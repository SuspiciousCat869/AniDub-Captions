00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,166
Cell left Trunks with
an unusual announcement.

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,791
The android plans to revive the
World Martial Arts Tournament.

4
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,541
With his body and
ego badly bruised,

5
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,541
the young Saiyan
returned to his friends

6
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,916
to bear the ominous message.

7
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Word of the
tournament was greeted

8
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,291
with shock and suspicion.

9
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,833
Who could trust a seemingly
unbeatable android that is bent

10
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,041
on destroying the world?

11
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,583
[ROSHI] Okay, but I am!

12
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,166
Only I can beat Cell.

13
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,291
[NARRATOR] There is
little time to prepare,

14
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,166
so the fighters
better make it count.

15
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,166
Because if Cell gets his way...

16
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,708
these days just
might be their last.

17
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,041
[NARRATOR] The competition
is set to begin in 10 days,

18
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,458
but Cell has yet to
reveal the location

19
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,291
of his terrifying tournament.

20
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,541
He's been busy carving
up the landscape,

21
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,000
building the
perfect battleground

22
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,916
to put his enemies to rest...

23
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,583
[NARRATOR] Cell is
ready to go public

24
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,166
with the location
of his tournament.

25
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,000
But the question is, will he
be playing by his own rules?

26
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,000
[CELL] Yes, that
will do just fine,

27
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,250
it should be large enough.

28
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,750
And now, to get the word out.

29
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,291

[DR. BRIEF] Hm? Now let's
see what we've got here.

32
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,375
Interesting... Hm... 
A most unusual design...

33
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,125
[DR. BRIEF] Hm... I wonder
what this device does?

34
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,583
[DR. BRIEF] I can't make
sense of these plans!

35
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,125
Oh... they're upside down.

36
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,458
No, no, that's not right... Hmm?

37
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,958
This is strange. Based on what
I can gather from these plans,

38
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,791
I'd say your device is
completely different

39
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,583
from the other Androids.

40

Yes I know. That means...
these plans are useless.

44
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,333
So... can you fix me?

45
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:59,916
I don't know if I can. But just
wait till Bulma gets back.

advantage since I won't be able

to rest between matches and
my new opponents can enter

the competition immediately.

309
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,750
The rules will be the same

as the World's Martial
Arts Tournament.

If you give up or your body
touches the outside

[CELL laughs]

323
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,250
[ANDROID 16 growls]

324
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,958
[CELL laughs]

325
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,416
[ROSHI gasps]

326
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,500
Curse him!

327
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,166
Now watch this.

328
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,166
Here's just a little taste
of what you'll be up against!

329
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,375
Come and get me if you dare!

330
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,875
[screaming, gasping, whimpering]

331
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,958
Now, let the games begin...

332
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,833
The tournament starts
in nine days! Good luck!

333
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,583
[CELL laughs]

334
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,583
He's really serious!

335
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,000
He'll destroy the planet
if we don't stop him!

336
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,500
That's right...

337
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,083
The stakes are a lot higher
than we originally thought!

338
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,625
We're in trouble guys!

339
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,583
Oh.... We're history!

340
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,875
What are we going to do?

341
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,916
Not one of us can beat Cell!

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,833
Not even Vegeta or Trunks could
beat him... We need Goku!

343
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,541
[KRILLIN growls]

344
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,541
[BULMA] What are
you doing, Vegeta?

345
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,000
Hear me out. I don't care
about the people of Earth,

346
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,625
but I promise
I will destroy Cell!

347
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,541
I'll go with you!

348
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:50,416
[BULMA] Wait! Let me cut
your hair before you go.

349
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,916
It might get in the way.

350
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,625
Uh, thank you!

351
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,083
[VEGETA groans]

352
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,708
[NARRATOR] Cell's evil
extravaganza is well underway.

353
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,666
The Cell Games will no
doubt captivate audiences

354
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,000
all over the world,

355
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,250
spreading fear and chaos
just as the android wants.

356
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,541
And with Cell's
impressive fighting record,

357
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,500
the odds seem heavily
stacked in his favor.

358
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,541
But as it is with
any good competition,

359
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,375
there's still plenty
of room for an upset.

360
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,375
[NARRATOR] Because up
in Kami's Lookout,

361
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,166
behind the doors of the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

362
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,125
Goku and Gohan
continue to train...

363
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,041
If this father-son duo can
harness the true potential

364
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,375
of the Super Saiyan,

365
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,333
there's no telling what
could happen when the

366
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,791
tournament day arrives!

367
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,166
[NARRATOR] All eyes
are on you Goku,

368
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,875
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
