00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,500
[GOHAN cheers]

2
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,416
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,458
it seemed like a time
for celebration.

4
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,916
Old friends
rejoiced together.

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,375
[KRILLIN] Are you okay?

6
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,250
[GOHAN] Piccolo...

7
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,750
[NARRATOR] And new
friends were reunited.

8
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,166
[NARRATOR] However, the
nightmare wasn't over yet.

9
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,750
And Frieza renewed his attack
on the battle-weary Goku!

10
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,041
[NARRATOR] But an
incredible sacrifice from

11
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,833
the lion-hearted Piccolo saved
Goku from certain destruction.

12
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,333
[NARRATOR] Few men have the
courage for such a noble act.

13
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01,250
Piccolo had truly transformed
into a being of greatness.

14
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,875
This time, you won't come back!

15
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,125
[NARRATOR] The next man
on Frieza's hit list:

16
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,541
Goku's best friend, Krillin!

17
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,458
[KRILLIN] Help me! Ahh--

18
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,708
[GOKU gasps]

19
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,041
[NARRATOR] It was
a tough day indeed

20
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,541
for the virtuous warriors
from planet Earth...

21
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,458
Beaten, battered,
but not defeated,

22
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,375
the loss of his friends
and their radical acts

23
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,583
of unselfishness caused a
transformation in Goku

24
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,333
that he had never
experienced before!

25
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,666
Goha, listen very carefully.

26
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,875
You must leave this planet now
and take Piccolo with you.

27
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,333
Got it?

28
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,125
Just do as I say, Gohan!

29
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,166
Leave me now!

30
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,541
Can't you see?!
I need to be alone!

31
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,125
Uh, right!

32
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,875
[NARRATOR] What does this
golden transformation mean?

33
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:09,500
Has the legendary Super
Saiyan emerged at last?

34
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,541
Find out, today!

35
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,625
What... What now?!

36
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,291
Saiyans transform into apes!

37
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,125
This is completely
different from anything

38
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,291
that I've ever seen before!

39
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,000
Darn!

40
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,458
What does this mean?!

41
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,333
Gohan!

42
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,666
It's time!

43
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,416
Piccolo is our only chance
of bringing the others

44
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,583
back to this dimension!

45
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,291
Take him to the ship and go!

46
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,625
But what about you?

47
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,916
Don't worry about me now!

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,875
I know that I'm
where I need to be!

49
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,708
But... if we take the ship,

50
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,291
that means you'll be stranded
out here with no way home!

51
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,375
I'm your father, now listen!

52
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,583
Gohan, just do as I say!

53
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,458
Whatever you want, Dad.

54
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,958
[GOHAN] C'mon, Piccolo.

55
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,208
[GOHAN] It's time for
us to get out of here.

56
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,791
I love you, Dad...

57
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,333
Goku, my Dad!

58
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,291
I understand.

59
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,916
What Vegeta said
came true after all!

60
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,791
The legend!

61
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,291
My father,
a Super Saiyan!

62

[FRIEZA laughs]

63
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,750
Amusingly
vivid imagination.

64
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:44,083
Only I decide who
leaves here today.

65
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,625
Hmph.

66
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,083
Huh?!

67
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,333
Wha--?!

68
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,791
[FRIEZA grunts]

[FRIEZA growls]

00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,416
You just don't
know when to stop.

72
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,958
Enough is enough!

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,375
[FRIEZA screams]

74
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,125
First, Vegeta,
then Piccolo,

75
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,333
and now, my best
friend, Krillin!

76

[FRIEZA growls]

77
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,875
You don't care!

78
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,791
I can see that!

79
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,500
Their lives mean
absolutely nothing to you!

80
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,750
You're not in the
least bit sorry!

81
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,666
Even now, all you can think
about is how to destroy me!

82
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,083
[FRIEZA screams]

[FRIEZA grunting]

84
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,875
How?! How did you get
this incredible power?!

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,291
Don't tell me...

86
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,416
I-It's true!

87
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,875
Isn't it?!

88
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,208
How wild!

89
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,250
It just happened!

90
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,625
He just changed!

91
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,875
It was like he was on fire!

92
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,208
That's my Dad..

93

He's so great!

[DR. BRIEF] Well,
what d'ya think?

98
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,666
Could this be it, Scratch?

[SCRATCH meows]

100
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,375
[DR. BRIEF] Hm! It
looks like you're right!

101
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,041
But we're running out of
options, my furry friend...

102

Hey!

103
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,083
What the heck's
going on up there?!

104
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,333
[DR. BRIEF] We're still trying
to isolate the problem, ChiChi!

105
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,416
How complicated
could it be?!

106
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,458
If I have to come
up there, I will!

107

with an owner's manual

108
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,625
or something?

109

[DR. BRIEF] Hey, cut us a
little slack down there!

110
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,250
Nobody can trouble-shoot

like we can!

"we", you're by yourself!

[CHICHI] Oh, so we're relying on
a cat to get us into deep space!

115
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,875
[DR. BRIEF] This
isn't an ordinary cat!

116

She's had four years experience!

117

Hey, what's up?

118
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,000
You look worried.
What's the deal?

119
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,458
[ROSHI] Mmm!

120
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,916
[CHICHI] I don't care if you
won the Nobel Peace Prize!

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,833
You're a kook!

122
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,500
And so is your cat!

123
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,458
Strange! This life!

124
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:09,166
It's always full of
unexpected twists and turns!

125
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,416
[YAJIROBE] So what's up?

126
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,833
It's Goku!

127
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,583
Something's happened
to Goku, I can feel it!

128
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,833
I've had a sixth sense about
Goku since he was a boy.

129
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,375
Is he dead?

130
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,458
Oh, no, that's not it!

131
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,708
He kept digging and he
finally hit the mother lode!

132
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,791
A power so great that normal
men can't even fathom it!

133
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:29,583
So what?

134
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,791
Isn't that good?

135
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,125
[ROSHI] Not necessarily.

136
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,916
Having the kind of power
that I'm talking about is

137
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,208
uncharted territory for Goku.

138
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,500
He's never experienced
anything like it.

139
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,208
That much
I can guarantee!

00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,375
Yes, sir!

141
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,500
A power of this
magnitude could overwhelm

142
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,041
a man and change
him forever!

Right now, Goku's
struggling to hold on

145

to who he is!

146

Yep, shoot!

all of them.

166
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,000
They paid for
their mistakes!

167
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,333
[FRIEZA giggles]

168
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,541
Is that why they died?

169
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,291
I thought it was
because I killed them.

170
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,708
You're just a beast!

171
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,125
With no conscience!

172
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,000
[FRIEZA laughs]

173
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,625
[FRIEZA] So I'm a beast, huh?

174
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,583
Oh, and what about you,
Mr. Super Saiyan?

175
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,958
Aren't you just like me?

176
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,166
Hmph.

177
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,875
So, the jury's still
out on that one.

178
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,875
Let's just give it
a little more time!

179
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,625
[FRIEZA yells]

180
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,083
[FRIEZA shouts]

181
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,791
Huh...?

182
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,375
Oh, man, Dad!

183
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,458
No... Don't look...

184
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,750
[FRIEZA gasps]

185
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,125
[FRIEZA grunts]

186
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,750
[FRIEZA yells]

187
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,625
[thinking] Don't
look back, Gohan!

188
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,208
Whatever you do,
don't look back!

189
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:06,791
Your evil deeds are like
a noose around your neck!

190
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,250
[FRIEZA chuckles]

191
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,958
[FRIEZA grunts]

192
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,750
[GOKU yells]

193
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,666
[FRIEZA screams]

194
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,458
[FRIEZA growls]

195
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:20,416
[blows landing,
grunting]

196
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:29,208
[grunting continues]

197
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,875
[grunting continues]

198
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,416
[FRIEZA growls]

199
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,541
[FRIEZA yells]

200
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,250
What?! But how?!

201
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,625
How could he dodge
it at this range?!

202
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,500
[FRIEZA yells]

203
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,541
[FRIEZA shouts]

204
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,416
[FRIEZA shouts]

205
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,166
It can't be...

206
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,250
Hey! Why can't I hit you?!

207
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,958
Just tell me!

208
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,916
You didn't say "please."

209
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,541
"Please"...?

210
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,541
What?! "Please"?!

211
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,458
[FRIEZA growls]

212
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,375
You-- Alright then...

213
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,458
Please!

214
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,750
Huh?!

215
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,791
[FRIEZA gasps]

216
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,458
You can destroy planets,

217
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,291
but you can never destroy
what I am, "friend".

218
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,375
Y-You!

219
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,875
What... What are you?!

220
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,125
I am the hope
of the Universe.

221
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:58,791
I am the answer to all living
things that cry out for peace.

222
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,875
I am protector
of the innocent.

223
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,708
I am the light in the darkness.

224
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,750
I am truth!

225
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,958
Ally to good!

226
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,458
Nightmare to you!

227
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,500
[NARRATOR] How will Frieza
be able to stand up to Goku

228
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,333
now that the legendary
power of the Super Saiyan

229
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,208
has awakened within him?

230
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:52,041
