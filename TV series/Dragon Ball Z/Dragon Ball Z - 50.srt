1
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,666
Here, now you have what you
came for. Take it and leave!

3
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,500
[NARRATOR] Having successfully
acquired the fifth Dragon Ball,

4
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:25,833
Frieza ordered Dodoria to
eliminate the remaining Nameks.

5
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,666
[NARRATOR] It was a task
the ruthless henchman

6
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,208
was only too happy
to carry out.

7
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,708
[DODORIA]
Play dead!

8
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,000
[GOHAN]
Aaahh! Stop it!

9
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,666
[NARRATOR] Not willing
to sit idly by,

10
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,041
Gohan and Krillin
charged to the rescue...

11
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,750
but our heroes soon
found themselves

12
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,750
in a race
for their lives!

13
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,416
Fortunately for them,
the chase was cut short,

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,041
as Dodoria had some deep
troubles of his own!

15
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,708
Having watched and waited for
the perfect moment to strike,

16
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,500
Vegeta made his move!

17
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,791
And the Saiyan prince
gave Dodoria a lesson

18
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,666
in ruthlessness he
would not forget.

19
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,666
[VEGETA laughs]

20
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,666
[VEGETA] It's the true
might of a Saiyan warrior!

21
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,791
[DODORIA screams]

22
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,458
[DODORIA]
Lord Frieza!

23
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,500
[VEGETA yells]

24
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,708
[DODORIA screaming]

25
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,208
[NARRATOR] In yet another
stunning display of strength,

26
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,750
Vegeta's power has soared
to even greater heights!

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,958
It seems none
can oppose him.

28
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,541
Meanwhile, even Goku,
with all of his might,

29
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,875
stands little chance
against this villain.

30
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,750
But in less
than six days,

31
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,041
he will have no
choice but to face him.

32
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:35,625
Untold dangers await...
Today on Dragon Ball Z!

33
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,333
[VEGETA chuckles]

34
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,166
So long, Dodoria.

35
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,666
After all
his boasting,

36
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,708
in the end he was nothing
more than a sniveling coward.

37
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,208
[chuckles]

38
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:07,250
But still, I didn't think I
would defeat him so easily.

39
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,458
My powers have grown to exceed
even my own expectations.

40
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,875
Too bad Kakarot
and his friends

41
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,041
can't be here to see
them. Or can they?

42
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,541
I get it...

43
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,125
Those two little brats I chased
out here were Earthlings!

44
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,166
[VEGETA] Hmm, I do sense
a faint power level.

45
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,875
No, two of them.
Flying away.

46
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,083
But it couldn't be anyone
from Earth, could it?

47
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,416
I'd better go
and check it out.

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Because if I'm wrong,
and they are here,

49
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:38,041
I'd hate to miss a chance
to settle the score!

50
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,291
Hey, Krillin!
I recognize this place!

51
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,041
I think we're getting
close to the cave!

52
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,625
Good. 'Cause I was
starting to think

53
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,041
we were getting
lost out here.

54
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,875
Great! Someone's comin'!
We gotta hide, guys. Fast!

55
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,416
Down there
and hurry!

56
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,000
Got it!

57
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,166
I don't know.

58
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,958
It doesn't seem like we've
got a lot of cover here.

59
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,041
Well, it's better than
being up in the air.

60
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,541
Just keep your power low,
and hope we're lucky!

61
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,500
You're worried it's that
monster again, aren'tcha?

62
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,291
Me too.
But I don't think

63
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,291
he'll be able to find
us here, you guys.

64
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,333
Hmm... It's like both of
those powers just disappeared.

65
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:40,208
But they were just here,
I'm sure of it!

66
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,333
[GOHAN screams]

67
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,416
Oh no, Krillin.
Look! Up there!

68
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:06,458
[KRILLIN whimpering]

69
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,791
[thinking] Oh, great!
This is just what we need!

70
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:13,041
It's Vegeta! I don't know
how, but he's found us!

71
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,041
[VEGETA] Hmm...?

72
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,000
[ALL whimpering]

73
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,041
[thinking] But I don't get it!
Why would he be looking for us?

74
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,291
And how could he even know
that we're on this planet?!

75
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,958
[whimpering continues]

76
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,375
[GOHAN] It looks
like he's leaving.

77
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,333
Yeah, good. And he wasn't
wearing his scouter.

78
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,791
He must be searching
for something else.

79
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,916
I'm guessing he doesn't
know that we're here, Gohan.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,458
Unless Vegeta's learned
how to sense power levels!

81
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,041
If he has,
we're screwed!

82
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,541
Even if we push our
power down to zero,

83
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,250
he could still
sense him!

84
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,500
[VEGETA] Bah. There's no one
here. Maybe there never was.

85
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,125
Perhaps it was a mistake
to destroy the scouter

86
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,250
before I'd fully
tested my ability!

87
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,750
Hm... But then
again, maybe not.

88
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,833
It's very faint.

89
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,083
But there's
definitely something

90
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,375
coming from
down there!

91
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,000
[GOHAN]
He's coming this way!

92
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,416
[GOHAN screams]

93
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,125
[ALL whimpering]

94
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,416
It's behind
that rock.

95
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,583
Gohan. It's no
good. He's got us.

96
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,208
We can at least lead
him away from the kid.

97
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,208
Let's go!

98
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,833
Huh?!

99
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,875
Now, Gohan!

100
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:04,916
[VEGETA] Ah!

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,041
[KRILLIN &amp; GOHAN scream]

102
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:15,416
[WHALE moaning]

103
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,416
Damn!
Just a fish.

104
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,958
Oh, forget it. I've wasted
enough time chasing shadows.

105
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,166
There are still two more
Dragon Balls out there,

106
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,583
waiting to be found.

107
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,291
If I can just get to one
before Frieza and hide it,

108
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:52,125
it'll be enough to stop him
from completing his collection.

109
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,125
Then, it's simply a
matter of biding my time,

110
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,875
waiting for the perfect
opportunity to strike.

111
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,625
It shouldn't take long.
Without their scouters,

112
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,416
I could be breathing
right down their necks

113
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,541
and they wouldn't
even know it!

114
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,958
[VEGETA laughing]

115
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,208
[GOHAN sighs]

116
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,000
Too close!

117
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,625
Oh, man. I just knew
we were goners.

118
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,166
I mean if that whale hadn't
shown up when it did...

119
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, I don't even
wanna think about it.

120
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,333
Anyway, I don't
know about you,

121
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,125
but I for one don't
plan to wait around

122
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,000
to see if he comes back.
Let's keep moving.

123
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,416
[GOHAN] Right.

124
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
[KRILLIN] That cave is
sounding cozier by the minute.

125
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,500
I am beat!

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,375
[GOHAN giggles]

127
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,666
[GOHAN laughs]

128
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,666
[KRILLIN]
Hey, Gohan.

129
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,875
Y'know, I'm sorry
I got you into this.

130
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,666
Maybe it wasn't such a
good idea to come here.

131
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,000
I mean, I wanna wish all
our friends back to life,

132
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
but If we try to
compete with Vegeta,

133
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,083
we're just gonna
get ourselves killed.

134
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,458
So, you think we
should give up?

135
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,708
[GOHAN] Hey! Look! There's
the cave! We're safe!

136
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,250
[KRILLIN] Yeah.
Good eye, buddy.

137
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,666
[GOHAN] Bulma!

138
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,250
Bulma?

139
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,583
[GOHAN] I don't
see her anywhere.

140
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,541
Maybe she's way in
the back or something.

141
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,958
I'll go
check it out.

142
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,416
Bulma!
Hey!

143
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,333
Bulma! Come out, come out
wherever you are! Hello!

144
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,375
[GOHAN] A Capsule house?

145
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,791
Well, it's about time
you two came back!

146
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,041
What took you
so long, anyway?

147
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,916
I thought I was
gonna die of boredom!

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,125
[GOHAN and KRILLIN
chuckling sheepishly]

149
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,291
Must've been rough...

150
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,000
Hmm?

151
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,833
Hey, what's the deal
with the miniature Piccolo?

152
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,166
He's Namekian, right?

153
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,250
You sure it's a good
idea to bring him here?

154
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,500
Sure. We saved him.

155
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,208
What happened
out there?

156
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,500
How 'bout we
go inside first?

157
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,291
Then we'll tell
you the whole story.

I have a lot to
tell you, too!

160
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,000
I just talked to my
dad a while ago--

161
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,291
Oh, and guess what! He said
Goku is on his way here!

162
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,666
To Namek!

163
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,500
And brace yourselves...
He'll be here in six days!

164
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,791
That's right! He's using a
replica of the Saiyan ship

165
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,708
he came to Earth
in as a baby!

166
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,041
My dad worked all day and
night to fix it up for him!

167
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,333
And he's still
training, too!

168
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,500
So he'll be ready to
take on the bad guys!

[DR. BRIEF] Hello!
Goku! Can you hear me?

194
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,958
Oh, It's you guys.

195
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,333
Did something happen
back on Earth?

196
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,541
No, everything's just
fine here. It's your ship!

197
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,791
Looks like you've sustained
a bit of damage to the hull.

[GOKU gasps]

199
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,166
[OOLONG] Hey there!

200
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,166
Probably just collided
with a small asteroid.

201
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,750
[GOKU] So, that's
a bad thing, right?

202
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,125
Well, it's
hard to say...

203
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,583
But if we don't get that
hull patched up, it will be!

204
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,083
[GOKU] So now what
are we supposed to do?!

205
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,958
You'll just have to
go outside and fix it.

Who, me?!

[DR. BRIEF] Sure!
Don't worry.

208
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,125
I had a custom fit space
suit prepared for you

209
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,583
in case of
emergency.

210
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,791
And there's
a repair box

Remember you're tethered

00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,291
to the ship.
Just pull yourself in.

that's what this thing's for.

Phew!

I gotta be
more careful...

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,875
[DR. BRIEF] Don't be
afraid to walk, Goku.

227
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,750
I installed magnets on
the feet of your spacesuit.

228
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,208
You did?

229

Wow! How 'bout that!

This'll sure
make things easier.

Hey, there it is.

232
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,250
[GOKU] Okay.

233
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:26,583
Let's see... Just a
little bit of space glue

234
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,291
and she'll be
good as new.

00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,500
[DR. BRIEFS] Hm...
Looks like the impact

236
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,458
knocked the ship
a bit off course.

237

the new trajectory here...

[DR. BRIEF] Goku! You've got
to get back inside the ship!

243
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,916
Something terrible
has happened!

244
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,375
The collision
with the asteroid

245
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,541
knocked your ship out of the
flight path I programmed,

246
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,416
and it's sent you
on a new trajectory

247
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,333
directly for
Alpha HZ.

248
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,666
It's a star
bigger than our sun.

249

You'll be incinerated
if you don't

get inside and
re-plot your course!

You have to hurry!

to reprogram the ship!

you through every step.

[NAMEK 1] It's an invader!

319
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,375
[NAMEK 2] What does he want?!

320
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,875
Which one of you
is the Elder?

321
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:31,166
I'm here for the Dragon Ball.
If you have it, get it.

322
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,625
How rude!

323
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,208
I am the Elder...

324
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,875
Now I must ask,

325
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,458
what use do you have
for the Dragon Ball?

326
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,375
That's my business,
old man. Where is it?

327
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,208
I'm sorry, but I cannot give
you what you are seeking.

328
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,708
Only those who are worthy
may claim the Dragon Ball.

329
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,041
Wrong answer...

330
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,500
[ALL gasp]

331
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,708
Bang.

332
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,375
[NAMEK 3] Elder!

333
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:19,500
[NAMEKS gasping]

334
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,166
[VEGETA chuckles]

335
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,000
[NARRATOR] After the day's
harrowing adventures,

336
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:37,083
Goku has resumed his
intensive training regimen.

337
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,333
But he still has
a long way to go...

338
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,875
He'll have to train at more
than twenty-times gravity

339
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,291
before he's ready
to face Vegeta!

340
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,833
Tune in next time,
as our heroes quest

341
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,250
for the Namekian Dragon
Balls continues...

342
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:55,333
On the next action-packed
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
