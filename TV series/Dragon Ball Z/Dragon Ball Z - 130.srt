could be sufficient!

he be so confident?

[thinking] Yes!
He is shrewd!

He seems completely
at ease, but is he?

I have to agree with you,

but he's a genius when
it comes to fighting!

216
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,708
Vegeta was weakened
by the other Android.

217
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,833
He was vulnerable so
he bluffed and acted

218
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,750
like he was eager to
fight the next one!

219

That other android could
have defeated Vegeta

if he would have called
the bluff and attacked,

221
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,000
but Vegeta was too convincing.

222
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,500
Mentally, he's
impossible to beat.

223
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,125
He thinks of every
conceivable advantage.

And physically, he's
reached a new plateau!

I've never seen a power
quite like his before!

It's radical! Just amazing!

stronger than my Dad now?

There's a good chance,
yes. I think so.

I say we go find them!

233
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,875
Vegeta may be stronger than us,

234
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,791
but that doesn't
make him my boss!

235
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,958
Yeah! Mine either!

236
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,166

We can't just
take off right now!

But no jumping in unless I say!

I need to get you guys
back to Goku in one piece!

242
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,583
Vegeta's probably
looking for him

243
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,250
in the mountains
as we speak.

244
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,958
But he's going
to be hard to find

245
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,416
since we can't sense
his energy level.

246

and find that tin-can!

away and fight!
