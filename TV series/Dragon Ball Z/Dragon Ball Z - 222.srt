[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,541
the Z warriors discovered
the hiding place

4
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,541
of the wizard
Babidi's spaceship.

5
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:23,000
Dabura, King of the Demon World
welcomed them by blasting

6
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,416
the Supreme Kai's sidekick
Kibito to smithereens.

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,375
But he didn't stop there.

8
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,250
He had more than a mouthful
for anyone that got in his way.

[PICCOLO grunts]

13
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,291
[NARRATOR] Dabura turned
Piccolo and Krillin to stone,

14
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,208
but there was no time
for the good guys to

15
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,916
ponder the fate of their
concrete comrades.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They decided to
launch a full-on assault

17
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,416
against the wicked wizard

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,875
and headed into the
heart of Babidi's ship.

19
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,333
With three of the Earth's
most powerful fighters

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,625
falling right into his hands,
Babidi is now confident

21
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:10,791
he can resurrect the monster
Majin Buu ahead of schedule.

22
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,458
[BABIDI] I'd be shocked if
any one of them had a brain.

23
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,291
[BABIDI laughs]

24

[DABURA chuckles]
Yes, trapped so easily...

25
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,375
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu
lies dormant in his shell

26
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,458
waiting to be released
so that he can wreak havoc

27
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,041
on planet Earth.

28
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,041
All he needs is enough power to
break the spell that binds him.

29
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,708
Babidi knows that if he can
drain Goku, Gohan and Vegeta

30
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,500
of their power it will be more
than enough to free Majin Buu.

31
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,125
So he's used his magic to
manipulate a fierce force

32
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,166
of warriors into
fighting for him.

33
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,958
And now, Vegeta must
face the first fighter,

34
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,958
the powerful Pui Pui.

35
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,375
[PUI PUI chuckles]
Welcome, fellow warriors.

36
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,583
You've arrived at Stage One.

37
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,666
[PUI PUI] Master Babidi is at
the bottom level of this ship.

38
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,041
We are currently on the top
level, also known as Stage One.

39
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,041
And there's no way of
getting down to him

40
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,416
unless you beat the warrior
that appears at each stage.

41
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,666
[NARRATOR] Babidi has
cleverly designed his ship

42
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,791
to absorb the
power of the fighters.

43
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,333
There are three stages that
the Z Warriors must pass

44
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,250
if they want to get
to the wizard.

45
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,041
But at each level a new and more
powerful foe waits for them.

46
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,458
Can the good guys get Babidi
before he gets them first?

47
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,791

is very different from yours.

117
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:38,083
It's the gravity! Ten times
stronger than Earth!

325
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,500
[bones cracking]

326
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,541
[YACON growls]

327
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,875
[BABIDI]
Yacon!

328
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,083
[BABIDI] Sorry to keep
you waiting, my friend.

329
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,333
I have some
fresh victims for you!

330
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,541
Have as many as you like!

331
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,333
Yes... Babidi!

332
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,250
Hey! C'mon! Get out here!

333
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,333
[VEGETA] Why don't we just
smash through the floor

334
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,291
and get to the
bottom of this place?!

335
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,750
[We can't do that! Even though
he's not at full power,

336
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,333
an unnecessary shock
could free Majin Buu

337
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,958
and that would be disasterous!

338
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,416
Augh. I'm beginning to think
that this Majin Buu

339
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,958
may not be worth
fighting after all.

340
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,625
And the same goes
for that Dabura.

341
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,208
What...? No, you
can't be serious.

342
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,708
Then you won't fight them?

343
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,833
Well, why should I? From what
I've seen of Dabura so far

344
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't see any reason
to be so afraid of him.

345
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,041
I watched his
movements outside

346
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,708
and the only thing I have
to worry about is his spit.

347
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,541
If I avoid that,
I know I can beat him.

348
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,583
Your friend Kibito
was careless, that's all.

349
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,958
[SUPREME KAI]
Ah...

350
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,708
So, do you agree with him, Goku?

351
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:59,750
Yeah. Vegeta's right!
Dabura's not that tough...

352
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,041
If it was a few years ago,
we might be afraid of him.

353
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,333
About seven years ago, we
fought this guy named Cell.

354
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:10,125
Now that was tough! Oh-ho!

355
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,083
[SUPREME KAI thinking]
I can't believe this...

356
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,375
Can these Super Saiyans
really be that strong?

357
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,625
[SUPREME KAI thinking]
I suppose it is possible.

358
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,333
It was extremely difficult to
restrain Gohan's movements

359
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,166
after he became a
Super Saiyan...

360
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,750
And that may not even
have been his full power!

361
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,958
Hey! Get out here now!

362
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,333
Let's go! I'm ready to fight!

363
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,625
Huh...?

364
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,250
[YACON growls]

365
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,708
[GOKU]
Uh...

366
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,875
[YACON growls]

367
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,583
[GOKU, GOHAN gasp]

368
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,708
What is that thing?!

369
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:17,583
[YACON snarls]

370
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,000
That's it... Be a good boy,
Yacon, and finish him off

371
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,041
for me! [laughs]

372
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,541
[YACON roars]

373
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,458
What...? Oh no!

374
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:36,208
[YACON growls]

375
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,000
[NARRATOR It looks like Babidi's
pet monster Yacon

376
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,708
is about to have a
Super Saiyan for lunch.

377
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,958
Goku had better be on his toes.

378
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,541
One slip, and all his
power could be drained and

379
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,791
sent straight to Majin Buu.

380
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,708
Could this be Goku's
most difficult fight yet?

381
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,041

Dragon Ball Z!
