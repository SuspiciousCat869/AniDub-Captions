1
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,291
Frieza decided to test
Goku's agility and speed

3
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,333
by bombarding him
with boulders.

4
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,416
Now! It's my turn!

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
[NARRATOR] Goku proved to be
up to the challenge though,

6
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,750
and he easily
vaporized the remainder

7
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,625
of Frieza's projectiles.

8
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,583
[NARRATOR] But after
a sneak attack,

9
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,833
Goku found himself trapped
in a ball of energy.

10
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,333
[NARRATOR] Then Frieza launched
him like a Saiyan Warhead,

11
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,625
set to explode
on impact.

12
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,166
[NARRATOR] Just when
it was looking like

13
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,000
Goku wouldn't
make it out alive,

14
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,958
the Saiyan emerged
from behind the smoke.

15
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,458
[NARRATOR] Not only
had Goku survived,

16
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,916
but he appeared unharmed.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,500
They're monsters...
One good, one evil...

18
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,666
[NARRATOR] It was then
that Frieza proposed they

19
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,666
stop pulling their punches
and use their true power.

20
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,916
No more sandbagging,
what do you say?

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,833
Sounds good, sure.

22
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:27,416
[NARRATOR] The fight
rages on... today!

23
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:06,458
[KRILLIN] So... this is it. The
calm before the storm, huh?

24
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,458
[PICCOLO]
Yeah, you got that right.

25
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:17,583
[KRILLIN gasps]

26
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,041
[GOHAN screams]

27
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,875
[GOHAN]
Wow! Check out that splash.

28
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,375
[KRILLIN] Yeah. That
was a pretty big chunk.

29
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,166
Look... Just look at 'em...

30
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,916
It's hard to believe,
but the outcome of this fight

31
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
will influence the future
of the entire universe.

32
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,375
[KRILLIN] And we're the only
ones who get to watch it...

33
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,666
[PICCOLO] Hopefully we'll get
a chance to do more than that.

34
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,625
[GOKU] What d'ya say
we get down to it?

35
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,750
I've got better things to do
than stare at you all day.

36
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,875
[FRIEZA] You are
a case, aren't you?

37
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,166
Killing you is going
to be sheer delight.

38
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,375
[GOKU] Alrighty, then.
It's now or never.

39
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:29,083
Sure, what do you prefer?!
Ground? Or up in the air?

40
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,875
Ground's good. Yeah,
sure, why not? Ground.

41
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm a "ground"
kind of guy.

42
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,125
If that's alright
with you of course.

43
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,458
[FRIEZA giggles]

44
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,791
[FRIEZA]
I like your attitude.
Let's see...

45
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,708
[GOHAN]
There they go!

46
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,291
[KRILLIN]
What? They're landing already.

47
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,041
[PICCOLO]
They're choosing a battle site.

48
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,291
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN]
Huh?!

49
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,375
Frieza must fight better
when he's in the air.

50
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,166
Goku's call. This is it...

51
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,833
Go, Dad...

52
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,166
[GOKU]
So this must be the place.

53
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,416
[FRIEZA] Yes, this will make
a fine site for your grave.

54
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,833
It's perfect! Now, would you
prefer cremation or burial?

55
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,416
Daisies or chrysanthemums?

56
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Whatever! You pick. I trust ya.

57
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,541
[FRIEZA giggles]

58
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,250
For that, I'm going to give
you a little break. Ah, I know!

59
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,375
I'll fight without
using my hands!

60
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,625
Well, how does that grab you?

61
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,791
That's your call...

62
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:53,791
Fine then. This way I won't
break my nails. Alright?

63
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,750
It's up to you. But I
don't recommend it.

64
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,458
[FRIEZA] You're too
cocky if you think

65
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,916
I need to use my
hands to beat you.

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,708
I don't want you
to die believing

67
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,666
that you ever really
had a chance to win.

68
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,875
Okay, I'm not going to
argue with ya, shoot.

69
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,625
Very well, then.
No hands, it is.

70
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,416
[FRIEZA]
Hmm...

71
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,125
[GOKU] Haaaah!

72
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,291
[DR. BRIEF]
Whoooaa!

73
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,208
[DR. BRIEF coughs]

74
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,250
[DR. BRIEF] Ohhh...

75
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,958
[coughing continues]

76
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,666
Well, she's good as new. Great!

77
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,250
[DR. BRIEF]
There we go!

78
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,625
[DR. BRIEF]
Perfect! Now let's crank her up.

79
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,625
[DR. BRIEF]
Yes!

80
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,083
[CHICHI growls]

81
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,125
[CHICHI] I can't believe
my Dad broke the ship

82
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,333
just so I couldn't leave.
It better be fixed by now!

83
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,791
[CHICHI screams]

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,750
[DR. BRIEF] The repairs are
coming along slowly this time.

85
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,458
[ROSHI]
Good. Let's keep it that way.

86
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,333
So, that's the plan, huh?!

87
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,916
[DR. BRIEF]
Hm?

88
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,083
Schemer! How dare you
make light of this situation

89
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,500
when my son's life is at stake!
Your daughter's up there too!

90
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,541
Doesn't that mean anything to
you?! Don't you have a heart?!

91
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,416
ChiChi! That's enough
now! Come on!

[ROSHI grunts]

94
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,750
Picking on a helpless girl!
You should be ashamed! Hmph!

95
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,625
Look, I can't win here.

96
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,625
If I fix it fast, your dad
and the others jump on me.

97
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,541
If I fix it slow,
well, let's just say

98
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,208
it's best not to fix it slow.

99
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:35,500
You got it! So get the
lead out and fix it!

100
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,958
My dear lady, it takes time
to re-energize a reactor.

101
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,625
[CHICHI] Hmm?!

102
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,708
In layman's terms,
these yellow lights

103
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,458
have to be all the
way up to that "F",

104
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:50,166
but, as you can plainly see,
they're not even close.

105
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,458
So what?!

106
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,708
Huh?!

107
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,458
Who cares?! Just fix it!

108
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm a scientist, not
a magician. Use your head.

109
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,625
[CHICHI]
What did you say?! How dare you!

110
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,916
[OOLONG] Why do I have to go to
Namek?! I'm just a regular pig!

111
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,625
One karate chop and my
hand aches for days. Man.

112

My stategy is kick 'em
in the shin and run,

113
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,125
but that won't work.
We should forget about

114
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,125
going to Lizard-Ville and head
to the Bahamas. Huh?!

[PUAR] We were so happy
together. Just the three of us.

117
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,875
I'm not going to take in
anymore of this sitting down.

Calm down there,
tough guy. Kook...

121

Now, you just need to train at
a hundred times normal gravity,

[GOKU] Man... When's the...
last time you had a... bath?

167
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,125
Yeah, no foolin'! Whew! It's
downright unpleasant back here!

168
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,041
[FRIEZA] First you grab my tail,
and then you insult me.

169
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,375
You're going to pay
dearly for this.

Okay! You asked for it!

I'm having a deja' vu!

Rrrgh! You are so dead!

BULMA Did I mention to you
that I'm a genius? Yep!

184
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,291
I'm not just
another pretty face.

Y'know, I'm almost as smart
as I am beautiful. It's scary.

Hey there, bud. You're so quiet.
I hope you're not bored.

187
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,458
Now, where was I? Oh yeah,
now I remember. It's true.

188
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,208
I'm a genius.

turn into such shambles?

201
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,916
I should have never
taken this trip...

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,958

[GINYU laughs, yells]

210
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,875
[BULMA] I always told
my Dad he was silly

211
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,041
for stashing emegency food
on the air-bikes,

understands what I'm saying.

Hey, can you shake your
head if you understand

what I'm saying? Two shakes.

could be the next Jane Goodall

be able to understand

thought I'd find a body

Oh, my. I'm so sorry.

Yeah, I'll bet. Well,
please don't go losing

any sleep over it.

Shoot, I'm sure that it
was an honest mistake.

You're welcome to try
it again if you want to.
