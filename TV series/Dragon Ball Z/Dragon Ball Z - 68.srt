00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:15,333
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragonball Z,

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,916
Ginyu Force members
Burtur and Jeice

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,916
launched a tag-team
assault on Goku!

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,541
Together, they fired they fired
the Purple Spiral Flash attack.

5
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,541
But, to their surprise,
it was a move easily defended

6
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,791
by our newly arrived hero!

7
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,416
Ah! What's happening?!

8
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
[growling]

9
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,750
[NARRATOR] As the smoke cleared,
Vegeta, Gohan, and Krillin

10
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,875
watched in awe as Jeice prepared
to fire a second attack!

11
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,250
Crusher...

12
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:55,458
Ball!

13
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,625
[NARRATOR] But this too was
deflected with little effort.

14
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:03,250
Goku looks unstoppable, which is
bad news for Burtur and Jeice!

15
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,708
Do two of the strongest warriors
of Frieza's fighting force

16
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,791
even stand a chance against
the Saiyan's new power?

17
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,166
Find out... today!

18
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,041
Darn it!
Where did he go?!

19
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,083
[BURTUR grunting angrily]

20
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,666
Burtur! Behind!

21
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,333
[BURTUR screams

22
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,666
Hey.

23
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,166
How... how the heck
did you do that?!

24
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,708
I mean...

25
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,625
How did you get behind me?!

26
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,791
No one's that fast!

27
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,875
[GOKU] Well, apparently I am.

28
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,000
[BURTUR growling]

29
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,958
[thinking] Man, I've
never seen anyone

30
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,875
get to Burtur like this before!

31
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,375
And he deflected my Fire Crusher
Ball like it was a beach ball!

32
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,250
This isn't good!
I don't like it one bit!

33
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,250
[BURTUR growls]

34
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,291
Who are you?!

35
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,416
My name is Goku
and I'm a Saiyan...

36
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,333
from Earth.

37
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,166
[BURTUR growling]

38
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,500
Liar!

39
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,416
I've defeated hundreds of
Saiyans and none of them

40
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,708
were faster than me!

41
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,416
[GOKU]
It must be my diet.

42
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,583
I eat really wholesome foods.

43
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,291
Your diet?
Your diet, huh?!

44
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,083
Well, you're about to make
my fist part of your diet!

45
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,625
Oh, I see. Playing
it cool, are you?

46
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,750
Well, you'll die even faster!

[BURTUR yellling,
GOKU grunting]

48
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,000
Why don't you stay still
and fight me like a man?!

[BURTUR and GOKU grunting]

50
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,541
Can... you see?

51
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,000
No way!

00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,750
Hyaah!

54
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,500
That does it!
I've had enough!

55
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,208
No one makes a fool
of the Ginyu Force!

[BURTUR] He can't dodge
us forever, Jeice!

00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,708
He's gotta screw
up sometime!

He's doing this to us, mate!
Don't you get it?!

He is...?

This is totally insane!

Too bad! I was hoping
you might have changed!

They don't deserve
any favors!

They're scum, Kakarot!
Believe me!

Would they have taken mercy
on your son and your friend?!

stronger than you to beat you!

141

He could take your kid
hostage and make you walk

hands like a lamb!

savages, Kakarot!

it takes to win the game!

And here you are,
Mr. Nice Guy!

spit you out with that attitude!

a little compassion
is a disadvantage.

You poor fool.

is a fight to the end!

And it will be your end!

to beat who here?

those guys earlier!

He was in a league
of his own!

And this guy's
supposed to beat him?!

Not likely!

163
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,875
Kakarot's strong, but
he's not strong enough!

164
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,666
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN groan]

165
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,833
[VEGETA] And besides!

166
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,541
Frieza's been after
the Dragon Balls!

167
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,333
And if I know him, he's probably
already made his wish by now!

168
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,541
Which means you won't be dealing
with an all-powerful maniac!

169
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,875
You'll be dealing
with an immortal!

170
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,208
[KRILLIN] Hm!

171
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,208
[GOHAN] Huh?

172
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,583
No, I don't think
that Frieza guy

173
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,666
has used the
Dragon Balls yet.

174
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,750
[VEGETA] Huh?
Why not?! Explain!

175
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,458
Well, on Earth, when
you summon call the Dragon,

176
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,083
all kinds of crazy
stuff starts happening!

177
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,333
For one thing, the
entire sky turns pitch black!

178
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,583
[KRILLIN] Plus, there's
always a lot of lightning.

179
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,833
Radical lightning!
And high winds!

180
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,875
Nope, the sky's
been real calm.

181
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,083
[VEGETA] What! Then Frieza
hasn't summoned the Dragon yet!

182
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,416
But why not?!

183
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,625
He's bound to have had
them all for a while now!

184
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,250
Hey, I think I know why!

185
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,458
I'll bet Frieza doesn't
know the password, huh?

186
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,500
These balls aren't
like the ones on Earth.

187
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,500
Here you need to
know a password!

188
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,166
A password?!

189
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,416
Then there's still hope!

190
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,166
[GOKU] Hey, that means there's
still a chance to wish Piccolo

191
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,125
and the others back
to this dimension!

192
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,500
Alright!

193
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,458
[GOKU]
Whatd'ya say, Gohan?!

194
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,041
[GOHAN chuckles]

195
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,583
[GOKU] You guys
should be proud!

196
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,375
This means all of your hard
work might still pay off!

197
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,500
[GOHAN]
Woo-hooo!

198
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,041
[KRILLIN]
Everything's gonna be okay!

199
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,958
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laughing]

200
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:27,000
[GOKU laughs]
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laughing]

201
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,708
[KRILLIN]
Right, Goku?

202
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,916
[GOKU] Yup!

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,125
Thanks to you guys,
we still have a chance!

204
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,833
[VEGETA thinking]
A very slim chance!

205
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,583
[GINYU] Do they think
they can just take

206
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,833
the rest of the day off?!

207
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,375
[JEICE] Uh, Captain,
I really need to talk

208
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,625
to you about something. It's--

209
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,625
[GINYU] What lovely balls.

210
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,541
[JEICE] I understand. Burtur,
Recoom are--

211
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,333
[GINYU] I thought you
knew better than to

212
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:52,500
interrupt me when I'm
talking, Jeice, hmmm?

213
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,041
[GINYU laughs]

214
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,958
When Frieza figures out
how to use these things,

215
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,958
and you know he will,
we'll be completely unstoppable!

216
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:07,041
Imagine working for the most
powerful man in the universe!

217
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,500
How's that for a 401k?!

218
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,500
[GINYU] Okay,
this is ridiculous!

219
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,208
Where are Burtur
and Recoome?!

220
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,041
[JEICE] Well... they
won't be coming back, sir...

221
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,833
[GINYU] Jeice, are you
saying that two members

222
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,458
of the most illustrious
fighting squad in the universe

223
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,583
have been defeated
by just one man?!

224
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,833
[JEICE] Yes, Sir!
That's exactly what I'm saying!

225
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,500
[GINYU]
And where were you?!

226
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,833
Well, I was right there
with them, and then I took off!

227
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,041
[GINYU] You idiot!
I know what's up!

228
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,625
You ran away, didn't you?!

229
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,208
How dare you show your
orange, little face back here!

230
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,541
You're such a disgrace!

231
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,125
Have you learned anything
after all this time?!

232
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,791
But this guy was
unbelievably strong!

233
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,166
I'm sorry, Captain.

234
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,583
[GINYU growls]

235
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:10,125
[thinking] Guldo, Recoome,
and Burtur... All gone!

236
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,541
Men, good news!

237
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,708
Your chances of making the
squad have just increased!

238
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,166
There are now four
openings on the team!

239
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,041
[RECRUITS cheer]

240
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,083
[JEICE]
But, Captain Ginyu!

241
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,375
I'm still here!
We only need three!

242
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,666
[GINYU]
Silence!

243
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,125
You no longer have a
place on the Ginyu Force!

244
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,416
[JEICE] Hmm?!

245
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,750
[GINYU]
That is, unless...

246
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:32,791
[GINYU laughs]

247
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,541
Unless you can strike a
pose that shows these guys

248
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,833
what being a Ginyu is about!

249
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,875
I'll try my best, sir!

250
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,500
[GINYU] Alright, men!
Look sharp!

251
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,166
This is your first mission!

252
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,666
I want you to dig a hole and
bury those Dragon Balls!

253
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,125
[RECRUITS] Yes, Sir!

254
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:58,291
[RECRUITS grunting]

255
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,750
Dig with style, mates!

256
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,375
You're not convicts!
You're the Ginyus!

257
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:09,208
[RECRUITS grunting
and murmuring]

258
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,083
[JEICE] The one on
the left has pinache.

259
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,625
And he's a heck of a lot
better looking than Burtur.

260
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,750
[RECRUITS grunting]

261
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,541
[JEICE chuckles]

262
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,208
[JEICE] Not too shabby, Captain!
This lot knows how to dig!

263
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,625
Yes. Yes, they do.

264
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,666
Now, men, I'll be
leaving you for a while

265
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,708
to take care of some business.

266
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,791
Line up!

267
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,041
[RECRUITS panting]

268
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,916
[GINYU] I want you to sit
this one out and watch

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,208
but pay close attention!

270
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,333
[GINYU]
We are...

271
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,666
the Ginyu...

272
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,375
--Wooah!
--Force!

273
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,000
It's just not the same
without the other guys! Ah...

274
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,208
We're like two puppies

275
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,250
that have been seperated
from their litter!

276
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,708
That guy is gonna
pay dearly for this!

277
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,166
Ya hear me?!

278
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,458
[JEICE whimpers]

279
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,916
[JEICE] I hear you, Cap'n!

280
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,875
[BULMA] My Dad couldn't
have been that far off

281
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,166
with Goku's arrival time.

282
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,583
He should've
been here by now.

283
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,125
Maybe Goku already
came and won the day

284
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,541
and they all went back
happily to Earth together

285
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,500
and forgot about me...

286
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,916
No, Goku wouldn't
forget about me!

287
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,333
He just couldn't!

288
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,583
Heck, I've known him since
he was just a little guy!

289
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,291
[BULMA sighs]

290
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,458
Those were the days...

291
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,083
What's the use?! Ugh!

292
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,000
[BULMA] Oh, Goku...

293
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,500
[BULMA sighs]

294
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:06,000
You won't forget me. I know.

295
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,166
[GOHAN]
What do we do now, Dad?!

296
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,208
[KRILLIN] Yeah, where
do we go from here?

297
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,583
[GOKU] Hey, Vegeta!

298
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,500
You know Frieza and the
others alot better than us.

299
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,750
How would you suggest we
approach the situation?

300
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,916
Oh, it's quite simple.

301
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,125
All you have to do
is finish Frieza.

302
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,833
You don't think
I can do it, do ya?

303
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,250
I know! King Kai warned
me about Frieza as well

304
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,750
and told me to stay
away from him at all costs!

305
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,458
[VEGETA] Good advice.

306
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,125
But, heck, if we could
get to the Dragon Balls

307
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,875
and wish our friends
from Earth back,

308
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,291
we might have a chance!

309
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,875
[VEGETA] 
You friends from Earth...

310
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,875
If you think they're going to
tip the scales in your favor,

311
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,541
you're out of your mind!

312
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,750
But I have an idea.

313
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,500
Let me wish for immortality
and we'll win for sure!

314
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,958
You can forget that!

315
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,000
There's no way we're going
to create an immortal Vegeta

316
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,166
to go around terrorizing
the universe!

317
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,166
[VEGETA] Heh!

318
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,250
Huh?!

319
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,208
[KRILLIN]
Two big powers coming!

320
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,541
Oh, great! They're heading
right for us, aren't they?

321
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,958
You'd better believe it.

322
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,875
Jeice, the one your Dad let go,

323
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,375
is coming back with
Captain Ginyu!

324
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,583
[VEGETA] Oh, now
you've done it, Kakarot!

325
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,875
You're not having
any regrets, are you?

326
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,208
Hey, shut up!

327
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,458
We're here for you, Goku!

328
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,333
You just tell us what
to do, and we'll do it!

329
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,625
Wait a second! If those
guys are coming here

330
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,041
and I can't sense Frieza over
there, where their ship is!

331
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,500
Kakarot, quick,
help me locate Frieza!

332
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,708
[GOKU] Right!
No problem!

333
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,083
[KRILLIN] I don't get it.
What's the big deal?

334
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,708
[VEGETA] The big deal is if

335
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,875
the Dragon Balls are
at their spaceship

336
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,625
and Frieza isn't there
for some reason...

337
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,666
[KRILLIN] then Captain Ginyu
and the orange guy are leaving

338
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,958
the Dragon Balls
unguarded to come here!

339
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,000
[VEGETA] Precisely!

340
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,000
[GOKU] There's a huge
power in that direction,

341
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,458
but it's pretty far off!

342
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,250
That's him.
It's unmistakable now.

343
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,541
[GOHAN] Uh, oh.
That's Guru's place!

344
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,916
This is not good.

345
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,458
Guru's old, he can't
defend himself!

346
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,208
And that's not all.

347
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,583
That's right!
Guru created the Dragon Balls!

348
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,958
So, if Frieza destroys him,

349
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,333
then that means the Dragon Balls
are history as well!

350
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,250
Say what?!

351
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,666
You mean if some
old Namek dies,

352
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,375
the Dragon Balls will vanish?!

353
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,708
[GOKU]
All things must pass.

354
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,291
Not even the Dragon
Balls last forever!

355
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:30,208
[KRILLIN] Hey wait, Frieza
wouldn't hurt Guru if he knew!

356
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,208
But he doesn't know.

357
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,916
Poor Guru! He wouldn't
tell Frieza either!

358
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,750
He'd rather die than
let the Dragon Balls

359
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,708
be used for any kind of evil!

360
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,166
I wish there was some
way for us to help out...

361
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,833
[GURU] Yes, I see
you have been brave

362
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,875
and giving in your struggle.

363
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,708
I have a gift for you that might
help you in your endeavors.

364
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,833
He's so good he reminds you of
a Grandfather or something,

365
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,041
how could anyone want to
hurt such a great guy?!

366
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,916
[VEGETA] What world
do you live in?!

367
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,083
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN] Huh?!

368
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,666
[GOKU] Cool it, guys!
We've got company!

369
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,458
[VEGETA gasps]

370
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,916
Huh?!

371
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,875
Dad!

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,833
Meet the boss, Matey!
His name is Cap'n Ginyu

373
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,583
and he'd like to have
a few words with you

374
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,833
concerning our
encounter earlier!

375
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,041
[KRILLIN] Hey, uh, Goku,

376
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,833
I think now would be a good
time for a plan!

377
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,291
Krillin, you and Gohan
are going to take off!

378
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,750
Get the Dragon Radar

379
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,208
and see if you can get your
hands on the Dragon Balls!

380
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,250
Alright. Let's see...

381
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,083
housand!
[GINYU] The Scouter
says... five

382
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,458
[JEICE] That's impossible!

383
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,750
Somehow he can hide his true
level from the scouter!

384
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,958
Shut up, Jeice!

385
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,416
Huh?

386
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,583
evel,
Of course he's hiding
his true power

387
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,791
that's ridiculously obvious!

388
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,500
You're looking at a
rare fighter there!

389
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,500
A guy like this one can
quadruple his fighting power

390
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,541
in an instant!

391
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,666
I estimate when
he really gets going

392
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,541
housand or maybe more!
he'll have a power level of
sixty

393
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,791
What?! Sixty thousand!
But he said he was a Saiyan!

394
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,791
No bloody Saiyan that we've
ever met is that strong!

395
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,541
[GINYU] Well, this one is!
Think about it!

396
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,208
He might be a mutant like us!

397
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,583
I mean, he's
definitely different!

398
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,916
He's the first Saiyan
I've seen without a tail!

399
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,333
What a magnificent
opportunity to showcase

400
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,541
my fabulous strength. Heh!

401
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,875
A chance to reveal
the full extent

402
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,875
of my grandeur in battle.

403
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,208
You gotta love it.

404
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,291
Alright, guys.
It's time for you to leave.

405
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,541
You can do it!

406
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,083
Get the radar, and then
go get the Dragon Balls!

407
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,666
But what about you, Dad?

408
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,250
You know there's no way we can
leave you here all by yourself!

409
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,000
[GOKU]
I'll be fine, Gohan!

410
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,083
Just concentrate on
doing your part!

411
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,458
[KRILLIN] Goku, you're enjoying
this in some strange way,

412
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,166
aren't you?!

413
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,750
[GOKU] Kinda.

414
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,625
Let's get out of here and let
your Dad do his thing, Gohan.

415
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,625
Don't forget we've got
own mission to finish!

416
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,083
Piccolo and the others...

417
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,500
Now you're talking,
you guys!

418
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,125
You have a part
in the plan, too!

419
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,958
If that's okay with you.

420
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,000
I was hoping that
we could join forces

421
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,333
and work together
against those guys.

422
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,166
Well, how does that sound
to you, Vegeta, will you do it?

423
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,083
Yeah, sure. Why not?

424
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,083
You're gonna trust him?!

425
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,625
[GOKU] Guys!
There's no time!

426
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,041
Now, let's go!

427
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,083
We're on it.

428
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,541
You got it, Goku!

429
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,166
[JEICE] Hey!
There they go!

430
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,458
Let 'em go! Big deal.

431
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,750
I don't know why your dad
has to trust that guy!

432
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,375
I hear ya!
It's too risky!

433
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,916
[GURU coughs]

434
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,583
[DENDE]
Guru, are you okay?

435
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,125
Well, I guess
it's now or never!

436
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,458
And I'm right behind you.

437
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,791
[VEGETA chuckles]

438
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,166
[VEGETA yells]

439
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,875
Have fun, Kakarot!

440
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,541
[VEGETA laughs]

441
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,583
Man, you dirty dog!

442
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,166
Prepare to die!

443
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,750
[GINYU laughs]

444
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,583
[NARRATOR] With Vegeta leaving
our hero to fend for himself,

445
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:52,166
will Goku have the power to
defeat the fierce Captain Ginyu?

446
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,583
Find out on the next
Dragon Ball Z!
