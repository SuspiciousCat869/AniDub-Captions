1
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,833
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,041
Krillin paid a visit
to the Eldest Namek,

3
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,833
where he received
a Dragon Ball,

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,041
and another
unexpected reward!

5
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,583
[KRILLIN cackles]

6
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,833
Power!
A lot of power!

7
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,500
[NARRATOR] With his hidden
potential released,

8
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,916
Krillin raced off with
his prize. Meanwhile...

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,375
Now, go find Vegeta.
I want that Dragon Ball!

10
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,333
[NARRATOR] Frieza sent
his henchman Zarbon

11
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,708
to search for Vegeta,

12
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,416
in order to discover the
location of the Dragon Ball

13
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,083
that the Saiyan
had hidden...

14
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,416
Well. So you are still
alive, after all...

15
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,583
I guess that's lucky for me.
Not so lucky for you.

16
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,708
[NARRATOR]
Krillin has one Dragon Ball!

17
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,833
Can Gohan find the last one
before Vegeta is forced

18
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,958
to reveal its
whereabouts to Frieza?

19
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,041
If not, the race for the
Dragon Balls may be decided

20
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,833
before Goku even
arrives! Stay tuned!

[grunting continues]

24
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,500
I hope Yamcha
and the others

25
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,458
are at least making better
progress at King Kai's.

26

[GOKU panting]

27
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,041
[thinking] I wonder if they've
caught Bubbles yet? Heh.

28
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,625
I can only imagine the
time they must be having.

29
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,583
Oh well. No
time to daydream!

30
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,916

I'll get you!

[chattering continues]

37
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,083
You think you're
pretty smart!

38
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,875
[YAMCHA shouting]

39
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:32,041
[BUBBLES giggling]

40
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,250
Thought he had 'im.

41
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,000
I know...

42
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,791
[YAMCHA] Ugh! Damn... monkey...

43
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,625
[KING KAI humming]

44
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,333
[KING KAI] Don't
blame the monkey!

45
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,333
[TIEN] My turn!

46
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,666
[BUBBLES chattering]

47
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,250
Huh?

48
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,916
All right.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,291
[CHIAOTZU] C'mon!
Get him, Tien!

50
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,875
[KING KAI] No need to
hurry, boys. Take your time.

51
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,833
What's up?

52
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,458
I've already proven I'm
above these foolish games.

53
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,541
So what do you say we
just cut to the chase?

54
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,875
[KING KAI] Nope. Sorry.

55
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,791
You'll have to go through
the proper procedure

56
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,208
like everyone else.

57
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,916
Aahhh...

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,250
No one's forcing you
to sit out, Piccolo.

59
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,458
You're free to join
the others at any time.

60
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,708
But if you'd
rather not do that...

61
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,666
You're more than welcome
to give me a hand

62
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,500
weeding the garden,
if you'd like.

63
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,958
[PICCOLO growls]

64
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,750
I'm curious, why are
you in such a rush?

65
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,750
You made a promise that
you wouldn't fight Frieza.

66
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,875
You're not thinking
of breaking it?

67
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,500
No, no, of course
you're not.

68
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,250
Because that would
mean you're a liar...

69
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,666
And I think
we both know,

70
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,333
the only thing worse than
a liar is a no-good thief!

71
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,041
I make it a rule never
to train either one!

72
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,666
Not that you'd have to
worry about that, right?

73
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,208
Ah, forget I
mentioned it.

74
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,416
Uh? So you don't want
to help with the garden?

75
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,208
Hmmm...

76
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,291
Huh?

77
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,125
[BUBBLES chattering,

[TIEN panting]

79
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,666
[KING KAI] Heeey!
It's time to eat!

80
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,916
[ALL gasp]

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,083
Hmm...?

82
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,125
They're eating more
than Goku did!

83
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,416
You could lose a
hand in there.

84
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,041
Wait!
Slow down!

85
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,208
Try to save a little
bit for me, you guys!

86
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,208
It's really great,
King Kai.

87
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,666
Oh! Glad to hear it!

88
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,500
I try to prepare
a healthy menu

89
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,416
for all my trainees
while they're here.

90
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,291
There's fried rice,
fried fish,

91
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,625
fried chicken, fried
sausages, fried pork,

92
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,750
refried beans, fried cheese,
and milkshakes for desert.

93
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,041
Huh? Hey! Where'd it all go?!

94
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,333
[ALL] Ah... Couldn't
eat another bite!

95
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,416
Well, then, I see
in our next lesson

96
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,416
we should definitely
discuss moderation.

97
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,916
[YAMCHA] Now that I'm full,
you're in big trouble, ape-face.

[KING KAI] Hey! Don't
call me ape-face!

99
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:45,416
I'm not talking about you,
King Kai. It's him I want.

They're doing
great work.

They just keep on getting
faster and faster.

Pretty impressive, no?

123
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,875
[PICCOLO] I came here
to get stronger...

124
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,250
To do that, I have to
train with someone

125
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,083
who's stronger than I
am. And they're not.

Oh. Well, now.

Even Chiaotzu's gotten fast
enough to catch Bubbles.

for step number two!

is take this hammer,

give me a good tap,
and then you win!

139

And don't go
easy on me!

Because, I'm sure not
gonna go easy on you!

Here.

Hey, Piccolo! Why don't
you give it a try?

158
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,916
[PICCOLO] Because I have better
things to do with my time

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,583
than take swings at a
cricket. I'll train myself.

or not, here I come!

00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,291
[ALL shouting]

163
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,916
[CHIAOTZU] Come on! Get him!

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,958
Here! Let me
give it a try!

165
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,083
[CHIAOTZU yelling,
GREGORY laughing]

166
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,291
What's the matter?
Gonna give up already, guys?

167
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,125
[YAMCHA growls]

168
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,791
No way!

169
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:24,208
Heeey! Why don't we
take a little break?

170
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,125
[ALL] Huh?

171
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,458
Piccolo's already over there
taking a nap under the tree.

172
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,791
You guys might
as well too.

173
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,750
Hey, we're not
like Piccolo.

174
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:37,291
We came here to work!
Let's get going!

175
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,708
Okay, big shot!

176
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,541
[KING KAI] Well, I could
sure use a nap too.

177
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,958
[thinking] He knows what
we're up against here...

178
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,958
This Frieza is somehow
even stronger than Vegeta,

179
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,208
and all he's doing
is wasting our time!

180
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,583
How is he?

181
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,916
[APOOL] He's holding steady.

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,041
I've managed to stabilize
his vital signs for now,

183
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,250
but he's still in
critical condition.

184
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,708
He may never
regain consciousness.

185
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,958
He's got to make it!
You revive him at all costs!

186
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,500
Do you understand?!

187
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,291
Yes, sir...

188
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,625
[thinking] If he
doesn't recover,

189
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,791
Frieza will have my head...

190
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,958
[FRIEZA] I want that
Dragon Ball...

191
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:11,333
[KING KAI snoring]

192
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:19,416
[BUBBLES quietly snoring,

193
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,666
[GREGORY panting]

194
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,250
[CHIAOTZU humming]

195
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,750
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

196
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,250
Oh yeah!
Chiaotzu! Home run!

197
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,125
C'mon! Keep your
eye on the cricket!

198
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,458
Right!

199
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,375
Here we go, it's two outs,
bottom of the ninth--

200
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,291
Hey, all right!
Full count.

201
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,750
We've got runners
on the corners

202
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,541
and we're down by two...
This for the win!

203
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,500
[GREGORY] I'll teach you
to give me some respect!

204
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,625
Just see if you can
keep up with me!

205
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,375
[CHIAOTZU] Okay.

206
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,500
All right, then.
Here I come, Doll-boy.

207
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,041
See if you can even
swing the bat!

208
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,125
Ready when
you are!

209
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,833
You asked for it.
Here comes the heat!

210
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,625
[GREGORY giggling]

211
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,416
[GREGORY screaming]

212
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,750
[YAMCHA] It's goooone!

213
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,166
[BUBBLES whooping excitedly]

214
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,416
Ah! We're under attack! Abandon
ship! Batten down the hatches!

215
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,125
He knocked it out of the
park. A grand-slam home run!

216
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,000
Huh? Gregory?
What are you doing in here?

217
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,541
It's not his fault. Chiaotzu
knocked him a good one.

218
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,000
We all did!

219
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,958
Really? All of you?
Is this true, Gregory?

220
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,250
No... They
didn't catch me.

221
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,291
They can't prove a thing!
They're lying!

222
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,333
Goodness! Well that
was really fast.

223
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,666
It only took you about an
hour and five minutes.

224
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,333
[YAMCHA] That's right. And
we're ready for the next lesson.

225
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,208
[KING KAI] Now, I
hope you guys know

226
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,625
what you're getting
yourselves into!

227
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,416
For the next exercise,
we'll start with some basics

228
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,333
in the ancient
art of grappling!

229
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,833
You ready for some
one-on-one, Tien?

230
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,958
You got it!

231
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,125
Yeah!

232
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,166
[KING KAI] Hold on, now!
Not so fast there!

233
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,708
Ah- ahh! I'm in charge
of picking the opponents.

234
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,166
[PICCOLO] Count me in.

235
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,333
[KING KAI] Oh, so you've
finally decided to join us.

236
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,791
Well, how 'bout
Piccolo against--

237
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,500
[PICCOLO] Against them all.

238
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,750
[BOTH] What?!

239
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,500
You three weaklings
had to struggle

240
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,916
just to catch a monkey
and a grasshopper.

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,750
I could take
on 10 of you,

242
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,833
and it still wouldn't
be a challenge.

243
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,708
Oh yeah? We'll
see about that!

244
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,166
Wait, now. I'm not
so sure about this...

245
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,666
The odds do seem
unfairly stacked.

246
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,125
[PICCOLO] Heh.

247
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,208
[KING KAI] But, if this is
what you boys want to do...

248
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,583
Heh! We'll handle him.

249
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,125
I certainly
hope so.

250
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,916
You three have done
such excellent work

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
in your training
exercises so far.

252
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,083
It's time to see whether
or not it's paid--

253
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,916
[PICCOLO] Enough talk!

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,500
I'm ready. Let's see
what you've got.

255

[BOTH growling]

256
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,583
Come on!
Attack me!

257
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,666
Ready?

258
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,125
[BOTH] Hmph.

259
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,458
[CHIAOTZU] Uh-huh.

260
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,958
Ready?! And go!

263
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,875
Oh yeah?!

264
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,291
Nice try!

Hey, don't worry.

You're forgetting...
You're already dead.

281

You can't die a second
time, you know.

282
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,833
You give him a minute or
two and he'll shake it off.

283
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,750
Just you wait.

believe how much stronger

00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,583
they've already
become.

291
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,250
It can't be because of
this stupid training

292

they've been doing...

293

[PICCOLO] Arrgh!

304
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,375
[YAMCHA] So...
How's that for you?

305
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,333
Yeah, have you had
enough yet, Piccolo?

306
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,791
[PICCOLO] Hmph.

307
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,458
I haven't even
gotten started.

308
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,916
[ALL] Hah!

309
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,708
[KING KAI] Nope, sorry guys.

310
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,208
That's enough
for now.

311
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,958
I've decided we should all
take a break for lunch.

312
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,416
[ALL] Huh?

313

What's the only kind of dog in
the world that doesn't bark?

316
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll tell you...
A hot dog!

[APOOL] Frieza's not
going to be happy.

322
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,541
At this rate,
he'll never recover!

323
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,958
I don't know...
But it looks to me

324
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,791
like the high and
mighty Prince Vegeta

325
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,458
really isn't so mighty
after all, now is he?

326
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,125
[APOOL laughs]

327
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,083
[APOOL] Well, I hope
you do pull out of it.

328
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,458
'Cause I'm gonna really
enjoy watching Zarbon

329
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,291
torture you
to death!

330
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,166
That oughta' keep
you for a while.

331
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,666
Tell you what, I'm gonna
go take a little break.

332
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,333
Just promise you'll sit
tight 'til I get back.

333
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,375
I wouldn't want you to
wander off and get hurt.

334
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,916
[APOOL chuckles]

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,375
Huh?!

336
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,416
[APOOL screaming]

337
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,958
So, then.
How is he?

338
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,166
[ZARBON] He... He should regain
consciousness any time, now.

339
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,625
Good, then I won't
have to kill you.

340
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,208
Yes, lord...

341
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,708
[distant explosion]

342
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,083
What? What in the
blazes was that?!

343
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,541
Find out!

344
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,625
[VEGETA chuckling]

345
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:29,000
They just keep underestimating
the true powers of a Saiyan.

346
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,458
Huh?

347
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,666
[ZARBON panting]

348
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,708
[distant explosion]

349
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,125
Damn! It came from
the recovery room!

350
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,166
Well, don't just
stand there!

351
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,583
[ZARBON gasps]

352
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,541
[ZARBON] He's gone!
He must've flown off!

353
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,291
[FRIEZA] So go after him!

354
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,208
[VEGETA thinking] Excellent.
Everyone's here...

355
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,875
Go now! Do you
hear me, Zarbon?

356
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,916
I'll...
I'll find him!

357
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,208
[FRIEZA] You'd better!

358
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,125
Because if you don't find
him within the hour,

359
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,208
you'll wish you'd
never been born!

360
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,791
[VEGETA laughing]

361
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,166
[thinking] They're almost
making this too easy...

362
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:24,375
[VEGETA laughing]

363
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,041
[thinking] Oh, Frieza.
You're so overconfident

364
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,791
in your abilities
that you've left even

365
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,916
your precious
Dragon Balls unguarded.

366
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,458
Well, I assure you, it
will be your last mistake.

367
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:41,041
[VEGETA chuckles]

368
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,375
You lose, Frieza!

369
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,375
[NARRATOR] Vegeta is back
from the brink of death,

370
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:49,166
and five of the magic Dragon
Balls are now within his grasp!

371
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,416
Can anything stop him from
fulfilling his sinister wish?

372
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,458
Find out, next
Dragon Ball Z!
