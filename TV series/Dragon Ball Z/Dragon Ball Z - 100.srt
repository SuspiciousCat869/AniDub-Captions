00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,083
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,625
the planet Namek continued
to crumble apart

3
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,791
as King Kai hatched a plan
to restore Frieza's victims

4
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,750
back to life using a wish to the
Eternal Dragon of the Earth.

5
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,666
[NARRATOR]
Mr. Popo made the wish,

6
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,750
but it was a tall order,
even for an Eternal Dragon.

7
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,416
And the Dragon wasn't sure if it
could fulfill the wish or not.

8
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,541
[SHENRON] I... don't know.

9
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,625
[NARRATOR] Back on Namek,
the showdown continued

10
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:48,000
between the Super Saiyan Goku,
and Frieza, the evil tyrant.

11
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,916
The amazing Saiyan
continued to challenge

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,416
the depths of Frieza's
strength even though

13
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,375
the villain was at his
maximum power level.

14
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,708
[NARRATOR] Does Goku has
something up his sleeve?

15
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,541
He's going to need it, because
Frieza has committed himself

16
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,291
to an all-out attack!

17
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,375
[NARRATOR] The two super powers
are on a crash course.

18
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,625
Find out which one
survives, today!

[KING KAI grunts]

32
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,458
Holy cow!

33
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,958
What a jolt!

34
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:02,125
Ughhh... Knocked
my socks off!

35
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,208
My word...

36
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,750
This is truly a
battle like no other!

37
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,125
Kami?

38
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,458
Kami, we're running out of time!

39
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,958
What about the wish?

40
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,708
Yes, yes, of course.
Mr. Popo is on the job

41
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,083
as we speak.

42
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,708
The wish has been made.

43
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,958
But the Eternal Dragon is
having trouble fulfilling it.

44
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,250
Fulfilling this wish is no
simple task, my friend.

45
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,000
It's a big one!

46

Three minutes!

55
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,916

that this planet is going

56

[BULMA] What?!

76
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,125
What do you mean "It's over"?!

77
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,166
My Dad's power signal...
I can't sense it...

78
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,166
Gone!

79

Wh-What does that mean?!

80
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,250
It means that...
That he's dead...

81
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,416
No! Hey!

82
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,875
That can't be!

83
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,208
[FRIEZA] I can't believe it!

84
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,500
This is incredible!

85
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,416
He's actually gone!

86
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,583

[BULMA] I hate to say it, Gohan,
but if your Dad's been defeated,

93
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,250
then it's time to get the heck
out of here while we still can!

[BULMA] Gohan, are you okay...?

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,208
I know it's hard,
but we gotta go.

98
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,541
[GOHAN] I'm staying, Bulma.

99
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,208
You're gonna have to
leave with Piccolo!

100

[BULMA] What?! Hey!
This isn't funny!

101

[GOHAN] I'm part Saiyan, Bulma.

102
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,458
Frieza is gonna hunt
me down wherever I go.

103
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,250
The last thing I wanna do
is lead him back to Earth.

104
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,375
I don't want to be
a danger to anybody...

105
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,791
I know what I've got to do.

106
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,708
That's nonsense!

107
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,416
Let's go!

108
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,333
You're not sure that he's
going to follow you.

109
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,458
We really should get out
of here before it's too late!

111

Don't go!

You can't put this
all on yourself!

113

Don't worry about me.

This is the way that I want it.

I'll be alright.

116
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,583
You take care of Piccolo.

117
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,583
[BULMA] Gohan, no!
This is suicide!

118
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,541
No way!

119
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,125
This is life.

120
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,500
Piccolo would understand.

121
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,041
And so would my Dad!

122
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,166
Besides, I don't
intend to die.

123
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,250
Frieza's bound to be hurting
if he was fighting my Dad.

124
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,750
Maybe I can beat him!

give it a try!

take this anymore...

00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,125
But where's Guru?

168
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,500
Huh?

169
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,083
The sky...

170
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,666
It's black.

171
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,458
Time to get out of here.

172
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,625
She's about to blow.

173
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:18,041
And I don't have enough energy
to weather the explosion.

174
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,333
Well, so long.

175
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,708
You fulfilled the legend,

176
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,166
only to become a fresh batch
of Super Saiyan Soup.

Huh?!

No, it can't be!

180
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,125
What?! It is!

181
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,708
Huh...?

182
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't leave now.

183
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,291
It's not over yet!

184
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,625
Heh.

"Not over yet"?

That's a good one, kid.

189
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,708
You're a funny little guy.

190

You're just in time
for a quick beating.

191

Well... We'll see...

192
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,583
I think...

193
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,250
It's your turn!

194
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,583
[FRIEZA chuckles]

195
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,833
A pint-size Saiyan!

196
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,625
Hmph.

197
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,666
You don't really believe
that you can succeed

198
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,416
where both your father
and Vegeta failed?

199
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,083
Maybe you do
believe it!

200
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,333
It wouldn't surprise me to
know that the last Saiyan

201
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:54,541
to perish at my hands, was
just as foolish as the first.

202
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,833
Darn shame, isn't it?

203
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,583
A noble race like the
Saiyans completely extinct.

204
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,875
Or am I speaking too soon?

205
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,125
Perhaps you really are
going to strike me down.

206
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,416
Well... Let's find out!

Don't tell me you've had a
change of heart, big guy?

213
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,708
Well, it's too late now,
you're going to have to learn

214
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,875
how to finish
what you've started.

215

we play to the end!

[FRIEZA] Take that!

[FRIEZA] You're no fun!

All bark and no bite.

What a joke.

[thinking]
Just two more minutes...

223
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,708
If I can hold out for
two more minutes

224
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,541
he'll get caught
in the explosion...

Yes...

[VEGETA] How did
I get back here?

232
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,791
It's impossible,
but I'm really alive!

But what about Guru?

Without him, it's no use!

He's the only one who
can make our plan work.

[KING KAI] You're right, Tien!

There's no cause to celebrate
if Guru hasn't returned.

[FRIEZA pants]

336
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,333
[thinking] Father,
I-I'm sorry...

337
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,250
I really tried!

338
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,375

[GOHAN gasps]

342
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,708
What?!

343
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:01,625
Dad!

348
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,666
But... Daddy...

349
