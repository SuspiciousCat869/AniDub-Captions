00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,166
Frieza fired an attack that
seemed to pass by everyone...

3
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,833
[NARRATOR] Everyone
except the one person

4
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,333
who couldn't be
healed by Dende...

5
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,166
[NARRATOR] Dende himself...

6
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,000
Enraged by the loss
of their friend, Gohan...

7
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,041
...Krillin...

8
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,125
...and Piccolo...

9
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,375
...go three-on-one
with the evil Frieza.

10
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,416
A move that almost
lands Gohan in trouble.

11
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,625
[NARRATOR] Surprisingly,
Vegeta stepped in

12
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,291
and saved the young boy.

13
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,166
[NARRATOR} Then launced
an attack of his own.

14
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,666
You're making me mad!

15
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,291
[NARRATOR] Fueled by the idea
of becoming a Super Sayian,

16
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:16,000
Vegeta tried his hand at
defeating the maniacal Frieza.

17
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,000
Things were looking good, but
Frieza's immense power and speed

18
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,625
were too much to handle,
and left Vegeta puzzled

19
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,833
over his inability to
strike his nemesis.

20
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,083
That's impossible!

21
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,541
I guess you're... not a
"Super Saiyan", are you?

22
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,916
[NARRATOR] Does Vegeta have
the power to destroy Frieza?

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,125
Find out today!

24
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,708
[VEGETA thinking]
How can I beat Frieza?!

25
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,291
I've used all of my best moves!

26
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,541

[VEGETA growls]

00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,458
[VEGETA] Hyaah!

31
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,916
Huh?!

32
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,875
Where'd he go?!

33
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,416
[thinking] He's so darn fast!

34
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,333
I don't believe it!

35
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,833
It looks like Frieza's
too much for Vegeta!

36
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,875
I think you're right.

37
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,041
[FRIEZA] Vegeta,
face it, to fight with me

38
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,458
is futile and useless.

39
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,250
Just wake up. You're
blind and delusional.

40
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,000
[VEGETA gasps]

41
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:30,750
You keep going on about
being a Super Sayian.

42
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,458
But it's just a myth, Vegeta.

43
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,916
I've never seen one.
Have you? You're such a chump.

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,666

[VEGETA gasps]

46
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,500
Such an ego...

47
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,750
You really believe all that?
A "Super Saiyan".

48
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,791
I must say, somebody
has some high hopes.

49
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,583
[VEGETA whimpers]

50
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,666
[thinking] Oh no!
What if he's right?!

51
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,333
What if I'm not
a Super Saiyan?!

52
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,666
That would mean I don't stand
a chance against Frieza!

53
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,208
And that means I'm
pretty much... dead!

54
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,208
Blast it! It can't be true!

55
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,916
What's he doing?

56
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,583
No, this just isn't possible!

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,166
Huh?

58
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,000
[VEGETA] You're wrong!

59
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,000
I am a Super Saiyan!

Vegeta's aim is bang on,

00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,666
but everytime he shoots, Frieza
anticipates his every move!

a matter of time

I-I don't...

Frieza defended himself with
just one... one simple kick!

164
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,916
[VEGETA gasps]

165
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,333
[VEGETA yells]

166
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:41,166
[blows landing,
yelling]

167
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,916
[VEGETA gasps]

168
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,666
[VEGETA screams]

169
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,708
Feel free to jump in
anytime, my little friends.

170
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:09,541
[blows landing]

171
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,041
[KING KAI thinking] Piccolo and
the others are bound by fear,

172
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,708
rendering them helpless
against Frieza's fury.

173
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,875
Now it looks as though all
hope to defeat Frieza is lost...

174
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,208
[thinking] I can sense Vegeta
losing his battle against...

175
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,875
...against some
tremendous dark force!

176
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,375
It must be Frieza!

177
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,791
[thinking] And I fear
the worst for Vegeta...

178
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:45,041
[beeping]

179
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,541
[buzzing]

180
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,000
[thinking] I'm healed!

181
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,500
[thinking] I can feel
my renewed power!

182
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,166
It's surging
through every vein!

183
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:53,000
[thinking] I can't believe it!
I can't believe my strength!

184
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,000
This is incredible!

185
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,583
[thinking] I feel so calm,
yet I know I must help Vegeta

186
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,041
and the others.

187
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,125
[thinking] I'm sorry I haven't
been there for you, Gohan.

188
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,708
But I'll make up for lost time.

189
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,041
[thinking] Trust me!
I'm on my way!

190
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:33,208
[blows landing,
VEGETA grunting]

191
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:43,000
[NARRATOR] Is Goku truly
strong enough to stop Frieza,

192
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,541
the ultimate fighting machine?

193
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:50,833
