[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,500
Goku and Gohan
struggled to adapt their

3
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,958
incredible Super Saiyan
strength to life at home.

4
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,041
[GOKU] You gotta control it,
like me. Watch this, see?

5
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,000
[NARRATOR] But when you're used
to holding planet-conquering

6
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,500
tyrants in your grip,

7
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,541
everyday life
can be tricky.

8
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,833
[NARRATOR] With Cell's deadly
tournament only days away,

9
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:41,375
Goku was determined to enjoy
the simpler things in life.

10
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:45,375
[GOKU laughs]

11
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,458
Family ties were
strengthened as ChiChi

12
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,625
held a party for
Gohan's eleventh birthday!

13
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,833
It was a time to share
laughs and memories.

14
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,583
[NARRATOR] Dark days lie ahead,

15
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,041
and Goku's family and
friends are spending

16
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:05,708
this precious time in the
best possible way: together.

17
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,791
Now, can our heroes find
the strength to beat Cell,

18
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,750
and restore the planet's peace?

[VEGETA growls]

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,416
Agh! What is taking that
Namek so long?! Really!

23
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,666
Doesn't he know he's wasting
important people's time?!

24
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,125
Well, he's almost
done, just stay calm.

25
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,583
[VEGETA] "Calm"?!

26
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,750
Oh, I will show you calm!

27
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,250
If he stays there any longer,

28
00:03:56,333 --> 00:04:00,625
I'll knock that door down
and calmly drag him out!

29
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,250
Look! He's done!

30
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,125
[VEGETA] Well, it's about time!

31
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,875
Great! A dramatic entrance!

32
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,875
Alright! Out of my way!

33
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,333
[thinking] Wow! Piccolo's
power has gone way up!

34
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,833
That's funny. You
haven't changed at all.

35
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,041
[VEGETA chuckles]

36
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,875
What were you doing
in there? Taking a nap?

37
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,875
[thinking] Now I will
show you, Kakarot!

38
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,583
I'm going to surpass you.
Once and for all!

39
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,291
[KING FURRY] And so, my dear
citizens, do not be afraid.

40
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,166
The Royal Military shall
mount a courageous attack,

41
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,750
and silence the infamous Cell
with one triumphant swoop!

42
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:46,000
As I have often said, there is
nothing to fear but fear itself!

43
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,833
Those guys are in
for some big trouble.

44
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,708
They should know by now
that Goku's their only chance!

45
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,541
Dr. Gero's androids
really are something!

46
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,583
And that goes for this guy, too!

47
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,875
I mean, the level
of detail in his circuitry?

48
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,166
It must have taken Dr. Gero
years and years to finish!

49
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,333
[BULMA] Now if only
I could decode

50
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,416
this energy detection sequence.

51
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,333
See? There's one! Right there!

52
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,625
I told you this lake
was perfect for fishing!

53
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,791
Is this okay, Dad?

54
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,708
I feel bad that we're
not training right now.

55
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,250
Yeah, it does feel kinda
weird acting so relaxed.

56
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:54,291
Oh, come on, you guys.
I think we can handle Cell!

57
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,791
"Think"? What do
you mean "think"?

58
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,375
Don't worry! We can win,
and remember:

59
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,125
we've reached a level that
there's no point in passing.

60
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,666
We've done all
that we can! Okay?

61
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,333
Okay!

62
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:12,333
Well, if you say so, I suppose
that's enough for me!

63
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:17,125
Hey guys! Wash your
hands, lunch is ready!

64
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,583
Oh, coming!

65
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,958
Now, son, let's try
to enjoy ourselves

66
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,958
and not worry about Cell!

67
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,333
There'll be plenty
of time for that.

68
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,750
[GOKU] Woo-hoo!
Would you look at this?!

69
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,791
ChiChi, you've outdone yourself!

70
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,500
[KRILLIN] Hey, Goku,
I've been meaning to ask.

71
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,791
Since when have you
had a driver's license?

72
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,625
Oh, you know!

73
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,458
He and Piccolo went to get
a license three years ago!

74
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,291
And... they gave him one?!

75
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,416
[CHICHI] Well, not exactly...

76
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,083
You see, Piccolo and Goku
decided to have a little race

77
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,625
during their driving test,

78
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,875
and they were just
flying across the road like

79
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,875
a couple of 16-year olds!

80
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,333
[INSTRUCTOR] Look out!

81
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,125
[CHICHI] That's just like
you guys, to turn something

82
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,541
as simple as a driving
test into another competition.

83
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,125
It was a wonder no one got hurt.

84
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,000
[GOKU laughs]

85
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,666
[GOKU] Well, my driving
instructor may have hurt

86
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,750
his lungs screaming so much!

87
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,041
He sure was scared!

88
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,083
[CHICHI laughs]

89
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,625
[CHICHI] Can you blame him?

90
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,291
From what I hear, you
nearly had about

91
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,291
fifty head-on collisions!

92
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,166
[GOKU chuckles]

93
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,125
[GOKU] Yeah, some of 'em
were kinda close...

94
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,375
Now what?

95
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,083
[INSTRUCTOR sighs]

96
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,416
[CHICHI] After that day, I never
thought Goku

97
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,125
would get his license.

98
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,875
But then, I pleaded
with the instructor

99
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,458
to give Goku another chance,

100
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,375
and after five
more tries

101
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,500
this big lug of mine
finally got it right!

102
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,666
Well, are you glad he did?

103
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,791
Yeah, I love when
Goku drives me places.

104
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah, I bet!

105
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,416
You know, it's really
the smallest things

106
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
that can make you
happy in your life.

A nice Sunday drive.

A family picnic on a warm day.

Or when you close your eyes and
fall into your husband's arms.

by Master Roshi's house

if you want to.

I guess they're running
away from the city.

Well, you can't blame 'em.

I mean, you tend to think
you're a lot safer

the Royal Military was summoned

to stop the monstrous

00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,166
a full-scale attack
on the monster!

161
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm sure you can hear the
roar of machine guns

162
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,083
and missiles in front of me.

163
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,000
Amazing!

164
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,583
The monster
has no doubt

165
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,500
been reduced to a pile
of blackened ashes!

166
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,750
I say we can all let
out a giant sigh of relief.

167
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,666
No! No! Get out!

168
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,166
Stop! Cease fire!

169
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,166
[screaming]

170
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,916
[PILOT] Yee-haw!

171
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,500
Cease fire, cease fire!

172
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,541
--Cease fire!

[laughing]

174
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,708
Oh yeah! You like that?

175
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,583
Aahh...

176
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,250
[COMMANDER] Huh?!

177
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,541
[COMMANDER] There's, no way!

178
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,916
Just no way!

179
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,666
You... see that?

180
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,875
[SOLDIER E] Yeah, I see it, too!

181
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,625
He's.... He's still alive!

182
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,625
Judging by your silence,
I'd say it's my turn now.

183
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,291
[CELL chuckles]

[SOLDIERS screaming]

186
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,208
[REPORTER] I don't know how,
but Cell is still alive!

187
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,625
The troops are retreating!

188
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,916
And... now Cell seems
to be raising his hand!

189
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,541
Don't do it! They're helpless!

190
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,375
[SOLDIERS screaming]

191
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,625
Cell, no!

192
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,625

[GOKU growls]

196
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,833
That monster!

197
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,208
[CELL] Now that was amusing.

198
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,708
[CELL chuckles]

199
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,500
I'm sorry about this,
ChiChi, but I have to go.

200
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,208
I need to ask Piccolo something.

201
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:59,958
That's... odd. What does
this have to do with Piccolo?

202
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,208
[TRUNKS] Goku!

203
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,166
[GOKU] Hey, Trunks.
Hey, Mr. Popo.

204
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,750
Oh, wow, Piccolo!

205
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,041
You've been
doing some training

206
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,833
in the Hyperbolic Time
Chamber haven't you?

207
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,250
That's right.

208
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,541
I can really tell!
You're strong!

209
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,000
A lot more powerful than before!

210
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,250
Why don't you just
say it? I'm stronger,

211
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,375
but you still don't
think I can beat Cell.

212
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,166
Nope, don't stand a chance.

213
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,041
Thanks. You've always
been the honest one.

214
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,583
So why did you come up here?

215
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,833
Well, I've been thinking.

216
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,041
You can split yourself
in two again, right?

217
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,666
So that there's
a Piccolo and a Kami?

218
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,208
[PICCOLO] What?

219
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,666
See, with Kami gone all the
Dragon Balls have disappeared,

220
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,458
but we really need
a wish from the Dragon.

221
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,833
We need to wish for
all the people Cell killed

222
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,416
to be brought back to life.

223
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,916
And I mean every
single one of 'em.

224
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,541
[GOKU] It's the only
way we can make up

225
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,041
for letting Cell come this far.

226
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,000
[PICCOLO] Sorry, Goku,
but I can't.

227
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,125
Once two Nameks
have fused together,

228
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,208
they can never split apart.

229
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,791
That's why
I was so hesitant

230
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,458
to fuse with Kami-- it was
a permanent deal.

231
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,916
Too bad. 'Cause I was really...

232
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,875
[GOKU sighs]

233
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,333
...hoping.

234
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,750
Wait! I remember
Gohan told me once

235
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,458
that all the
survivors from Namek

236
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,916
went to live on a new
planet somewhere!

237
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,250
Maybe I can get a hold of them!

238
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,750
Why?!

239
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,375
Maybe I can get one
of them to come here!

240
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,708
Yeah, and then he could become
the new guardian for Earth!

241
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:43,458
That way we'll have a new
set of Dragon Balls, right?

242
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,916
[MR. POPO gasps]

243
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,000
[GOKU] If we explain
our situation,

244
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,750
I'm sure they'd
be happy to help!

245
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,583
I would just love a new
guardian to keep me company!

246
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,208
But, you don't have
the time to be doing this.

247
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,208
You don't even know
what planet they're living on!

248
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,416
It'd take years to find them!

249
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,583
Ah, I doubt that! Not if
I use my Instant Transmission!

250
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,833
It's just a simple matter
of finding a planet

251
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,125
with an energy signature
that's similar to Piccolo's!

252
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,375
[PICCOLO] You can't sense
energy that far away!

253
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:22,416
Oh, sure! I must admit
I've never actually tried.

254
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,750
But if I put my
mind to it, I bet I can.

255
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,541
Now please, everyone
be really quiet.

[MR. POPO gulps]

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,041

right! I can't!

Hey! I know what I'll do!

260
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,458
I'll go to King Kai's planet
and locate them from there!

261
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,500
Now, if I can just get
a good picture of King Kai!

262
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,416
Oh! There we go!

263
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,125
So, do you think he'll do it?

264
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:31,166
I don't think we should rely
on it if that's what you mean.

265
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,208
[GOKU] Hmmm, I wonder what
that goofy guy is up to.

No, no jokes.

about all the horrible things

that are happening on Earth?

[NARRATOR]
Goku continues with his plan

282
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,041
to bring Cell's victims
back to life.

283
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,041
But with the World Martial Arts
Tournament only days away,

284
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,375
shouldn't he be thinking
about his training?

285
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,833
The clock is ticking,

286
