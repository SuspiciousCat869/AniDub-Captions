00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,166
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,833
In a dramatic move using
the Fusion Earrings,

3
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,375
Goku and Vegeta joined
bodies to battle Majin Buu.

4
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,166
Permanently united as one,

5
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,291
they became the warrior Vegito.

6
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,333
And they focused
all of their strength

7
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,583
on Earth's ultimate threat!

8
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,875
A monster once
thought unstoppable,

9
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,416
Majin Buu at last
began to weaken

10
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,625
under the Saiyan combo's attack.

11
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,208
[SUPER BUU] But if that's
the way you want to play this,

12
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,000
then fine!

13
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,125
[NARRATOR]
Anxious to test the limits

14
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,541
of his new opponent's power,

15
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,666
Majin Buu created
a giant energy ball.

16
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,625
Made with energy fragments
from every planet

17
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,583
the monster had destroyed,

18
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,208
it was a blast capable of
splitting the Earth in two.

19
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,541
[NARRATOR] But for the
confident warrior, Vegito,

20
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:10,416
it was just another sporting
challenge to overcome.

21
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,375
[NARRATOR] Now, having
warmed up his new body,

22
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,166
and tested the fighting
abilities of Majin Buu,

23
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,625
Vegito has decided to turn
the battle up a notch.

24
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,750
Calling on the greater
powers of Goku and Vegeta,

25
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,625
the incredible fused warrior
has gone Super Saiyan.

26
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,708
[VEGITO]
Call me Super Vegito!

Oh, I shouldn't
have let this happen!

Ha, ha! Aw...

00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,208
So, uh, what happened
to Majin Buu?

48
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,041
Up there?!

Super Vegito.

So is that your
official new name?

[SUPER BUU laughs]

52

[SUPER BUU] We have such
great titles now, don't we?

53
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,708
Super Buu, Super Vegito,

54
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,500
we might as well just
say we're invincible.

55
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,333
But let's not forget the stats.

56
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:39,833
You have two Saiyans and I have
three, not to mention the Namek!

57
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,250
It's quality, not
quantity, my friend.

58
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,458
And our union wasn't
achieved by kidnappings.

59
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:50,208
But if you're sure you can win
this fight with petty theft...

60
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,208
Come prove it!

they were rivals

Not when I'm on guard.

161
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,833
It's not much fun being
hunted down, is it, Majin Buu?

162
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,291
Being hunted,

163
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,375
just the way you hunted down
our friends. Does it hurt?

164
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,166
[screams]

165
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,708
Curse you!

166
00:14:55,791 --> 00:15:01,625
[SUPER BUU grunting]

167
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,291
Hm?

168
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:09,625

[growls]

171
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,208
I warned you!

172
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,833
I warned you not
to make me mad!

173
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:33,041
[yells]

174
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,125

[VEGITO gagging]

177
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,166
What the--?

178
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,000
[SUPER BUU cackles]

179
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,041
[SUPER BUU]
I have you now! I'm inside!

180
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,958
Increase your power
all you want.

181
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,958
I'll only get stronger!

182
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,250
If you thought you
were sick of me before,

183
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:11,458
wait till I start tearing
you apart from the inside!

184
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:15,916
[SUPER BUU grunts, cackles]

185
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,750
You must really think
I'm an amateur!

186
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,041
[SUPER BUU]
What?!

187
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:46,875
[VEGITO yells]

188
00:16:53,458 --> 00:17:01,000

[SUPER BUU groans]

00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:24,000
[SUPER BUU groaning]

[SUPER BUU panting]

193
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,541
[SUPER BUU] I don't understand!
You should be under my control!

194
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,791
It's simple!

195
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,500
You see, I've used my energy to
isolate you inside of my body.

196
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,375
And, as long as
you stay in there,

197
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,041
I have complete
control over you.

198
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,875
Which is fine,
if you don't mind it.

199
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:58,708
[VEGITO wretches]

200
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:09,083
[SUPER BUU panting]

201
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,541
[VEGITO chuckles]

202
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,416
I'd say add some spice.

203
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,708
But I don't think anything
will get your bad taste

204
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,208
out of my mouth.

205
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,666
I'm taking you off the menu.

206
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,958
You've got some nerve
making me into a joke!

207
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:26,250
I'll destroy you, I swear,
if it's the last thing I do!

208
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,458
[growls]

209
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,333
I'm not your entertainment!

210
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:39,291
[grunting, growling]

211
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:49,833
[SUPER BUU yells]

212
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,375
[gasps]

213
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,125
[SUPER BUU screams] You led
me to this, you mortal freak!

214
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,000
It's your fault!

215
00:18:56,083 --> 00:19:08,333
[screams]

216
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:17,625
That's it, try
everything you can!

217
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:26,125
[screaming continues]

218
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:30,041
Oh, no! It looks like Buu
is really out of control!

219
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,833
Isn't he always?

220
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,125
Yes, to a degree!

221
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,291
But this is like when

222
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,708
was trapped in the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber!

223
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:44,500
Let me out!

224
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,458
[DENDE] Somehow, Majin Buu's
anger plunges him deeper

225
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,625
into his evil power
supply. In a rage,

226
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,666
he was capable of punching
a hole between dimensions!

227
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,541
Take a look!

228
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,333
[DENDE] If he's mad enough,
he could do it again.

229
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,958
And that would be disastrous
for the entire universe!

230
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,166
He could break through one
dimensional wall after another.

231
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,458
The imbalance could
cause a collapse!

232
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,333
Yeah, sounds awful.

233
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,791
[SUPER BUU] You make fun of Buu!
No one makes fun of Majin Buu!

234
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:42,041
[yells]

235
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,000
What? The whole planet's
energy is warping around us!

236
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,000
Is he trying to
destroy everything?

237
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,083
This has gone too far!

238
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,958
[yells]

239
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:03,291
[yelling]

240
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,791
[VEGITO grunts]
Stop this!

241
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:29,791
[yelling]

242
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,208

244

[VEGITO]
Hmph.

245
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,500
He won, I lost.

246
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,833
[VEGITO]
Well! If you ask me,

247
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,375
that was a little too
close for comfort.

248
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,458
But have the decency
to learn your lesson.

249
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:20,166
There's no way you
can ever beat me!

250
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,208
Unless you'd like
to try that technique

251
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,916
you've been saving.

252
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,125
[growls]

253
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,500
[OLD KAI]
Oh, no.

254
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:32,083
Don't stop now! What could
he be waiting for?

255
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,958
Now! He must destroy
Majin Buu now!

256
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,208
[NARRATOR] The clash
between two great powers

257
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,166
has taken a darker turn!

258
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,541
Vegito seems fully
capable of defeating Buu,

259
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,125
and yet, he declines.

260
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,375
What secret is the
fused Saiyan after?

261
