00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,458
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,875
Frieza spoiled the
surprise when he noticed

3
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,458
Goku's secret weapon,
the Spirit Bomb!

4
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,875
[FRIEZA] But where did
he get so much power?!

[FRIEZA laughs]

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,250
[NARRATOR] Of course,
Frieza wasn't about to

8
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,333
let Goku have the upper hand,

9
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:36,041
deciding to stop the Spirit
Bomb dead in its tracks.

10
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,291
And as Frieza
well knows,

11
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,208
the best way to
solve a problem

12
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,500
is to go directly
to the source!

13
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,291
Bad news for Goku!

14
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,166
[FRIEZA] Ka-boom.

15
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,250
[NARRATOR] But suddenly,

16
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,750
Piccolo came charging
to the rescue!

17
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,875
Piccolo?!

18
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,375
Goku...

19
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,208
You must hurry and finish
collecting energy for your bomb!

20

[FRIEZA growls]

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,833
[NARRATOR] Now, can Piccolo
keep Frieza busy long enough

22
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,250
for Goku to complete
his Spirit Bomb?

23
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,083
Stay tuned and find out!

You've gotta hurry!

How long until your
Spirit Bomb is ready?!

33
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,208
It looks like Frieza's
about to attack again!

34
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:15,791
No...

35

Not yet...

36
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,166
I need a little
more time, Piccolo!

37

Aah!

38

Throw it Goku, throw it!

No! I can't!

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,583
It's not strong enough
to defeat him yet!

[PICCOLO growls]

The last, pathetic Namek.

Well, come and
get it, if you can.

Piccolo?

47
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,541
What's he
trying to do?

48
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,791
He can't win!

[GOHAN] What?!

50
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,541
He must be trying
to stall Frieza

while Goku powers up
the Spirit Bomb!

52

I've gotta a bad
feeling about this, Gohan!

53

As powerful as Frieza is,

Hmph.

169
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:40,333
I forgot about those other
insignificant, little bugs.

170
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,833
[FRIEZA chuckles]

171
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,250
No matter, I'll crush
them once I'm finished

172
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,791
with these two weaklings.

173
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:54,000
[FRIEZA laughs]

174
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,125
The end is at hand!

175
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,583
You and this entire
planet will be reduced

176
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,083
to nothing but dust!

177
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,625
[FRIEZA laughs]

178
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,375
[GOKU growls]

179
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,500
Goku...

180
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,958
Is it ready?

181
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,125
Yes!

182
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,416
It's complete!

183
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,791
C'mon!

184
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,041
Do it!

185
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,041
Daddy!

186
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,125
[GOKU yells]

187
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,541
[FRIEZA chuckles]

188
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,000
Huh?!

189
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,083
[FRIEZA whimpers]

190
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,625
[BOTH gasp]

191
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,833
[FRIEZA] Nooo...!

192
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,208
[FRIEZA growls]

193
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,541
[PICCOLO] Hit the dirt!

194
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:02,875
No! That's...

195
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,791
impossible!

196
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:17,166
[FRIEZA growling]

197
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,750
[FRIEZA grunting]

198
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,041
[FRIEZA] I.. can't control it!

199
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,625
I-It's too powerful!

200
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,000
[grunting continues]

201
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:02,375
[FRIEZA screams]

202
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:20,708
[FRIEZA grunting]

203
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:28,833
[FRIEZA grunting]

204
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,375
[FRIEZA screams]

205
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,583
[FRIEZA screams]

206
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,708
[GOHAN grunts]

207
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,833
[KRILLIN screams]

208
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,291
[GOHAN screams]

209
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,333
[GOKU screams]

210
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,791
[PICCOLO screams]

211
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,166
[BULMA screams]

212
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,041
[GINYU screams]

213
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,041
[BULMA screams]

214
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,166
[BULMA] Help me, please!

215
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,625
[GINYU grunts]

216
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,375
[KING KAI] Hmm?! I'm
getting something!

217
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,291
[BOTH] Huh?

218
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:32,375
[KING KAI whimpers]

219
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,000
It finally
happened...

220
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,500
Goku defeated Frieza...

221
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,833
Goku has defeated Frieza!

222
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,833
Woo-hoo! Frieza's been defeated!

223
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,625
Goku has defeated Frieza!
Ha, ha, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

224
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,666
So, he really
pulled it off!

225
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,541
You think the old kook
is telling the truth?

226
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,000
I'd say he's nuts!

227
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,583
Impossible!

228
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,333
Hurray for Goku!

229
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,750
Yeah, I second
that, Chiaotzu!

230
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,208
I knew he'd win!

231
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,583
Hey, Krillin!

232
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,958
[GOHAN laughs]

233
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,416
[KRILLIN] Thank goodness
you're safe!

234
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,500
You too!

235
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,541
So, Krillin, do you
think Frieza survived?

236
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,958
Hope not!

237
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,208
[GOHAN] Where's Piccolo?

238
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,583
And where's... my Dad?!

239
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:37,458
[NARRATOR] Finally Goku's
Spirit Bomb has done it's job!

240
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,708
Or has it?

241
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,458
Has Frieza been
totally destroyed?

242
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:45,291
And did the explosion
take out Piccolo and Goku?

243
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:49,125
Find out who survives, in
the next exciting episode of...

244
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,208
Dragon Ball Z!
