00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,208
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,458
Gohan gave Garlic Jr.
quite a beating.

3
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,333
And Krillin put him through
plenty of pain as well.

4
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,583
But with Piccolo see-sawing
between strength and weakness,

5
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,916
the evil giant
regained the upper hand.

6
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,333
In the resting place
of guardians past,

7
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,250
Kami took care
of the distraction

8
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,791
while Mr. Popo handled
the Sacred Water.

9
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,583
And the precious water
was spread over the earth,

10
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,708
to negate the horrible effect
of the Black Water Mist.

11
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,666
My plan!

12
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,500
[NARRATOR] Garlic Jr. was
incensed by this latest attempt

13
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,458
to foil his dark plans.

14
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,125
And in a terrible rage,
he decided to pull out

15
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,333
all the stops and
reopen the Dead Zone.

16
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,541
A horrible void of darkness
that sucks people into it

17
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,625
like a vacuum and
holds them in a timeless,

18
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,416
spaceless prison forever.

19
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,791
The Dead Zone
will swallow you up

20
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,333
and keep you for all eternity!

21
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,875
There's no escape!

22
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,458
[NARRATOR] With Piccolo's
power waning

23
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,166
and Krillin
weakened from battle,

24
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,041
it was up to Gohan
to protect them

25
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,458
from the deadly suction
of the Dead Zone!

26
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,375
But how long can the
little warrior hold on?

27
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,708
Find out, today!

has reopened the Dead Zone!

It won't be long now!

00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,750
That little pimple
of a shield is going to pop

70

and the three of you
are going to ooze into

[KRILLIN] Oh, man! This is it!

75
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,208
We've got to
think of something fast!

76
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,625
Gohan! Don't give in!

77
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:14,083
We need all the time
that we can get!

78

No... Gohan... Makyo Star!

00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,541
Huh?

81
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,166
Look! Blow up the Makyo Star!

82
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,708
It's the source of his power!

83
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,250
[KRILLIN] But he's barely
able to hold the shield!

I don't know, Piccolo...

That plan sounds
half baked to me...

No, it's fully baked.
It's the only way!

Uh, yeah, but-- Shoot!

we're goners!

264
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,708
Yeah, well, thanks for blowing
up the Makyo Star, kid.

265
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,041
Because of you, Garlic
shriveled up like a raisin.

266
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,958
I see! So the lion's
share of his energy

267
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,958
was actually coming
from the Makyo Star!

268
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,708
Well, I'll be a green,
pointy-eared monkey's uncle!

269
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,583
With the star gone,
he's through!

00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,458
I hope he can learn
to like the Dead Zone...

00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,833
...since he's now
a permanent resident.

272
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,583
Piccolo! We did it ourselves!

273
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,833
We didn't even
need my dad this time!

274
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,583
We needed your dad
very much, kid!

275
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,208
And he was here the whole time!

276
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,666
What? Are you sure?

277
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,291
Of course I'm sure! He was
here, inside of you, Gohan!

278
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,833
Hey, Piccolo?

279
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,000
[PICCOLO] Yes?

280
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,458
Gosh... you're such
an incredible friend.

281
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,250
[PICCOLO] You too,
Gohan. You too...

282
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:59,000
[GOHAN chuckles]

283
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,916
[PICCOLO] He's okay.
He just needs a little rest.

284
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,541
[PICCOLO] Sleep well,
Gohan. I'm proud of you.

285
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,500
[NARRATOR] And so the planet
Earth was back to normal again.

286
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,083

restoring his damaged house.

[OOLONG screams]

288

[NARRATOR] Krillin and Maron
traded-in for a convertible,

289
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,583
Gohan was being more
closely guarded than ever,

290
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:40,083
and Piccolo resumed his solitary
life of training and meditation.

291
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,458
And though he didn't
accept Kami's offer

292
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,500
to officially take over
as guardian of the Earth,

293
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,416
you can rest assured
that not much escapes

294
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,791
from Piccolo's
ever-watchful gaze.
