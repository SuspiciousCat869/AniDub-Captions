1
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,833
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,583
With no more
battles to fight,

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,416
Goku had settled
into a peaceful life

4
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,291
with Chichi
and his new son!

5
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,458
[GOHAN]
I'm Gohan.

6
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,125
[NARRATOR] But peaceful
though it may be,

7
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,375
life in the countryside
is anything but quiet!

8
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:33,291
The woods can be a dangerous
place for a young boy alone.

9
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,875
Fortunately for Gohan,

10
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,083
his father is one of the
strongest men in the world!

11
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,375
And Goku was there
in the nick of time

12
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,125
to pull his son
from harm's way.

13
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,625
But even as father and son
braved the perils of the woods,

14
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,000
little did they know,

15
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,750
a far greater threat was
descending upon the Earth!

16
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,333
An alien spacecraft
fell from the skies,

17
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:59,416
carrying aboard an unexpected,
and most unwelcome, visitor.

18
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,791
Piccolo was the first

19
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,208
to meet this mysterious
invader face-to-face.

20
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,916
And the extent of the
alien's power was revealed.

21
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,500
Despite being one of the
mightiest fighters on Earth,

22
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,666
Piccolo's awesome energy
attack had little effect.

23
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,375
[RADITZ] You actually managed
to singe one of my leg hairs.

24
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,958
Impressive!

25
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,125
[NARRATOR] Though powerless to
defend himself against this foe,

26
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,750
Piccolo's life was spared
when the alien sped away

27
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,250
to continue his search...

28
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,166
A search for a man
named Kakarot...

29
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,375
[thunder]

30
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,250
[RADITZ] You are a discredit
to your race, Kakarot!

31
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,000
But when I find
you I'll teach you

32
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,208
what it means
to be a Saiyan!

33
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,208
Kakarot!!

34
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,041
[BULMA]
Hello!

35
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:04,916
Hey, you guys!

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,166
Hey!

37
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,416
Bulma!

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,916
Wow! It sure has been
a long time, hasn't it?

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,041
Yep! But look at you!
You're as beautiful as ever!

40
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,666
Oh, you men...
You're impossible!

41
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,166
I guess you forgot about
my truffles, though.

42
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,125
Oh well, that's okay.
I'll forgive you.

43
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:22,958
[BULMA]
Surprise!

44
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,041
Aahh!

45
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,875
[BULMA] See?
I didn't forget!

46
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,208
Heh! Goodness, you're
gonna spoil this old man.

47
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:33,791
I'm so happy right now. Heh! 
I could just squeeze ya!

48
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,125
[ROSHI groans]

49
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,208
Hey, I was just
trying to say thanks!

50
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,833
[BULMA thinking] Why did I
think he could ever change?

51
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,541
[GOHAN] Whoa-ho-ho!

52
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,041
[GOKU laughs]

53
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,375
[GOHAN]
Oh, wow!

54
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,625
Yay!

55
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:58,166
Hey so, eh.. what's Yamcha
been up to these days, Bulma?

56
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,541
Oh that idiot! I don't even
want to think about him!

57
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,666
He made me so mad,
I didn't even tell him

58
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,041
we were going to
be here today!

59
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,875
I never want to see him again!
We're finished!

60
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,500
I mean, can you believe it?
He went out with another girl!

61
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,750
Breaking up
is hard to do.

62
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,416
I wouldn't
know...

63
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,041
So, where's
Goku at?

64
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,500
[KRILLIN] Well, he said
he was gonna be here.

65
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,916
I guess he's on his way.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wow...

67
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,416
[ROSHI] Hey, Krillin,
leave me some!

68
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,875
[beeping]

69
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,583
[RADITZ thinking] This power
moves with great speed!

70
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,916
But not fast enough...

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,083
[RADITZ chuckles]

72
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,125
[GOKU]
Here we are, Gohan!

73
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:43,250
[RADITZ] Kakarot!
You cannot escape me!

74
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,500
Hey! Is anyone home?

75
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,791
[BULMA and KRILLIN]
Huh? Ah!

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,041
[RADITZ thinking]
Hm? It stopped!

77
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,166
Goku!

78
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,041
[BULMA and KRILLIN laugh]

79
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:55,708
Hi!

80
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,666
Hey, who's the kid?

81
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,041
You tryin' to earn some extra
cash babysitting, or somethin'?

82
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,750
He's my son.

83
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,416
[ROSHI] Your son?

84
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,833
Pretty wild, huh?

85
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:07,750
[KRILLIN] Wow...

86
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,833
[BULMA] Oh Goku,
he's adorable!

87
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,708
Gohan, say hi.

88
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,416
[GOHAN]
Hello, everyone.

89
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,916
--[KRILLIN] Hi! 
--[BULMA] Oh, hello!

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,250
[GOKU] This is Gohan.

91
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,791
Gohan? I see...

92
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,041
You named him after your
grandfather, did ya?

93
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,458
[GOKU] Uh-huh!

94
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,250
[ROSHI] Well, that's wonderful.
He's a fine looking boy.

95
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,708
I'm sure your grandpa would
have been very proud.

96
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,958
[BULMA] Hey Gohan.
How old are you?

97
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,333
Um, uh, four and a half.

98
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,458
Are you gonna grow up to be a
brave fighter like your dad?

99
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,458
Well, ChiChi doesn't
let him train.

100
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,875
Huh? Oh...
No martial arts, huh?

101
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,791
So what do you want to be
when you grow up, Gohan?

102
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,541
An orthopedist.

103
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,791
Wow, uh...
An orthopedist, huh?

104
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,375
[GOKU] He's just
saying hi, Gohan.

105
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,375
Hm... A tail.

106
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,833
Yeah! He was born
with it, just like me!

107
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,166
I think he wants you
to pet him, Gohan.

108
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,916
[GOHAN chuckles]

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,458
Oh, man! Goku,
has anything, you know,

110
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,583
strange ever happened
to Gohan at night?

111
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,750
What do you mean?

112
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,666
She means, has Gohan ever
looked at the moon at night?

113
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,750
When it's full?

114
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,833
I don't think so...

115
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:19,916
[ROSHI] Hmm?!

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,541
No... We all go to
bed pretty early.

117
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,750
[GOHAN hums]

118
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,250
Uh, why?

119
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,125
[ROSHI] Wh-Why, you say?
Oh, no reason...

120
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,875
Heh, heh, heh! Uh, no
particular reason at all!

121
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,333
[KRILLIN] Well, uh... He sure
seems a lot different

122
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,916
than you were when
you were a kid, Goku.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,875
I know.

124
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,583
ChiChi can be pretty
overprotective

125
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,125
when it
comes to Gohan.

126
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,666
She makes him study
all the time,

127
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,791
and she says martial arts
are a waste of energy.

128
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,416
[GOHAN] Three... Go!

129
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,916
Oh, yeah? Then what
does that make us, then?

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,041
[GOKU] Huh?

131
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,958
[ROSHI] Now, now.
Settle down boys.

132
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,708
You can't expect
everyone to agree

133
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,833
with what
you're doing.

134
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,708
It would be all
too easy, then!

135
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,833
[GOHAN laughs]

136
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,541
[ROSHI laughs]

137
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,750
Watch out! He might
pinch you, Gohan!

138
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,791
That crab's a
mighty sore loser!

139
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,375
[GOHAN giggles]

140
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,916
[BULMA]
Oh, how neat.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,833
That's a real Dragon Ball on
your hat, isn't it? Isn't it?

142
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,833
Yep. The
four-star ball.

143
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,375
It took me a
while to find it,

144
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,833
but I wanted
Gohan to have it

145
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,333
since it used to belong
to my grandfather.

146
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,291
I've been collecting 
Dragon Balls for fun.

147
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,375
I've got the three-star ball,
and the six-star ball too.

148
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,375
They're at home.

149
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,416
Wow. you know,
it's wild to think

150
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,166
of all the crazy
adventures we used to have

151
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,083
trying to find
those things.

152
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,750
[KRILLIN] Yeah, really...

153
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,500
So, Goku, what are
you guys gonna wish for

154
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,791
when you get
all seven?

155
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,666
[GOKU] I don't know, Krillin.
That's a good question.

156
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,333
Come to think of it, I
don't really want anything.

157
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,583
--[KRILLIN] Whoa!
--[BULMA] Oh, wow!

158
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,458
[ROSHI thinking] Hmm...
I thought Goku had less power

159
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,375
now that he settled down.

160
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,291
[KRILLIN] You're still
one bad dude, Goku!

161
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,291
[KRILLIN]
What is it?

162
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,625
[ROSHI]
What, Goku?

163
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,625
There's something bad
heading straight for us...

164
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,791
[BULMA] What?
Are you sure, Goku?

165
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,958
[GOKU]
I'm positive.

166
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,291
I've never felt a power
like this before.

167
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,750
Yeah, I feel
it now, too...

168
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,083
There's nothing
there, you guys.

169
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,625
[GOKU thinking]
What is it?

170
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,875
I've never sensed anything
like this before.

171
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,875
Such an...
An awful power!

172
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,583
[GOKU]
Look! There!

173
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,458
[ROSHI] Oh, yes!
I see it, Goku!

174
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,625
[GOKU]
Who is that?

175
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,291
It's not Piccolo, is it?

176
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,583
[RADITZ laughs]

177
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,000
[ROSHI thinking]
This isn't good.

178
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,291
I smell death in the air.

179
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,083
[RADITZ chuckles]

180
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,791
[RADITZ] So, we meet
again at last...

181
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,375
You've grown up.

182
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,750
Ah!

183
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,458
I recognize you,
though, Kakarot.

184
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,166
Kak-a-rot?

185
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,375
That's right.
That's your name.

186
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,250
Uh?!

187
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,083
[BULMA] His name?

188
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,958
Who is this?
You must be nuts.

189
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,458
Kakarot! What have you been
doing here all these years?

190
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,041
Your mission was to terminate
all life on this planet!

191
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,625
Why haven't you
carried it out?

192
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,708
Listen, mister...
I don't know who you are,

193
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,916
but you've obviously
got the wrong guy!

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,750
[RADITZ chuckles]

195
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:13,250
Shoo! Shoo! I think you've
been dippin in the egg nog.

196
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,958
Allow me to escort 
you off this the island.

197
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,375
Krillin, watch out!

198
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,708
[KRILLIN yells]

199
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,333
Krillin!

200
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,916
Ahh! A tail?

201
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,166
[RADITZ chuckles]

202
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,250
[GOKU] I don't believe it!
He's got a tail, too!

203
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,625
That's good.

204
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,916
I wondered how long it would
take you to recognize me.

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,083
What are you--I...
I've never seen you before!

206
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,416
[BULMA] Gohan!

207
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,666
[RADITZ]
Kakarot!

208
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,875
You mean to tell me you
have no idea who I am?

209
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,583
I don't know who this 'Kakarot'
person is you're looking for,

210
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,916
but I'm not him!
My name's Goku!

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,083
What happened
to you?

212
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,083
[BULMA]
Ah! Gohan! No!

213
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,750
[GOHAN] Daddy!

214
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,416
[GOKU]
Gohan, get back!

215
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,666
[RADITZ] Kakarot!

216
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,166
Tell me... Did you ever
suffer a serious injury

217
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,666
to the head when
you were young?

218
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,750
[ROSHI] Hmm...

219
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,250
What?

220
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,083
[RADITZ] When you were a kid
did you ever hit your head?

221
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,666
[GOKU] Gohan!

222
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,708
Did you hear me?!

223
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,750
Yeah!

224
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,250
I don't remember it very well,

225
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,750
but you're right, I did hit
my head when I was a child.

226
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,583
[RADITZ snarls]

227
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,583
[GOKU] I still have a scar
where it happened.

228
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,875
You stupid fool..
You forgot!

229
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,833
I forgot what?
Tell me!

230
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,708
[ROSHI] Goku?

231
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,166
There's something...

232
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,875
Something your
grandfather once told me

233
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,791
that I think you
should know...

234
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,333
Long ago, your grandpa Gohan
was walking through the woods

235
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,708
when he came
upon a crater

236
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,916
that had been recently
made in the ground.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,083
When he went to examine
it more closely,

238
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,500
he found what appeared to be
some sort of spaceship.

239
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,625
And next to it...
There you were.

240
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,583
Lying in a little
round pod.

241
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,000
Gohan tried to take care
of you, but you were wild,

242
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,625
downright uncontrollable,

243
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,458
and unusually
powerful for a baby.

244
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,583
You wanted nothing to do
with Gohan's kindnesses.

245
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:37,333
Then one day, there was
a terrible accident...

246
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,750
You fell into a deep ravine
and badly injured your head.

247
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,000
Your grandfather feared
that he had lost you.

248
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:48,458
But somehow, miraculously,
you survived.

249
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,583
Yes, any other child
would have died,

250
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,041
but you recovered.

251
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:56,500
And from that day on, you
became a happy, loving boy.

252
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,416
I'm from outer space?

253
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
[ROSHI] Yes.

254
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,541
Well, that would
explain a lot...

255
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,875
So you think Goku has some
connection with this guy?

256
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,333
[ROSHI] 
I wish I knew...

257
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,958
Okay. You've got
my attention.

258
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,375
Now tell us
who you are!

259
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,916
Well, I wasn't expecting
to give a history lesson

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,708
when I came
here today...

261
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,541
But all right...
I'll tell you everything.

262
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,666
After all, you are going to
be working for me from now on,

263
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,833
and I do like my subordinates
to be well informed.

264
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,333
Hey, Krillin...
You alright?

265
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,708
Yeah, be careful Goku.
This guy's not normal.

266
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,916
Mm-hm. Believe me, I know...

267
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,791
I could sense that from
the minute he landed.

268
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,750
Even now, standing here
talking to him like this...

269
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,083
Something about him
turns my stomach.

270
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,958
Such harsh words...

271
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:55,458
Careful. You're more like
me than you realize.

272
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,208
You were born on
the planet Vegeta...

273
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,625
You are a space fighter,
a Saiyan warrior...

274
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,916
Just like me.

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,750
Aah!

276
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,166
Wha?

277
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,500
[ROSHI]
Goku...

278
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,375
Allow me to
introduce myself.

279
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,750
I'm Raditz...
Your big brother.

280
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,458
Goku has a...
a brother?

281
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,625
Goku...
He looks like you!

282
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,625
Why should I
believe you?

283
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,833
Yeah, that's right!

284
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,500
What the heck is Goku
doing on Earth

285
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,875
if he's from
another planet?

286
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,875
[RADITZ laughs]

287
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,250
[RADITZ]
That's simple...

288
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,833
We sent him here.

289
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,500
Kakarot was given specific
orders to clear this world

290
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,875
of its current
inhabitants...

291
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,750
A mission which he
has failed miserably.

292
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,208
[GOKU] Huh?

293
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:48,875
You see, we Saiyans are sort
of like... Planet brokers.

294
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,958
We scour space
for planets

295
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,583
that will bring a high price
on the galactic market.

296
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,666
Once we find them,
we send our warriors there

297
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:03,541
to purge them of any life
and make them ready for sale.

298
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,250
It's a very, very
profitable business.

299
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,708
And we take great pride at
being efficient in our work.

300
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,750
For example, if we
discover a planet

301
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,208
with strong
inhabitants,

302
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,291
we send a team of our adult
fighters to wipe them out.

303
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,041
But for planets full of
weaklings like this one,

304
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,125
one of our babies is
generally sufficient

305
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,250
to carry out
the order.

306
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,708
If what you say
is true,

307
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,291
you Saiyans are
just an abomination!

308
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,791
You're space pirates!
That's what you are!

309
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,708
How can you send little babies
off into space all alone?

310
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,833
[RADITZ] Trust me,
they're more than capable

311
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,583
of looking
after themselves...

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,625
Well, most of them.

313
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,291
Kakarot,
you're a disgrace!

314
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,166
You could have easily wiped
out every living thing

315
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,625
on this planet
by yourself.

316
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,208
If you hadn't
forgotten your orders,

317
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,875
it would have only have taken
you a year or two at the most.

318
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,125
Especially considering this
planet has a nice, big moon.

319
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,416
Uh!

320
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,875
Yeah, lemme guess,

321
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,916
I was probably supposed
to blow that up, too...

322
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,375
You fool! You know
as well as I do,

323
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,375
it's the key to unlocking
your true potential!

324
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,875
I'm sure at least
once in your life

325
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,291
you've looked at
the full moon...

326
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:16,708
[roaring]

327
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,625
I don't know what
you're talking about.

328
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,375
[RADITZ]
Ah! Aaahh!

329
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,250
Wh-What happened
to your tail, Kakarot?

330
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,916
[GOKU]
My tail? Why?

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,625
Answer me! Now!

332
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,583
It was removed permanently
a long time ago!

333
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,291
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

334
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,625
Your true power
is gone now!

335
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,125
Without your tail,

336
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,625
you've lost your ability to
transform at the full moon!

337
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,000
Now I can see how you
can be on good terms

338
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,666
with these weaklings...

339
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,875
Listen! This is my home!
And these are my friends!

340
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,083
So it doesn't matter
what you say I am!

341
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:58,333
And you sure don't act like
any brother I'd wanna have.

342
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,250
My name is Goku
and I live here!

343
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,625
Now leave us alone!

344
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,416
[BULMA] 
Yeah! Just go!

345
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,916
Even if you
are brothers,

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,833
that doesn't mean Goku has
to destroy peaceful planets

347
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,791
like you do,
you big creep!

348
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,000
Right! Goku even saved
this planet once, mister!

349
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,458
So, go away!

350
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,875
[RADITZ chuckles]

351
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,250
[RADITZ] So baby brother
wants to be left alone...

352
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, it's a pity that's
not going to happen.

353
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,458
No, at this point I'm afraid
you're far too valuable

354
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,916
to us for that...

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,916
You see, three years ago,
our home planet, Vegeta,

356
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,375
met with an
unfortunate accident

357
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:38,583
when a huge comet slammed
into its surface.

358
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:43,333
The planet was vaporized and
the Saiyan race destroyed.

359
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:47,625
There's not too many of
us left now, brother.

360
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,791
In fact...

361
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:54,041
As far as we can tell, there
are only four... including you.

362
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,958
We were the only
Saiyans away from home

363
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,916
when the
planet exploded...

364
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,833
Like you, the rest of
us had been sent off

365
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:05,166
to perform a few
'hostile takeovers.'

366
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,958
And now we've found another
world we'd like to conquer.

367
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,875
It should bring in
a very high price.

368
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,666
But unfortunately,
the job's a little too big

369
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,041
for only three
of us to handle.

370
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,250
We were almost afraid
we'd have to pass it up...

371
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,750
Until I remembered
you, Kakarot.

372
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,166
You're not as powerful as I
might have hoped, but still,

373
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,958
with your help we
should manage nicely.

374
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:34,041
Well now, what do you
think? Are you excited?

375
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:39,833
You should be... I've come to
take you back into the fold.

376
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,083
I've heard enough!

377
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,500
[RADITZ] Heh!

378
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:46,500
I'd die before I'd join a
gang of pirates like you!

379
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,791
Interesting.

380
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,333
I have been meaning
to ask you, Kakarot...

381
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,375
I couldn't help but notice
your son has a tail.

382
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,875
[GOKU]
Leave him out of this!

383
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,666
[RADITZ]
I'll decide that!

384
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,291
If you won't join us...

385
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,708
I suppose I'll just
have to settle

386
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,666
for taking the boy
in your place.

387
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,750
[BULMA yells]

388
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,708
[KRILLIN] Goku?

389
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,875
We'll see... Hya!

390
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,000
I see the fire in
your eyes, brother.

391
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,416
You should come with us!

392
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,833
It's in your blood...
You love to fight.

393
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,458
Now...

394
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,833
[KRILLIN] I'm right
here with you, Goku.

395
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,458
Just stay close
to Gohan.

396
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,166
[ROSHI]
Watch him, Goku...

397
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,875
Ahh!

398
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,583
[GOKU groans]

399
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,916
[GOHAN]
Ah! Daddy!

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,750
--[KRILLIN] Goku!
--[ROSHI] Are you okay?

401
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,166
[BULMA] Gohan, no!

402
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,458
[RADITZ laughs]

403
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,375
[gasps]

404
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,458
[GOHAN] Hey!

405
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,375
Like I said...
I'm taking your son...

406
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,625
If you ever want to
see him alive again,

407
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,916
I suggest you
listen closely!

408
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,625
[GOHAN cries]

409
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,291
Come on Goku.
You have to get up!

410
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,333
[GOKU grunts]

411
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,833
Now then, I'll give you one
day to think about my offer.

412
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,458
Although, let's be
realistic, Kakarot.

413
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,208
I'm not giving you a choice.

414
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:41,291
So, when you decide to
join us and you will...

415
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,000
There's something
I want you to do...

416
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,083
Prove to me that
you mean it...

417
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,625
You can start
by eliminating

418
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,291
100 of these
pathetic earthlings.

419
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,625
Just stack them here on
the beach when you're done.

420
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,333
I'll be back tomorrow
for a head count.

421
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,833
[GOHAN whimpers]

422
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,458
[RADITZ] So what do
you say, Kakarot?

423
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,916
I do hope you'll come
through for me on this one.

424
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,541
After all,
he's my nephew.

425
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,625
It would be a shame
if I had to hurt him.

426
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,458
Aahh! Help, daddy,
I'm scared! Aaahh!

427
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,416
[GOKU grunts]

428
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,541
[GOKU] G-Gohan...

429
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,208
Aahh! Help me! Aahh!

430
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:36,083
[RADITZ laughs]

431
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,166
[NARRATOR] The unthinkable
has happened...

432
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,708
Gohan has fallen into the
clutches of the evil Raditz!

433
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,583
And against his older
brother's incredible strength,

434
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,250
is there anything Goku
can do to rescue his son?

435
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:54,250
The outlook is grim, in the
next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
