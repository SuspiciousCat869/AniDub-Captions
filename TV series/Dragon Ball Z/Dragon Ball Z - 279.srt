00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,958
[NARRATOR] On the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,250
Majin Buu was on a manhunt
for Goku and Vegeta,

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,958
and when his search led him
to the great Kai Planet,

4
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,750
life in Other World took
a turn for the worse.

[grunts]

7
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,125
[NARRATOR] Vegeta wanted to
lure Buu away from the planet

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,875
before he destroyed it,
but Goku wasn't sure how.

9
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,166
[VEGETA]
Oh, use your brain, Kakarot.

10
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,708
All we have to do is
raise our power levels,

11
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,000
and he'll come running.

12
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,333
Of course!

13
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,250
Right!

14
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,375
Buu squash you like bugs!

15
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,166
[NARRATOR] Hearing their call,
Buu didn't waste a moment,

16
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,291
but went directly to the sacred
land of the Supreme Kai,

17
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,166
where the battle is
about to begin!

18

[ALL gasp]

20
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,333
[chuckles] How perfect!
We can fight as we like here.

21
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,250
[GOKU]
Hm.

22
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,541
Please leave now, you guys.

23
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,541
If you try to stay, you'll
only be helping Majin Buu.

24
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,958
[KIBITO KAI]
What?

25
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,250
[GOKU] Sorry, but we can't fight
to our full potential

26
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,208
if we're worried
about your safety.

27
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,791
Oh yeah, I understand now.

28
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,166
I know what's going on here!

29
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,583
Sure, you're thinking
that our sacred planet

30
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,250
is going to be demolished
during the fight.

31
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,416
Oh well, kick some
butt, you two.

32
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,750
Thanks, Old Kai.

33
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,875
Do your best, Vegeta,
and you, too, Goku!

34
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,625
[VEGETA chuckles]

35
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,875
[DENDE thinking]
Goku...

36
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,250
Grab a hold of me, you two.

37
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,250
I believe it's time
for us to go.

38
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,166
[OLD KAI]
I don't know about this!

39
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,416
You'll be just fine.

41
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,416
Where are we?

42
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,041
I've transported us to a
planet in the physical plane,

43
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,541
quite far from the action
is taking place.

44
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,041
We'll be safe here.

45
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,125
[OLD KAI] You could've picked
a place with shorter grass.

46
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,708
Oh well, too late!

47
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,083
Those Saiyans
are a stubborn lot!

48
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,333
Why did they have to destroy
those earrings we gave them?

49
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:07,375
I guess they plan on using the
Fusion Technique to fight Buu.

50
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,458
But can they get the
job done in half an hour?

51
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:15,416
Well... I doubt it, but at
least they'll have a chance.

52
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,833
Hey, we should
probably decide now,

53
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,000
while we still have
a spare minute.

54
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,375
[VEGETA] Right! How are
we going to do it?

55
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,333
[GOKU] I guess we'll try
the old fashioned way.

56
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,916
[VEGETA] All right, Kakarot,
you're asking for it.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,750
[GOKU]
We'll see about that!

58
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,208
[GOKU, VEGETA]
Rock! Paper!

59

Rock! Paper! Scissors! Haa!

61
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,291

[groans]

63
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
That's not the Fusion Technique!

64
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,333
Those idiots! What in the
world are they doing?!

65
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,958
Have they finally gone mad?

66
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,666
[VEGETA]
Yeah, you beat me, Kakarot,

67
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,208
but there's a good chance
that I'll get my turn anyway!

68
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,666
Gee, thanks,

69
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,708
but if you wanted a turn,
you should have chose paper!

70
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,791
[GOKU]
The fact of the matter is,

71
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,125
I probably could have
destroyed the fat Majin Buu

72
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,416
when I was at
Super Saiyan Three,

73
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,833
but I wanted Gohan and
the boys to try their hand

74
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,500
at saving the world.

75
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,666
I won't be around forever.

76
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,208
And, neither will he, hopefully.

77
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:30,291
All right, Buu! Let's do it!

78
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,541
What's the deal?
Did he drop something?

79
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,375

No, this can't go on anymore!

The planet you're seeing

109
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,833
is the sacred land of the Kais,
the abode of Supreme Kai.

time reaching that place!

I doubt Buu would have ever
found that planet on his own.

113

Wow. This is good.

163
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:16,208
This is great!
The best I've seen!

164
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,041
Northy, isn't that
the guy named Goku

165
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,541
who trained here not long ago?

166
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,041
Yep! That's him!

167
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,250
The same fighter who beat
Pikkon in the big tournament.

168
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,916
He's gotten a lot stronger
since then though, as you see.

169
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,958
Who's in pink?

170
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,416
Silly, that's Buu.

171
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,833
You faught him yourself
a long time ago, remember?

172
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,750
Hello? He was wreaking
havoc all over the Universe?

173
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,791
Total destruction, a mess!

[yells]

175
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,625
You've got to be
kidding me! That's him?!

176
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,333
That's Bibidi's mad man?!

177
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,625
He's been revived again?!
This is terrible!

178
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,333
[KING KAI]
Mm-hm.

179
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,875
We're lucky to
be alive right now.

180
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,000
No offense, Pikkon,
but he's a lot stronger.

It's true!

Okay, on to Plan B,
whatever that is.

Where are you, Kakarot?

Majin Buu is too strong!

I don't wanna see
Goku get hurt!

[OLD KAI] Now, now,
I wouldn't count Goku out yet!

That's not the look
of a desperate man.

217
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,541
That's the face
of a true champion!

Darn you!
Where's your weak point?

You're twice as strong
