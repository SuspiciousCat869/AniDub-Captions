00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,875
the kettle was boiling over
on the Planet Namek!

3
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,333
The Nameks' home planet
had been severely damaged

4
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:27,083
by a blast from Frieza and it
was due to explode any minute.

5
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,625
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Frieza was struggling

6
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,416
to gather enough
energy to achieve

7
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,291
his maximum power level;

8
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,333
one hundred percent of
his true potential.

9
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:44,333
[FRIEZA growls]

10
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:50,541
[FRIEZA yells]

11
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,791
Frieza, let's do this
while we're still young!

12
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,333
[NARRATOR] And the
final battle began:

13
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:11,250
The ultimate Frieza against
Goku, the mighty Super Saiyan.

14
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,291
[NARRATOR] But it
appeared that Frieza

15
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,291
had regained the upper-hand over
Goku now that he had attained

16
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,416
his maximum power level.

17
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,833
[blows landing,
GOKU grunting]

18
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,416
[NARRATOR] It was beginning to
seem as if King Kai was right:

19
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,166
That Goku had made a terrible
mistake by allowing Frieza

20
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,000
the time that he needed
to fully energize himself.

21
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,208
[FRIEZA yells]

22
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,041
[GOKU] Huh...?!

23
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,791
[FRIEZA yells]

24
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,125
[NARRATOR] Things were
looking grim indeed

25
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,541
for the mighty Saiyan.

26
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,166
[FRIEZA pants]

27
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,916
Well, fancy that!

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,250
One shot and he's
throwing in the towel.

29
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,458
Strike up a dirge!

30
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,250
[NARRATOR] But Goku
wasn't done just yet.

31
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,750
[GOKU] Don't get
too excited Frieza!

32
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,541
Because this battle
is far from over.

33
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,958
You're running out of time.

34
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,166
[GOKU] Don't worry!

35
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,291
What I have to do won't
take long, trust me!

36
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,666
[FRIEZA] You fool!

37
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,416
Do you really believe that?
Don't you understand?

38
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,666
I've won! Not you! Me!

39
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,125
Get it?

40
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,916
[FRIEZA yells]

41
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,333
[FRIEZA chuckles]

42
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,875
Superb! Really!

43
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,208
A very rare power indeed!

44
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,041
But I go on and on!

45
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,791
I am lord of the Universe!

46
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,375
Nothing can stop me!

47
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,875
Nothing! See?!

48
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,916
I remain untouched!

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,458
You! Them! You crumble! You die!

50
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,708
But I-- I live on!

51
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,208
[FRIEZA giggles]

52
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,125
[YAMCHA] King Kai,
what's the matter?

53
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,500
[TIEN] Something happened!

54
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,333
[CHIAOTZU] Tell us,
King Kai, please!

55
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:17,666
I-It's, uh, Goku... He's,
uh, running out of time!

56
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,250
I don't understand!

57
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,458
It didn't have
to end this way...

58
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,000
[KAMI] King Kai?

59
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,666
King Kai, are you there?

60
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,083
This is Kami.

61
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,375
Can you hear me?

62
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,458
[KING KAI growls]

63
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,375
[KING KAI] Yes, Kami!
I can hear you!

64
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,875
What is it now?

65
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,000
[KAMI] Uh, yes, pardon me, sir,

66
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,333
but I wanted to let
you know that Mr. Popo

67
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,666
has located the
seventh Dragon Ball

68
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,666
and that he should
have it shortly.

69
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,625
[KING KAI] Yes, and...?

70
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,666
[KAMI] Oh, uh,
yes, of course!

71
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,708
Let me get to the point:
I was wondering if I should use

72
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,250
the wish to bring Yamcha and
Tien back to this dimension.

73
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,041
[KING KAI] Oh! Yes, I see...

74
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,625
[KAMI] Unfortunately, Chiaotzu
can't be wished back

75
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,875
since he's already been revived
once by the Dragon Balls.

76
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,083
[KING KAI] Oh, yeah...

77
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,625
[CHIAOTZU groans sadly]

78
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,875
[TIEN] Chiaotzu...

79
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,208
It's no big deal, right?

80
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,458
Huh?

81
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,666
H-Hey!

82
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,625
No worries, I'm stayin'!

83
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,666
I wouldn't take off without you!

84
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,958
No way! You can't!

85
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,500
You have to go!

86
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,958
Hey, he doesn't have to go
anywhere, and neither do I!

87
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you nuts?

88
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,000
You've got a
sweetheart back home!

89
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,291
Bulma! Remember?

90
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,958
Uh, yeah, you're right...

91
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,500
Uhh... Yo!

92
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,958
Hey, yo! Hey, yo!

93
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,458
[KAMI] U-uhh yes,
King Kai, I'm still here.

94
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,541
[KING KAI] Kami, you said
that Tien and Yamcha

95
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,041
could be wished back.

96
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,875
Does that mean that more than
one person can be revived

97
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,250
with these Dragon Balls
at the same time?

98
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,416
[KAMI] Of course, as long
as they perished

99
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,083
under some common circumstance,
they certainly can.

100
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,583
[KING KAI] Ahh, yes, very good.

101
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,500
Okay, okay, lemme
get this straight:

102
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,333
So if we asked the Dragon to
restore all of those who were

103
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,708
killed by Vegeta, for
instance, would it work?

104
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,791
[KAMI] Uhh, well,
yes, it should.

105
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,458
But only for those
who were killed

106
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,708
within a year's time at most.

107
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,291
[KING KAI] I see!

108
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,375
And that doesn't just
apply to those from Earth,

109
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,333
but includes people from
other planets as well?

110
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,041
[KAMI] I think so...

111
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,958
I don't see any reason
why it wouldn't.

112
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,458
[KING KAI] Good!

113
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,750
Now, Kami, this is the most
important question of all:

114
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,958
What if a mother lost her
children at the hands of Vegeta,

115
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:32,500
for instance, and her grief
caused her to pass away, too?

116
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:36,791
Now if we wished back all of
those who were killed by Vegeta,

117
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,041
would her life be
restored as well since

118
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:44,416
Vegeta's actions were the direct
cause of her passing away?

119
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,458
[KAMI] Mm... Oh, dear me...

120
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,083
[KAMI] Gosh, King Kai, I'm
not at all sure about that one.

121
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,666
We've never had a case
like that before...

122
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,458
But I would say that there's
a very strong possibility

123
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,625
that she, too, would
be restored to life.

124
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,708
[KING KAI] I see...

125
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,500
[TIEN] Are you
alright, King Kai?

126
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,541
Yes! I'm fine!

127
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,166
Now! Kami! Listen up, please!

128
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,500
[KAMI] Huh?! You
have a wish, King Kai?

129
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,125
Yes! To restore all
those killed by Frieza

130
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,125
and his gang
back to life!

131
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,583
Please work...

132
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,208
Man, this is crazy!

133
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,541
It's falling apart!

134
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,416
My gosh, this is scary!

135
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,000
This thing could
blow at any second!

136
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,708
This is bad! This
is gonna be the end!

137
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,791
Hey, think positive.

138
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,500
How dare you, you twerp!

139
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,833
You have no idea what
I've been through, do you?

140
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,041
It's been horrible!

141
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,708
Well, look on
the bright side.

142
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,750
[BULMA] Bright side?!

143
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:52,791
I've been chased
by dinosaurs,

144
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,583
I had my body stolen
by a crazy frog,

145
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,125
I was nearly crushed to
death, I have major B.O.,

146
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,125
and my legs are so bristly
I feel like a cactus!

147
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,791
So tell me: What's
the bright side?!

148
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:01,375
[GOHAN gasps]

149
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,416
[BULMA screams]

150
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,250
[BULMA] Gohan! Don't you
ever do that to me again!

151
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,958
You scared the life out of me!

152
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,916
[GOHAN] Look! There's
the bright side!

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,750
We made it to my Dad's ship!

154
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,333
And it's still
in one piece!

155
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,583
That's a miracle
if I ever saw one!

156
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,916
Alright! We're going
home! We made it!

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,375
Whoa! Ha!

158
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,000
[GOHAN] Uh, oh!
There goes the ship!

159
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,291
[BULMA] What do you mean "There
goes the ship"?! Do something!

160
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,500
Hey! Stop!

161
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,708
You can't just leave
without our permission!

162
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,375
As an expert on
destroying planets,

163
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,833
I'd say that you're
just about out of time.

164
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,166
Agreed?

165
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,625
And yet you're standing
there like a statue

166
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,125
waiting for me to
make the first move.

167
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,583
It doesn't make any sense.

168
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,833
The longer you wait,
the worse your chances are.

169
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,125
I know!
You're stalling,

170
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,333
giving those kids
a chance to escape.

171
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,791
That's it!

172
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,083
[FRIEZA giggles]

173
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,166
Well, that's okay.
They'll be my next targets.

174
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,708
It shouldn't be too hard to
track them down, should it?

175
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,166
Well, that depends.

176
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,666
If you're dead, it will be.

177
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,041
Huh?!

178
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,041
You're through! Done!

179
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,125
It all ends here!

180
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,625
[FRIEZA giggles]

181
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,541
You're the one
who's through!

182
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,958
Not me! Do you hear me?! You!

183
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,083
[thinking] Gohan, why
haven't you left yet

184
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,125
like I told you to?!

185
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,458
[FRIEZA yells]

186
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,166
Huh?!

187
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,625

00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,208
Huh?!

191
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,416
[FRIEZA grunts]

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,875

[FRIEZA growls]

00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,458
[FRIEZA] Super... Saiyan...

199
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,833
[KAMI] King Kai, I have
relayed your wish to Mr. Popo.

200
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,916
He's very close
to the seventh ball.

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,916
It won't be long now.

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,625
Thanks to Popo, we'll
soon have them all.

203
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,041
[KING KAI] Ah, very good!

204
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,250
Excellent, Kami! Nice work!

205
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,958
[KAMI] Thank you, King Kai!

206
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,791
Sir, If you don't mind my
asking, can you explain

207
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,541
the reasoning behind the wish?

208
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,750
[KING KAI] Yes, of course.
I know it's a little confusing.

209
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,375
But if we revive all of the
victims of Frieza and his gang,

210
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,458
then the Nameks will
all be brought back

211
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,375
and I think Guru will be too!

212
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,875
[KAMI] But I thought Guru
died of natural causes?

213
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,833
[KING KAI] No, Guru
died of a broken heart...

214
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,958
Such was the pain that he felt
over the loss of his people.

215
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,916
Frieza's handywork!

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,875
[KAMI] I see...

217
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,583
[KING KAI] Now,
when Guru returns,

218
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,083
then there will be one more
wish to be granted by the

219
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:33,958
Dragon of Namek because Gohan
and Krillin only used two!

220
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,208
Oh yeah, right! I see!

221
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,750
And that wish?

222
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,791
[KING KAI] That wish will be to
transport everyone on Namek

223
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,625
except Frieza to
the planet Earth!

224
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,875
And as a going away present,
we'll give the planet Namek

225
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,083
to Frieza which should
explode in his face

226
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:50,041
and blow him to smithereens
after everyone's gone!

227
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,791
Not bad!

228
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,916
It's brilliant,
but extremely risky!

229
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,708
[KING KAI] This plan
requires a great sacrifice

230
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,166
on your part, guys!

231
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,083
You'd have to stay here
at least a year longer!

232
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,333
I don't
have a choice...

233
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,958
Don't look at me.

234
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,041
Yeah, that's fine. No prob!

235
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,875
Bulma can wait a while!

236
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,666
Well, that's
three thumbs up!

237
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,750
I'm in! Sure!

238
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,708
[KING KAI]
Good!

239
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,458
Okay, Kami! It's unanimous!

240
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,666
Proceed as planned

241
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,125
and keep me informed
of Mr. Popo's progress!

242
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,708
As you know, timing is
everything in this venture!

243
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,375
[KAMI] You can rest assured that
we'll do everything we can

244
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,875
to get this done as as quickly
as possible, King Kai!

245
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,541
[BULMA] Gosh, I don't
know about this, Gohan!

246
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,208
Are you sure?

247
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,166
Yes, I'm sure. Hey, come on.

248
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,958
Okay... Here I come.

249
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,000
But I think I'm going to
stay over here by the door...

250
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,833
Whoaa...

251
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,333
[GOHAN] Gosh, I wonder why
all the lights are out...?

252
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,333
[BULMA] Whoaa!

253
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,583
Okay... I guess I'm in...

254
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,250
Okay. Now about those lights.

255
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,416
Please work...

256
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:33,125
Hey! We have power, Gohan!

257
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,583
Huh?!

258
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:42,375
[BULMA whimpers]

259
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,625
[BULMA screams]

260
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,541
Look, Gohan, look!

261
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,791
Right there! It's Piccolo!

262
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,583
Yeah, I know.

263
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,625
Oh, I get it! Gee, thanks!

264
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,416
Well, I'm not traveling
across the galaxy

265
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,750
with a shady character
like Piccolo on board!

266
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,291
Who do you think I am?

267
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,875
There's no telling
what he might do

268
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,000
once we're out in deep space
in the middle of nowhere!

269
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,500
There's just no way!

270
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:08,875
If he stays, you
can count me out!

271
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,000
But he's not bad,
he's good!

272
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:11,833
Really!

273
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,250
And that's the truth!

274
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,416
He's coming or we're
not going anywhere!

275

[BULMA gasps]

276
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,458
Now, look, Gohan.
Piccolo belongs here.

277
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,916
It's his home.

278
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,958
I doubt he even
wants to leave here.

279

[GOHAN growls]

280

R-Right! Nevermind!

[thinking] Oh, man!
This is just great!

282
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,041
How do I get myself into
these predicaments?

We're sinking even more!

That does it, Gohan!
We can't wait anymore!

300

Do you hear me?!

301
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,916
We need to get
out of here rght now!

302
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,375
Oh, my gosh!

303
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,916
[BULMA] Oh, man! Come on!

304
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,875
Huh?!

305
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,375
We're not
leaving, Bulma!

306
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,625
Not yet!

307
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,125
Please take
your hand away

308
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,458
or I'm going to bite
it as hard as I can.

309
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,458
He's my Dad! I love him!

310
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,458
Please, Bulma! I know he'd do
the same for you if he could!

311
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,666
Please, my Dad needs us!

312
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,208
He does!

00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,708
[BULMA] Alright, Gohan...

316
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,958
Two more minutes.

317
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,625
[GOHAN] Thank you, Bulma.

318
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,875
[KAMI] Piccolo, I'm very
proud of you, Piccolo.

319
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,833
But you have to try to
hang on a little bit longer.

320
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,333
They're counting on us now.

00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,500
Don't give up yet, son.

322
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,333
[KING KAI sighs]

323
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,625
[MR. POPO] Kami!

324
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,791
Kami, it's me, Popo,
can you hear me?

325
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,541
[KAMI] Loud and clear, Mr. Popo!

326
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,875
Go ahead!

327
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,208
I'm done, Kami.

328
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,916
They're all here!

329
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,458
All seven balls!

330
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,291
I'm waiting for your final word.

331
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,625
[KAMI] It's time, Popo.
Make the wish!

332
00:20:55,791 --> 00:21:07,500
[FRIEZA yells]

333
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,000
[FRIEZA growls]

334
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,250
Speak! Name your wish!

335
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,958
Say it now, and it
will be granted.

336
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,375
Yes, of course!

337
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,875
Can you please restore the
lives of all those killed

338
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,208
by Frieza and his gang?

339
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,958
Is it within your power
to grant this wish?

340
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:02,000
I... don't know.

341
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,083
[MR. POPO] It's very bad
that you don't know!

342
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,958
If you don't know, who does?

343
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,208
So many lives are
depending on this!

344
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,041
[SHENRON] I will try!

345
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:13,875
[KING KAI] This is it, guys!

346
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,541
All we can do now is pray.

347
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,250
[FRIEZA growls]

348
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,375
[GOKU] Frieza! You're through!

349
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,625
[NARRATOR] As the Eternal
Dragon tries to fulfill

350
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:36,500
Mr. Popo's wish, Goku and
Frieza are on a collision course

351
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,083
with one another.

352
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:42,916
Who will emerge victorious from
this battle of good versus evil?

353
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,458
[FRIEZA yells]

354
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,916
[GOKU growls]

355
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,791
[NARRATOR] Time is
of the essence...

356
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,833
The planet Namek
is about to explode

357
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,041
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
