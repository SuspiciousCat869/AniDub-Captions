00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,541
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,833
the evil wizard Babidi
was busy monitoring

3
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,625
the progress of Majin Buu,

4
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:22,208
the malevolent monster he plans
to unleash upon the Earth.

5
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,875
Once enough energy is collected,

6
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,791
the creature will be hatched
to destroy the planet.

7
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,083
But Babidi didn't count on
the Z Warriors dropping in

8
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,208
and spoiling his fiendish fun!

9
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:37,125
[NARRATOR] Goku and Gohan, along
with Vegeta and the Supreme Kai,

10
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,750
fought their way into
Babidi's spacecraft.

11
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,416
Now they must battle their way
through the multi-leveled ship

12
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,666
to get to the wizard.

13
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,916
But on each new level,
they must face one of

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,375
Babidi's fearsome fighters.

15
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,083
[NARRATOR]
It's not going to be easy...

16
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,041
Babidi is watching their every
move and gives his warriors

17
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:58,708
the advantage by casting spells
from deep inside his fortress.

18
00:02:58,791 --> 00:02:59,958
[PUI PUI]
Enough!

19
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,500
[NARRATOR]
His dirtiest trick by far

20
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,583
was changing level one
of his ship into the

21
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,625
home planet of the
warrior Pui Pui.

22
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,375
But that didn't stop the
awesome power of Vegeta.

23
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,458
He easily defeated his
hapless opponent

24
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,458
with a quick blast of
Super Saiyan strength.

25
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,625
[SUPREME KAI]
Now I see...

26
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,125
[NARRATOR]
And with level two open,

27
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,375
the good guys were ready to
face their next challenger.

28
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,833
So, I wonder who's
behind that door there?

29
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,291
Hope he's tough!

30
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,500
[NARRATOR] Goku doesn't know
what he's in for!

31
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,208
He's about to face
the vicious Yacon.

32
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,375
Can Goku get the gang
to the next level?

33
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,833
Or is he about to become
lunch for a monster

34
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,125
with an appetite
for Super Saiyans?

35
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,625
[YACON growls]

36
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,500
[roars]

37
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:45,166
[YACON roars]

38
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,541
[GOKU]
Ah... Ugh...

39
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,791
Wow! He sure is an ugly one!

40
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:57,666
[laughs] Oh, yummy!
Who do I eat first?!

41
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,250
Why'd I have to get this guy?

42
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,500
Sure, he's big... but he
kinda looks dumb to me...

43
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,666
[gasps]

44
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,125
I know that monster!

45
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,541
I know who he is.
His name is Yacon!

46
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,916
You've met him before?

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,375
That's right...

48
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,958
He is one of the most feared
creatures in the universe

49
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,750
and he is extremely strong!

50
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,583
I don't think Goku will be
able to beat him on his own.

51
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,291
[VEGETA]
Hmph.

52
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,791
[BABIDI laughs]
That's it, Yacon!

53
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:29,250
Now, get his energy!
Give it to me!

54
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,375
Then we'll bring Majin Buu
back to life.

55
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,708
[BABIDI laughs]

56
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:41,416
[YACON chuckles]

57
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,375
[growls]

58
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,833
[GOKU]
Hmm.

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,375
[YACON grunts]

60
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,750
[BOTH grunting]

61
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,208
[YACON growls]

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,375
[GOKU gasps]

63
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,416
[GOKU grunts]

64
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,875
[YACON grunts]

65
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:19,291
[gasps]
That was close!

66
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:25,291
[YACON laughs]]

67
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,375
So... He's a big one,
but he's quick!

68
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,541
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

69
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,208
That's what I was
trying to tell you...

70
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,125
And Goku can't beat him!

71
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,250
Huh? No. My dad should be
more than enough for that guy.

72
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,000
Just watch and see.

73
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,750
Watch and see...?

74
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:45,083
[YACON laughs]
You were very lucky...

75
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,666
But you won't
get away this time!

76
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,625
[sighs] I'd better watch it.

77
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:53,208
One slip and those claws
will tear me in two.

78
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:57,250
[BABIDI chuckles]
Look, he's afraid...

79
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,041
--[BABIDI laughs]
--Yes! He won't last long

80
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,541
against Yacon!

81
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,583
[BABIDI] I'd like to
watch him panic some more

82
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,125
but there is no time for that!

83
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,166
[BABIDI]
Can you hear me, Yacon?

84
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,708
Listen to me!

85
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,833
[YACON]
Hnn?!

86
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,791
[BABIDI] You're doing well,
my marvelous monster.

87
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,083
I'm proud of you,
do you know that?

88
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,458
With your help, Majin Buu
will be resurrected

89
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,166
sooner than expected.

90
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,916
I have a treat for you
that will help you

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,958
finish off these
intruders quickly.

92
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,500
How would you like to visit
your favorite planet?

93
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,125
The Planet of Darkness!
Would you like that, my pet?

94
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,000
[YACON gasps]

95
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,375
[DABURA]
I don't understand.

96
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,708
There is no need to help him
with this Earthling.

97
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:40,250
Yacon is strong enough
to beat him on his own.

98
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,583
Yes...

99
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,125
But it's all this fighting
inside the spaceship...

100
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,500
See, a shock could
wake Majin Buu and

101
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,833
we don't want him to be released
with insufficient energy, do we?

102
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,375
We must make sure he comes to
life with his utmost power.

103
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:00,500
Yes, of course. Good plan.

104
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,791
I know...

105
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,250
Now watch this!

106
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,458
Yacon doesn't need my help,
but he's going to get it!

107
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,875
[BABIDI yells]

108
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:13,416

Huh?

00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,875
[GOKU grunts]

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,125
A stone? That hurt.

116
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,083
[GOKU]
Hey, what happened?

117
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,625
Who turned out the lights?

118
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,250
It's so dark
I can't see a thing!

119
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,916

[laughs]

121
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,875
Welcome to the
Planet of Darkness.

122
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,791
[YACON] You're scratching
your head, aren't you?

123
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,791
You can't see me,
but I can see you.

124
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,125
You can?

125
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,291
[GOHAN] Sounds like
he feels right at home.

126
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,208
[SUPREME KAI]
Yacon was born in this place.

127
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,791
It's at the far end
of the universe

128
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,208
where no light can reach it.
Thus, the Planet of Darkness.

You're mine now!

00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,541
I'm gonna eat you!

You can see in the dark?

No. But then I don't
really need to.

150
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,666
I can sense your movements by
the subtle vibrations

in the air.

What is that guy up to?

He looks different than before!
Oh no, he-he's changing.

00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,000
So what?
He's just emitting light.

Three thousand killis?!

177
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,458
How can an Earthling generate
3,000 killis of energy?!

178
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,416
It can't be...

179
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,125
With 300 killis, it's possible
to destroy a planet.

00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,583
Three thousand?

181
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,166
I tell you a human with that
much power does not exist.

[BABIDI] Ugh. Do you think
this meter is broken?

183
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,166
If he really has
3,000 killis of energy...

184
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,416
Yacon doesn't even
have a chance.

185
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,291
My poor Yacon only
has 800 killis...

Yacon is a type of monster
that eats light energy.

00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,333
[DABURA laughs]

324
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,916
For stage three, I will be the
warrior that they must battle.

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,583
And you have my word that I will
fill Majin Buu with their energy

326
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,625
when I destroy
every one of them.

327
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,458
But, Dabura...

328
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:54,250
If you are beaten by them,
then who will protect me?!

329
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,458
You must promise me
that you'll win!

330
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,000
I'll win.

331
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,208
I am Dabura.
I am the Demon King.

332
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,583
I don't care how many killis
of energy they have.

333
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:10,458
There is no one in the universe
who can exceed my power.

334
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,000
[NARRATOR]
Goku is pumped

335
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,708
after putting a stop to
the menacing Yacon,

336
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,791
but he has no
idea of the danger

337
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:20,291
that's about to come
through that final door.

338
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,916
[GOKU]
So far so good!

339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,916
I wonder who
Babidi'll send next?

340
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,208
Hey! You're up, Gohan!

341
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,125
All right!

342
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,625
[VEGITA]
Hmph.

343
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,750
[NARRATOR] With all of the fun
Goku and Gohan are having,

344
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,333
it seems the Supreme Kai
is the only one

345
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,583
who still remembers
their true mission.

346
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,750
And Dabura, with his ability to
turn people to stone

347
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,583
might be more than Gohan
can handle by himself.

348
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,833
Can Gohan summon the strength to
beat the Demon King

349
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:49,458
or is he destined to give up
his energy to Majin Buu?

350
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,625
Don't miss the
next Dragon Ball Z!

351
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,875
[GOHAN]
All right! I'm ready!
