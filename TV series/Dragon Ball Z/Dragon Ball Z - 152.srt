00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,250
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,416
Cell was about to absorb
Android 17 into his being

3
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,916
when Android 16
lodged a silent complaint.

4
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Like a raging bull,

5
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,375
the strong, silent Android
charged into battle

6
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,291
and attacked Cell
with all he had.

7
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,625
It was soon evident
that Android 16

8
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,958
was every bit as strong as Cell.

9
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,375
Leaving nothing to chance,

10
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,958
the giant Android proceeded
to rip off Cell's tail,

11
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,291
ensuring that the
greedy monster could never

12
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,250
absorb another life
into his being again!

13
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,250

[CELL screams]

15
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,875
[NARRATOR] But
Cell had other plans,

16
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,458
and he would not be deterred

17
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,208
from completing his
deadly evolution so easily.

18
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,750
A little tail regeneration,
and he was back in business.

19
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,791
[ANDROID 16] Hmm?

20
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:08,958
[CELL chuckles]

21
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,458
[CELL] Since some
of Piccolo's cells

22
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,291
comprise my cellular structure,

23
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,375
I, too, have the ability
to regenerate my body!

24
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,541
[NARRATOR]
The epic battle continues...

25
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,458
...today on Dragon Ball Z!

26
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,041
[thinking]
Full regeneration?

27
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,208
How can you beat a
creature like that?!

28
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,333
[thinking] He's hideous.
I could never be a part of that!

29
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,958
[thinking]
He's just too much...

30
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,875
[CELL]
A valiant effort, my friend,

31
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,875
but just a minor
inconvenience to me.

32
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,958
[CELL chuckles]

33
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,708
I thought I had the
solution, but I did not.

34
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,708
You are bound to have a
weak point somewhere, though!

35
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,916
Really now? We'll see.

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,416
This time I'll
rip off your head!

37
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,083

[CELL]
So much for that strategy...

43
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,041
Now, do you have
any other tricks,

44
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,208
or can I get
on with my work?

Look at those fireworks!

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,250
Those guys are going
all out over there!

64
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,250
[thinking] Wait a sec... I can
feel Tien's energy signal!

65
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,875
[thinking] Oh, great!
What's he doing over there?

66
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,458
So much for the plan!
Aw, man! Now what?

67
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,416
I can't go over there now.
Not without the remote.

68
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,166
Sorry, Tien.
I've got to find Bulma first!

69
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,500
[GOKU]
Wow! That's strange!

70
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,083
Cell's energy signal
just took a nose-dive!

71
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,250
Yeah, I felt it,
too, Dad. Is he losing?

72
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,083
[GOKU] It doesn't seem
possible, but somebody seems

73
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,500
to have the upper
hand on him right now.

74
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,625
Now, if they could just
hold on a little longer!

75
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,166
He's great!

[ANDROID 16]
Why are you still here?!

80
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,708
I told you to leave this place!

81
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:19,333
Hey, you squashed the bug. What
is there to be afraid of now?

82
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,083
That attack was not
enough to finish Cell!

83
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,500
It is imperative you run
from this place immediately!

84
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,291
You, too, 17!

85
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,875
Don't give Cell the
chance to absorb you!

Don't worry.

I think you've taken the wind
out of that freak's sails.

You're obviously

scared there for a second,

but now, heh, now I know...

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,666
I'll leave...

163
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,166
My dear android,

164
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,833
when will you understand
that you belong to me?

165
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,291
[ANDROID 18 growls]

166
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,833
[CELL]
Well, shall we get started?

167
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,958
Just relax.
You know the routine.

168
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,291
[ANDROID 18] Stay where
you are. I'm warning you.

169
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,208
One step closer
and I'll detonate!

170
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,833
Huh?!

171
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,125
Extinguish yourself?
You wouldn't dare!

172
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,916
Oh, no? Just try me.

173
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,125
Anything's better
than merging with you.

174
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:00,333
I'm not a creature like you are.
We're completely different.

175
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,041
How can I be a part of you?

176
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,833
[CELL] I think I know someone
who can answer that for you.

177
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,958
[ANDROID 17 (CELL)]
Hey, 18, what's up? Don't worry.

178
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,083
It's me, 17.

179
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,875
Huh?

180
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,333
What's the deal?
You're scared, huh?

181
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:23,458
Don't worry, look. I'm fine.

182
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,708
I know that it's hard
to understand, but we were

183
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,125
meant to be together
as part of Cell.

184
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,708
Once you join us,
it will all become clear.

185
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,416
Join you? Are you sure?

186
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,500
[ANDROID 17 (CELL)] 18! Would I
ever do anything to hurt you?

187
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,125
Don't listen to him!
That's not 17!

188
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,291
Cell is using
his voice to trick you!

189
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,250
[CELL]
Be quiet, you fool!

190
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,125
You only have half a brain left!

191
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,833
You have no idea
what you're talking about!

192
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,708
Please continue, 17.

193
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,666
You do whatever you want, 18...

194
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,250
But doesn't it make
sense to do as Dr. Gero

195
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,083
intended and become one
ultimate being above all others?

196
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,875
It's what we were made for!

197
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,208
There is no higher
purpose for us!

198
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,250
I'm not buying it!
That's not 17!

199
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,750
17 loved
the person he was.

200
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,333
This life was a
fascinating game to him.

201
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,833
And he wouldn't trade
it for anything!

202
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,416
Especially not to
be a part of you!

203
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,291
You fool, you're mine
whether you like it or not.

204
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,833
So just accept it.

205
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:29,291
[CELL] Go ahead and try! But how
many seconds will you need?

206
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,125
At least a few to
gather energy for the blast!

207
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,041
But I will stop
you before then!

208
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,583
All I need is a
second to get to you,

209
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,833
but you'll need at least a
handful to get the job done!

210
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,041
[CELL chuckles]

211
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,500
Add it up.

212
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,625
[CELL] Come to me.

213
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,208

214
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,958
No!

[ANDROID 18 growls]

216
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,125
Huh?

217
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,541
What does that no count
think he's doing?

218
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,666
[TIEN] I'm doing the only right
thing... I'm stopping you.

219
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,833
You fool! You've seen, you
know you're no match for me!

220
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,125
[TIEN] I might be just a pothole
in the road to you, big guy!

221
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,125
But it's going to be
one heck of a deep pothole!

222
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,375
Take this, you!

223
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,291
[TIEN yells]

224
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,500
[TIEN] Tri-Beam! Haaa!

Oh, no!

227
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,125
Tien just jumped in, didn't he?!

228
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,541
We had a plan!

229
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,250
He's not even supposed to
be there! What's the deal?

230
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,250
[ANDROID 16]
18... Are you okay?

231
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,250
[ANDROID 18]
I'm fine, I think.

232
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,625
[TIEN]
There you go, Cell!

233
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,416
A little greeting
from the "No Count"!

234
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,500
[TIEN] Alright, big guy! I know
you're down there somewhere!

235
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,500
And I'll bet you're
raging mad, aren't you?

236
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,208
Oh boy, Tien! You've
really done it this time!

237
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,041
Why are you still here?!
Get out of here right now!

Darn it!
What's he doing?!

He knows that he can't
sustain an effort like that!

Tien's going all out,

263

but how much longer
can he hold on?

264

With Cell on the rampage,

00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,958
is there any hope left
for the valiant warrior?

Can Vegeta and Trunks
complete their training

in the pendulum room
in time to lend a hand?
