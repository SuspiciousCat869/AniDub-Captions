00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,666
our heroes' worst
fears were realized

3
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,833
when Cell absorbed Android 17
into his being.

4
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,125
Fueled by this union,

5
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,541
Cell underwent a mighty
transformation,

6
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:38,708
moving him one step closer to
his final terrifying form.

7
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,333
[CELL] Ahh, yes!
This is much nicer!

8
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,875
How exhilarating!

9
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,166
[NARRATOR] The reformed Cell
was certainly a sight to behold.

10
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,250
But what sort of
horrifying new power

11
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,375
accompanied this shocking
new appearance?

12
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,791
[CELL] Ah, a new look! 
Much more comely than the last!

13
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,166
Merging with 18 should
have a similar effect.

14
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,333
[CELL] I can't wait!

15
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,333
[CELL chuckles]

16
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,583
[NARRATOR]
Bulging in his new body,

17
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,375
Cell was able to quickly
overcome the ox-like 16.

18
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,791
[ANDROID 18]
Look what you've done.

19
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,208
You're a monster!

20
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,416
[NARRATOR]
It seemed no one could stop Cell

21
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,375
from absorbing Android 18
and reaching his completion.

22
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,041
[CELL]
My dear android,

23
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,916
when will you understand
that you belong to me?

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,041
[NARRATOR]
Then, in a daredevil move,

25
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,083
Tien ambushed Cell
with a bold new attack!

26
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,041
But how long can he keep it up?!

27

He's strong...
But Cell is stronger.

62
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,625
Tien will not be able
to last much longer.

63

His life force is slipping away.

64
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,875
He must stop.

65
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:40,166
Or, the next energy blast
he fires could be his last!

No! I won't let that happen!

Yeah, I'm worried about Tien.

[CHIAOTZU] I'm worried
about him too, Yamcha.

[CHIAOTZU] He's in trouble.

Tien is on his own right now.

We can't save him, even though
we want too. Believe me...

What are you talking about?

Shame on you!
You can't give up.

You know Goku would
never do a thing like that.

When he and Gohan
finish their training,

they're gonna bash

But if you get involved now,

Hey, Piccolo, are you okay?

170
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:32,666
Huh? What's this?
How could he still be living?

171
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,416
I was too careless...

172
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:40,208
Just hang in there, guys! I'll
take care of the both of you.

173
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,208
I'll get you some of
Korin's Senzu beans

174
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,958
the minute we get back
to Kami's place!

They disappeared?!

Where did they go this time?

180
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:23,708
That's quite a move! I must
find out how he does that!

181
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:33,083
Well, that will be the last time
that they will get away from me!

182
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,291
I'll deal with them soon,
but finding Android 18

183
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,791
is much more important
to me right now.

[GOHAN] Are they okay, Dad?

186
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,416
Yes, Son, but they both
need a Senzu bean right away!

Okay!

I wonder what that is...

Yay, Trunks! Good call!
What a smart boy you are!

You're a real genius,
just like your mom!

Okay. Should we see
what he wants, huh?

202
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,291
[KRILLIN]
Hey, Bulma!

203
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,041
Listen, I really need
that remote control

204
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,291
to stop those androids, okay?

205
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,666
[BULMA] Sure, Krillin.
But be careful.

206
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,583
I put a lot of work into it.

207
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,666
Wow. So this little
thing will stop them, huh?

208
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,666
Now you'll have to get within
10 meters of the androids

209
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,958
to be in range.

210

Any farther away
and it won't work.

Huh? Uh... 10 meters?

Don't complain! You're lucky
you have that thing at all!

Uh... yeah, of course.

Hey, what have you got there?

I got everyone a combat
suit just like Vegeta's.

This one is for you.

It's very comfortable.
And of course, durable!

Kami's place?

Wow! That's above

[KRILLIN] Yeah, that's right.

Okay! I'll go to Kami's.

and shut down those

did the trick.

feeling a lot better.

I was gone for good this time.

to do everything by yourself!

You had us all really
worried about you, Tien.

an honorable move, Tien.

it still wasn't enough!

much stronger than all of us
