1
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,000
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,666
Vegeta was attacked from
within by Babidi's dark magic,

3
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,625
and by the hatred from his past.

4
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,958
[GOKU]
Vegeta... You didn't...

5
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,958
[cackles]

6
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,583
How sad...

7
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,583
I didn't figure you were weak
enough to be controlled.

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,958
[NARRATOR] All the
bitterness, hurt and anger

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,625
that had ruled Vegeta long ago
were brought to the surface.

10
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,750
It conusmed him!

11
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,666
[NARRATOR] And put him
under Babidi's control.

12
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,791
In a single, devistating
instant, it was clear.

13
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,958
The Dark Prince had returned.

14
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,250
The evil that had been
surpressed in Vegeta's heart

15
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:54,041
for years was once again brought
to life by Babidi's magic.

16
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,208
There could be no negotiation.

17
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,166
Vegeta was beyond
reason, beyond logic.

18
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,833
Only action would prevent him
from causing any further harm.

19
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,708
Realizing this, Goku did the
only thing he could.

20
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,000
[GOKU]
Babidi!

21
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,250
Transport us to a place
away from people!

22
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,958
If you give me that,
then I will fight Vegeta!

23
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,750
[NARRATOR] Goku was playing
right into Babidi's hands.

24
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,250
But not even the protests
of the Supreme Kai

25
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,833
could dissuade him from
his course of action.

26
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,166
[NARRATOR] Left with no other
option, the Supreme Kai

27
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,916
and Gohan descended into
Babidi's ship in the hopes

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,708
of destroying Majin Buu
before he could be returned

29
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,250
to full power.

30
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,125
All of the energy lost by
Goku in the coming struggle

31
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,291
will be absorbed by
the sleeping monster,

32
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,833
and there's sure
to be plenty of it.

33
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,333
Vegeta isn't taking
this fight lightly.

34
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,583
[VEGETA] You see!
This is our fate. Our battle!

35
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,750
[NARRATOR] The Super Saiyan
showdown is about to begin.

36
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,916
Today on Dragon Ball Z!

37
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:14,000
[MR. SATAN]
Uh... Ah... Uh...

38
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,375
Hey, uh... Mister Satan?

39
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,250
I hope you'll understand
if we postpone

40
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,750
your awards ceremony...

41
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,083
Of course.

42
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,416
After all that's happened,
I think that would be

43
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,750
the right thing to do.

44
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,916
Besides, all the
TV crews have run off.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,416
Okay, we'll reschedule
for later, then.

46
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,875
[MR. SATAN]
Hm.

47
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,833
I guess we should probably
tell the runner-up.

48
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,291
What do you mean?

49
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,583
About the delay, of course.

50
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,500
I think Number 18
will wanna be here

51
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,333
to collect her prize for
second place, don't you?

52
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,208
Uh-- Number 18?!

53
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,416
Wh-uh...

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,500
Uuuh...

55
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,041
What? Are you kidding?

56
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,375
Ha! Of course she'll
wanna be here!

57
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,000
She worked hard for this
honor. She deserves it!

58
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,125
Not many people
can stand next to me

59
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,416
when I put on my
Championship Belt!

60

[laughs]

62
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,333
[CHICHI]
How could he do this?

63
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,500
I really thought
Vegeta knew better.

64
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't think he'd ever wanna
hurt people like this again.

65
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,791
What kind of an
example is he setting--

67

You don't think Trunks was...

68
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,291
Goten was with him!

69
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,791
They wouldn't have
been down there...

70
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,291
Would they?

71
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:42,250
Vegeta, what happened to you?

And at your hands,

my honor and my pride,
the foundations upon which

I have always stood,
began to crumble at my feet.

It was at your hands

by a piece of low-level trash.

I had been raised

my royal birthright!

by a mere child!
