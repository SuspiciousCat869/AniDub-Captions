00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,666
Hidden deep underground, the
sleeping Majin Buu

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,083
was closely monitored by Babidi
and the demon king Dabura.

4
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,125
Their goal: to collect enough
energy to free the monster

5
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:28,000
from his cocoon and unleash him
upon the unsuspecting Earth.

6
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,750
[NARRATOR] Krillin and Piccolo
learned the hard way

7
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:36,083
just how dangerous Babidi could
be, but that didn't scare Goku.

8
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,041
[NARRATOR] He led Gohan,
Vegeta and the Supreme Kai

9
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,166
boldly into
Babidi's spacecraft.

10
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,708
But the evil wizard had stocked
his ship with warriors

11
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,125
waiting on each level
to do them in!

12
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,583
[NARRATOR] Using his
Super Saiyan strength,

13
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,041
Vegeta made
short work of Pui Pui,

14
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,875
the fighter guarding Stage One
of Babidi's spaceship.

15
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,833
But Stage Two would prove
much more difficult.

16
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,125
Standing in Goku's way
was the monster Yakon.

17
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,500
A beast with a sweet tooth for
light who found the energy

18
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,500
of the Super Saiyan
extra tasty.

19
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,333
[YAKON roars]

20
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,083
[NARRATOR] Yakon planned to
make a meal out of Goku,

21
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,416
but he bit off more
than he could chew,

22
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,083
and that caused the gluttonous
ghoul to burst at the seems.

23
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,625
Once the smoke cleared,
Goku and his friends

24
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,125
would be free to
advance to Stage Three.

25
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,916
A proposition which made
Babidi rather nervous.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,916
[BABIDI]
...Who will protect me?

27
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,916
[DABURA laughs]

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,833
For Stage Three, I will be the
warrior they must battle.

29
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,125
I am Dabura.
I am the Demon King!

30
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,208
And you will have my word that I
will fill Majin Buu

31
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,041
with their energy when
I destroy every one of them.

32
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,708
[GOHAN] You'd think Babidi
could have at lest

33
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,708
varied up the
décor a little bit.

34
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,125
All these Stages
look the same...

35
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,500
[VEGETA]
Get used to it.

36
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,166
I have a feeling we're going
to be here for a while.

37
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,250
Well, hopefully the next
fighter through that door

38
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,541
will be worth the wait.

39
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,000
Gohan! Your next!

40
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,333
Goku! Listen to me!
This is not a game.

41
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,458
Babidi's henchmen come from the
four corners of the universe and

42
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,833
every one of them is
incredibly strong.

43
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,458
We've all been lucky so far,

44
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,916
but I think from now on
we should all fight together.

45
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,541
Nah. Don't you worry
about it, Supreme Kai.

46
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,375
Gohan doesn't need any help.

47
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,125
Besides, that would be unfair!

48
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,416
[gasps]
Unfair?!

49
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,083
Well... Vegeta and I
both got to fight alone,

50
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,375
so don't you think Gohan should
have a turn for himself, too?

51
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,875
[GOHAN] Yeah!
I can take care of myself.

52
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,583
Just wait, I'll show you!

53
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,208
[whimpers]

54
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,458
Yes! Go and get them!

55
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:16,250
[chuckles] Master,
I am going to crush them all!

56
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:21,500
Ah! Where are you going, sir?
Level Three is the other way!

57
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,291
[BABIDI] Dabura's going to get
into the fighting spirit

58
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,250
in the meditation room!

59
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,333
The meditation room?

60
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,958
[grunts]

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,125
Ah, I see!

62
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,375
That's how he focuses
his incredible power!

63
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,500
[BABIDI laughs]

64
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,333
Guard! Listen, I don't
want you to open that door

65
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,416
until Dabura tells you to.

66
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,666
Yes sir!

67
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,458
[BABIDI] I'm glad he's
taking this seriously.

68
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,583
He can be such a devil!

69
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,916
Oh, I just can't wait to see the
look on all of their faces

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,416
when Dabura walks
through the door.

71
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,458
[giggles]

72
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,208
[GOHAN]
Boy, it's getting late...

73
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,500
How long is Babidi
going to keep us waiting?

74
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,500
Relax, Gohan.

75
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,750
He's probably just having
trouble finding anyone

76
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,000
strong enough to fight you.

77
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,041
[GOHAN]
Yeah...

78
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,833
So, uh, I wonder
how they're doing

79
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,458
back at the World Martial
Arts Tournament?

80
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,583
[GOHAN]
I don't know, Dad.

81
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,791
I mean, we did sorta
leave 'em in a bit of a bind.

82
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,500
I would have preferred
to fight you there, Kakarot,

83
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,083
than come to this place.

84
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:35,375
This has been a waste of my time
battling these cretins.

85
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,291
[GOHAN chuckles]
I know what you mean, Vegeta,

86
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,958
I was looking forward to
duking it out in the ring

87
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:39,750
with my Dad, too.

88
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,083
[GOKU]
Oh yeah?

89
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,458
I'm ready for the both of you!
Anytime, anywhere!

90
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,375
[SUPREME KAI thinking]
These Saiyans are impossible!

91
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,333
They enjoy the thrill of a
challenge so much

92
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,500
that they ignore the
dangers of fighting!

93
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,708
Reckless!

94
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,500
[CROWD shouting, yelling]

95
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,333
Hey! What's the hold up?!

96
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,041
How long do we have to wait?!

97
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,041
You better start the
match or else!

98
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,250
[ANNOUNCER whimpers]

99
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,125
So you want to disqualify them?

100
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,541
[FRIAR D] Well, they
haven't come back yet!

101
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,958
[FRIAR E]
It's our only choice!

102
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,833
[OX-KING]
Did I miss anything?

103
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,166
Are they ready to start?

104
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,666
No way.

105
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,125
They can't start until Goku and
the other guys come back.

106
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,958
Bulma, I'm worried. Where
do you think they could be?

107
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:25,375
[growls] They're pretty
far away, wherever they are...

108
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,333
And I sense that they're in
some sort of trouble, too.

109
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,791
[YAMCHA]
Huh...

110
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,833
Okay, if they're not back within
the hour, they're disqualified!

111
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,208
[FRIAR D] But that leaves
only five fighters

112
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,416
in the whole tournament!

113
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,875
[FRIAR C]
Hmm...

114
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,833
That'll never work.

115
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,958
[TRUNKS] Oh no, did we miss the
start of the competition?

116
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,458
[GOTEN]
I think we're just in time!

117
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,750
[MR. SATAN] Hmph.Those sissy
cowards haven't come back yet.

118
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,791
I guess I scared them off.

119
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,958
Oh well, the show must go on!

120
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,833
At least the four of you
have enough guts

121
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,500
to stick around and fight me.

122
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,958
[KILLA talks incoherently]

123
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,166
[TRUNKS grunts]

124
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,250
Well, it's time!

125
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,875
Look, it's Mr. Satan!

126
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,708
Hey, Mister Satan!

[CROWD] Mr. Satan!
Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!

129
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,958
Thank you my friends!

130
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,166
I know you came to see
a show of strength

131
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,916
and I'm gonna give it to you!

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,583
Mr. Satan always comes through
for his loyal fans! Yeah!

133
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,500
[CROWD cheers]

134
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,375
You the man, Mister Satan!

135
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:47,333
Yeah! Come on, show us
what you got, Mister Satan!

136
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,666
[MISTER SATAN]
Yeah-ha-ha!

137
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,875
[growls, chuckles]

138
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,458
That old guy's a clown,
isn't he?

139
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,291
[GOTEN]
No. Clowns are funny.

140
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,333
[MR. SATAN]
Now, listen here, guys.

141
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,708
The only thing that's gonna
satisfy this crowd

142
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,333
is some action.

143
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,458
[FRIAR E] There are only five
fighters. What do you suggest?

144
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,875
A battle royale!

145
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,083
[FRIARS]
A battle royale?!

146
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,125
[MR. SATAN]
Yes!

147
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,041
Disqualify the cowards
who took off

148
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,458
and have all five remaining
fighters duke it out

149
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,291
in the ring at
the same time.

150
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,625
The crowd will go wild!
They'll love it!

151
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,708
In fact, this'll probably be

152
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,875
the single greatest
moment of their lives!

153
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,833
And you can take that
all the way to the bank!

154
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,791
Ha-ha!

155
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,833
Hey! Great idea!

156
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,333
Leave it to Mr. Satan to come up
with a great plan like this!

157
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,250
Uh, Mr. Satan?

158
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,250
It's just that...

159
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,041
Well, I'm a bit concerned...

160
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,666
Yeah? Speak up!

161
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,208
It sounds like you got a problem
with my great idea or something.

162
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,750
Uh?

163
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,541
All right, if you don't like it,
I guess I'll just go home...

164
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,958
No don't do that!
I-It's a wonderful idea, sir!

165
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,541
Good! It's settled!
Tell the crowd!

166
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,750
Right!

167

Ladies and gentlemen!

Sorry to keep you waiting, but
I now have some terrific news.

169
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,833
At the suggestion of
Mister Satan,

170
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,125
we have decided to
hold a battle royale

171
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,458
among the five
remaining fighters!

172
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,375
All five will take to the
ring simultaneously,

173
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,666
and the last one standing
will be the winner!

174
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,208
[CROWD cheering]

175
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,583
Yeah! Three cheers
for Mister Satan!

176
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,083
Oh my! I think I'm in love!

177
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:33,458
Mister Satan it looks like your
battle royale idea is a hit.

178
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,458
It was very courageous
of you to suggest it.

179
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,083
Uh. What?

180
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,583
Well, yes. Of course.

181
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,333
Defending your title against
four challengers at once

182
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,958
is no easy feat.

183
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:48,791
To be honest, if you were anyone
else, I'd say you were a fool!

184
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:53,375
[laughs] The last thing a
champion like me

185
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,250
ever worries about is
the competition!

186
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,833
Yes, of course.

187
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,166
Everyone knows that you're the
best fighter on planet Earth.

188
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,916
Right? He's great!

A battle royale, huh?

191
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,708
Oh no, do you think
it's going to start

192
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,875
before Goku and Gohan get back
from where ever they are?

193

[ROSHI growls]
That's "if" they come back!

194
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,791
What are you saying, old man?!
Of course they'll be back!

195
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,625
[sighs] How else will
I win my prize money?

196
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,750
Now let me tell you the
names of the participants

197
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,833
in the battle royale,
and I'll start with

00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,458
the most important
fighter first!

00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,583
that 18 girl out of
the competition?

314
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,791
[MR. SATAN yells]

315
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:03,083
[MR. SATAN] Quick and painless!
After all I am a gentleman.

316
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,125
[thinking] Those poor saps
never knew what hit 'em!

317
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah! I showed them!

318
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,375
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah!

319
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:17,125
[ANNOUNCER] Wow, Mr. Satan is
already declaring victory!

320
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,666
That's what I call showmanship!

321
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,166
[thinking] Yeah, I won again!
Aw, it was all too easy...

322
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,541
He's such a blockhead.

323
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,875
[GOTEN]
That's for sure.

324
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,500
You! You with the mask on!

325
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,375
Are you ready to get the
pummeling of your life?!

326
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,666
Pay attention!

327
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,500
I'm gonna teach you
real martial arts!

328
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:43,333
[laughs]

329
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,166
Number 18 first,
then Mr. Satan.

330
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,083
Got it?

331
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,000
[GOTEN]
Okay!

332
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,833
[yells]

333
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:51,458
[TRUNKS, GOTEN growl]

334
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,708
[MR. SATAN yells]

335
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,708
[yells]

336
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,083
[TRUNKS growls]

337
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,375
Yaah!

338
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,708
[MR. SATAN gasps]

339
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,000
[gasps]

340
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,541
[ANDROID 18 grunts]

341
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,583
[TRUNKS grunts]

342
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:21,041
[ANDROID 18 gasping]

343
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,416
[MR. SATAN whimpers]

344
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,291
Wow!

345
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,166
Whee!

346
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,875
Since Goku isn't in the fight,

347
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,250
I guess I'll just have to
cheer for Number 18!

348
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,458
Get 'im! Number 18! Go!

349
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,166
[OOLONG]
Oh! Oh! Oh!

350
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,708
Yay, Mommy!

351
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,333
[ROSHI]
Hmm...

352
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,583
[ROSHI thinking]
Eh? What was that?

353
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,916
[TRUNKS]
Not that way!

354
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,166
To the right. To the right!

355
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,625
[GOTEN]
I'm trying! I'm trying!

356
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,583
[TRUNKS]
Whoa!

357
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,041
[TRUNKS gasps]

358
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,250
[GOTEN] Trunks!
It's no good! It's time to fly!

359
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,083
[gasps]

360
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,250
[ANNOUNCER]
And they're off!

361
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,000
Their fists are flying
and so are they!

362
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:14,541
[BOTH grunting]

363
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,125
[GOKU]
Aw, man! What's the hold up?

364
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's smash
the door in!

365
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,750
No, stop! Don't do that!

366
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,708
I'm sick of all this waiting!

367
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,083
Please!

368
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,625
Whatever you do, Vegeta,
you mustn't create a shock!

369
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:31,166
[BABIDI laughs]

370
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,583
Ah, good...

371
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,500
How's Dabura doing?

372
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,291
Sir! He's still meditating.

373
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,708
[BABIDI]
Good!

374
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,000
Soon he'll be ready to go
crush the three intruders.

375
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,833
I can hardly wait!

376
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:48,916
[chuckles]

377
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,500
[NARRATOR] The meditation
chamber has served Dabura well.

378
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,291
Now, with his
mind and body focused,

379
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,125
his power at its maximum,

380
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,541
the Demon King
is ready for battle.

381
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,666
But so are the Z-Fighters!

382
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,500
They know that they've got only
one more opponent to beat

383
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,875
before reaching the
heart of Babidi's ship

384
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,166
and the evil wizard himself.

385
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,166
And Gohan's itching for a fight!

386
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,458
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the Battle Royale rages on!

387
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,750
Number 18 and Mighty Mask
vie for the top prize,

388
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,166
and while they exchange
volley after volley

389
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,208
high above the Earth,
Mr. Satan's chances of winning

390
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,750
the Tournament are
crashing to the ground!

391
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,333
Faced with not one,
but two challengers

392
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,125
of incredible
strength and speed,

393
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,291
it seems the champion
will have no choice

394
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,041
but to relinquish his title...

395
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,083
Which of these fighters
will win the day?

396
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:54,083
Stay tuned for scenes
from the next Dragon Ball Z!
