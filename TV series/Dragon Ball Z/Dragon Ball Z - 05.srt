1
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,333
[PICCOLO and GOKU yell]

2
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,833
Goku and Piccolo launched
a combined assault

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,791
against the
evil Raditz!

5
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,625
But in spite of their
fierce efforts,

6
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,416
Raditz easily deflected
their every attack,

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,333
and countered with
an energy blast

8
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,750
that sent Goku and
Piccolo reeling!

9
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,000
Having firmly seized
the upper hand,

10
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:38,000
Raditz proceeded to deal out
a series of punishing blows!

11
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,666
And the mighty Goku
was rendered helpless

12
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,000
as his older brother cruelly
ground him into the dust.

13
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,541
Time to die!

14
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,916
[beeping]

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,833
Huh?

16
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,125
[NARRATOR]
That's right... It's Gohan!

17
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,291
What awesome new powers
have been awakened

18
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:04,958
within Goku's son?
The answer... Today!

19
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,208
Eh?!

20
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,583
[gasps]

21
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,625
[RADITZ] You?
I don't believe it!

22
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:32,333
[PICCOLO] Goku! Look over by
the crater... It's your son!

23
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,875
It can't be...

24
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,458
[GOKU] Gohan?

25
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,041
Gohan, Daddy can't
get up right now.

26
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,000
Run away
from here!

27
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,166
[grunts] Run away! Gohan!

28
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,625
[GOKU] Run now!

29
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,625
[RADITZ] Ahh!

30
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:02,250
Power Level 1370?
Impossible for a kid!

31
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,375
And, and it's
still going up!

32
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,500
[gasps]

33
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,291
Leave my Dad...

34
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:19,500
...alone!

35
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:27,833
[GOHAN screams]

36
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,541
[RADITZ groans]

37
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,333
[PICCOLO] Whaaa?

38
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,208
What the...

39
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,875
G-Gohan?

40
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,041
Uh, Daddy?

41
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,333
Gohan...

42
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,000
Go...
Get out of here...

43
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,083
But, Daddy...

44
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,041
[RADITZ] No one's ever
done that to me!

45
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,250
No...
Stay back!

46
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,083
Gohan, you
have to go!

47
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,166
[beeping]

48
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,625
Gohan... Quick!
Run now!

49
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,125
What? Hey, kid...

50
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,208
What happened to all
that power you had?

51
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,041
[GOHAN] Wha...
What power?

52
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,916
Bah! Play dumb
if you want.

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,625
You'll pay
all the same!

54
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,500
Daddy...
Help.

55
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,666
Leave him alone!

56
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,541
[RADTIZ yells]

57
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,250
Gohan!

58
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,000
[GOKU]
Gohan!

59
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,666
Huh?!

60
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,666
Please Don't hurt him.
He's just a boy!

61
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,958
Yes, he's just a little
boy, that's true!

62
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,750
But he's
very strong,

63
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,958
and he has
a power level

64
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,791
even higher than
yours, little brother.

65
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,666
And if he ever learned
to control it,

66
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,333
it would be
very bad for us.

67
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:17,875
So you can see! I have no
choice! He must die. Now.

68
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,125
[GOKU groans]

69
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,750
[GOKU]
No. Wait... You can't...

70
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,916
[RADITZ thinking]
You are the first Saiyan

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,458
to ever damage me
like this, my nephew.

72
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:39,958
You are a true warrior who
is worthy of being a Saiyan.

73
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,833
[RADITZ thinking] And so,
I will give you a death

74
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,541
that is also
worthy of a Saiyan.

75
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,208
[RADITZ screams]

76
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,708
Why, you wretch!
I should have killed you!

77
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:05,458
[RADITZ grunts]

78
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,916
[GOKU] Piccolo!

79
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:14,875
[GOKU] Piccolo!
Your attack! Let's go!

80
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:23,666
[PICCOLO chuckles]

81
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,291
Goku, sometimes
you amaze even me!

82
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:31,791
Now, hold tight!
This will take some time...

83
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,458
And don't listen to
anything he says!

84
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,750
[RADITZ yells and grunts]

85
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,833
See? It never pays to
tell a lie, now, does it?

86
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,666
You little scoundrel!

87
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:50,000
[RADITZ grunts]

88
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,833
[GOKU] Piccolo!
Hurry up!

89
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,916
I can't hold him
much longer!

90
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,500
[RADITZ thinking] How could
that little brat's attack

91
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,791
weaken me so much?

92
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,250
Kakarot!
You're a fool!

93
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,458
How do you expect
to dodge that beam

94
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,500
and hold me at
the same time?

95
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:14,125
Heh, heh. You're right,
I can't. We'll both go!

96
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,250
What?
That's insane!

97
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,875
You'll be killed!
Is that what you want?

98
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,000
[GOKU] If it's the only
way for me to beat you!

99
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,791
Hold on, Goku!
I'm almost ready!

100
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,875
So you're going to
sacrifice yourself...

101
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:36,458
Goku, how very noble of you.
And how convenient for me.

102
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,166
[PICCOLO thinking] Then again,
even if I do kill you,

103
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,125
it's only a matter of time
before your friends

104
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,625
wish you back with the
Dragon Balls... Too bad.

105
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,500
[RADITZ and GOKU grunt]

106
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,708
No you don't!
No way!

107
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,041
[grunting continues]

108
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,458
[GOKU]
Piccolo, my ribs are broken!

109
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,833
Ah! Hurry!

110
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,750
[PICCOLO] I'm almost
there, Goku! Hang on!

111
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,041
[beeping]

112
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:08,083
[RADITZ] 1440!

113
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,083
No! If that hits,
we're finished!

114
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:18,250
[PICCOLO grunts]

115
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,583
Hey! Kakarot! Look!

116
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:27,583
If you don't let me go, right
now, we're both going to die!

117
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,833
What's wrong? You seem a
little scared, brother!

118
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,083
You're a Saiyan!

119
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,791
Don't sacrifice yourself
for these Earth dogs!

120
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,125
[GOKU] It's nice to know that
you're so worried about me!

121
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:46,833
[PICCOLO grunts]

122
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,208
[PICCOLO] Prepare
yourself, Goku! It's time!

123
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,708
[RADITZ grunts]
[GOKU screams]

124
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:02,333
[PICCOLO] Special
Beam Cannon... Fire!

125
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,083
Kakarot!

126
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,458
[PICCOLO yells]

127
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:16,166
[RADITZ screams]

128
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,083
Aaaaahhhh!

129
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:40,875
Curse... you!

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,583
[PICCOLO breathes heavily]

131
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:31,291
[PICCOLO breathes heavily]

132
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:39,000
Kakarot... How could he?
It makes no sense!

133
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:44,916
The fool...
Now we're both dead...

134
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No. You die alone.

135
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,000
Goku won't be
gone for long.

136
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,750
I'm guessing his
friends will see to it

137
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,916
he's back
within the week!

138
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,916
What? That's impossible!
Tell me... How?

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,666
Heh. Gladly! On this
planet we have something

140
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,250
that we call
the Dragon Balls.

141
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,333
When all seven balls
are gathered together,

142
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,916
they have the power
to grant any wish.

143
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,583
And that includes bringing
the dead back to life.

144
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,083
So you see...

145
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,708
It's Goku who will
have the last laugh.

146
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:24,000
[RADITZ chuckles and groans]

147
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:29,541
No... I'm afraid you're
wrong, green man...

148
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,541
This device on my face...

149
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,500
It's... It's also
a transmitter...

150
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,875
My Saiyan comrades
heard every single word.

151
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:42,708
[PICCOLO] Huh?

152
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,833
[RADITZ]
The two of them...

153
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,916
Now they'll come...
I know they will.

154
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,208
They will...
I know they will...

155
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,833
And once they arrive you'll
be powerless to stop them.

156
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,375
There's nothing
you can do...

157
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,500
They'll seek out
these Dragon Balls.

158
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,041
And they'll destroy
everything in their path!

159
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,458
[RADITZ chuckles and groans]

160
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:12,416
You and every living
thing on this planet

161
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,833
will be wiped out.
They'll destroy you all.

162
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,416
[GOKU] When...
When will they come?

163
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,541
How long will it take
them to get here?

164
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,083
One year. And the
funny thing is...

165
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,416
[RADITZ chuckles]

166
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,375
They're much
stronger than me.

167
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,833
Stronger?

168
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,541
One year?

169
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,291
Oh, no.

170
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:43,500
So enjoy this little
victory of yours today.

171
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,791
It means...

172
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:49,291
It means nothing...
You're as good as dead...

173
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,375
[RADITZ chuckles and groans]

174
00:13:55,458 --> 00:14:00,708
[RADITZ] I only hope I'm back
in time to see it happen...

175
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,208
Don't look so upset...

176
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,875
We can't all have
the last laugh.

177
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,000
[RADITZ laughs]

178
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,750
[PICCOLO yells]

179
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:23,000
[CHICHI hums]

180
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,375
[CHICHI thinking] Hm.
Goku should've been home by now.

181
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,791
I guess he lost
track of time,

182
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,625
seeing all his old
friends again...

183
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,083
Still, I wish
he'd hurry.

184
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,250
It's not good
for Gohan

185
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,791
to be away from his
studies this long...

186
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,583
Oh well, I suppose it's
all right this time.

187
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,208
Gohan works
so hard.

188
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,541
He deserves to have a little
fun once in a while...

189
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,041
Come to think of it,
so do I...

190
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,875
[whirring]
Huh?

191
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,208
[OX KING]
ChiChi! Gohan!

192
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,833
Ahh!

193
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,458
Hey Dad!

194
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,583
[OX KING] Hey darling!

195
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,000
[OX KING chuckles]

196
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,333
I thought I'd come to
see how you were doing.

197
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,666
So... Where's
my grandson?

198
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,166
Gohan! I have
something for you!

199
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,791
[OX KING grunts]

200
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,958
Ha, ha, ha! Oh, dad!

201
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,666
Okay. I think this
is the place...

202
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,333
[ROSHI] Mm-hm.

203
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,375
[BULMA] They should be right
down there somewhere...

204
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,583
[PICCOLO]
Thanks for the warning...

205
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,208
We'll deal with
your Saiyan friends

206
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,916
just like we
dealt with you.

207
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:47,625
Goku... It's over.
He's gone.

208
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,208
[KRILLIN]
Hey! Look!

209
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,958
There they are!

210
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,875
[BULMA] Oh, no...
Only one of them's standing.

211
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,750
Who? Who is it?

212
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,583
Piccolo?

213
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:20,750
Oh no...
This doesn't look good.

214
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,916
[NARRATOR] Even as Goku's
friends rush to his side,

215
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,541
little could they know
that far away,

216
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,875
in a distant corner
of the galaxy,

217
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,458
the events on Earth are being
followed with great interest.

218
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,916
Raditz stinks.

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
[VEGETA]
He's a complete disgrace...

220
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,041
How could he let himself
be beaten by men

221
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,625
with such low
fighting power?

222
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,041
I don't know.

223
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,041
Maybe we should go teach
those Earthings a lesson.

224
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,666
A waste of time...

225
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,333
Then again,
I am curious...

226
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:37,541
Oh. Are you thinking
about what Raditz said?

227
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,916
[VEGETA laughs]

228
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,833
Exactly. Those Dragon
Balls caught my interest.

229
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,250
Just think about the
possibilities, Nappa.

230
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,958
If we can get our hands on
those seven Dragon Balls,

231
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,875
then we can wish for
anything that we want.

232
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,041
Anything at all.

233
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,208
Wouldn't you say that's
worth making a little trip?

234
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,541
You kiddin'?
Yeah! Let's go!

235
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,416
Ha, ha, ha , ha, ha!

236
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
[KRILLIN] You're going
to make it, Goku!

237
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,375
You can pull through!

238
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,916
No, Krillin.

239
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,666
He can!
Can't you, Goku?

240
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,125
Just tell him!
Say something!

241
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,791
Well, Gohan's
still unconscious.

242
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,291
But otherwise,
I think he's okay.

243
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,166
--[GOKU grunts]
--Eh?

244
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:28,875
That's good...

245
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,666
Goku...

246
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,166
ChiChi'd kill me
if he got hurt.

247
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,875
Goku...

248
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,166
[GOKU chuckles]

249
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,833
[GOKU]
K-Krillin...

250
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:56,208
Please take care
of G-Gohan for me...

251
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,416
Yeah, sure, buddy.

252
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,916
But! It's not gonna
come to that, okay?

253
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,166
You're gonna
make it!

254
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,291
And that's all
there is to it!

255
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,125
Krillin...

256
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:11,833
No. Not this time, friend.
This time I can't.

257
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,333
I'll wish you
back, Goku.

258
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,791
We already have
three Dragon Balls.

259
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,541
I'll see you... soon...

260
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,750
No...

261
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,458
Goku?

262
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,250
Goku!

263
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,500
[KRILLIN]
Goku!

264
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,791
[squeaking]

265
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,958
[VEGETA] Once we've forced
Kakarot's friends

266
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,916
to tell us how to find
the Dragon Balls,

267
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,375
we'll eliminate them...

268
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,083
Along with anyone else who
tries to stand in our way...

269
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,583
And then, we can wish
Raditz back to life.

270
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,916
No. That would
be a wasted wish.

271
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,791
Raditz was a weakling
and a fool..

272
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,583
Any Saiyan who could
be defeated so easily

273
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,166
doesn't deserve
to live.

274
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,458
[NAPPA grunts]

275
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,041
[VEGETA]
Actually, Nappa,

276
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,708
I have something far
more grand in mind.

277
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,875
Now tell me, how does the idea
of eternal life sound to you?

278
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:33,833
What? Living forever?
That sounds great.

279
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,041
Yeah, and if
we can't die,

280
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,250
that means no one'll ever
be able to defeat us...

281
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,416
So what the heck would
we need Raditz for?

282
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,791
Yes, 'what for', indeed?

283
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,416
We'll be the greatest
fighters in the universe.

284
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,083
And we will ascend
to our rightful place

285
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,583
among the Saiyan
warriors of legend!

286
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,833
Do you mean...

287
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,166
[VEGETA]
That's right, Nappa.

288
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,250
That's exactly
what I mean.

289
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,166
We will become
Super Saiyans!

290
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,416
[NAPPA] Now I definitely
like the sound of that!

291
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,375
[KRILLIN sobs]

292
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:44,625
[KRILLIN] No! Goku!
You can't die! You can't!

293
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,875
[ROSHI]
He's gone.

294
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,791
No, this...
This can't be happening.

295
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,875
I don't believe it.

296
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,625
[ROSHI] Look!
He's disappearing!

297
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,791
What in the world?

298
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,333
I know...
It was Kami.

299
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,750
[KRILLIN] Kami?

300
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,125
The guardian of the Earth.
I think you both know him.

301
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,541
Yes. This is his work...

302
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:18,625
No doubt Kami has some 'special
purpose' in mind for Goku...

303
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,875
Do you think so?

304
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,041
[NARRATOR] Although Goku has
left the world of the living,

305
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,875
it seems
thanks to Kami,

306
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,375
a bold new adventure awaits
him in the world beyond!

307
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,625
But as Goku begins his
incredible journey

308
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,125
into the unknown,

309
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,291
the friends he leaves behind
must find a way to carry on!

310
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,500
For the time being...

311
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,625
The Earth is without
its greatest champion

312
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,041
and a terrible new
threat is on its way!

313
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,833
In one year, two even
more powerful Saiyans

314
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,375
will land on Earth...

315
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,541
Who will be there
to stop them?

316
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,125
The countdown begins...

317
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,416
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
