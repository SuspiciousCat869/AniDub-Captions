00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,750
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,000
Nappa and Vegeta continued
their conquest of the planet,

3
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,041
much to the terror and
dismay of Krillin and Gohan.

4
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,416
But Goku, having finally
returned to Earth

5
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,833
with the new skills taught
to him by King Kai,

6
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:31,541
put a sudden halt to the
Saiyans' sinister plans.

7
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,541
Thanks a lot,
Vegeta...

8
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,125
[NARRATOR] Not to be outdone,
Vegeta took the shame

9
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,291
of his comrade's failure
into his own hands,

10
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,041
and brought their
partnership to an end...

11
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,500
Die!

12
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,333
[NARRATOR]
Permanently.

13
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,958
[NARRATOR] Vegeta seems
confident of victory,

14
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,625
but Goku still has a
few surprises in store

15
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,583
for the evil Saiyan...

16
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,500
When the battle
continues... today!

17
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,583
[VEGETA] So, Kakarot,
are you ready?

18
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,208
[VEGETA chuckling]

19
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,458
[GOHAN whimpering]

20
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,791
I know a
better place!

21
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,916
Wherever!
Just lead the way!

22
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,750
[GOKU thinking]
I've got to be careful...

23
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,666
There's no telling
how powerful he is...

24
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,625
[KRILLIN]
Well, there they go.

25
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,250
[GOHAN]
Yeah...

26
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:19,250
[KRILLIN] Gohan, I, uh, I
guess we'd better get going.

27
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,625
Hey, Gohan, try
not to worry!

28
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,458
Your dad knows
what he's doing,

29
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,541
he's got everything
under control!

30
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,791
Really, I mean it!

31
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,708
Goku is the toughest
guy in the whole world!

32
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,458
Hey, plus, you
and I are a team!

33
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,333
We really did great!
Don't you think?

34
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,791
Yeah!

35
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,541
[KRILLIN] Now, let's get you
back to your mother.

36
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,291
I think she'll be pretty
happy to see you.

37
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,208
Yeah, no one will get hurt
if we fight way out here.

38
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,958
Kakarot...

39
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,166
I have a
proposition for you...

40
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,916
[VEGETA] I'm only going
to say this once,

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,666
so listen
carefully.

42
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,666
I, Vegeta, Prince
of all Saiyans,

43
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,666
would like to
offer you, Kakarot,

44
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,958
the opportunity to stand
beside me in this conquest.

45
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,208
With Nappa gone,
I could use a good man!

46
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,666
[VEGETA] Think about it...
We would rule the planets.

47
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,083
You could have
anything you desired.

48
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,333
There's no one in the
universe that could touch us!

49
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,875
[VEGETA] Nothing would
be out of your grasp!

50
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,625
Well, what do you
say, Kakarot?

51
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,500
I have everything that
I could ever want

52
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,791
right here on Earth!

53
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,583
So, I'll have to say...
no thanks.

54
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,208
Besides, I've seen how
you treat your partners.

55
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,875
Not much
job security...

56
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,000
[VEGETA chuckling]

57
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:26,875
Alright, then, so be it!
You had your chance!

58
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,708
[GOKU] Hyaah!

59
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:10,958

[VEGETA] Say goodbye!

64
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,375
Man, he's good! Far better
than I expected him to be...

65
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,333
I'll still
beat him!

66
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,583
Kakarot...
What's wrong?

67
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,583
I was hoping for a more
interesting fight!

68
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,291
You'll get one!
I promise!

69
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,083

[GOKU snarling]

72
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,750
Kaio-Ken...
Attack!

73
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,291
Ah?!

Hmph!

78
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,958
[VEGETA] That Kaio-Ken
Attack is a nice trick,

79
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,708
but I've encountered something
just like it before!

80
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,500
Hah?!

81
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,291
[VEGETA chuckling]

00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,875
Don't tell me that's
all you've got?

83
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,916
If it is,
you'd better quit!

85
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:31,291
Heh. Funny... As grim as
things look right now,

86
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,000
I kind of like
the challenge!

with it?

around, that's what!

had it with you!

not broken! Stop it!

ball is overwhelmed.

are emitting

an inconceivable
amount of energy!

This isn't exactly
an ordinary fight!

102

So, it's started?

103
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,416
I mean Goku and that
guy are fighting?

104
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,583
Yes, I believe so.

it out on the Scouter!

Bulma! What does it say?

power levels due west!

Who does he think he is?

116
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,458
What kind of power could
he possibly be hiding?

117
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,541
Guess I'll just
have to find out...

118
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,041
That's it?
That was your best?

119
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,833
I've got some bad
news for you...

120
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,875
You may be stronger than
anyone else on this planet...

121
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,291
But even at your peak,
you're still no match for me!

Wanna bet?

to wager... Behold!

00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,416
What's going on?

162
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,875
Look! Up in the sky!

163
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,000
[screaming]

164

[birds squawking]

165
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,541
That's freaky...
What's wrong with them?

166
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:45,083
[VEGETA grunting]

167
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,541
Hunh?!

168
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:54,166
What power...
Amazing!

169
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,208
[VEGETA growling]

170
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:07,666

[yelling continues]

[GOKU panting]

176
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,666
[GOKU] I think it's
finally over...

177
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,041
Whoa...
That was incredible!

178
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:52,375
And now everything
is calm... too calm...

179
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,083
[VEGETA] Kakarot!

180
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,666
Farewell...
You're finished!

181
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,375
[GOKU shouting]

182
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,750
[VEGETA] What's the matter?
Can't find me?

183
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,958
Haah!

184
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,791
Kaio-Ken!
Times two!

185
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,416
Hraagh!

186
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,750
[VEGETA chuckling]

187
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,333
Well now, missed him...
How nimble!

188
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,708
[VEGETA] Nice one!

189
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,541
[thinking] What an
incredible level of power!

190
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,208
I'd better think of
something fast...

191
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,625
I don't know how much
longer I can keep this up!

192
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,916
I've got
no choice...

193
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,416
If the Double Kaio-Ken
Attack doesn't work,

194
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,458
I guess I'll
try a triple!

195
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,625
Sorry, King Kai, but I
don't see any other way!

196
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,166
[VEGETA] What's the
matter, Kakarot?

197
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,625
You don't seem too
eager to continue!

198
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,250
Don't tell me you already
need to catch your breath?

199
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,791
We were just
getting started!

200
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,958
[GOKU] Don't wait on me!
Feel free to lead off anytime!

201
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,250
[thinking] Goku's insane!

202
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,708
This guy's beating
him senseless,

203
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,625
but he just keeps
coming back for more!

204
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,083
I know Goku's tough,
but it seems like this time,

205
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,416
he's finally
met his match...

206
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,708
[VEGETA] This staring contest
is beginning to irritate me.

207
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:13,625
Are you planning on continuing
our fight anytime today?

208
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:17,458
What's it going to be?
I'm tired of waiting!

209
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,333
[thinking] Alright, I'll try
the triple Kaio-Ken attack!

210
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,041
I sure hope my
body can take it!

211
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,583
[VEGETA laughing]

212
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,833
I keep forgetting that
you're an Earthling now!

213
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,958
You don't even have
a tail, do you?

214
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,958
You let them
operate on you?

215
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,666
What'd they do, get you
while you were sleeping?

216
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,541
Now I see why you have no
desire to join me on the hunt!

217
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,041
If we still had
a home planet,

218
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,958
you'd be a
laughing stock there!

219
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,375
[YAJIROBE thinking]
Oh, man!

220
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,666
It looks like Goku's
in big trouble!

221
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,541
I've got to help
him somehow...

222
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,208
And I guess the best
way for me to do that

223
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:55,750
would be to, uh... Hide!
Somewhere over this way...

224
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:04,375
[thinking] Okay, this is it!
Time to see what I'm made of.

225
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,708
[GOKU grunting]

226
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,166
Hmm?!

227
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:14,083
[GOKU growling]

228
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,708
Alright, here goes nothing!
Kaio-Ken Attack times three!

229
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,208
What? No! I told him not
to go over a double!

230
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,208
No matter what!

231
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,541
This isn't good. I don't know
if his body can handle it!

232
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,958
I didn't have time to
prepare him for that...

233
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,333
[KING KAI whimpering]

234
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:40,291
Oh, Goku...
Please be careful...

235
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,916
[BUBBLES chattering]

236
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,541
[GREGORY] C'mon, Goku!
You can do it!

237
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:03,833
[GOKU yelling]

238
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,666
Uh!

239
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,500
[CHICHI]
What's it say?

240
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,166
Wow! Look at it go!

241
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,958
Hey, let me
try it, Bulma!

242
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,500
Can it, Oolong!
This isn't a game!

243
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,125
Goku's power level
is rising rapidly!

244
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,041
At this rate
he'll explode!

245
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,625
[BABA] Oh, my!

246
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,791
[CHICHI] Oh, no! Goku!

247
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:27,916
Seventeen thousand... Nineteen
thousand... Over twenty-one!

248
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,625
Ahh!

249
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,625
[OOLONG] Whoa!

250
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,625
[CHICHI] Bulma,
are you okay?!

251
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,666
Yeah, I think so...

252
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,541
[OOLONG] Whoa-hoa!
Talk about overload! Man!

253
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,291
Uhh... ahh!

254
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,625
Huh?

255
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,666
[GOHAN whimpering]

256
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,625
[KRILLIN] Hey, Gohan,
what's the matter? Gohan?

257
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,666
[KRILLIN] 
Let's keep moving... Come on!

258
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,250
We gotta get to Kame House!

259
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:02,875
[thinking] Daddy, what is
that? Something's different...

260
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:12,916
[GOKU growling]

261
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,125
What? No way!

262
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:26,625
[GOKU growling]

263
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,875
Rraagh!

264
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,583
[NARRATOR] What new level
of power has Goku reached?

265
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,708
And is this new power
enough to stop

266
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,833
Vegeta's path
of destruction?

267
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,958
Goku is determined to see
this through to the end,

268
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,666
but, with the
unpredictability of Vegeta,

269
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,000
what else might be
in store for him?

270
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,291
Find out, on the next
action-packed episode

271
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,958
of Dragon Ball Z!
