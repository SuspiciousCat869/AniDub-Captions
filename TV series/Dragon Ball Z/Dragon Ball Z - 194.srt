[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,000
under the guidance
of his master and father,

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,583
Gohan was able to
reach radical new depths

4
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,166
and unleash a power
that had no rival!

5
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,500
Cell could only look on with
horror as the tides turned,

6
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,708
his evil vision--
and his body--

7
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:32,583
disintegrating right
before his very eyes!

8
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,208
It was the mother
of all energy waves!

9
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,083
As beautiful
as it was deadly!

10
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,583
A good omen,

11
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,833
that signaled a time of new
beginnings on Planet Earth!

12
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,000
But instead of donning
their party hats,

13
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,958
the Earth's Special
Forces celebrated

14
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,916
by summoning
the Eternal Dragon--

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,750
which, thanks to Dende,

16
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,583
could now grant two
wishes instead of one!

17
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,708
The first wish was easy!

18
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,583
Please revive all those on
Earth who were killed by Cell!

19
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,500
So be it!

20
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,041
[NARRATOR] Oh, death,
where is thy victory?

21
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, grave, where is thy sting?

22
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,875
And when it was
time to try to bring

23
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,708
Goku back with the second
wish, the Super Savior said,

24
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,125
Thanks, but no thanks!

25
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,166
It was time for a change.

26
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,916
To move on and
face new frontiers.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,041
A new generation
on Earth was arising

28
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,458
and the groundwork had
already been layed!

29
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,500
His work was complete!

30
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,333
Trunks was ready to set sail
on his new adventure as well!

31
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,541
After finding a group
of true friends

32
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,791
and the power to set
things right in the future,

33
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,125
it was time to head for home!

34
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,583
Love you! Goodbye!

35
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,791
[GOHAN] Bye, Trunks!
You're the greatest!

36
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,625
[TRUNKS]
Goodbye, Gohan!

37
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,625
Later, man!

38
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,625
Bye, Trunks!

39

[TRUNKS]
See ya, guys!

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
[NARRATOR] Although peace has
been restored to the Earth

41
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,458
in the present, the future
from which Trunks came

42
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,791
is still a very bleak place!

43
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,541
No one knows where
Androids 17 and 18

44
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,916

[TRUNKS]
Hey! Watcha readin' there?

62
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,625
Hi, Mom! I'm back!

63
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,750
Yes. Yes. I see!

64
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,791
[BULMA]
Wow!

65
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,291
My gosh!

66
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,875
Trunks! Just look at you,
you've grown so much!

67
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,166
You even look older!

68
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,458
Yeah, I am!

69
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,125
I spent some time
in a room where

70
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,916
I lived out an entire
year in one day's time

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,958
and Dad was there with me!

72
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,750
You know it was pretty neat!

73
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,125
Yeah, that sounds
like your father!

74
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,958
Stuffing a whole year of quality
time with you into one day!

75
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,750
Hey, guess what?

76
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,833
There's tea made. How 'bout
we sit down and have a cup?

77
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:55,708
Sure!

78
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,583
[TRUNKS] And that's
pretty much the whole thing

79
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,875
in a nutshell, Mom.

80
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,708
[BULMA]
My gosh...

81
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,041
So Goku died after all?

82
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,583
[TRUNKS]
Mm-hm.

83
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,583
Goku not wanting to be wished
back--that sounds like him.

84
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,416
So he helps save the world
one last time and moves on.

85
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,083
What a guy!

86
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,125
Yeah!

87
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,416
Guess what, Mom?
Dad defended me in a battle!

88
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,500
Trunks, you've
gotta be kidding!

89
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,125
It's true!
I didn't see it,

90
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,125
but Yamcha told me
all about it afterwards!

91
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,333
Dad went all-out. Cool, huh?

92
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,375
[TRUNKS]
Cell was outrageously strong,

93
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,416
and I was having a bad day,
to say the least!

94
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,125
Yamcha said that when my dad
saw me, die he went mad!

95
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,416
He was so upset, he charged
Cell like a wild man

96
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,958
and without any hopes of
winning, attacked him head-on!

97
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,041
[TRUNKS]
Yamcha said it was the best shot

98
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,083
that anyone got in
on Cell all day!

99
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,083
Isn't it great, Mom?
Hard to believe, huh?

100
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,458
Mom?

101

312
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,791
[GOKU] Well, it...
uh... looked sturdy...

313
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,125
[laughs nervously]

314
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,083
Oh, man! Sorry, King Kai!
Gosh! I really blew it!

315
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,208
I feel so dumb!

316
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,166
[BUBBLES chatters]

317
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,166
No... No, it's not true,
Bubbles. It's not his fault.

318
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,166
Hey! I know! Yeah!
This is a sign!

319
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't think we're supposed
to be living here, King Kai!

320
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,583
Do you believe in signs?

321
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,458
--[KING KAI] No!
--[GOKU] Huh?

322
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,708
Come on! Let's go to the
Other World! Take a trip!

323
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,916
Huh?! You mean hit the road?

324
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,291
Hm...

325
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,791
Come on!

326
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,916
There's nothing holding us
here except a pile of lumber.

327
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,958
We're as free
as birds, King Kai!

328
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,166
Let's hit the road right now
and go on an adventure!

329
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,583
Well, gosh! I don't
usually migrate!

330
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,291
And I hate.. travel...

331
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,625
Here! It'll be okay, come on.

332
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,958
Bubbles!
Gregory! Road trip!

333
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,833
Yay!

334
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,291
[NARRATOR] Goku and King Kai
have begun their journey

335
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,625
to the Other World!

336
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,416
What is this
mysterious place?

337
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,375
And what will our adventurers
find when they get there?

338
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:53,125
Join us next time
on Dragon Ball Z!
