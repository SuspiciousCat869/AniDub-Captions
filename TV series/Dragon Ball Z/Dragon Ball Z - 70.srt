00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,375
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragonball Z,

2
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,458
the battle between
Captain Ginyu,

3
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:23,166
leader of the Ginyu Force,
and Goku began!

4
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,833
[NARRATOR] In an effort
to test his own strength,

5
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,416
Captain Ginyu tried to get
Goku to reveal his true power,

6
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,291
but the Saiyan would not play
Ginyu's game, at first...

7
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,041
Now, let's go!

8
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,250
[NARRATOR] But as Goku
increased his power level,

9
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,458
Ginyu began to
reconsider his strategy.

10
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,625
Ahh... No way!

11
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,458
[NARRATOR] Does the
captain of the Ginyu Force

12
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,916
stand a chance
against Goku?

13
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,833
Find out today!

14
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,166
[JEICE thinking] Man o' man!

15
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,833
Now I see what Burtur and
I were really up against!

16
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,791
We didn't have a clue!

17
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,958
undred  housand!
Fighting power one
and seventeen

18
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,541
Oh no!

19
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,541
That's only three thousand away
from Captain Ginyu's maximum!

20
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:32,458
[GOKU growling]

21
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:37,333
What?! Darn! No way!
Hey! Hey, stop that!

22
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:45,541
[GOKU shouting]

23
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,458
[GOKU] Actually, I'm
just getting warmed up!

24
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,750
[GINYU] Oh, a wise guy,
huh?! Now, let's see here!

25
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,416
What?! One hundred
and forty thousand!

26
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,791
No! It can't be!

27
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,708
[GOKU] I think your friend's
having a nervous breakdown!

28
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,125
[JEICE] He's just
cooling off, mate!

29
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,416
He'll be back!

30
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,625
[GINYU yelling]

31
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,750
[GOKU growling]

32
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,833
One hundred and fifty
thousand! Unreal!

33
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,000
[growling continues]

34
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,625
[GOKU shouts]

35
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,791
Jeice! Look out!

36
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,541
[GINYU grunts]

37
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,625
[JEICE] Whoa!

38
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,083
[GINYU laughs]

39
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,083
[GINYU gasps]

40
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,625
Here! Try these
on for size!

41
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,958
[JEICE] Watch it!

42
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,083
[JEICE] Captain! I think it'd be
wise if we left and got Frieza!

43
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,583
[GINYU] Shut up, Jeice,
I'm in charge here!

44
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:13,208
[GOKU yells]

45
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:17,291
Wha--? Huuuuuuh?!

46
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,208
[GINYU] So this is the real you!

47
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,625
undred a housand!
One
eighty

48
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,916
Astounding! Incredible!

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,416
Man, we should
be getting

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,375
the heck out of
here right now!

51
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,666
Yeah, I've seen about
all I want to see!

52
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,625
There's no need
to be scared of me!

53
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,500
Just say you're sorry
for what you've done

54
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,791
and leave and no harm
will come to you!

55
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,458
What? Apologize?!

56
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,875
[GOKU] That's right!

57
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:53,375
[GINYU] We're the Ginyu Force!
We-We never apologize!

58
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,333
Uhh.

59
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,416
[GOKU] I'm sorry to hear that!

60
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,958
[GINYU] You don't scare me!

61
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:02,625
We don't bow to anybody,
not even a guy like you!

62
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,166
Although, I must admit...

63
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,500
we've never really
faced anyone like you!

64
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,291
[GINYU wails]

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,708
[BULMA] Huh?!

66
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,625
Oh, my gosh! What happened?!

67
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,041
This is horrible!

68
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,250
Man...

69
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,708
Hmm...

70
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,875
[BULMA] I had no idea
it was this bad!

71
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,875
This is just awful!

72
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,041
How could anyone do
this to these people

73
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,625
just for the Dragon Balls?
It doesn't make sense.

74
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,125
Man...

75
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,916
Gosh, and here I was
thinking I had it bad...

76
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:07,333
[BULMA] Oh, you poor
little guy. Ooh...

77
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, Goku,
hurry up!

78
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,083
We need you!

79
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:28,000
[GURU] What are you
looking for, Dende?

80
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,750
[DENDE] I was hoping that
Nail would come back, Guru.

81
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,916
[GURU] Try looking
below, to your left.

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,708
[DENDE] It's him!
Guru, Nail's come back!

83
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,916
[GURU] Who is it, Dende?
I can not see very well.

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,708
[DENDE] It's Nail, Guru!
Nail's come back.

85
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,291
[GURU] It couldn't be Nail!
I sent him on a mission.

86
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,916
[NAIL] It is I, Guru.

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,750
Nail, why have
you returned?

88
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,458
I asked you to help
the Earthlings,

89
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:03,375
can't you respect an old man's
wishes even in his last hour?

90
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,208
[NAIL] I know
what's coming, Guru.

91
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,958
And you do too.

92
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,291
You also know that
I can't be anywhere

93
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,666
except by your side
at this time!

94
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,166
[GURU] There's nothing
you can do, my son.

95
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,333
You know that.

96
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,166
[NAIL] But, Guru,
I have to try!

97
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,291
[GURU] But you can't succeed.

98
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,750
[NAIL] Then I'll die trying!

99
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,583
[GURU] Nail!

100
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:30,458
Mmm. You're a fine young man.

101
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,083
Hmm...

102
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,333
Isn't that the
place over there?

103
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,208
[KRILLIN] I don't know,
it all looks the same to me.

104
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,000
[KRILLIN] Hey, you
were right, Gohan!

105
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,458
This is it!

106
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,708
We better hurry!

107
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,541
[KRILLIN] Where is she?
Uhh, Bulma, where are you?

108
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,958
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

109
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,583
Hm, I guess
she's not here.

110
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,041
Hey, Bulma!

111
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,166
Well... Huh.

112
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,208
[KRILLIN] Keep your eyes open
for the Dragon Radar, Gohan.

113
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,916
[KRILLIN] Maybe a mountain lion
drug her into this little cave!

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,833
[GOHAN] I wouldn't want
to be the mountain lion!

115
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,166
[KRILLIN] Yeah, I
guess you're right.

116
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,625
Oh, brother!
I can't believe it.

117
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,791
You leave a girl stranded
in the middle of nowhere,

118
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,333
and she's still gone
when you need her.

119
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,000
[GOHAN] Hey, Krillin.
Check this out.

120
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,208
[KRILLIN] Oh, yeah. Wow.

121
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,041
Some sort of hieroglyphics, huh?

122
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,916
ki!
No, silly! This is a track
from Bulma's air

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,375
She took off somewhere!

124
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,625
[KRILLIN chuckles]

125
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,708
Oh, great, a ruthless
killer is about to find

126
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,958
the key to immortality and
she's out cruisin' somewhere!

127
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,958
Bad timing, huh?

128
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,625
C'mon, Gohan!
We've got to find her!

129
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,083
Without the Dragon Radar,
this is hopeless!

130
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,125
[FRIEZA] Oh, and what
do we have here?

131
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,458
Well, well, well...

132
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,458
[FRIEZA chuckles]

133
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, I guess it's time for you
to get going, my little brother.

134
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,583
I know you can do it!

135
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,333
[GURU] Come here, boy.

136
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,000
[DENDE] Yes, Guru

137
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,666
[DENDE] Yes, Sir?

138
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,208
[GURU] I have a gift for you
to help you on your mission.

139
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,625
[GURU grunts]

140
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:08,750
[DENDE whimpers softly]

141
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,666
[GURU] It's okay, Dende.

142
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,625
Don't be scared
of this new power

143
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,791
that you feel
within you, son.

144
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:29,750
It has always existed inside
of you, I merely uncovered it.

145
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,125
Must I go?

146
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,208
[GURU] The sooner,
the better, my son.

147
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,166
Goodbye, Guru!

148
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,916
Please take care of yourself
while I'm gone, okay?

149
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:54,208
[GURU] Be strong,
my little warrior.

150
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,541
It pleases me that
in these dark hours,

151
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,833
a flame so small
burns brightly.

152
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,166
[GINYU] Of course,
I know what you are now!

153
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,666
You're not an ordinary Saiyan,
you're a-a... a Super Saiyan!

154
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,916
Huh?!

155
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,458
Call me what you want,
it doesn't matter to me.

156
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,708
Because the outcome is
still going to be the same!

157
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,666
This is what Frieza
was afraid of,

158
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,791
this is why he destroyed
the planet Vegeta!

159
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,041
[GINYU] Aargh! Why me?!

160
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,583
Rrgh! I am the
great Captain Ginyu!

161
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,541
[JEICE] That's it, Captain!
Remember who you are!

162
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,833
Sir! He's making you
lose your composure

163
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:52,375
and forget about style!
Don't let him do it!

164
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,500
[GOKU] My offer still stands!
We don't have to fight!

165
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,875
[GINYU] Hmm...?

166
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,166
[GOKU] You can still choose
to admit you're wrong

167
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,125
and leave this place!

168
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,500
Alright!

169
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,875
One way or the other,
let's settle this right now!

170
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,791
It's your choice!

171
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,000
You're serious,
aren't you!

172
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,500
You'd let us go? We
could leave just like that?

173
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,000
Mm-hmm. Yeah, why not?

174
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,333
You're the ones
who will suffer most

175
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,125
for what you've done
to these people.

176
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,750
It's bad karma!

177
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,750
Bad karma?

178
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,875
[GOKU] That's right!

179
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,500
You'll have to reap
what you've sown.

180
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,625
[GINYU thinking] Wait a second.
Something's not right here!

181
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,625
Super Saiyans are supposed
to be radically efficient

182
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:36,958
killing machines. But this
guy is as gentle as a lamb!

183
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,666
He must not be a fully
developed Super Saiyan,

184
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,791
which means he still
has weaknesses!

185
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,500
And I think I
just figured out

186
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,166
what this guy's
greatest weakness is!

187
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,916
Yeah. Yeah! Yeeaah!

188
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,583
I thought I was
dealing with a lion here

189
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,541
but now I realize you're
just a pussycat!

190
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,541
Huh?

191
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,250
[GINYU] You heard me!
Ha ha ha!

192
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,708
Yes, my friend!

193
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,708
It's hard to win fights when
you're way too forgiving.

194
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,958
[GINYU] And I know you
wouldn't even hurt a fly

195
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,666
if you didn't have
to, would you?

196
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,000
[GINYU chuckles]

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,625
[FRIEZA] Oh, to sip from
the cup of eternity,

198
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,583
and fly free on wings
of immortality!

199
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,250
[FRIEZA giggles]

200
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,833
[DENDE] Hm?!

201
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,291
[FRIEZA] Hmm?

202
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,750
It's just a brat.

203
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,583
Kids are learning to fly
so young these days.

204
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,166
[GURU] The evil one
has arrived, Nail.

205
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,666
[NAIL] Yes, Guru.
I feel his presence.

206
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,916
[FRIEZA chuckles]

207
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,125
[FRIEZA] Hello,
is anybody home?

208
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,833
[NAIL] Yes, I'm home.
Welcome, "friend".

209
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,916
[FRIEZA] Why,
thank you very much.

210
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,875
I'm a visitor here,
touring your lovely planet

211
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,916
and I happened to find
seven Dragon Balls!

212
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
A man at the gift shop
told me about

213
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,083
the legend behind the
balls; about the wish.

214
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,375
[FRIEZA] But the balls don't
work unless you have a password.

215
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,583
Would you happen to know
the password, my good man?

216
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,541
Not me.

217
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,583
You should check with the
Chamber of Commerce, "friend".

218
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,333
They have that sort
of information.

219
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,375
[FRIEZA chuckles]

220
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,583
[FRIEZA] The Chamber is dead...

221
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,875
And so are you if you
don't tell me the password.

222
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,416
[scouter beeping]

223
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,875
[FRIEZA] Hmm?

224
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,708
Hm...

225
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,166
Huh?!

226
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,666
Well, well. Friends
of yours, I presume?

227
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,833
I hope you boys don't plan
on ganging up on me now.

228
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,333
That wouldn't be fair!

229
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,208
Four strong men
against just one of me.

230
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,583
Go back...

231
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,500
[FRIEZA] Hm...

232
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,416
Hmph.

233
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,666
So, we arrived
just in time!

234
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,791
[NAIL growls]

235
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,125
Look! I can handle
this! It'd be better

236
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,625
if you guys took off!

237
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,250
Oh, I get it, Nail.

238
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,875
You want all the glory
for yourself, huh?

239
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,583
Well, forget it!
He destroyed our village!

240
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,000
This guy is ours.

241
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,916
Bald and bold, heh!

242
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,583
[FRIEZA] Oh, my!

243
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,333
[FRIEZA] Goodness!

244
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,500
Well, I don't want to
burst your bubble, boys.

245
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:47,416
But, you have the fighting
power of a boy's scout troop!

246
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,208
We can play if you'd like,
but it will be your last game!

Please, listen!

You don't have--

Don't worry
about us, Nail!

My dear man, do you
know the password

266
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,250
which activates
the Dragon Balls?

Well, do you?

00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,375
[FRIEZA] I can't hear you.
Perhaps if I let go?

00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,833
There!

[FRIEZA] Why so blue,
lizard

275
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,833
You look so stressed,
but everything's fine!

276
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:50,041
Just tell me the password.
It's that simple.

277
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,000
Or... your friend could tell.
Would you rather have me

278
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,750
extract the information
from your friend?

279
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,750
Look! My friend
is very old.

280
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,958
He's dying as it is, and
he doesn't need your help!

281
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,625
You wouldn't
harm him anyway!

Think about it:

283
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,125
If he dies than you can't
use the Dragon Balls

284
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,541
because he created
the Dragon Balls.

285
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,750
And when he goes, they
go with him, got it?

286

Ohh...

Besides, look; he's
a very sensitive person.

He's spent his whole life
healing and teaching our people.

Nice to meet you.

a conversationalist, huh?

at me because I didn't knock?

How rude!

Maybe you'd speak
up if your friend here

300
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,750
was crying out in pain?
Whatd'ya think?!

301
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,750
I think you would be the
one crying out in pain

if you fought him.

He's not like the other Nameks
that you've fought so far.

00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,916
You obviously don't like
to exchange pleasantries.

317
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,208
Very well, then, let's cut
straight to the chase, shall we?

318
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,708
What's the password?

319
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,333
[JEICE] That's it, Captain!
You're looking good, mate!

320
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:17,166
eter!
I'd say you're back to a full
"ten" on the style

321
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:24,375
[GINYU] Yes, style! That's
us, the mighty Ginyu Force!

322
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,208
We're professionals!

323
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,166
For us, killing is
just part of the job!

324
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,000
But it's not like that
for you, is it?

325
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,125
[GINYU chuckles]

326
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,333
You can't beat us!

327
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,541
[GINYU chuckles]

328
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,791
[laughing]

329
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:44,625
[NARRATOR] Has Captain Ginyu
exposed Goku's only weakness?

330
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,500
Does the Saiyan from
Earth have what it takes

331
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,541
to defeat the Ginyu Force?

332
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:53,875
Tune in next time
for Dragon Ball Z!
