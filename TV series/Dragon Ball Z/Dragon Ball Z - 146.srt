Krillin, are you alright?

understand it!

[CELL] Goku is still alive?

190
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,291
[KRILLIN] Yeah, of course he is!

191

[CELL] Goku's alive...

192
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,583
So, this history is somehow
different from the one I know.

193
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,125
[TRUNKS thinking]
Even Cell knew it!

194
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,916
The timeline in this world is
playing out very differently

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,541
from the one we
knew in the future.

196

Nothing is happening
as I expected it to!

And I can't figure
out what it was

198
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,291

so far off course!

[TRUNKS yells]

204
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,791
[TRUNKS] My battle with Frieza
was three years ago now.

205
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,000
With the element of
surprise on my side

206
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,500
I defeated him and
his father easily.

207
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,458
But I knew it
wouldn't end there...

208
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,208
I came from the future to warn
Goku and his friends

209
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,083
of an even greater threat
that was on the way.

210
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,000
It was hard for them to believe,

211
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,791
but Frieza would be the
least of their problems.

212
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,291
[TRUNKS] Goku was unaware that
he would catch a deadly virus.

213
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,375
Of course,
how could he ever know?

214
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,625
But I felt that if I gave him
the antidote to save his life,

215
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,500
he would survive and be strong
enough to help me defeat

216
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,375
Dr. Gero's androids,

217
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,875
both in this world
and in my future world!

218
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,791
When I later came
back to this time,

219
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,250
I found that the
timeline I had expected

220
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,041
was slipping out of control.

221
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,583
Something had changed!

222
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,458
Goku was nowhere to be found.

223
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,291
Neither were the androids
that terrorized my world.

224
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:11,791
Instead, that strange Android 19
and the maniacal android version

225
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,041
of Dr. Gero had
appeared in their place!

226
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,958
[TRUNKS] At last,
Androids 17 and 18,

227
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,958
the androids I expected
to find did arrive.

228
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,791
But along with them came
yet another new android...

229
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,791
One that may be even more
terrible than the rest!

230
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,416
Why hadn't he been
activated in my time?

231
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,000
How many other evil schemes

232
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,916
had Dr. Gero planned of
which I was unaware?

233
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,750
I guess I learned the answer to
that question soon enough...

234
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,541
[ANDROID 16 sighs]

235
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,333
[TRUNKS] That's when
we discovered that Cell,

236
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,708
Dr. Gero's ultimate
creation had arrived.

237
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,875
That creature...

238
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,708
That terrible creature
from the future!

239
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,833
By my calculations he
must have arrived here

240
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,958
at least a year before I did...

241
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,208
Lying dormant until
the time was right

242
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,333
for him to unite with
Dr. Gero's other androids.

243
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,916
But I don't understand how the
ship he came here in

244
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,416
could be exactly
the same as mine?

245
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,333
In fact, that ship IS mine!

[TRUNKS] By travelling back
and forth through time,

247
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,166
have I unwillingly had
a negative effect

248
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,958
on the future of this world?

249
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,583
Am I responsible for
everything that has happened

250
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,041
up to this point?

251
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,291
Maybe I've had no effect
on anything at all!

252
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,125
Either way there is
no way of stopping

[TRUNKS] My father is right!

257
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
Now I must follow his lead

258
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,583
and find some way to push
myself to the next level.

only hope we have

of beating the Androids
and saving this world!

tired of this routine!

this time, Piccolo.

closer to catching him

[REPORTER 2] The creature
continues its path

of relentless destruction,

coming. Then he's ours!

Yeah, when all of us
jump out of this plane

time, he won't stand a chance!

come at him from all sides,

Androids attacking?!

321
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,291
[ROSHI growls]

322
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,916
[CHICHI screams]

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,291
[ROSHI screams]

324
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,625
Will you stop that?!

325
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,875
Why'd you dump a
bucket on my head?!

326
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,041
[crashing]

327
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,541
[CHICHI screams]

328
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,916
[ROSHI screams]

329
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,250
Will you please
stop screaming now?!

330
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,625
If you wanted a
hug... well...

331
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,000
You could've just asked!

332
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,541
[ROSHI chuckles]

333
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,958
[ROSHI yells]

334
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,875
Thank you...
That was nice...

335
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,500
Good night...

336
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,125
[CHICHI gasps]

337
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,583
Goku!

338
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,583
Goku! What...?

339
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,625
[CHICHI] Goku...?

340
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,333
[CHICHI gasps]

341
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,541
[ROSHI] Huh? What's going on?

342
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,541
Huh?

343
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,916
Well, you sure don't
see that everyday...

344
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,333
[CHICHI gasps]

345
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,916
--Goku!
--Hey, Goku!

346
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,666
[CHICHI laughs]

347
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,375
[ROSHI chuckles]

348
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,041
Hey! Wait up!

349
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,833
[GOKU yells]

350
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,875
[ROSHI stammers]

351
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,000
[ROSHI yells]

352
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,083
[CHICHI] Goku!

353
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,041
[CHICHI laughs]

354
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,666
Hey!

355
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, Goku!

356
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,333
[CHICHI sobs]

357
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,708
I'm sorry I
worried you, ChiChi.

358
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:16,458
Everything's gonna be alright.
I'm all better now.

359
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,958
Are you sure, Goku?

360
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,125
Yeah! Here, see for yourself!

361
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,125
[BOTH laugh]

362
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,458
Oh, Goku!

363
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,000
[BOTH laugh]

364
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,750
[CHICHI screams]

365
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,333
Uh-oh...

366
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,458
I've really gotta start
watching my strength.

367
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,625
[CHICHI screams]

368
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,041
Oh my!

369
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,333
Sorry about that.

370
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,041
[GOKU laughs]

371
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,125
[ROSHI] Goku!

372
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,500
Oh, hi!

373
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,208
[ROSHI] So,
you're all better?

374
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,458
Sure! I feel just fine!

375
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,541
In my dreams I could hear
everything that was going on.

376
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,041
We're in deep trouble aren't we?

377
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,666
But... I'm not ready
to fight just yet...

378
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,583
Goku? Why not?

379
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,375
Of course he's not.
You still need to rest.

380
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,291
So just stay put!

381
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,541
Hey, I'm alright.
Just relax now...

382
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:13,375
It's time for me to start
my training once again!

383
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,375
It's time for me to
move to the next level!

384
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,250
[CHICHI gasps]

385
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,916
What?

386
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,750
[GOKU] Vegeta knows it too.

387
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,791
Through my dreams,
I could hear him speaking

388
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,541
what I had also felt.

389
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,500
That there is a level beyond
that of a Super Saiyan...

390
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,541
And I will rise to claim it!

391
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,000
Huh?!

392
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,166
[NARRATOR] Has Goku
lost his mind?

393
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,291
Maybe he's still
running a fever?

394
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,041
He seems determined to take
his Super Saiyan powers

395
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,291
to the next level. But is it
actually possible for him

396
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,666
to become an
Ascended Saiyan?

397
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,291
Find out on the
next Dragon Ball Z!
