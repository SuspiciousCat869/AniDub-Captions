00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,041
[GOKU]
I'd better get moving...

2
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,416
Goku was running
down Snake Way,

4
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,583
hoping to get some special
martial arts training

5
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,708
from the legendary
King Kai...

6
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,625
Meanwhile Gohan was busy

7
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,916
with his own survival
training back on Earth.

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And the young
Saiyan soon learned

9
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,166
that it's not easy when you're
out in the world all alone.

10
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,875
Friends are hard
to hold on to,

11
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,833
especially when
they're the main course

12
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,541
on the menu for
a hungry T-Rex!

13
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:42,000
Careful Gohan, or you could
end up being his dessert!

14
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,500
Luckily, Gohan's a
natural born fighter,

15
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,125
just like his
father Goku.

16
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,000
But he hasn't developed
the fighting skills

17
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,375
of his father yet.

18
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,541
And with his dino buddy
digested by the big T-Rex,

19
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,833
Gohan soon found out,
only the strong survive!

20
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,333
Speaking of strong...

21
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,708
Two sinister Saiyans are headed
towards Earth right now.

22
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,500
Every minute
they get closer

23
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,166
and that means
it won't be long

24
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,958
before we all find out what
the big bang theory really is...

25
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,875
Keep your eyes on the skies and
get ready for Dragon Ball Z!

26
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:29,041

Catch me if you can!
Nyah! Nyah!

46
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,416
Great! It looks like
tail steak for breakfast!

47
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,333
Hey... You won't have much of
a tail if you keep this up.

48
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,500
I used to have a
tail too, you know!

49
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,791
[T-REX groans]

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,375
So, he's starting to
master the training.

51
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,000
[chuckles]

52
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,041
[NARRATOR] Somewhere, deep
in the vastness of space,

53
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,916
the two Saiyan warriors
continue their journey

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,291
towards planet Earth.

[beeping]

60
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,833
[YAMCHA] Oh boy!

61
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,583
I can't believe Kami
is going to train me!

62
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,208
I'm so excited I can hardly
wait to get started!

63
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,833
Just take it easy, Yamcha.

64
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,333
You know we
have to find out

65
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,333
where Tien and
Chiaotzu are first!

66

[KRILLIN laughs]

67
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,833
I bet they'll be surprised
to see us! Heh, heh!

68
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,583
And once we
find those two,

69
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,333
Yamcha can start his
training with Kami

70
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,083
and then no one will be
able to beat him in battle!

71
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,583
That's right...

72
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,791
I'll be ready for anything!

73
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,000
[KRILLIN and PUAR laugh]

74
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,625
[PUAR] You said it!
That'll be great!

75
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,750
[YAMCHA] Hey, step on it,
would ya, Bulma?!

76
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:41,416
[VEGETA] Nappa? Nappa?
Are you awake?

[NAPPA groans]

78
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,000
I am now.
What's going on?

79
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,791
Nothing much.

80
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,041
But, I thought we'd make a stop
and stretch our legs a bit.

81
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,000
Get some exercise.

82
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,541
[VEGETA] Planet Arlia's
not far from here.

83
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,750
Maybe we can sell it
for a nice price.

84
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,791
That sounds good.

I hope these Arlians
know how to fight,

real competition

[NAPPA] There's not much
to this place is there?

92
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,333
[VEGETA] Obviously not.

93
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,458
Let's have a look
around shall we?

94
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,666
Are you sure you can get a
high price for this planet?

95
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,375
Doubt it...

around a little more.

on Arlian territory!

and we'll blast ya!

go hunting after all!

we were too much for them!

Eh, they sure are ugly!

The new king of Arlia
is very ruthless.

He uses us prisoners
for his own amusement.

So you can imagine
the pain I feel.

161
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,208
[KING] Lemlia please,
you have to eat something.

162
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,791
[LEMLIA] No thank you.
I'm not hungry.

163
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,375
[KING]
Don't be so stubborn...

164
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,041
You have to put the
past behind you...

165
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,958
You are my Queen now.

166
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,791
[LEMLIA] No! There is only
one that I truly love.

167
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,916
[FIGHTER 2 yells and groans]

168
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,750
[KING]
Enough!

169
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:24,125
Take Gregor to the pit!
Esaw is the new champion!

170
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,833
[GREGOR]
No, not the pit!

171
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,458
Please, Sire, not the pit! No!

172
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,000
This isn't fair!

173
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,833
[GREGOR screams]

174
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,833
No! Please.
Don't leave me down here!

175
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,041
Give me another chance!

176
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,666
[GREGOR screams]

177
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,583
No, Yeddy!
Please, stay away from me!

178
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,416
Stay away! A-Ahhh!

179
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:12,583
[GREGOR screams]

180
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,750
[KING sighs]

181
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,458
[KING] I'm suffering
from royal boredom!

182
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,250
[ATTENDANT] Sire, earlier
today we captured two aliens.

183
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,541
They're in
the dungeon now!

184
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,958
[KING]
Aliens?

185
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,583
Have the guards bring them
to the arena immediately.

186
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,125
Maybe they can provide some
entertainment fit for a king!

187
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,541
[VEGETA] Don't put yourselves
out! We're already here!

188
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,125
[KING] What's the
meaning of this?

189
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,666
Why don't these prisoners have
an armed escort in my chamber?

190
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,875
[ATTENDANT]
I don't know, Sire!

191
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,416
No orders were even
sent to the dungeon.

192
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,083
[VEGETA] Your guards met with
an unfortunate accident.

193
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,916
[ATLA] Now's my chance to
get out of this place.

194
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,958
[PRISONERS groan]

195
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,416
[ATLA] I must to get to
the King's chamber at once!

196
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,666
Amazing!

197
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,541
Those two aliens melted
through the cell bars.

198
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,666
That makes things a
lot easier for me!

199
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,166
[KING] How dare you!

200
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,458
Soon it will be your turn

201
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,666
to meet with an
unfortunate accident.

202
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,708
You may not want to
watch this, my dear.

203
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,958
[LEMLIA]
Very well.

204
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,875
[KING] I'll see that my
guards make short work

205
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,583
of these
repulsive creatures!

206
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,833
Really?

207
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,958
[KING]
Ah, let's see!

208
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,750
Yes, we'll test the big
one with the shiny head

209
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,625
against our
champion in combat!

210
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,291
We'll save the
little one for last,

211
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,041
he won't put up much of
a fight I'm sure!

212
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,375
Now teach
them a lesson!

213
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,583
[ESAW] Yes, Sire!

214
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,000
[KING]
And Esaw?

215
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,583
I'll see that you
retire a wealthy man

216
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,375
if you can defeat
both of them.

217
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,125
Now begin!

218
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,625
[ESAW] Haa!

219
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,208
[ESAW yowls]

220
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,125
[KING] Huh?!

221
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,208
[ESAW screams]

222
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,000
[NAPPA] Heh! I guess that makes
you the new champion, Vegeta!

223
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:49,916
[VEGETA chuckles]

224
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,333
[KING]
Not bad!

225
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,541
But ten of our finest warriors
have mastered techniques

226
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,458
using energy
just like yours!

227
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,250
They have? Interesting!
We'd like to fight them!

228
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,541
Ready?

229
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,250
[KING] I'll see you suffer
for your insolence!

230
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,625
[NAPPA] Yeah, whatever.
Can we get on with this already?

231
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,041
[KING]
Ah! How dare you!

232
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,500
C'mon, your
heinousness!

233
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,541
Bring on that cricket brigade
of yours! We're ready!

234
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,208
[KING] Take a good look
at my Elite Royal Guards.

235
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,541
Now, you won't be talking
so tough, will you?

236
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,166
[ROYAL GUARD 1]
Fire!

237
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,500
[chuckles]

238
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,958
[gasps]

239
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,541
Was that it? It felt good.
Real refreshing!

240
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,250
[KING]
Oh, I'll make you pay!

241
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,375
If you think you can
just walk out of here,

242
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,416
you are sadly
mistaken!

243
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,291
Guards attack!
Destroy them!

244
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,666
[ROYAL GUARD 3]
We got 'em now!

245
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,791
[ROYAL GUARD 6]
Attack!

246
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,333
[NAPPA laughs]

247
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,375
[ROYAL GUARDS yell]

248
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,208
[GOKU thinking]
Where's King Kai's place?

249
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,916
It's got to be around
here somewhere!

250
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:19,833
[NAPPA yells]

251
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,125
[ROYAL GUARDS whimper]

252
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:34,791
[NAPPA yells]

253
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,750
[KING] Release Yeddy!
Release Yeddy!

254
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,250
Hurry before it's too late!

255
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:52,750
[rumbling]

256
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:13,083
[YEDDY growls gutturally]

257
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,208
So, it's the old giant
bug in the ground trick!

258
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,875
[KING] Yeddy,
destroy these creatures!

259
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,500
They're bad!
Very, very bad!

260
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,625
We're bad?

261
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, a little.

262
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,208
[VEGETA] Over here!

263
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,083
[NAPPA] Hey, ugly!

264
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,291
[NAPPA grunts]

265
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:58,875
[KING] That fool! He's no
match for Yeddy's strength!

266
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:03,916
[NAPPA grunts]

267
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:13,541
[YEDDY roars]

268
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,125
[KING] No!

269
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,833
Hey! I've got one more
little surprise for you!

270
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,291
[NAPPA grunts]

271
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,416
Yaah! It's your
going away present!

272
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,041
[KING]
No! Impossible!

273
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,791
Coward!

274
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,625
[KING] Please!
Don't hurt me!

275
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:42,041
Aaahh!

276
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,416
[ATLA] It sounds like there's
a battle going on up there!

277
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,833
I'm coming for
you, Lemlia.

278
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,500
What? Unbelievable!

279
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:56,583
The king and his Royal
Guard have been destroyed!

280
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,541
[VEGETA]
Computer.

281
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,208
[COMPUTER]
Yes, Prince Vegeta?

282
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,208
[VEGETA]
Send the pods at once.

283
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,083
[COMPUTER]
Initiating retrieval sequence.

284
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,333
[ATLA] Do you two realize
what you have done?

285
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,250
You have freed our planet
from centuries of bondage!

286
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,958
At last Arlia is a place where
a new beginning can be made!

287
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,875
From now on you two
visitors from space

288
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,291
will be known as heroes
among our people.

289
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,916
I can't begin to tell you
how very grateful I am.

290
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,250
[ATLA]
Farewell, my friends!

291
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,000
You will always be
welcome here on Arlia!

292
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,583
[ATLA] Thank you!

293
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
We will never forget you!

294
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,791
[LEMLIA] Atla?

295
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,041
[ATLA] Huh?

296
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,333
[LEMLIA] Atla! Thank goodness!
You're alive!

297
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,416
[ATLA] Do my eyes deceive me?
Is it really you, Lemlia?

298
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,708
[LEMLIA] Yes, it's me,
Altla, your Lemlia!

299
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,666
[ATLA] You don't know how happy
I am to see you, my love!

300
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,041
[VEGETA] 
Let's go, Nappa!

301
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,083
We couldn't give away
this place if we wanted to.

302
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,375
[NAPPA] But that thing back
there said we were heroes!

303
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,750
Being a hero is
highly overrated.

304
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:02,875
Ergh. Too bad, I guess, that
was a big waste of time then.

305
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,625
[VEGETA] Don't worry there's
still Earth to conquer!

306
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,500
[LEMLIA] Atla!

307
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,750
[VEGETA] Hold on. I've got
some unfinished business

308
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,958
to take care of...

309
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,250
This planet has a
serious bug problem.

310
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,875
[ATLA] 
Lemlia, my darling!

311
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,041
[LEMLIA]
Atla!

312
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,083
[giggles]

313
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,166
[LEMLIA]
Atla, my love!

314
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,625
[ATLA] My darling! At last
we can be together forever!

315
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,916
[LEMLIA and ATLA giggle]

316
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,208
There's nothing like
a little fireworks

317
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,625
when you say goodbye!

318
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:01,000
[NAPPA] Heh! Their moon, too!
Nice touch!

319
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:05,916
[VEGETA] I think we've
made the universe

320
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,333
a cleaner
place today.

321
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,041
Arlia deserved
what they got.

322
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,333
I just hope Earth is a lot
better than that planet.

323
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,208
It will be...
Earth has the Dragon Balls.

324
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,416
Once we find them, we can
wish for whatever we want!

325
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,541
Hm. Immortality,
here we come!

326
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:32,041
[evil laughing]

327
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,375
[NARRATOR] The dangerous
duo is on a mission

328
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,458
and they've got Earth
in their sights.

329
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,666
What the world needs
now is a hero,

330
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,791
someone to
save the day.

331
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:47,083
Someone like Goku, but he's
still busy on Snake Way.

332
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,166
[GOKU] Doesn't this
road ever end?!

333
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,500
[NARRATOR]
We'll find out...

334
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,666
on the next
exciting episode

335
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,416
of Dragon Ball Z!
