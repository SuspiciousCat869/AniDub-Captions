[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragonball Z,

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,916
the androids that invaded Earth

3
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,875
went head-to-head
and fist-to-fist

4
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,416
with Vegeta, Piccolo,
Tien, and Trunks,

5
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,958
and left them bruised,
battered, and broken.

6
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,416
Frozen with fear,
Krillin watched in horror

7
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,875
as his friends took
it on the chin.

8
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,750
And Goku continued to battle

9
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,083
the illness that has
him in its clutches.

10
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,250
[KRILLIN] Stop!
You leave Goku alone!

11
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,666
No. I am programmed
to destroy Goku.

12
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,750
[ANDROID 17]
There you go.

13
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,500
16 has been programmed
to destroy Goku.

14
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,791
So that's what
we're going to do!

15
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,375
[KRILLIN] What is this?
Some kind of game?!

16
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,791
That's right, friend.

17
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,333
And finding Goku is
part of the game.

18
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,875
[KRILLIN whimpering]

19
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,208
Good luck!

20
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,833
Bye!

21
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,666
[NARRATOR] The good guys
are down for the count

22
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,166
and the androids seem
to be getting stronger.

23
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,958
Now that Krillin
is on his own,

24
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,500
can he revive his friends
and intercept the androids

25
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,666
before they reach Goku?

26
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,375
[KRILLIN thinking]
They're going after Goku!

27
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,291
If they find him, he's history!

28
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,708
Oh no! I forgot
the other guys!

29
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,875
[VEGETA groaning quietly]

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,333
[KRILLIN] Let's see now...

31
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,916
We should have six
beans left beteween us.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,750
I hope it's enough for
everybody to have one...

33
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,291
[KRILLIN] Hey! Tien,
can you hear me?

34
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,875
[TIEN grunting]

35
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,083
[KRILLIN] Are you alright?

36
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,083
[TRUNKS growls]

37
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,916
Here, take this.

38
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,583
[KRILLIN] Hmm?

39
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,750
Vegeta looks like he's
in pretty rough shape.

40
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:42,083
I guess I need to give
Vegeta a couple of beans.

41
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,750
[PICCOLO] What?!

42
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,041
You mean they even knew
about the Senzu beans?!

43
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,333
[TIEN] I don't get it!

44
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,208
They know everything about us!

45
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,041
Why didn't they
just finish us off?!

46
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,583
Those two could have squashed
all of us like flies!

47
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,666
They were just toying with us!

48
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,750
Man, this is
all Vegeta's fault!

49
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,458
Hey, don't blame him!

50
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,916
We all underestimated
their strength.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,625
Which was a mistake!

52
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,125
But we can't afford
to make any more.

53
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:19,000
The androids may not
be so forgiving next time!

54
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:24,041
[VEGETA growling]

55
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,583
Vegeta!

56
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,083
[PICCOLO] Trunks!
Let him go! Stop!

57
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,166
[TRUNKS] Huh?!

58
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,125
Leave him alone.

59
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,416
Ever since Vegeta
became a Super Saiyan

60
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,000
his ego has been
out of control.

61
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,458
Honestly, I think what
that Android hurt

62
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,083
the most today
was his pride.

63
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,791
He is very ashamed
of his defeat.

64
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,416
[TIEN] I know how he feels...

65
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,958
We worked so hard...

66
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,083
But they were still stronger
than all of us put together...

67
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,958
No, Tien. I'm sorry.

68
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,416
I should've been
fighting right

69
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,708
alongside with you guys,
but I was just too scared...

70
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,041
Don't sweat it.

71
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,000
Trunks is a Super Saiyan
and it only took one punch

72
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,916
from those androids to
take him out of the fight.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,833
Even if you'd
joined us, Krillin,

74
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,375
we would not have won today.

75
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,875
Oh, man!

76
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,125
I wish Goku was here!

77
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,083
Trunks, you were able to take
out Frieza single-handedly.

78
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,458
You're one of the strongest
people I've ever met.

79
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,416
But those Androids
tossed you aside

80
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,666
as though you were nothing!

81
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,125
[TRUNKS growls]

82
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,166
Goku is strong.

83
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,583
But in all honesty,
I don't see how he can be

84
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,708
that much stronger
than Trunks or Vegeta.

85
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,666
And if that's the case,
we're done for!

86
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,750
[KRILLIN whimpers]

87
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:53,958
No!

88
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:54,958
I don't get it...

89
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,375
It's strange...

90
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,000
These androids
are much stronger

91
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,166
than the ones
I fought in my time.

92
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,375
[KRILLIN &amp; TIEN gasp]

93
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,458
Wait, Trunks,
what do you mean?

94
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,166
The androids I fought
were stronger than me,

95
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,750
but not this much.

96
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:11,833
The kind of strength these new
androids have is off the charts!

97
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,750
[TIEN] Then we really
are out of luck!

98
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,375
What should we do?

99
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,750
You three go to Goku's and
move him some place safe.

100
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,708
He'll be able to join
you once he's well.

101
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,541
It's obvious that
we're going to need

102
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,208
all the help we can get
to defeat these androids.

103
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,791
Good idea!

104
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:35,875
But, Piccolow, what are you
going to be doing, huh?

105
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:36,916
[PICCOLO growls]

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,625
I don't know.

107
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,708
[KRILLIN] Come on.

108
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,208
I know you've
come up with a plan.

109
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,041
Why don't you just tell
us what your scheme is

110
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,416
Come on we're
buddies now, aren't we?

111
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,166
Listen to me!

112
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,291
Stop asking questions!

113
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,250
It's none of your concern!

114
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,500
This is something
that I have to do alone!

115

[KRILLIN] Piccolo! What do
you think you're doing?!

122
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,625
I'm leaving!

123
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,541
And anyone who tries to
follow me will be sorry!

124
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,583
Just find Goku!

125
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,708
And forget about me!

126
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,166
What's with him? Did I
miss something here?

127
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,375
I haven't seen
Piccolo act like that

128
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,958
since back in the old days

129
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,208
when he was trying to destroy
Goku and take over the world!

[TIEN growls]

131
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,750
It doesn't make sense!

132
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,875
Last I heard, Piccolo
was fighting on our side!

133
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,291
Don't worry, Tien.

134
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,583
Piccolo just has
a lot on his mind.

135
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,375
He's still one
of the good guys.

136
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,708
This is one fight
we can't afford to lose.

137
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,500
And if we want to
beat these Androids,

138
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,583
it's going to take
everything that we've got!

139
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:06,291
Piccolo is just doing what
he thinks he has to do to win!

140
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:10,125
Don't worry. He'll be okay!

141
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,166
Krillin! "He'll be okay"?
What are you talking about?!

142
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,916
You saw Piccolo fly
in that direction right?

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,125
Try and guess where
you thing he's going.

144
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,625
[TIEN] Is this a trick question?

145
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,791
Uh, gee...

146
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,041
How am I supposed to know?

147
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,583
Come on, tell me where he went!

148
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,458
To Kami's place!

149
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,625
To Kami's place?!

150
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,000
Piccolo and Kami are
one and the same.

151
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,500
Piccolo is
the embodiment

152
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,750
of all the negative energy
that's inside Kami.

153
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,541
They were once one being,
but split in two.

154
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,541
That's why they'll always
share a common bond.

155
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,958
[TIEN] Yeah?

156
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,416
I remember Master Roshi
telling me something long ago.

157
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,625
He said that if Kami and
Piccolo hadn't split into two,

158
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,458
they'd be the strongest being
in the entire universe.

159
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,958
Hell-oh? Get it?!

160
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,291
The reason Piccolo has
gone to Kami's place

161
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,541
is so that he can
join with him again.

162
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,708
Really?

163
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,291
If those two unite
again into one being,

164
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,083
they'll become the
ultimate Namek warrior!

165
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,500
And Piccolo is stronger
than he's ever been before,

166
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,208
so together they'll
be an unstoppable force!

167
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,541
Look! You know what
a Super Saiyan is!

168
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:20,458
Piccolo and Kami will
become a "Super Namek!"

169
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:25,958
You say a "Super Namek," huh?
We could sure use that!

170
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,958
Wait a minute,
if they unite,

171
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,208
Kami will disappear and
the Dragon Balls will too!

172
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,500
Yeah, that may be true...

173
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:37,125
But it's no better if Piccolo
is destroyed by the androids.

174
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:41,041
In either case, the
Dragon Balls will disappear!

175
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,708
Think about it.

176
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,750
There's no other way to defeat
these androids on our own.

177
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,416
If Piccolo's thinking of uniting
with Kami, he must be desperate,

178
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,375
and he figures that
this is our last chance

179
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,208
to get out of this mess!

180
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,833
It's too bad...

181
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,375
Piccolo and Kami
really don't get along.

182
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,458
My father,
I mean Vegeta.

183
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,208
We can't forget about him!

184
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,958
There's no reason for you
to hide it anymore, Trunks.

185
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,333
We all know about
Bulma and Vegeta

186
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,125
and the fact that
they had a baby.

187
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,666
And that baby is you;
you're their son, right?

188
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,166
[TRUNKS gasps]

189
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,750
I guess Vegeta's the only
one who doesn't know.

190
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,916
[TRUNKS] I kept it
a secret... I'm sorry.

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,333
[TIEN] You don't
have to apologize.

192
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:34,000
As for Vegeta, I'm sure he'll
be back once he cools off a bit.

193
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,125
I know he's too proud
to run away from a fight.

194
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,458
He just needs some time

195
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,416
to work some things
out for himself.

196
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,916
Then I'm sure he'll be back
stronger than he ever was!

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,375
Yeah!

198
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:59,416
I'll show those androids!
No one makes a fool of me!

199
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,083
They'll pay for this!
They should have finished me off

200
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,333
when they had the chance,

201
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:07,083
because I will
show them no mercy!

202
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,291
[TV MAN] I'm sorry, Beverly.

203
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,291
There's someone else.
I don't love you anymore.

204
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,000
So, goodbye...

205
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,208
No...

206
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,166
No, don't leave me...

207

Please don't go...
Come back! Rex, come back!

Wait right, here okay?!

[ROSHI] Hey, Maron?
What's up? What's happening?

232
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,958
[MARON] Oh,
I was bored

233
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,833
so I thought I'd call
a few boyfriends.

234
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:49,375
[ROSHI] These guys are
all your boyfriends?!

235
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,833
Oh, what's a girl to do?

236
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,541
All these boys are so cute;
it's hard to pick just one!

237
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,000
[ROSHI yells]

238
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,250
Say "Hello" to Krillin for me!

239
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:04,916
And I'll see you guys
later, okay? Buh-bye!

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,916
Looks like she's
gone for good.

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,541
Oh yeah, she's
gone alright.

242
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,250
Maron's a nice girl

243
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,041
but I don't think she's
the right type for Krillin.

244
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,625
Now, listen... When
Krillin gets here,

245
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,666
don't tell him
Maron was around.

246
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,916
I don't think the
boy could take it.

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,916
Right!

248
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,375
What a darn shame...

249
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,541
If only I were a younger man...

250
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,416
Then maybe I could have been
one of Maron's boyfriends too!

251
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,916
It's not fair! It's not!

252
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,291
Trunks, tell me something...

253
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,541
That medicine that
you gave to Goku,

254
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,416
how long will it take
before it makes him well?

255
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,666
In Goku's case...

256
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,083
I'd say it'll take
about ten days or so.

257
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,625
Ten days, huh?

258
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,458
We should be able to hide him
somewhere safe for ten days.

259
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,916
[TIEN] Yeah... No problem.

260
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,500
Of course there's no guarantee

that we'll be able to beat those
androids once Goku gets well.

can manage to stay

320
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,416
I came to this
place to face

321
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,500
the former guardian of Earth
and to ask for his throne.

322
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,916
[KAMI] The former
guardian was not impressed

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,166
by what he saw in me, a brash,
young warrior from Namek.

324
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,583
He was not willing to relinquish
the guardianship of Earth

325
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,791
to any creature
he felt unworthy...

326
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,041
[FORMER GUARDIAN]
There is a great evil

327
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,333
deep in your heart...

328
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:20,333
If you wish to take my place,
you must rid yourself of it...

329
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:24,750
Rid yourself of the evil
before it consumes you!

330
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,208
[KAMI grunts]

331
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,916
[KAMI] The former
guardian's words

332
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,416
stirred something
within me...

333
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,958
Although I had done
my best to suppress it,

334
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,583
I had always sensed a darker
nature lurking in my heart.

335
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,375
The guardian confirmed this
beyond a shadow of a doubt...

336
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,750
Only through intense
training was I able

337
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,333
to separate myself
from this dark force.

338
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,791
The dark force that
became Piccolo!

339
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,208
With my heart pure,

340
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,458
I was able to take the
guardian's throne...

341
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,833
But King Piccolo,

342
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,583
fueled by his evil ambition
to control the world,

343
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,291
escaped to Earth.

344
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,000
[KING PICCOLO laughing]

345
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,958
[KAMI] Before he could carry out
his insidious plans, however,

346
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,625
a mysterious boy appeared...

347
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,291
That boy was Goku!

348
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,916
[KING PICCOLO] No one
will stand in my way!

349
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,541
[GOKU grunts]

350
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,250
[GOKU growls]

351
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,375
[KING PICCOLO laughing]

352
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,833
[KING PICCOLO yells]

353
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,250
You're mine!

354
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,291
This planet belongs to no one!

355
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,041
No!

356
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,083
[GOKU yelling]

357
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,125
[yelling continues]

358
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,166
[GOKU grunts]

359
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,916
[KING PICCOLO gasps]

360
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,625
What?!

361
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,916
You're finished!

362
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,166
I'll squash you, insect!

363
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,458
[GOKU &amp; KING PICCOLO growl]

364
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,750
No! You're not
welcome here!

365
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,833
[crashing]

366
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,250
[KAMI] As his final,
desperate act,

367
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,541
King Piccolo sought
to preserve himself

368
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,208
by transferring his
essence into a single egg.

369
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:43,500
[KING PICCOLO grunts]

370
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,250
[KING PICCOLO screams]

371
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,208
[GOKU screams]

372
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:52,250
[KAMI] And that is how the
Piccolo we know today was born.

373
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,708
[PICCOLO chuckles]

374
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,083
And now the time has come

375
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,000
for the two of us
to unite as one

376
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,500
to face the
consequences together.

377
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,750
[KORIN thinking]
Uh-oh... There goes trouble.

378
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,458
[MR. POPO whimpers]

379
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,083
[PICCOLO thinking] You have
something I want, old man...

380
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,333
[KAMI thinking] You still have
a lot to learn, Piccolo.

381
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,083
[NARRATOR] While the
three killer androids

382
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,000
carry out their search
and destroy mission,

383
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,291
Piccolo is determined
to unite with Kami

384
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,583
in a last-ditch effort to stop
the three mechanical monsters.

385
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,291
But is he too late?

386
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,541
Find out next time,
on Dragonball Z!
