00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,333
Careful not to break
the punching meter,

00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,458
Goku and the others easily
qualified for the tournament.

00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,250
But, as usual,
the stubborn Vegeta

7
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,291
wasn't pulling any punches.

Mostly the fall.

[TRUNKS] Oops...

24
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,416
Guess I shouldn't've
hit him so hard but...

25
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,083
at least he's quiet.
