00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,500
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,583
Stage Three was in full swing
as Super Saiyan Gohan

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,666
matched strength
and wits with Dabura,

4
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,166
Lord of the Demon World!

5
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,125
[DABURA]
Wha--?!

6
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,666
[GOHAN grunts]

7
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,541
[NARRATOR]
It was a brutal contest!

8
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,583
Fist to fist! Blow for blow!

9
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,333
Each warrior on a relentless
quest for victory!

10
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,000
[NARRATOR] A win for
Gohan would mean the end

11
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,375
of Babidi's plans to
resurrect the evil Majin Buu!

12
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,208
But does the young Super Saiyan
have the power necessary

13
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,958
to defeat the mighty Dabura?

14
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,291
Vegeta didn't think so!

15
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,166
But Gohan wasn't
about to give up,

16
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,250
even though the odds seemed
decidedly against him!

17
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,041
[NARRATOR] But just as
fast as Babidi could say:

18
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,333
[BABIDI]
Papparapa!

19
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,791
[NARRATOR]
The fight was over!

20
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,458
After perceiving the latent
evil in Vegeta's heart,

21
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,916
the cunning Dabura immediately
formulated a new strategy!

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,166
To bring Vegeta over
to the dark side

23
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,958
and let him do the dirty work!

24
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,541
[BABIDI cackles]

25
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,416
[GOHAN]
Well, what now?

26
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,583
[SUPREME KAI]
I don't know!

27
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,791
I don't understand
what's going on!

28
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,958
Dabura is Babidi's
greatest fighter!

29
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,083
It doesn't make sense that he
would withdraw from the fight!

30
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,500
They don't have
anyone after him!

31
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,791
He's their best!

32
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,416
[GOKU]
He mentioned a new recruit.

33
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,958
Do you think he was bluffing?

34
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,375
[SUPREME KAI]
I'm not sure.

35
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,833
But it seems unlikely that
a fighter of that caliber

36
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,000
would just drop into their
laps at a time like this!

37
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,083
Yeah! They're definitely
up to something!

38
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,625
But what?

39
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,291
[VEGETA] Agh. This whole thing
would be over with right now

40
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,041
if it wasn't for you!

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,458
[VEGETA]
I hope you're proud of yourself!

42
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,166
Whatd'ya mean?

43
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,000
I mean you disgraced us with
your pitiful performance!

44
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,875
There's no excuse for you
fighting the way you did!

45
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,125
You have Saiyan blood
running through your veins!

46
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,250
A warrior like Dabura
should be dead!

47
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,666
And now you're sitting here,
scratching your head!

48
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,125
Wondering what's next when it
should already be finished!

49
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,916
You are pitiful!

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,250
Fighting with that soft,

51
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,166
righteous look on your face!
It's brute strength

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,500
that determines the outcome
of a battle, not goodness!

53
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,583
The mightiest survive
and the weak perish!

54
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,458
You Piccolo and Krillin
were turned to stone!

55
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,458
[gasps]

56
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,250
That's because
they're weaklings!

57
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,083
Is that the kind of fate
you want for yourself?

58
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,791
Garden statues!

59
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,291
If they're lucky someone will
make a birdbath out of them!

60
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,791
[GOHAN thinking]
Maybe Vegeta's right!

61
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,333
If he'd fought Dabura he
might've destroyed him!

62
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,000
Then Krillin and Piccolo
would be restored

63
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,750
back to their normal selves!

64
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:35,750
Ohhh... What have I done?!

65
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,916
Hey, look, Gohan didn't
know that Dabura

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
was gonna run off!

67
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,333
I'm sure he would've
wanted one of us

68
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,666
to fight him if he knew!

69
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,500
[VEGETA] Oh, yes!
Now there's a pleasant excuse!

70
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,916
You're as soft
as he is, Kakarot!

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,041
And I'm tired
of playing around!

72
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,958
I'm going to put an end to
this thing, once and for all!

73
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,125
[GOKU]
Vegeta, what are you doing?!

74
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,208
No more weak-hearted
excuses, Kakarot!

75
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,458
I'm taking control
of this operation, now!

76
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,666
And for starters I'm going to
blow this ship to kingdom come!

77
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,750
[GOKU] Wait! That might do
us more harm than good!

78
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,500
[SUPREME KAI]
Goku's right!

79
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,875
If you blow up the ship now,

80
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,500
you'll most certainly
revive Buu,

81
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,041
Vegeta! Listen! Please!

82
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,250
You don't know Buu.

83
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,500
His power is horrible!
He's pure evil!

84
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,083
Not even the four Kai's
combined could stop him!

85
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,250
He's murdered millions
of innocent people!

86
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,416
Shut up!

87
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,791
[SUPREME KAI]
Don't be a fool!

88
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,958
If Buu's revived, this
planet's finished! History!

89
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,458
All living things
will be exterminated.

90
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,250
He'll turn the Earth into
a dark, lifeless tomb!

91
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,250
Enough!

92
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,791
[VEGETA]
Now you listen to me!

93
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,166
What happens to this planet
is none of my concern!

94
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,083
The strongest will
find a way to survive!

95
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,041
And the weaklings shall perish!

96
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,583
What kind of person are you?!

97
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,000
[GOKU] Hey! Cut it out!
This has gone far enough!

98
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,750
How dare you!

99
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,916
You better let go
of me, Kakarot!

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,916
[GOKU]
Come on!

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,083
Let's put what's
happened behind us

102
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,708
and move forward from here!

103
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,666
[VEGETA] All right!
Whatever you say, Kakarot!

104
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,458
Now, what I wanna know
is why they withdrew

105
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,541
from the fight!

106
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,250
Yes! It doesn't
make sense, does it?

107
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,000
It was the perfect opportunity!

108
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,791
They could've gathered
more energy.

109
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,625
Maybe Dabura wasn't bluffing.

110
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,458
Maybe they did
find a new recruit.

111
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:19,625
It's definitely a possibility.
But I don't see how.

112
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,083
Happening upon someone
that could beat us all...

113
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,791
What are the chances
of doing that?

114
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,541
Slim to none, I'd say!

115
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,333
[SUPREME KAI thinking]
Perhaps the "perfect warrior"

116
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,750
that Dabura was speaking
of is right here among us!
