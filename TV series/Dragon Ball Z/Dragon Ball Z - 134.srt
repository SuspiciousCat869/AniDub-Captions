[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,708
The demented Dr. Gero
escaped to his

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,833
mountain hideout to
carry out the final phase

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,375
of his evil plan.

5
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,500
The doctor, now
an android himself,

6
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,375
activated two more of his
mechanical monsters.

7
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,916
The first to awaken was
17, a black haired boy

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,958
with super strength
and intelligence.

9
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,000
Next out was 18, a
computer driven diva

10
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,333
with blonde hair
and a bad attitude.

11
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,041
Don't let their looks fool you!

12
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,375
They may appear
harmless, but these two

13
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,833
are programmed to
pulverize planet earth!

14
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,458
And while Krillin
and the others force

15
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,125
their way into
the secret lab,

16
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,000
Dr. Gero's about
to find out that

17
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,250
his menacing machines
have minds of their own.

18
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,708
[DR. GERO] Huh? Android 17!
What are you doing?

19
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,041
Then let's try another idea.

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
[DR. GERO]
What?! What have you done?

21
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,625
You dare to defy me?
I created you!

22
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,458
You're not going to put us
to sleep again, old man.

23
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,750
Rats! It's sealed shut!

24
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,666
[VEGETA] Out of the way!
I'll blast it open!

25
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,083
[ALL]
Huh?

26
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,791
Don't do it! We can't beat
the androids without Goku!

27
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,875
Stop it! You don't understand
how powerful they are!

28
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,500
Too late, kid!

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,708
[PICCOLO, KRILLIN gasp]

[VEGITA]
Well, well...

31
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,250
What have we here that
has you all so nervous?

32
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,833
A boy with long hair and
a scarf around his neck,

33
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,833
and a beautiful young girl...

34
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,291
I take it these are
the scary Androids

35
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,083
we've heard so much about?

36
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,125
That's them.

37
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:09,250
They're androids? They look
just like humans to me!

38
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,375
[TRUNKS] Don't be fooled
by the way they look.

39
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,208
They're both deadly!

40
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,208
And they're stronger
than all of us!

41
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,916
[DR. GERO]
Well...

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,375
Goku's friends are very
determined to stop us...

43
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,625
But they will not!

44
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,125
[DR. GERO]
We will destroy them

45
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,208
just as they
destroyed Android 19!

46
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,458
Android 19?

47
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,333
So you built him after all!

48
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,208
[DR. GERO]
Yes!

49
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,791
[ANDROID 17]
I see.

50
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,833
But he was of a different
design than 18 or myself.

51
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,000
He was an energy-absorbing
model, was he not?

52
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,000
[DR. GERO]
Yes, he was.

53
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,833
How very interesting.

54
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,041
And you've chosen that
same design for yourself?

55
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,666
You thought that an
energy-absorbing model like 19

56
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,583
would be easier to control?

57
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,416
Yes!

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,333
And now he's been destroyed!

[DR. GERO] That is enough

63
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,375
I order you to destroy

Huh?

00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,541

in the looks
department, isn't he?

76

I'd like to see what
other modifications

77

you've made to him, Doctor!

there! Do not open that chamber!

away from Android 16!

android I didn't know about?

wake up our sleeping friend.

it may malfunction.

If 16 is just a prototype,

101
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,666
I wonder why you've
kept him for so long?

102

androids up to 15, didn't you?

to repair him someday!

Listen, I made you,

and I am telling you that if you
activate 16, you will regret it!

than this model is!

and activate him. Now.

not give you a voice box?

He tried to tell us it was

Are you with me, 18?

16, Dr. Gero programmed you

00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,833
[ANDROID 18]
Is something wrong?

314
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,916
[ANDROID 17]
No, don't blow a circuit.

315
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,500
I just wanted to enjoy the
scenery from down here.

316
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,500
[ANDROID 18]
So we walk?

317
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,166
No, we drive.

318
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,708
We're going to take the next
automobile that passes by us.

319
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,750
So, how does that sound?

320
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,708
Hm. It sounds to me like
you're being foolish.

321
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,750
17, why should we waste
our time driving a car?

322
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,708
Because we've never
done it before.

323
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,583
We're planning on taking
a little car ride, 16.

324
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,833
[ANDROID 17]
Do you wanna go too?

325
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,500
What? Did you just say "Goku"?

326
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,458
I guess I'll take
that as a "yes".

327
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,791
Seems Goku is the only
thing he has on his mind.

328
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,666
[ANDROID 17]
Hm. That's strange.

329
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,666
It seems Dr. Gero
created 16 without

330
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,250
any of the human personality
traits that 18 and I have.

331
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,000
I'll be curious to
see what other flaws

332
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,958
he has in his design.

333
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,791
[VEGETA]
So, there you are!

334
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,166
[VEGETA] I didn't think
you'd be this easy to find.

335
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,958
Run out of gas?

336
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,208
[ANDROID 17] There's
something different about you.

337
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,625
What happened?

338
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,625
I'm showing my true self.

339
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,708
I'm the most powerful
being on this planet!

340
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,333
And you're not welcome here!

341
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:10,083
[ANDROID 18] You're quite
brave for someone all alone!

342
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,708
Don't worry. I came prepared!

343
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,041
[VEGETA laughs]

344
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,958
[VEGETA] I'm going to put
you back in the crates

345
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,666
you crawled out of!

346
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,666
[BOTH chuckle]

347
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,291
You're laughing? Why is
that? This is not a joke!

348
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,125
Tell me, are all
of you Saiyans so

349
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,625
full of yourselves?
Is Goku like you?

350
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,708
Is this the way you try
to hide your incompetence?

351
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,541
[ANDROID 17] We androids will
always be superior to your kind!

352
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,625
You take that back!
You'll regret saying that!

353
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,083
You're nothing but a
machine made of tin!

354
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:48,333
You're just a bunch of toys
made by a crazy old man!

355
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,500
And don't forget that
tin toys can be broken!

356
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,458
He talks too much.

357
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,750
What was that?

358
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,083
[ANDROID 18]
16! Let's see what you can do!

359
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,916
Destroy him!

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,333
I refuse.

361
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,916
[ANDROID 17 gasps]

362
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,333
So, the big guy's not so dumb,
huh? Now, who's it going to be?

363
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,500
[ANDROID 17]
He refuses?

364
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,250
Who does he think he is?

365
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,791
[ANDROID 18]
Never mind him.

366
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,833
I'll handle this.

367
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,708
Ready? Little man?

368
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,375
[VEGETA]
So, it's ladies first, is it?

369
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,833
That's fine with me!

370
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,583
Now, don't expect me
to go easy on you.

371
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,000
I fight to win!

372
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,125
[NARRATOR]
Android 18 looks like she's one

373
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,125
tough customer, but
is she strong enough

374
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,625
to go one on one
with a Super Saiyan?

375
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,875
Whatever the outcome
Vegeta has got his

376
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,833
hands full with these
three bionic brutes.

377
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,041
Is he ready to battle
these mechanical monsters

378
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,541
all by himself?

379
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:54,791
