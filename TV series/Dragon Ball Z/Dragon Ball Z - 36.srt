1
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,958
Wait!

2
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,875
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,375
Gohan's transformation
brought the battle with Vegeta

4
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,166
to its crushing
conclusion!

5
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,500
With his body and his
pride seriously wounded,

6
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,083
the evil Saiyan had no
choice but to retreat.

7
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,458
And Krillin had little
choice but to watch him go!

8
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,125
When, I come back
to this planet...

9
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,666
you're all
going to suffer,

10
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,958
and when you
beg me for mercy...

11
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:40,166
I'll stare into your eyes as
I crush the life out of you.

12
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,958
[NARRATOR] Krillin proved
himself the bigger man

13
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,500
by showing
Vegeta mercy.

14
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,083
But will this decision
come back to haunt him?

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,458
There's only one
way to find out...

16
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,958
Stay tuned for more
Dragon Ball Z!

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,041
[thinking] Go... Just go!
Don't come back...

18
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,416
[KRILLIN]
Gohan...

19
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,791
Hey there,
little guy...

20
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:49,375
Come on... It's
gonna be all right.

21
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:54,000
[GOKU] Krillin... Bring him
over here. Let me see him.

22
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,750
How're you, Yajirobe?
Oh, I'm fine...

23
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,291
Don't bother to give
me a hand or anything.

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,291
[GOKU] How...
How is he?

25
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,291
Oh, he's a
little banged up,

26
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,750
but mostly I think
he's just exhausted.

27
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,500
Transforming into
a giant ape

28
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,125
isn't exactly as easy
as it looks, you know.

29
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,250
[BOTH] Huh?

30
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,833
[engine roaring in the distance]

31
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,000
Great. Now what?

32
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,041
[ROSHI] Hey! Hello down
there! Krillin! Goku!

33
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,875
[ROSHI laughing]

34
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:39,833
[KRILLIN laughing]

35
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,208
[CHICHI] Gohan!

36
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,125
ChiChi?

37
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,458
[CHICHI] What are
you waiting for?!

38
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,833
My baby needs me!
Open that door!

39
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,666
[CHICHI] Gohan!

40
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,375
[CHICHI]
I'm coming, son!

41
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,416
[CHICHI] Mommy's here!

42
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,875
[KRILLIN]
Wait, Chichi!

43
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,166
[CHICHI] I was so
worried... It's okay...

44
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,791
I'm here now! I won't let
anything happen to you...

45
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,500
Oh, Gohan...
Please, say something...

46
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,041
He'll be all
right, ChiChi...

47
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,541
But, did you see
Goku over there?

48
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,083
I don't want to scare you,
but he's in pretty bad shape.

49
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,416
If you're going to worry
about anyone, well...

50
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,583
My poor little boy... What
did those bad men do to you?

51
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,541
I promise, I'm never letting
you out of my sight again!

52
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,083
Oh, Gohan...

53
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,375
[thinking] Sheesh! It's not like
he's her husband or anything.

54
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,958
[BULMA]
Goku?

55
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, boy...

56
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,083
Oh, no...

57
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,750
[BULMA] How are you?
Can you move at all?

58
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,333
[ROSHI] Easy now, Bulma...

59
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,958
Sorry if I can't
get up to say hello...

60
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,125
That's all right...
Rest now...

61
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,750
You've done enough
for one day.

62
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,541
Oh, Master Korin...

63
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:14,000
[KRILLIN] Uh, I'm afraid I've
got some bad news, guys...

64
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,750
Bulma, you know, there's 
no easy way to say this...

65
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,208
But, Yamcha,
well, he...

66
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,416
He didn't make it.

67
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,166
Yes, I know... He fought
bravely, didn't he?

68
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,833
Oh! So then, uh, I guess you
know about Piccolo and Kami...

69
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,583
They're gone, too,
and that means,

70
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,375
so are the
Dragon Balls.

71
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,666
We won't be able to
wish anyone back...

72
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,166
[BULMA] Shut up!
I said I already know!

73
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,791
[BULMA sobbing]

74
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,166
I-I'm really sorry...

75
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,083
Yes, me too...

76
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,333
It's too bad. If only Piccolo
and Kami had survived...

77
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,958
Hey, I'm still here!

78
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,000
[BULMA] Yeah?! Well, I hope
you're proud of yourself!

79
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,541
You were hiding
the whole time!

80
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,291
Sneaking around like a coward
while everyone was dying!

81
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,041
Hey! That's
not true!

82
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,875
[BULMA] You're useless! Where
were you when they needed you?!

83
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,958
You should have died!
Not Yamcha! You!

84
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:20,416
[BULMA wailing]

85
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,000
You should be
thanking me!

86
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,416
I'm the one who cut off that
Saiyan creep's tail, y'know!

87
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,833
Jeez, you stick your
neck out for people...

88
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,708
And this is
what you get!

89
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,083
Now, now.
This is no time

90
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,041
to start fighting
amongst ourselves.

91
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,833
We need to get Goku
to the hospital...

92
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,708
I'm all out of
Senzu beans.

93
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,583
Hmmph.

94
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,208
[ROSHI] Okay, up we
go... Gently...

95
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:50,666
[BULMA crying]

96
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,625
[engines roaring to life]

97
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:15,791
[BULMA sobbing]

98
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,625
Where are the
others at, Krillin?

99
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,708
We need to go
pick them up, too...

100
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,958
That way... We were
fighting just over there...

101
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,000
Huh?

102
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:28,833
[BULMA sobbing]

103
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,375
[KRILLIN] Listen, um, Bulma?

104
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,791
I've been thinking...
And I don't know.

105
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,750
It's probably
impossible, but...

106
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,500
But still... as long
as there's a chance,

107
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,250
I gotta say
something...

108
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,166
Huh?

109
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,083
I can't get it
out of my head.

110
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,583
It's--It's
something that...

111
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,916
Well, it's something that
the Saiyans told us...

112
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,708
There might still be a
way to bring Yamcha back!

113
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,916
[ALL gasping]

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,708
What? What do
you mean?

115
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,208
Are you sure?

116
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,083
I-I don't know. It's
a shot in a million...

117
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,583
That's okay,
Krillin...

118
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,125
One chance in a million is
better than no chance at all.

119
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,791
Don't be afraid... 
Tell us your idea...

120
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:14,291
Well, you see, uh... Hey,
hold on. This is the spot.

121
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:18,208
Yamcha and the others
are down there...

122
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,500
We'll talk later, okay?

123
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,208
[ROSHI] Mm-hmm...

124
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,625
Krillin...
Where's Chiaotzu?

125
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,333
I thought we'd find
him here, too...

126
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,083
[KRILLIN] No.
You won't find him.

127
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:50,541
Chiaotzu blew himself up.
He was trying to save us.

128
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,458
[KORIN] What a tragedy. Such
a shameful, senseless loss.

129
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,791
It's never easy, seeing
such brave young men

130
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,000
cut down in their
prime of their lives.

131
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,333
I know... I wish there was
something I could have done.

132
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,916
I should have
been with them!

133
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,458
[BULMA] Here...

134
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,875
You better let
me fly...

135
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,208
Really,
I'm okay now.

136
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,750
Oh... Are you?

137
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,083
[thinking]
Oh, Yamcha...

138
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,000
[BULMA] Would you mind closing
your eyes for a second?

139
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,208
[YAMCHA] Is she
really gonna kiss me?

140
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,166
[BULMA] You are so dead!

141
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,916
[YAMCHA yelling]

142
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,250
[YAMCHA] I know I let
you down. I'm sorry.

143
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,083
[BULMA] Don't say that.
You didn't let anyone down.

144
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,333
You did your best.
Everybody knows that!

145
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,625
[BULMA whimpering]

146
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,083
[YAMCHA] I'm really
anxious to show these guys

147
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,875
what we're all about
down here on this planet!

148
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,333
[YAMCHA screaming]

149
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,208
No... I failed!

150
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,333
[PICCOLO screaming]

151
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,083
Oh, Gohan! Good!
You're awake!

152
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:16,958
Uh... Uwaah!

153
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,750
It's okay...
You're safe now.

154
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,916
I've got you.

155
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,250
Uh? Mom? Is that really you?

156
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,708
[CHICHI wailing]

157
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,833
That's right! Mommy's here!
My sweet, little boy!

158
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,250
I never thought
I'd see you again!

159
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,291
Don't worry about a thing,
son... It's all over now.

160
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,041
Yeah. We did it, Gohan.

161
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,833
[GOHAN] We did? So,
what happened to Vegeta?

162
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,541
Well, I guess you could
say he... he got away.

163
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,750
But, listen!

164
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,625
The important thing is,
we ran that creep back

165
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,125
to wherever it is
he came from!

166
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,416
That's all that
matters, right?

167
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,583
What about Dad?

168
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,083
[GOKU] I'm okay, Gohan...
I'm right here...

169
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,833
You did great
today, son.

170
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,000
We really showed
him, didn't we?

171
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,708
[GOHAN and GOKU chuckling]

172
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:12,000
[YAJIROBE] Hey, ChiChi...
What the heck's goin' on here?

173
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,583
Goku just came back from
the dead and saved the world,

174
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,250
and you've hardly
even looked at him!

175
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,291
He's your husband!

176
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,500
Aren't you at least
gonna say hello?

177
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,458
What? Say hello?
Oh no...

178
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,250
I don't have a single thing
to say to that man right now.

179
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,916
It's his fault my baby
almost got killed!

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,375
Mom! But the Saiyans were
gonna destroy the Earth!

181
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,416
They can blow up the
universe for all I care!

182
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,750
That's no excuse for putting
my little boy's life at risk!

183
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,333
[YAJIROBE] Man, Goku...
Your wife is crazy!

184
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,000
Hey, Krillin... What were
you going to tell us?

185
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,458
About the Saiyans?

186
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,166
Oh, yeah, okay...

187
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,208
Eh?

188
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,291
The way I understand
it... Well...

189
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,375
The Saiyans found out
about the Dragon Balls,

190
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,791
and they wanted to use
them to make a wish.

191
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,958
That's why they
came to Earth.

192
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,375
They were ready to
kill all of us...

193
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,041
Except they wanted
Piccolo alive.

194
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,458
They were convinced
he was the only one

195
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,583
that could lead them
to the Dragon Balls.

196
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,083
What, really?

197
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,875
Yeah... And the whole time,
they kept calling him this..

198
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,500
This really
weird name...

199
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,541
They called
him a Namek.

200
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,000
[ALL gasping]

201
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,458
I think Namek is
where they're from...

202
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:26,125
I mean, Piccolo and Kami,
they're aliens!

203
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,041
Well, I always said
they were funny lookin'.

204
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,416
Then when Goku was coming,
they said something else...

205
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,250
Nappa! Quickly!
Kill them all!

206
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,041
[NAPPA] But, what about
the Dragon Balls?

207
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,041
[VEGETA] We don't need
those fools to find them!

208
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,458
It's clear
to me now!

209
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,166
A Namekian is all we need
to make the Dragon Balls,

210
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,875
and Planet Namek is
loaded with them!

211
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,208
And you believed
them? You dope.

212
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,625
[GOHAN] No, you're
right, Krillin!

213
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,333
I mean, if Kami made the Dragon
Balls, and he's a Namek,

214
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,916
why couldn't other Nameks
do the same thing?

215
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Exactly, and maybe
they already have...

216
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,500
Vegeta said he'd heard legends
about Dragon Balls on Namek...

217
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,125
He never
believed them.

218
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,916
But what if they're
really true?

219
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,166
Then, that's it!

220
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,916
If you can somehow
get to Namek,

221
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,500
you can use their Dragon Balls
to wish your friends back!

222
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,250
And we can wish
Piccolo back first!

223
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,333
Now, Gohan, you shouldn't
get too excited...

224
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,541
That's a great idea!

225
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,416
And if Piccolo comes
back, then so will Kami!

226
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,416
And that means we'll have
all the Dragon Balls

227
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,708
here on Earth
back again, too!

228
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,541
Well, it's definitely
worth a shot!

229
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,291
Besides, what have we got
to lose? Let's go to Namek!

230
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,000
[KRILLIN]
All in favor, say "Aye"!

231
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,166
[ALL] Aye!

232
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,541
[ALL laughing]

233
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,125
[BULMA] Just stop it,
you guys! It's pointless...

234
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,291
I wish it was really
as simple as that,

235
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,208
but it just isn't!
It won't work.

236
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,083
[KRILLIN] What? What do you
mean? What's the problem?

237
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,625
Krillin, think about it...

238
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,166
For starters, do any of you
have even the slightest clue

239
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,916
where Planet Namek is?

240
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,833
[GOKU] Hey, wait...

241
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,041
I have an idea...
King Kai, are you there?

242
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,291
I hope you're
listening...

243
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,875
We could really use
your help right now.

244
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,458
[KING KAI]
Yes, Goku. I'm here.

245
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,750
So, you're looking
for the Planet Namek?

246
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,250
Well, of course I
know where that is!

247
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,333
Um, say you guys... Is anyone
else hearing voices?

248
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,500
Or is my old age finally
catching up with me?

249
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,291
Thanks, King Kai...
I knew I could count on you.

250
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,250
Go ahead,
we're listening.

251
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,250
Sure, but as long as I have
the podium for a minute...

252
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,250
Let me congratulate you all
on a battle well fought.

253
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,250
I was worried
there for a while.

254
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,250
It looked like that Saiyan
really had you guys

255
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,250
on the ropes!
But you pulled through!

256
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,250
[GOKU] I hate to say it,

257
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,291
but he even had me
a little scared.

258
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,958
I mean, even a Kaio
Ken times four attack

259
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,208
wasn't enough
to stop him!

260
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,791
Yes, and those were my
best techniques, too.

261
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,958
I hope you can
think of something

262
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,750
before you have to
face him again...

263
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,166
I'm sorry, but I'm
all out of tricks.

264
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,333
Yeah, I was afraid
you'd say that...

265
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,375
Maybe I shouldn't
have let him go...

266
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,208
Only time
will tell...

267
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,833
What? What are they
talking about?

268
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,375
You mean you actually
let that Saiyan go?

269
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,166
Oh, well, I'll tell you
the whole story later...

270
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,083
[KING KAI] Hmm...
Now where is it...

271
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,541
I'm sure I have
the coordinates

272
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,666
for Planet Namek in
here somewhere...

273
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,375
'Kay... There's Planet
Nambo, Namcheck, Namcheno...

274
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:20,375
Planet Namee...
Ah yes! Here it is!

275
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,291
The co-ordinates are SW-66.
Or maybe SU-83...

276
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,458
No, no!
9-0-4-5 XY, definitely!

277
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:30,083
What? Is he serious?
9-0-4-5 XY? But that's...

278
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,250
Um, what's
the matter?

279
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,458
We know where it is
now... That's good!

280
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,208
Hey! Master Roshi! I need
to check something out...

281
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,458
Take the wheel
for a minute!

282
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,708
You could say please...

283
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:43,000
9-0-4-5 XY... Hmm...

284
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,250
[KING KAI] I remember...

285
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,208
Planet Namek was once a
very beautiful place.

286
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,166
It was very much
like the Earth...

287
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,083
Lush and green, with
an abundance of life.

288
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,625
But that was
long ago...

289
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:57,375
Before a catastrophic event
caused the climate to change.

290
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,750
The effects on the
planet were devastating.

291
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,458
It has recovered over
time, little by little.

292
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,875
But I'm not sure there
were any survivors...

293
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,041
But... Oh no.

294
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,791
See? Told ya'...
It's just a pipe dream.

295
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,125
There's no
Dragon Balls.

296
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,250
Can it!

297
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,958
Let's not give
up hope yet...

298
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,500
There's really only one way
we can know for sure...

299
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,541
I'll have to feel it out...

300
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,916
Just give me a moment...

301
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,833
Oh! There it is!

302
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,250
Say... You know... If what
King Kai says is true,

303
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,208
this might explain how it
is that Kami ever came

304
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,750
to live upon
the Earth...

305
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,250
Yes... It must've
been so long ago

306
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,416
that Kami
couldn't remember.

307
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,166
But perhaps his
people sent him here

308
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,833
after the climate
on Namek changed,

309
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,375
so that at least one of
their race would survive!

310
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,833
I don't get it...

311
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,833
If these Namekians really
had a set of Dragon Balls

312
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,333
like you guys say...

313
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,916
Don't you think they
woulda' used 'em?

314
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,375
I mean, they coulda'
just wished their planet

315
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,916
back to normal.
Problem solved.

316
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,208
[ROSHI] No...
Maybe they couldn't.

317
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,208
The Dragon is not
all-powerful...

318
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,375
We found out when we
tried to destroy

319
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,666
the Saiyans
with a wish,

320
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,500
Shenron told us it
wasn't possible.

321
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,916
You see, the Dragon
Balls are tied

322
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,625
to the one
who created them.

323
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,416
And, they cannot
grant a wish

324
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,750
that exceeds their
maker's power.

325
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,208
Oh, that's a
load'a hooey...

326
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,833
You're makin'
it up...

327
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,125
You just don't wanna admit
that you're wrong. Yeah...

328
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,458
Urgh!

329
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,125
Hey! I thought I told
you to can it, stupid!

330
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,583
[KING KAI]
Good news, everyone!

331
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,291
I found the Namekians!

332
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,375
I can sense about a hundred
of them still on the planet,

333
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,833
alive and well!

334
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,250
You call that good news?

335
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,750
You're talkin' about a
hundred Piccolos here!

336
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,666
Even if the Dragon
Balls did exist,

337
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,500
you'd have to fight all
those guys to get 'em!

338
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,125
[KING KAI] No, no, no.
It's not like that at all!

339
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,208
The Namekians are basically
peaceful by nature, like Kami!

340
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,458
Piccolo was the
exception to the rule.

341
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,916
[KING KAI]
You have to remember,

342
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,875
Piccolo was born
there on Earth.

343
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,416
And during his
formative years,

344
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,583
he witnessed firsthand all of
the horrors of that world...

345
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,750
War, tyranny,
murder...

346
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,375
These experiences
took their toll...

347
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,291
Piccolo was
not born evil.

348
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,041
Rather, it was the evil
of men that corrupted

349
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,791
his otherwise peaceful
Namekian heart.

350
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,375
I guess that
makes sense..

351
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,125
People can be pretty
disgusting sometimes...

352
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,166
You said it...

353
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,916
Well, I can't think
of a better way

354
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,416
to show Piccolo
the good in people

355
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,041
than by using the Dragon
Balls to wish him back!

356
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,416
[BULMA]
Not so fast, guys...

357
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,166
You just don't
get it, do you?

358
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,250
Nothing's changed. So what if
we know where Planet Namek is.

359
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,208
How do we get there?

360
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,458
[KRILLIN] Is this a
trick question?

361
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,333
I mean, we just take a
spaceship! Easy as that!

362
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh, easy as that? Well,
I've got news for you!

363
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,666
I just calculated how long it
would take us to make the trip

364
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,208
using the best Capsule
Corp spaceship available!

365
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:52,125
And do you wanna take a wild
guess what I came up with?

366
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,041
What's that? No idea?
Then allow me to show you.

367
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,208
Here... See?
The numbers don't lie.

368
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:04,166
Your little cruise to Namek
is gonna take 4339 years!

369
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,375
That's one way!

370
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,375
[GOHAN] Wow. That's long.

371
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,208
What do you think,
King Kai?

372
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,333
Any ideas on how
we can get there?

373
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,416
No, I'm afraid I'm
stumped on that one...

374
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,416
Sheesh... They expect
me to know everything?

375
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,250
[KRILLIN laughing]

376
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,958
Okay. So you got me there,
Bulma. It's impossible...

377
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,708
But, hypothetically
speaking,

378
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,333
what would happen if we
used a Saiyan spaceship?

379
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,833
Hm?!

380
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,708
There's an idea. But where
are we gonna get one of those?

381
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,208
I thought the
Saiyans left.

382
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,833
[KRILLIN]
Well, Vegeta left.

383
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,541
And it looked like his ship was
only big enough for one person.

384
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,416
There's absolutely no
way that Nappa guy

385
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,750
could've squeezed
in there with him.

386
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,416
He had to've had
a ship of his own!

387
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,875
Hey! That's right!

388
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,500
And what about my brother
Raditz? He had a ship, too!

389
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:52,333
But I think it's prob'ly broken
after what Gohan did to it...

390
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,708
Okay! So there's one
spaceship left out there!

391
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,750
Now, all we have to do is
figure out where it is,

392
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,208
and we're
in business!

393
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,166
Well, then... I bet I know
just where to start looking.

394
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,916
It's most likely
not too far

395
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,291
from where the
Saiyans first landed,

396
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,041
somewhere in
East City!

397
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,583
[KRILLIN laughing]

398
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,458
Hey, I think I have
something that might help.

399
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,708
Check it out!
Vegeta dropped it...

400
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,291
I saw him punch a couple a'
buttons... And then boom!

401
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,708
His spaceship
came right to him!

402
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,666
I think it's a remote
control or something...

403
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,833
[BULMA]
Lemme see that!

404
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,833
Hmm...

405
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,166
[BULMA giggling]

406
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,625
Pack your bags!
We're going to Namek!

407
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,583
[ALL laughing]

408
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:35,666
[BULMA] We'll have Yamcha and
everyone back in no time!

409
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,916
[ALL laughing]

410
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,625
[ALL] Namek! Here we come!

411
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,208
[laughing continues]

412
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,208
[NARRATOR] A day of sorrow has
become a bright day of hope,

413
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,583
as our heroes prepare to embark
on a bold, new adventure!

414
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,291
It's Planet
Namek or bust!

415
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,375
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
