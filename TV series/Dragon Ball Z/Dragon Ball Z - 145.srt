Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

Piccolo squared off
against the diabolical Cell

3
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,583
in an effort to prevent
the evil Android

from absorbing
any more innocent victims!

5

[NARRATOR] Cell is Dr. Gero's
most fiendish creation.

6

Designed by a computer
and created from the cells

and all the other

9
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,958
His unquenchable thirst
for power makes him

10
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,166
the most dangerous foe
the Z-Fighters have ever faced!

11
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,875
His mission: to seek out
and absorb Androids 17 and 18

12
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,541

thereby transforming himself

13
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,291
into the most powerful
fighter who has ever lived!

14

the only obstacle between

15

Cell and his ultimate goal.

16
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,375
But the cunning creature
managed to easily evade

[NARRATOR] Disappearing
behind the blinding flash

24
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,458
of his Solar Flare,
Cell fled the scene

25
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,833
to begin his search
for Androids 17 and 18!

26
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,666
Now, it's up to
Trunks and the others

27
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,000
to reacquire the monstrous
creature before he can

28
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,875

29

If Cell succeeds in
accomplishing his goal,

Failure is not an option!

32
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,041
[PICCOLO] And for that reason,
he stole Trunks' time machine

33
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,458
and traveled here,
where for the last four years

34
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,208
he's been living underground,

35
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,458
developing into
the monster you saw today.

36
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,750
There. So you see,

37
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,458
this "Cell" will try to find
the other Androids at all costs.

38
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,083
Uniting with them
is the only way

39
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,708
he can ever become "complete."

40
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,000
Great... Just great...

41
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,375
Well... once again it's up to
us to stop him isn't it?

42
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,250
Whatta jip!

43
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,666
How do we find him now?

44
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,250
I mean, if Cell knows
that Piccolo is strong enough

45
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,333
to beat him before
he becomes complete,

46
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,708
he'll probably try to keep
his energy concealed from us.

47
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,708
Well, we'd better
figure something out

48
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:35,041
before he finds those Androids,
or I'll tell ya what guys,

we're going to be
in big trouble!

And not just us, Tien.

51
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,333
This monster is a danger to
every planet in the universe!

Remember,
Frieza and Frieza's father

I say let him become "complete."

57
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,833
If Cell destroys the Androids
he'll save me the trouble.

58
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,958
And fighting one battle is
much simpler that fighting four.

[VEGITA] I don't care
how powerful he becomes,

Hold on, Vegeta.

62
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,458
The Androids alone were
more than we could handle,

63
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,041
and if Cell absorbs their power,

64
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,791
he'll be stronger
than all of them combined!

Well... it... might help

Right. Not the Cell
