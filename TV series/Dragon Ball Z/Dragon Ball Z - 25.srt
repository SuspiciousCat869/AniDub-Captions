[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,125
The battle for the Earth
claimed its first casualty

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,333
as Yamcha fell at the hands
of the mindless Saibamen.

4
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,458
The two evil Saiyans,
Nappa and Vegeta,

5
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,250
looked on with
cold amusement,

6
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,375
as our heroes mourned
the loss of their friend,

7
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,333
eager to see who the
Saibamen would take

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,333
as their next victim in the
gruesome game of life-and-death.

9
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,125
But our heroes
stood firm.

10
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,791
Banded together,
and fueled by rage,

11
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,125
they were able to eliminate
the Saibaman threat

12
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,041
and put an end to the
Saiyans' cruel contest.

13
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,583
And that's when the
horror truly began...

14
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,083
Nappa attacked!

15
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,958
Tien was the
first to receive

16
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,541
the Saiyan's
ruthless attention.

17
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,916
But before Nappa could
close in for the kill,

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,208
Chiaotzu took
drastic action!

19
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,458
[CHIAOTZU using ESP]
I'm not afraid.

20
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,333
And if I can save you...
that's worth dying for.

21
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,708
Chiaotzu! No!

22
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,000
[NARRATOR] Another of the
Earth's Special Forces

defense of the planet...

24
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,958
Meanwhile, the greatest
hope of all, Goku,

25
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,583
is still on his way
to the battlefield!

26
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:26,916
Hurry, Goku...
Time is running out!

[thinking] Darn it!
I've got a bad feeling...

28
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,208
Things aren't going so
good down on Earth...

29
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,333
But I'm almost there.
I've got to keep it up!

Guess your little friend
couldn't save you, three eyes!

Aw, man! This is crazy!
What do we do, Piccolo?

35
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,208
He's just too strong! There's
no way we can beat this guy!

36
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,666
Stand your ground, Krillin.
We're here for a reason!

Heh, heh, heh!
You miss him already, huh?

[OOLONG] You're not kidding!
He's tearing it up!

Maybe he'll win!

Yes, there's
no question

60
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,875
that Tien is full of
spirit at the moment...

61
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,875
But, I'm afraid he's
fighting on heart alone!

62
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,041
I just hope he can
keep this up.

There it
goes again!

64

And it's doing the same
thing on every channel!

yourself out yet?

more before I stomp you?

He's going to start
attacking Tien

and when he does he'll
have an unguarded moment.

That's when
we strike.

That's a good plan!

to fight head-on!

eyes off them...

still so cocky.

[NAPPA] All right. Whadda you
say we get down to business?

166
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,583
Who's next?

167
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,208
[VEGETA] Nappa!
We still need the Namek

168
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,500
to tell us about
the Dragon Balls!

169
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,041
Oh yeah, I
almost forgot.

170
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,666
Looks like you're up,
little man!

171
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,416
Heh. You hear that, Piccolo?
You're in luck.

172
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,875
Maybe I should
tell 'em I know

173
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,166
all about the
Dragon Balls, too...

Be my guest,
but I don't think

175
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,041
it'll make much
difference in the end.

[KRILLIN] Point taken...

177
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,958
Now, let's try

up again!

like we're gonna have to

on the ground.

right there!

00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,875
[VEGETA] Hold on! I need
to ask them something.

If you say so...
You're the boss!

00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,875
[VEGETA] I'm curious about this
"Goku" they keep talking about.

288
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,791
Because I'm starting
to think the person

289
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,291
they're referring to
is actually Kakarot!

290

[KRILLIN] Yeah! Whatever you
call him... That's right!

[VEGETA laughing]

292
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,416
[KRILLIN]
What's so funny?

293
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,583
That you two think
Kakarot can beat us!

294
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,416
He couldn't even beat
his brother Raditz,

295
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,625
and Raditz was a weakling
compared to Nappa and myself!

296
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,916
[KRILLIN] Shows how
much you know!

297
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,875
He's way stronger
than he was before!

298
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,291
Just wait! You'll
find your match in Goku.

[NAPPA laughing]

300
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,458
This planet's not that big,
so why isn't he here yet?

301
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,166
He's smart! He's not going to
show up here! He's hiding!

302
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,125
Hey, you jerk! My Dad
never ran from anybody!

303
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,000
He'll be here, and he'll
beat you! Just you wait!

304
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,416
[VEGETA] You've
caught my interest!

305
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,791
We're going to
wait for him...

306
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,416
Take a break, Nappa.
Cool off for a while.

307
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,583
C'mon, Vegeta!
That's ridiculous!

308
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,416
I was about to
finish 'em off here!

309
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,541
Just hold off for
three hours...

310
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,916
We'll give
them that.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,458
[NAPPA growling]

312
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,500
Forget it! I
say they die now!

313
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,000
Haah!

314
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,791
Nappa! Do you really
want to defy me?!

315
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,791
Rrgh!

316
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,750
I-I'm sorry... I guess
I got carried away...

317
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,000
The battle will resume
in three hours,

318
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,166
whether Kakarot
is here or not.

319
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,250
[KRILLIN] Aw, come on, Piccolo.
You can't really blame him.

320
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,666
This is the first time
Gohan's ever been

321
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,416
in an actual battle.
It's scary enough as it is.

322
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,875
Well, I'm more
angry at myself

323
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,791
for counting on him.
What a waste of time!

324
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,625
Just go home,
Gohan.

325
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,791
If you're not going to fight,
you'll only slow us down.

326
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,041
[thinking] Not that it
makes much difference.

327
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,708
Judging by the way that
big one takes orders,

328
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,750
the smaller Saiyan
must be even stronger!

329
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,500
If that's the case...

330
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:10,625
I'm not even sure if Goku will
be able to stand up to him...

331
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,875
[NAPPA] Please, Vegeta! I was
just starting to have fun!

332
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,875
Now I'm bored!

333
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,916
Calm down...
Use some will power...

334
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,791
There's going to be
a much better show

335
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,000
in three hours,
I promise!

336
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:28,416
[VEGETA chuckling]

337
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,958
[NARRATOR] The Saiyans have
granted our heroes

338
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,833
a brief
three-hour reprieve

339
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,791
while they await
Goku's arrival.

340
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,708
But with miles still
left to travel

341
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,333
down the winding
Snake Way,

342
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,666
can Goku make it back to Earth
before the fighting resumes?

343
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,750
Or will his friends
be forced to continue

344
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,375
their losing battle
against the Saiyans alone?

345
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,000
The clock is ticking!

346
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,833
And the time for the ultimate
showdown between good and evil

347
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,208
is drawing near...

348
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:55,791
On the next explosive
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
