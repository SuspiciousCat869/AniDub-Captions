00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,791
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,666
a group of thugs called
the Red Shark Gang

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,750
tried to muscle
their way into town

4
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,291
until a concerned citizen
challenged them!

5
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,291
[JIMBO] We're gonna
make an example o' you!

6
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,750
[SLIMJIM]
Let him have it, Jimbo!

7
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,125
--[VIDEL] Ah!
--[GOHAN] You missed me! Huh?

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,958
[CROWD gasping]

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,708
Hey, Videl! Huh?

10
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:35,833
[JIMBO grunts]

11
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,333
[NARRATOR]
But when Gohan got hammered

12
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,083
and the big Boss
had Videl against the ropes,

13
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,041
there was only one hope left!

14
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,000
Hey, you! Back off!

15
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,416
[BOSS]
Huh?

16
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,541
[NARRATOR] The Great Saiyaman
arrived and it was time

17
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:52,333
to put a halt to the
Red Shark Syndicate's actions!

18
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,000
[GOHAN] Here! I think
this belongs to you!

19
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,458
[NARRATOR] With the
mobsters out of the way

20
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,375
the city was safe once again!

21
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,916
But was Saiyaman
safe from Videl?!

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,500
[VIDEL]
Tell me who you are!

23
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,708
[GOHAN] Hm?! All right!
I guess I can trust you!

24
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,666
But please don't ever repeat
what you're about to hear!

25
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,333
I'm the Great Saiyaman!

26
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,750
[NARRATOR]
Look out, Saiyaman!

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,458
This is one girl
who won't be satisfied

28
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,041
until she unmasks you!

29
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,041
[GOHAN thinking] That's strange.
The nimbus is here!

30
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm here! But where'd Chobi go?

31
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't you think it's
strange that he's gone?

32
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,000
He's just a baby!
He can't even fly!

33
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:04,083
Well, hey, you can't fly either,
but you manage to get around!

34
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,916
Besides, Toeto and his wife
would never let anything happen!

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,666
Don't worry!
Chobi's fine, Goten!

36
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,208
Let's go home!

37
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,625
[GOTEN]
I'll beat ya!

38
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,833
[GOHAN]
Oh, no you won't!

39
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,791
[FIGHTER groans]
[MR. SATAN laughs]

40
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,958
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah, heah! Ha, ha, ha!

41
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,375
Now that's a real man!

42
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,208
Incredible! What a guy!

43
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,250
[VIDEL]
Dad?

44
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,291
[MR. SATAN]
Hm? Oh, it's you, Videl!

45
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,666
I'm just reviewing
some of my old matches

46
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,166
and studying stategy!

47
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,791
You can never rest
if you want to stay on top!

48
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,458
[VIDEL] You're a
brilliant fighter, Dad!

49
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,458
You could definitely win
at the tournament again

50
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,208
but I heard that the guy
who won before you

51
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,750
is extremely powerful!

52
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,041
Ah! Your dad knows all about
the former champion!

53
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,166
His name is Goku! And he's
a magician, not a fighter!

54
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,500
Uses all kinds of
light tricks and deception

55
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,041
to win his matches, see!

56
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,541
And he doesn't have
the brute strength

57
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,041
that your father does, Videl!

58
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,208
He's a sissy compared to me!

59
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,416
No one can defeat the man
who saved the world!

60
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,625
No one! Do you
hear me, Goku?!

61
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,375
Ha, ha, ha!

62
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,666
[CHICHI humming]

63
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,083
Hope you two boys are hungry!

64
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,708
Well, not for meatloaf!

65
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,500
[CHICHI]
Goten! Shame on you!

66
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,458
You'll eat what
I put on the table!

67
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,500
[NEWSCASTER]
That's right, folks!

68
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,041
The circus is
in town once again!

69
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,166
And thanks to the promoter,
Mister Musuka,

70
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,833
circus goers have
a different attraction

71
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,416
to cheer about this year!

72
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,791
And there he is!

73
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,458
The baby dinosaur
that's winning the hearts

74
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,583
of circus goers everywhere!
Isn't he cu--

75
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,291
Hey! Chobi! Gohan! It's Chobi!

76
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,083
[NEWSCASTER] The little dinosaur
is said to be responsible

77
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,458
for the record-breaking crowds!

78
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,166
Look, the poor little
guy's scared to death!

79
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,625
You boys know him?!

80
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,875
Yeah! His nest is a
couple miles from here!

81
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,375
We've known
his parents for years!

82
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,291
They're not gonna be
very happy about this!

83
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,708
I can tell you that!

84
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,666
This is really awful, Gohan!

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,458
Don't worry!
He'll be fine, Squirt!

86
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,166
I'll see to it personally!

87
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,500
And that's a promise!

88
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,083
Here we go!

89
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,583
[ANNOUNCER] Step right up,
folks! See the baby dinosaur!

90
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,000
The one and only, Rocko!

91
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,500
The most adorable
spectacle on Earth!

92
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,916
[GOHAN thinking]
Poor, Chobi!

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,750
He's so scared that he's
trembling! This is terrible!

94
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,125
[CROWD cooing]

95
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,125
[GOHAN]
Excuse me, sir?

96
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,208
[MUSUKA]
Huh?

97
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,750
Hi! My name's Gohan!

98
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,541
I'm a little concerned about
the well-being of your dinosaur!

99
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,208
That's great! Now buzz off!

100
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,666
Look, I know you kidnapped
that little guy!

101
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,833
Please let him go!

102
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,291
You've gotta be kiddin' me!

103
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,500
Don't yous remember how
Jack and the Beanstalk

104
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,458
got the goose that
layed the golden eggs?

105
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,333
He stole her, that's how, kid!

106
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,875
But maybe you're right!

107
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,541
Maybe all circus owners should
be arrested for kidnapping!

108
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,625
[MUSUKA laughs]

109
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,166
It's not funny!

110
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,166
Look, that dinosaur has a
mother and a father and a home!

111
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,791
You can't just
take it, Mister! Huh?

112
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,125
Shut up! Where do yous
think circus owners

113
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,958
get their animals from, kid?!

114
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,000
Do you think
the stork brings 'em?!

115
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,375
It's dollars that matter!

116
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,166
Not sentimental rubbish!

117
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,333
[MUSUKA laughs]

118
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:25,791
[GOHAN thinking] I hope taking
Chobi is the right thing to do!

119
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,916
Of course it is!
What am I thinking?!

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,625
Chobi has the right
to be with his parents

121
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,083
just like that girl does!

122
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,166
Just like all children do!

123
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,333
Oh, boy! Speaking of
Chobi's parents,

124
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,250
they're going to be
boiling mad!

125
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,250
If I don't get Chobi
back to them soon,

126
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,625
we're gonna have a real
disaster on our hands!

127
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,958
I can see it now!

128
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,083
Toeto and his wife
combing the art district

129
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,583
for their kid! Oh, man!

130
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,125
[GOHAN]
Chobi!

131
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,000
[CHOBI]
Hm?

132
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,375
What's up there, little guy?!

133
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,208
It's me! Me! Gohan!

134

[GOHAN grunts]

135
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,041
Yeah! There we go! Great!

136
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,541
Now, let's get outta here!
Whatd'ya say?!

137
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,458
Hold on, boy!

138
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,958
[STRONG MAN] What do you
think you're doing?!

139
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,208
[GOHAN]
I beg your pardon, sir!

140
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,458
I'm returning him
to his rightful home!

141
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,666
That's what you think!

[STRONG MAN groans]

144
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,583
Be careful, sir!

145
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,875
Swinging iron poles
can be dangerous!

146
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,875
Man! Who in the world are you?!

147
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,875
[GOHAN] Let's just say
I'm a friend! See ya, buddy!

148
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,083
[MUSUKA]
Oh, yeah! Hundred n' ten...

149
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,250
Hundred n' twenty...
Hundred n' thirty-- Huh?

150
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,208
[TRAINER]
Mr. Musuka, Rocko's gone!

151
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,125
Someone bent the bars
of his cage and stole him!

152
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,833
[MUSUKA]
What?! I want that thief dead!

153
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,208
[TRAINER]
Yes, sir!

154
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,000
[MUSUKA] Well, what are
yous waitin' for? Let's go!

155
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,125
[CHOBI whimpering, crying]

156
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,291
[GOHAN]
Ah, Chobi, no! I can't see!

157
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,208
[CHOBI]

00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,583
You said "Go,"
didn't you?! Go-what?!

316
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,541
That's what I wanna know!

317
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,916
Please! Let go!
There's no time for this!

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,916
Sure there is!
It'll only take a second!

319
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,458
Just tell me your name!

320
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,958
It's Gohan! Isn't it?!
Just say it already!

321
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,708
Please, Miss! Here he comes!

322
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,291
Toeto!

323

[MUSUKA]
Gimme that, you idiot!

324
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,666
Hey! Come back here!

325
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,791
What do you
think you're doing?!

326

[MUSUKA]
All o' yous, freeze!

327
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,166
Now, gimme back my dinosaur
or I'll blow you away!

328
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,500
I found him! He's mine!

329
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,416
Don't shoot!

330
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,000
[MUSUKA]
Why yous!

331
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,416
Ah!

Don't worry about
your dad, little guy!

341
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,250
He'll be just fine!
Wait and see!

342
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:04,833
Listen to how precious
he is! Saiyaman I-I, uh...

343
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,541
Goodbye, Miss! I hope
we'll meet again soon!

344
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,708
Bye!

Good-bye!

[GOHAN]
Hello there! Special delivery!

347
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,833
Now that was an adventure!

348
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,375
You're a heck of alot braver
than I was at your age, Chobi!

349
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,958
You should be very
proud of him, Ma'am!

350
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,625
[VIDEL]
What a guy!

351
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,041
[MUSUKA] Hey! I know
where their nest is!

352
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,041
I'll be back! Yous hear?!

353
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,208
[VIDEL]
Why don't you think it over

354
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,250
in jail for a few days?! Hm!

355
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,083
What? Jail?

356
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,916
Takin' a dinosaur's no crime,

357
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,375
but steal'n an
officer's handgun is.

Saiyaman...

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,291
[GOHAN] All right!
That's the way it should be!

362
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,166
One big, happy family!

363
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,958
Yay! Chobi's back!
All right! Ha, ha, ha!

00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:14,166
[GOTEN laughing]

365
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,000
[GOTEN]
Welcome back, Chobi!

366
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,750
[GOTEN laughing]

367
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,083
Gohan! You're the greatest!

[class tune chimes]

370

[GOHAN]
Oh, man! Late again!

371
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,791
[VIDEL]
Hey! Good morning, Gohan!

372
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,333
[GOHAN]
Oh! Hey there, Videl!

373
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,125
You're late too, huh? Uh--

374
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,333
Gohan! It's over!

375
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,375
Whatd'ya mean!

376
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,750
Class is just
now starting, Videl!

377
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,041
--[VIDEL] Forget class!
--[GOHAN] Huh?!

378
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,875
[VIDEL]
Hold still! There!

379
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,208
My gosh, isn't
that funny?! Yeah!

380
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,416
I saw Saiyaman get
scratched in the same spot!

381
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,916
And that's exactly who
you are! Mr. Saiyaman!

382
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,708
Yikes! Busted!
I can't believe it!

383
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:02,041
The secret identity of
Saiyaman is public knowledge!

384
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:09,958
[GOHAN] Guardian of the city!
I am the Great Saiyaman!

385
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,041
I wouldn't exactly say that
it was public knowledge!

386
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,333
Only I know!

387
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,083
But I do think the public
has a right to know!

388
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,541
Maybe I should schedule
a press conference!

389
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,916
No, please! Don't!

390
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,375
You know the only reason
I keep my identity secret

391
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,583
is to protect my family's
privacy! It's for them!

392
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,416
Please, Videl!

393
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,666
Is that true?!

394
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,291
Yes, of course!

395
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,583
Hey! You're the
Golden Fighter as well!

396
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,625
Aren't you?!

397
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,875
No! Just Saiyaman!

398
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,916
Why should I believe you?!

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,625
That guy has blonde hair!

400
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,875
[VIDEL]
You're right about that!

401
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,708
He's more handsome
than you are, too!

402
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,458
I guess I believe you!

403
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,541
Yeah! I do!

404
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,375
Videl, Is there
any way you could

405
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,250
keep my secret between us?

406
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,583
Maybe. But you have to do
something for me in return.

407
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,125
Okay, here's the deal!

408
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,833
If you enter the
World Martial Arts Tournament,

409
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,291
I'll keep your secret!
How's that?

410
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,708
Me? Compete in the Tournament?

411
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,833
That's right! I'm gonna
be competing myself,

412
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,083
but winning the
World Championship

413
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,791
won't mean anything to me,
unless I know that

414
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,333
all of the best fighters in
the country are participating!

415
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,583
My dad was the last
champion and he told me

416
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:16,375
that a guy named Goku
won the one before that.

417
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,250
Strangely enough,
I did some research

418
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,333
on this Goku fellow
and found out that

419
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,916
he has a son named Gohan.

420
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,958
Then I put two and two together
and realized you're his son!

421
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,833
I'm right about that,
aren't I? Well?

422
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,166
Uhh, no!

423
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,708
I knew it! You're a
terrible liar, Gohan.

424
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,708
You're Goku's son! It's
written all over your face!

425
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,666
Wow! This is gonna be great!

426
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,166
What a terrific match!
The former champion's daughter

427
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,166
fighting the
former champion's son!

428
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,625
Doesn't that sound
exciting to you?

429
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,750
No, not really.
Why don't we do something

430
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:55,458
really challenging
like go out on a date!

431
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,375
Look, if you're too
chicken to fight me,

432
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,916
then you don't have to compete!

433
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,333
But I'm going to
tell everyone your secret!

434
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,333
What?! You'd do that?!

435
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,875
[VIDEL] Yeah, sure.
The truth is the truth, right?

436
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,666
Your family can adapt
to being in the limelight

437
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,666
just like mine did.

438
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,333
You wouldn't really!

439
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,708
Just try me!

440
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:15,375
Oh, all right then.
I'll compete in the tournament.

441
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,958
Cheer up! This is
gonna be a blast!

442
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,541
You just wait and see!

443
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,416
It's gonna be a heck of
a lot better than going out

444
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,333
on a silly ol' date,
that's for sure!

445
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,750
Oh, and there's
one more condition!

446
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,375
[GOHAN]
Huh?

447
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,541
It's no big deal!

448
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,458
I just wanna learn
how to fly, that's all!

449
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,291
That shouldn't be too hard
to teach me, should it?

450
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,166
No, it's a cinch.

451
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,250
Great! Well, we'll get
started right away!

452
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,583
See you later!

453
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:42,208
[GOHAN groans] Blackmailed
again! How do I do it?

454
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,333
[NARRATOR] It looks like
Gohan has gotten himself

455
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,208
into a pickle once again!

456
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:53,333
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
