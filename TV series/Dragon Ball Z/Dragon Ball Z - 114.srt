00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,125
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,250
chaos reigned in the
cities as ordinary citizens

3
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,833
had been turned into evil
maniacs by the Black Water Mist!

4
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,750
Animals and humans alike were
infected by the dreaded mist!

5
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,625
Needless to say, this is
one game of cat and mouse

6
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,500
that we all hope
we never have to play!

7
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,375
[NARRATOR]
Atop of Kami's Lookout,

8
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,916
the battle that would
determine the fate

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,583
of the earth continued!

10
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,416
And it looked like
Piccolo was up to the task!

11
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,000
But even though Kami was free

12
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,791
and had the
Sacred Water in hand,

13
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,791
Garlic Jr. still
had the last laugh.

14
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,750
There wasn't enough
time to spread the remedy

15
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,833
over the earth
before the changes

16
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,083
from the Black Water
Mist became permanent!

17
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,500
[POPO] We might
still have a chance, Kami.

18
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:04,041
[NARRATOR] Luckily, Mr. Popo
knew of a way to beat the clock,

19
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:08,833
but the plan meant putting
Kami's life in jeopardy!

20
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,250
While Kami and Mr. Popo
set off on their mission

21
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,166
to distribute the Sacred Water,

22
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,250
Garlic Jr. squared off
against Piccolo!

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,958
I want to
show you something...

24
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,541
My source of power!

25
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,166
[NARRATOR] Piccolo was no
stranger to Garlic Jr.'s ability

26
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,083
to transform
into a powerful giant.

27
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,666
But with the proximity
of the Makyo Star,

28
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,041
Garlic Jr.'s powers
were at their zenith!

29
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:42,791
[grunts]

30
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,625
[NARRATOR] And so the
incredible transformation began,

31
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,375
and the pesky elf of evil
became a titan of terror,

32
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,208
right before
Piccolo's very eyes!

33
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,916
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Kami and Mr. Popo

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,458
were walking on thin ice
as unwelcome guests

35
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,875
at the ancient burial ground
of guardians past!

36
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,250
Can Kami accomplish his mission
without losing his life?

37
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,583
Find out, today!

38
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,333
[NARRATOR]
High above the earth,

39
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:28,041
Kami's once beautiful
sanctuary now stands in ruin

40
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,375
as the evil light
from the Makyo Star

41
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,541
shines down from above!

42
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,291
[chuckles]

43
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,083
[SPICE and VINEGAR laugh]

44
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,791
[SPICE] Yeah, that's our boss!

45
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,666
[KRILLIN] Oh man. From blue
dwarf to green giant! Yikes!

46
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,375
[VINEGAR]
It's not over yet, kids!

47
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,208
We're just
getting started!

48
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,541
[SPICE] Yeah,
feast your eyes on this!

49
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,375
[yells]

50
00:04:56,458 --> 00:05:01,125
[yells]

51
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:11,166
[SPICE and VINEGAR yelling]

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,041
[SPICE bellows]

53
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:39,125
[BOTH bellow]

[GARLIC JR. chuckles]

55

Skyscrapers!

56
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,166
[GOHAN] Man o' man!

57
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,291
There! Allow us
to show you twerps

58
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,041
what the Spice Boys
are made of!

59
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:12,208
[laughs, grunts]

60
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,500
[BOTH] Huh?

61
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,958
Hm?

62
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,416
[KRILLIN groans]

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,666
[yells]

64
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,833
You!

65
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,958
Ha! Peek-a-boo!
Come to big daddy Garlic!

66
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,625
Huh?

67
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,791
[chuckles]

68
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:14,958
[GARLIC JR.] What's the matter?

69
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,500
You look a little
stressed out, Piccolo!

70
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,833
[chuckles]

71
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,666
[KAMI] I'm not sure what
that spirit did, Mr. Popo.

72
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,500
But for some reason I'm
having trouble staying awake.

73
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,750
[POPO] Please, Kami!
You have to fight it!

74
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,500
If you go to sleep in this
place, you'll never wake up!

75
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,666
Kami!

76
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,333
[MALE VOICE]
Leave him alone!

77
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,625
Let him rest! Can't you
see how weary he is?

78
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,208
You know what it means
when a guardian of the earth

79
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,416
passes through
those gates, Mr. Popo!

80
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,625
[POPO] That voice!

81
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,625
Kami! Your predecessor!

82
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,500
What?

83
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,666
Are you sure, Mr. Popo?

84
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,250
[POPO]
Yes, Kami! Absolutely!

85
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:32,375
So, Popo. You recognize me?

86
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,333
Yes, your guardianship.

87
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,416
I am happy to see you.

88
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,833
[POPO] It's been such
a long time! I've missed you!

89
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,791
[MALE VOICE] You shouldn't have
brought Kami here, Mr. Popo!

90
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,541
You know that!

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,041
Kami! He's gone!

92
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,625
[gasps]

93
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,666
He hasn't changed! My word!

94
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,375
Nothing could ever penetrate
that thick head of his!

95
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,833
[MALE VOICE] What?

96
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,958
Please, your guardianship!

97
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,375
Surely you know the predicament
that the earth is in!

98
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,791
Please, sir!

99
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,541
Just this one time!

100
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,291
Kami! Hold on!

101
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,458
[BOTH groan]

102
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,875
Please, I beg of you!

103
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,291
If you don't allow us
to release the Sacred Water

104
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,208
from up here, it will
never spread in time!

105
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,583
[KAMI] The people of Earth
will be permanently altered

106
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,000
by the Black Water Mist!

107
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,916
This is our only chance! Please!

108
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,875
Oh, no! Kami, lookout!

109
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:49,750
[POPO yells]

110
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,958
My word! You're smoking,
Mr. Popo! Are you all right?

111
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,875
[POPO] Don't worry
about me, Kami. I'm fine!

112
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,375
But what now? He's not
going to let us through, Kami!

113
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,541
I know him. Once he makes up
his mind, it's all over.

114
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,208
[POPO] I'm afraid our
mission here is hopeless.

115
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,541
We'll be lucky to
get out of here alive!

116
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,833
[KAMI] Get ready, Mr. Popo!
Let's break for it! Come on!

117
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,291

You've made the first cut!

165
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,916
It's too bad,
but your friend Piccolo

166
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,250
wasn't as fortunate as you.

167
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,375
[grunts]

168
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:36,916
Hm! It's a shame!
Isn't it, kid? Tough luck!

169
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,666
[chuckles]

170
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,166
[GARLIC JR.]
You're mad, aren't you?

171
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,958
What are you
going to do about it?

172
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,875
[GARLIC JR. growls]

173
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,333
Huh?

174
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,458
[GOHAN] Piccolo! Ha, ha, ha!
You're all right!

175
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,416
Yeah, I'm fine!

176
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,625
[PICCOLO] This over-stuffed
dwarf can't win.

177
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,708
You think you're so big!

178
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,833
Well how about taking on
someone your own size? Like me!

179
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:20,125
[grunts, yells]

180
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,250
[yells]

181
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,208
[GOHAN]
Wow! Piccolo! Unbelievable!

182
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,000
I didn't know he could
expand his size like that!

183
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,500
Your power's increased.
And you're big. But you're slow!

184
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:49,000
You can't sacrifice speed
for power! Not against me!

185
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,458
[grunts]

186
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,333
[BOTH yell]

187
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,541
[BOTH] Ooh!

188
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,375
Popo, there's a wall.

189
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,333
Yes, Kami, I forgot.

190
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,333
I'm afraid we can not
go any farther than this.

191
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,958
Not without the former
guardian's permission!

192
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,333
[KAMI groans]

193
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,083
Kami! Please turn back now!

194
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,750
Or he'll never let us
out of here alive!

195
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,458
Then so be it.

196
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:38,750
[yells]

197
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,333
That wasn't so bad.

198
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,375
Kami! Wow!

199
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,291
[KAMI] Head for the hills!

200
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,833
[POPO] Kami! Were you hit?

201
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,125
[KAMI] No, it's not that.

202
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,291
[gasps]

203
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,500
No! Fight it!

204
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,375
[KAMI] I'm trying, Mr. Popo,

205
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,750
but I'm feeling
a little light headed.

206
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,375
And, light-handed!

207
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,166
Kami! You can do it!
I believe in you!

208
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,375
Don't give up, please!

209
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,958
Very well, Mr. Popo.

210
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,416
Kami!

211
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,666
[PICCOLO groans]

212
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,000
What happened?

213
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,208
[GOHAN] Piccolo, what's wrong?

214
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:51,541
I know. It's that
idiotic bird-brain.

215
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,208
[GARLIC JR.]
You're losing power, aren't you?

216
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,375
Yes, that's it! Kami!

217
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,875
He must be having his soul
stripped away as we speak!

218
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,916
[POPO] Kami, wait!
I sense something ahead!

219
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,125
[BOTH yell]

220

[GARLIC JR. chuckles]

223
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,750
You've finally
come to your senses!

224
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,416
[GARLIC JR. grunts]
[PICCOLO groans]

225
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,416
[KAMI] No, I can't give up!

226
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,416

227

[yells]

229
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,125
[POPO] Kami, wait!
There's another wall ahead!

230
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,875
[KAMI] Can't stop now, Popo!

231
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,541
But we're about to hit it!

232
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,041
[KAMI yells]

233
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,083
[POPO] Kami! Wait for me!

234
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,000
Can't move!

235
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,458
Oh, Kami! Your body! Look!

236
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:34,083
[KAMI]
Yes, I see, Mr. Popo.

237
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,541
Not good...

238
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,958
[GARLIC JR. grunts]

239
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:44,000
[PICCOLO groans]
[GARLIC JR. grunting]

240
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,250
Hey! What's wrong?

241
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,708
[KRILLIN] Gohan...!

242
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,916
Gohan. Look.
Piccolo's losing power.

243
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,750
I-I think something terrible
has happened to Kami!

244
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,833
H... Help him!

245
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,041
Krillin...

246
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,333
[groans]

247
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:03,416
Oh, yeah! Death blow!
That's right! Time's up!

248
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,500
Oh... Kami, look!

249
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,416
I'll be darned!
That's it, Mr. Popo!

250
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,291
[KAMI] The hole above the
world's seven air-currents!

251
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,833
[POPO] I can't believe it,
Kami! We really did it!

252
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,500
[POPO] Kami! Kami! No! Please!

253
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,625
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

254
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,708
It's the bottom of
the ninth for you, Piccolo!

255
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,541
And here's the pitch!

256
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,208
[GARLIC JR.] Strike three!
You're out of there!

257
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,541
It's the end
of the game! You lose!

258
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,875

[growls lowly]

263
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,583
[NARRATOR] Kami and Mr. Popo
are just a stone's throw away

264
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,833
from reaching their goal,
but suddenly,

265
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:21,958
their destination seems
so very far away!

266
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,333
Does Kami have the
strength of will to defy

267
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,625
the former guardians
so that he can release

268
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,750
the Sacred Water in time?

269
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,750
[NARRATOR] Kami's predicament
has Piccolo down for the count,

270
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,833
and it's all
boiling down to this.

271
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,875
[NARRATOR] The battle for
the earth is between Gohan...

272
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,416
and Garlic Jr.!

273
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,291
What can Gohan do to defeat a
being armed with eternal life?!

274
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:52,333

of Dragon Ball Z!
