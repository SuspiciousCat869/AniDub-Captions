1
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,083
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,291
Evil descended
from the skies,

3
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,083
as the Ginyu Force made
their explosive landing

4
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,458
on Planet Namek!

5
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:28,166
With no time to spare,
Krillin, Vegeta, and Gohan

6
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,083
raced to gather the
seven Dragon Balls

7
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,041
in order to combat
these deadly foes.

8
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,791
[KRILLIN] Sorry... No
time to explain, Bulma!

9
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,833
I need the Dragon Ball!

10
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,041
[VEGETA] Quickly, now!
Follow me to the others!

11
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,708
Hey, hang on a
second! Come back!

12
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,000
What's going on?!

13
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,041
You could at
least fill me in!

14
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,875
Come back here!
Youuu!!

15
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,375
Why those...

16
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:55,833
What the...?

17
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,125
What was Krillin
doing with Vegeta?

18
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,916
[NARRATOR] As startling
as it seemed,

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,458
allowing Vegeta to
wish for immortality

20
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,291
was our heroes' only hope
for surviving the onslaught

21
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,041
of Frieza's
unstoppable henchmen!

22
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,333
I'm Recoome!

23
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,458
Burter!

24
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,458
I'm Jeice!

25
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,833
Guldo!

26
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,083
Captain Ginyu!

27
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,333
Now! You! See! The! Power!

28
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,166
Of the Ginyu Force!

29
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,291
[FRIEZA] At ease, men. I have
an important errand for you.

30
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,708
Thank you, Lord Frieza.
Glad to be of service.

31
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,375
So let's get
down to business.

32
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,333
What is
our mission?

33
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,166
[FRIEZA] It's quite
simple, Captain Ginyu.

34
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,541
Your mission is to
recover my Dragon Balls

35
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,583
and bring me Vegeta!

36
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,833
Vegeta...?

37
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,958
Ha, ha! Stupid Saiyan.

38
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,708
I always said he was
too cocky for his own good!

39
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,208
Looks like that ego of his
finally got him into trouble.

40
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,125
So, you've finally shown
your true colors, Vegeta...

41
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,833
You can expect
resistance.

42
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,708
Vegeta's strength has
grown considerably

43
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,458
since last
you saw him.

44
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,166
Woah!

45
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,625
Huh...?

46
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,333
[FRIEZA] Now, you know what
to do. Get those Dragon Balls,

47
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,125
and bring
me the Saiyan!

48
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,916
Oh, and before you go getting
carried away: I want him alive.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,791
Consider it done,
Lord Frieza.

50
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,416
Vegeta doesn't
appear to be making

51
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,625
any efforts to
conceal himself.

52
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,416
He should be an easy catch.

53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,541
You'll have him kneeling at
your feet within the hour.

54
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,000
Hmm...?

55
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,500
[FRIEZA] What is it, Ginyu?

56
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,583
[GINYU] Who are these
other two he has with him?

57
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,833
Both of them
seem to have

58
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,916
fairly significant
power levels as well.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,500
Others? Ah,
that's right.

60
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,458
It's probably those
two meddlesome pests

61
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,750
we encountered
earlier.

62
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,666
Vegeta must have
formed a little gang!

63
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,750
And what
of them?

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I suppose you
can kill them.

65
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,750
Yeah!

66
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,208
Right!

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,583
As you wish. It will be
our pleasure, Lord Frieza!

68
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:50,625
[ALL chuckling]

69
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,708
[GULDO] Hmm...

70
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,750
[GULDO] Hey!

71
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,041
Watch it, Vegeta...

72
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,125
You'd better start
remembering your place,

73
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,000
you arrogant
Saiyan monkey.

74
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,958
You're nothing
compared to us!

75
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,250
We make the rules around
here, and you follow!

76
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,583
The only reason you're
even still breathing

77
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,708
is because Lord Frieza
has taken a liking to you.

78
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,041
[VEGETA] Hmph!

79
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,500
[GULDO gasps]

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,833
[VEGETA chuckles]

81
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,166
Who do you
think you are?

82
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,541
The last I checked,
you took orders from Frieza

83
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,250
the same as I do.

84
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,708
Just because Frieza's put
you on the Ginyu Force,

85
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,958
it doesn't
change a thing.

86
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,291
You'll always be a
sniveling four-eyed freak.

87
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,041
What?! Why you
insolent little--!

88
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,750
[VEGETA] Now, if I was calling
the shots instead of Frieza,

89
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,416
you'd be licking my boots.

90
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,125
Urgh... Now you've
pushed me too far!

91
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,125
[GULDO growls]

92
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,583
Raah--!

93
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,791
[FRIEZA] That's enough fun
and games for one day, Vegeta.

94
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,166
Playtime is over.

95
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,833
[FRIEZA] I have
a job for you...

96
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,291
There's a nice
little planet

97
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,416
I've had my eye
on for some time.

98
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,333
Why don't you join me, and
we'll conquer it together?

99
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,083
As you command, Frieza.

100
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,333
Get used to that spot, Guldo.
I'll see you there again.

101
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,375
[VEGETA laughs]

102
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,333
[GULDO growling]

103
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,333
Damn you,
Vegeta!

104
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,541
Yo, what's wrong?

105
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,875
You got something in
one of your eyes there?

106
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,083
Snap out of it!

107
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,375
I see
revenge.

108
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,041
Here you go, Lord Frieza,
the scouter you asked for.

109
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,416
The newest model.

110
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,333
Ah, good work.

111
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,458
[GINYU] Ginyu Force!

112
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,875
[GINYU] Let's get busy.

Hut! Hut! Hut!

[thinking] The Ginyu Force!

122
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,875
They're coming!
We have to go faster!

123
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,125
[KRILLIN growls]

124
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,291
[thinking] Vegeta's right!

125
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,041
And it feels like
they're gaining on us!

126
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:16,916
Oh, Dad, where are you?
We need you!

127
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,250
[COMPUTER] Attention.
Destination alert.

128
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,166
Now on final approach
to Planet Namek.

129
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,791
ETA, 20 minutes.

Huh...?

00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,000
Wait a sec...

137
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,000
[GOKU] Hope I've got
a change of clothes...

138
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,458
Huh...?

139
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,375
[GOKU chuckles]

140
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,500
[GOKU] Well, I guess Dr. Brief

141
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,541
really thought of
everything, huh?

142
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,000
[GOKU] There's a lot of trouble
waiting for me down there...

143
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,458
Hang on, guys... I'm coming.

144
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,583
Ten minutes left.

145
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,083
Strange, but, I don't
feel the least bit scared.

146
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,291
Maybe it's the calm
before the storm.

147
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,750
I've just got to try
to keep myself focused.

148
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,666
Gotta stay alert...

149
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,041
because there's no
more time for training.

150
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,125
It's time to get out
there and help my friends!

What are you
waiting for?!

What is it?!

Y'know, suddenly this doesn't
seem like such a good idea.

160

We might be better off
taking our chances

161
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,416
than letting him
have his wish!

This isn't a game!
Give me that ball!

163
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,958
I'm losing
my patience!

[JEICE] Hi, mate!

Aw, man! How'd they
get here so fast?

We've come to collect you
and the Dragon Balls, Vegeta.

Hey, Cap'n...

Looks like we got the

[GOHAN whimpering]

[GINYU] This is going to be
even easier than I expected...

190
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,666
I should thank
you, Vegeta,

191
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,500
for having all
seven Dragon Balls

192

neatly for us.

understand if I don't.

Vegeta was right!

195

There's no way we can beat
all five of these guys!

196
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,666
Their power levels...
They're terrifying!

197
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,791
Especially that one...
The leader...

198
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,583
Don't get too
cocky, Ginyu!

199
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,291
You haven't 
beaten me, yet!

Oh, you think you're
pretty tough don't ya?

202

Well, this time you
won't have Frieza

203

to save your
scrawny carcass!

204

Oh, I've
waited for this!

Really?!

Yeah, that's
right! Come on!

Huh?

[thinking] This little guy has
lots of eyes, but no brains!

209

He's the one
guy in the group

210
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,916
Vegeta could beat with both
arms tied behind his back!

Now, hold up
there, Guldo...

216
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,375
Frieza wants him
back alive, remember?

217
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,666
[GINYU] Vegeta,
don't be silly.

218

You'll save us all

Dragon Ball... Come on, now.

Yeah, right!

222

And next you'll ask
me to surrender

223
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,500
so you can take me
back to Frieza!

he do that?!

us what they say?

them nicely, boys.

Yeah, an' when he
says treat 'em nice,

258
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,583
that don't mean we're
gonna buy you flowers

or nothin'
like that...

please shut-up!

Sorry 'bout that.

still make a run for it...

It's no use.
We can't run from this.

but to stand and fight.

[VEGETA] If we
combine our powers,

we might hold out long
enough to discover

we can exploit.

321
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:27,833
[GULDO &amp; RECOOME chuckling]

322
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:33,041
[ALL growling]

323
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,333
Hey there, Guldo,

324
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,291
why don't you ahead and
take your turn first?

325
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,916
Yeah, now that
you mention it,

326
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,291
I suppose that is
the best thing to do.

327
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,833
After all, we gotta get
the trash outta the way

328
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,625
so we have plenty of
room to crush Vegeta!

329
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,166
All right. It's time to
see what you're made of.

330
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,000
Gohan... Just remember
the power you have within!

331
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,833
Awww... I was hoping
they'd be begging for mercy.

332
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,041
Ready, Gohan?

333
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,583
Hm.

334
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,125
[KRILLIN] Then let's
turn up the heat!

335
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:12,833
Huh?!

336
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:18,458
[BOTH shouting]

337
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,666
[RECOOME] Oh...

338
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,583
Wh-What in the--?!

339
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,583
[NARRATOR] The battle against
the Ginyu Force has begun!

340
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,958
And as Gohan and Krillin launch
the first powerful volley,

341
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,791
it appears they've caught
their opponent off-guard!

342
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:47,791
But Vegeta knows victory
will not come so easily...

343
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,833
Our heroes will have
to use every ounce

344
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,041
of their strength
and courage

345
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,708
if they hope to
win this fight...

346
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,291
On the next
Dragon Ball Z!
