[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,916
Majin Buu realized that he
no longer needed any guidance

3
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,958
from his master, Babidi

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,000
and decided, much to
Babidi's dismay,

5
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,833
that the evil wizard
was expendable.

6
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,875
[NARRATOR]
Suddenly free, with no one

7
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,375
to put a damper on his fun,

8
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,083
Majin Buu celebrated his
newfound independence

9
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,083
the only way he knew how:

10
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,041
with massive destruction!

11
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,333
[NARRATOR]
Back at The Lookout,

12
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,833
Goku learned that
because he had used the

13
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,666
energy-draining Super
Saiyan 3 to stall Majin Buu,

14
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,958
he had even less time remaining
on Earth than he thought.

15
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,333
[GOKU]
Thirty minutes?! Ah!

16
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,166
Is that all the time I've got?

17
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,875
[NARRATOR] Determined to make
the most of every last second,

18
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,916
Goku started training
Goten and Trunks

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,458
in the art of fusion.

20
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,500
Only by mastering this technique

21
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,416
can the boys hope
to defeat Majin Buu

22
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,166
once Goku has returned
to the Other World.

23
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,958
[NARRATOR] These complex moves
will take time to perfect.

24
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,041
Unfortunately, time
is the one thing

25
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,875
the Z Fighters
absolutely don't have.

26

[TRUNKS]
This might be a bit tough.

27

[GOKU]
Listen, boys!

28
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,125
You two are gonna
have to face off

29
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,208
against Majin Buu
in just two days.

30
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,333
Now, that's pretty soon.

31

[panting]

32
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,958
So it's crucial you know
how to fuse before then.

37
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,375
I still can't believe
how much energy Goku lost

38
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,750
becoming a Super Saiyan 3.

39
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,166
[GOKU] Okay guys, I hope you
were paying close attention.

40
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,250
You're gonna have to
do the same exact moves,

41
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,541
in perfect symmetry.

42

[TRUNKS] Uh, I don't think Goten
knows what symmetry is, sir.

46

[TRUNKS thinking]
This, should be good.

53
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,708
[GOKU]
Now, watch us very carefully.

54
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,416
We only have time to
demonstrate this once.

55
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,291
Just follow me,
Piccolo, and do what I do.

56
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,583
But in reverse,
like a mirror opposite.

57

[GOKU]
That is symmetry!

61

[KRILLIN]
What the heck was that?!

62
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,500
Is this fusion or
a junior high prom?

63
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,250
I don't know how
I feel about that

64
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,625
being our last hope
to save the world.

65
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,625
Now, are you two ready
to give it a try?

66
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,208
[BOTH]
Yeah!

67
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,333
Goku, would you have
really asked Vegeta

68
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:05,541
to do this fusion move with
you if he were still alive?

69
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,875
It's just that--

70
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,750
Well, I can't imagine
Vegeta subjecting himself

71
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,833
to something like this.

00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,916
Hm? Why not?

Oh. But, Goten, your left

I'm sorry, but this

What? You think it's lame?

Ha! Kids today! Ah!
Fusion is anything but lame.

208
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
The Metamorese people
who taught this to me

209
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,875
are some of the strongest
warriors in the universe,

210
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,333
thanks to Fusion!

211

Okay. But, first
can you show me

h-how you change
into Super Saiyan 3?!

Hey, can you show me
how to do it too, Dad?

216
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,166
Instead of wasting our time with
this boring old Fusion thing,

217
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
wouldn't me and Goten
be a lot better off

218
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,000
if we became
Super Saiyan 3?

can beat Majin Buu then!

The only way you two

224
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,333
is by fusing together!

that you'll really
learn to fuse afterwards.

care of Mom for me?

321
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,250
Goku, you can't put
it off any longer!

322
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,750
Gotcha.

323
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,000
[GOKU]
I'm proud of you, son.

324
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,541
So long, everybody!

325
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:51,208
[ALL] Goodbye! Bye, Goku!
Nice seeing you, bye!

326
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,875
[GOKU]
Good luck fighting Majin Buu!

327
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,291
I'll see you all
sooner or later!

328
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:04,083
Ha, where you're going, I hope
it's a bit later than sooner!

329
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:11,916
[ALL]
Goodbye! I miss you!

330
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,166
Buu gonna run out
of things to boom

331
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,041
if strong guys
don't come soon!

332
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,625
[laughs]

333
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,791
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu continues
to ravage the Earth!

334
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,458
But elsewhere, on the
World of the Kais,

335
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,208
deep in the heart
of the universe

336
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:38,083
plans are being
made to stop him.

337
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,791
[NARRATOR]
Gohan continues his training

338
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,125
with the mighty Z Sword.

339
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,500
Will it be enough to crush
Majin Buu once and for all?

340
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:55,041
Find out on the next
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
