[NARRATOR]
It was bomb's away

00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,416
on the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,916
as Goku launched
the Spirit Bomb

with the full
force of his being.

[GOKU] Maybe you'll
come back some day.

00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:30,166
As... As a better person,
I hope. I'd like that.

Perhaps we'll have
a little one-on-one!

goodbye and send Buu packing!

[NARRATOR] And with a
resounding flourish of power,

18
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,333
Goku wrote the final
words in the chapter

19
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,833
and closed the book
on his old nemesis

At last, the war was over.

Nothing remained of Majin Buu

Or is he going to regenerate?

and what if he's not all gone?

Remember what happened when
Majin Buu had you pinned down?

128

The big Buu attacked
and got him off of you.

[MR. SATAN]
I've got you...

Right?

00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,916
[GOKU] The fact is, Vegeta,
if it wasn't for these two,

134

the Earth would
be gone right now.

135
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,166
I think that gives them
as much right to live here

as anyone else!
And you know it.

Yes, but, the Earthlings
don't know what went on up here.

00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,500
I think that their fear of Buu

00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,250

Let's see...

142
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,541
I guess we could keep Buu
indoors and away from everyone

for the first six months.

144

Then we could
use the Dragon Balls

00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,666
to wish the Earthlings'
memory of Buu away.

146
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,583

wish it away! Great!
