[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,416
no sooner had Vegito landed
in Majin Buu's stomach

3
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,291
than he was blown apart!

[GOKU, VEGETA gasp]

[NARRATOR]
And the search was on.

7
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,583
Goku and Vegeta were
looking for their sons

8
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,083
who, along with Piccolo,
had been absorbed

9
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,291
into the inner workings of Buu.

10
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,458
[NARRATOR] But this rescue
mission could only work

11
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,708
if the rescuers
managed to stay alive.

12
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,083
[NARRATOR] Into the deadly
gastric juices they plunged

13
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,125
until Vegeta created an ulcer

14
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,375
through which the duo
made a narrow escape!

15
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,208
[NARRATOR]
But one peril led to another

16
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,583
in this living house of horrors.

17
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,041
And the Saiyan
team was attacked

18
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,750

acid-bearing organisms!

comes to finish off the job.
