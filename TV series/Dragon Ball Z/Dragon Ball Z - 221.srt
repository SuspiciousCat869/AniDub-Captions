[GOHAN screams]

2
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

3
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,791
After stealing Gohan's energy

4
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,791
during the World Martial
Arts Tournament,

5
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,625
Spopovich and Yamu rushed
off to deliver the prize

6
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,083
to their master.

7
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,208
But they were followed.

8
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,250
[SPOPOVICH]
We did it!

9
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,750
Babidi should be pleased.

10
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,000
[NARRATOR] Not being ones to
back down from a challenge,

11
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,291
Goku and the
rest of the Z-fighters

12
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,583
joined the Supreme Kai
in pursuit of the thieves.

13
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,333
Although on the
lookout for danger,

14
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,583
none of them were prepared
for the surprise

15
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,958
that awaited them at
Babidi's compound.

16
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,500
[KIBITO]
It's Dabura!

17
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,083
What is he doing here?!

18
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,708
[NARRATOR] But the appearance of
Dabura, King of the Demon World,

19
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,416
merely foreshadowed
the horror to come!

20
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,333
[BABIDI]
I have no more use for you!

21
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:04,416

22

[YAMU screams]

25
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,750
[NARRATOR]
With an army of ruthless minions

26
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,125
aiding him in his quest,

27
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,291
Babidi's dreams of releasing
Majin Buu upon the Earth

28
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,250
may actually be fulfilled.

29
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,208
But it seems the wizard has
failed to consider the arrival

30
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,208
of some unexpected guests,

31
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,833
determined to thwart his
doomsday plot... or has he?

32
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:35,375
Find out today,
on Dragon Ball Z!

33
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:49,041
[chuckles] Wonderful,
don't you think?

34
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,833
Seeing those faces contort
in horror like that?

35
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:57,250
It pleases me to no end how
easily humans are frightened.

36
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,375
[DABURA chuckles]
And they were but two!

37
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,208
There are millions
left to torment...

38
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,000
[BABIDI]
I'm so excited!

39
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:09,208
[BABIDI laughs]

40
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,541
This is bad...

41
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,375
They kill their own men.

42
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,375
[KRILLIN whimpers]

43
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,250
[KIBITO] That's the
cruel game Babidi plays.

44
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,166
He seeks out only the
most powerful fighters...

45
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,875
He uses his magic to bring them
under his complete control,

46
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,666
and when he has
no more use for them...

47
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,000
...he disposes of them as though
they were diseased animals.

48
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,916
If he frees Majin Buu...

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,916
he will destroy
all life on Earth

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,708
just as he has destroyed
Spopovitch and Yamu.

51
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,291
That is Babidi's evil wish.

52
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,500
Oh, there's something else.

53
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,041
Yes?

54
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,916
It would seem we
have some company...

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,625
Yamu and Spopovitch were a bit
careless in their escape,

56
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,166
I'm afraid.

57
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,958
[grunts]

58
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,375
Above us on that cliff face
you will find Supreme Kai,

59
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,333
and several of his friends...

60
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,458
Huh?!

61
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:13,416
[chuckles] The fools believe
they're well hidden.

62
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,791
Seven in all.

63
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,791
Each of them strong...

64
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,833
We cannot use the energy
of the Supreme Kai or Kibito.

65
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,208
But three of these others

66
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,416
possess enormous
energy as well.

67
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,916
It will go a long way
toward reviving Majin Buu.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,708
[BABIDI]
More than that, Dabura.

69
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,625
In these three alone, we will
find more than enough energy

70
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,041
to suit our purposes.
How marvelous!

71
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,875
[BABIDI chuckles]

72
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,666
I never imagined we would
accomplish our goal so quickly.

73
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,458
Let's lure those three
into the ship

74
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,416
where we can absorb
their energy...

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,708
That would be the simplest
course of action,

76
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,500
don't you think?

77
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,916
Yes...

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,250
But the Supreme Kai will
surely try to prevent it.

79
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,833
Oh, I think we can manage to
get around that little problem.

80
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,458
Dispose of the stragglers and
get back to the ship at once.

81
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,750
The others will come
storming after you in a rage.

82
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,875
Very nice.

83
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,541
I need but a moment,
and you will have them.

84
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,000
Good, good.

85
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,541
But spare the
Supreme Kai for now.

86
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,125
For what he did to my father,

87
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,916
I will take my own sweet time
with his destruction...

88
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,916
At your request, Master.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,750
I will leave him
for your pleasure.

90
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,166
Shall we get to work, then?

91
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,625
[DABURA]
Certainly.

92
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,500
But! Master Babidi,
what about me?!

93
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,250
Pui Pui, Dabura will not
be needing any help.

94
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,416
So why don't you come with me?
You can fight at Stage One.

95
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,083
All right!

96
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:10,333
Hey, look. Why is Dabura just
standing outside by himself?

97

C'mon! Move it!

00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,916
Hey, ref! Get a job!

Hey, Trunks,

168
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,583
what's that announcer guy
mean by intermission?

169
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,708
He's saying he's got to
stop the match now,

170
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,041
cause Gohan got his butt
kicked by those two guys.

171
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,041
[GOTEN] You can't
blame this on my brother!

172
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,458
Hello? The tournament stopped
after he got attacked,

173
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,625
didn't it?

174
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,833
[GOTEN] Stop talking bad
about my brother!

175

[FRIAR 1] Is there anything
I can do for you?

No, I-I'm just fine,
I just slipped...

Hey, Supreme Kai!

193
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,916
You said if we break them we
can't put them back together.

194
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,166
Does that mean there's a way to
get my friends back to normal?

195
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,208
[SUPREME KAI]
Yes... there's a way.

196
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,708
They'll return to normal
only if we defeat Dabura.

[sighs]

Is that all? Good,
then it'll be easy.

199
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,333
We'll have 'em back in no time.

Let's do it, Dad.
You and me together.

202
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,916
I think it's time we showed 'em
who they're dealing with!

What're we waiting for?!

Wait, Goku...

206

You'll fall right
into their trap!

207

[GOHAN]
Huh?

208
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,791
They're counting on the
fact that you'll charge

209
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,916
into their spaceship
to stop them!

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,791
It's safer for all of us
if you just wait out here.

[GOKU]
I'm sorry,

212

but I just can't leave
my friends like that.

Watch over everyone for us!

[GOKU]
Huh?

227
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,458
[GOHAN] This place doesn't
look much like a spaceship.

228

[VEGETA]
Hmph.

229
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,708
Hey, there's nobody here...

230
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,500
I thought they'd be
waiting for a fight.

Hey, that looks like a
door over there...

Think we should
try and bust it down?

233
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,333
Uh...? Yeah.

234
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,833
[lauhgs]
So, you couldn't resist

235
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,833
the draw of a good fight
after all, huh?

236

You have no idea what you've
gotten yourself into.

[GOKU]
Huh?!

239

[SUPREME KAI] Once inside this
ship, there's no way out.

240
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,041
[GOHAN]
What?!

241
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:22,083
[SUPREME KAI] Our only hope of
escape now is to destroy Babidi.

00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:26,416
Uh... well... that is
what we came to do...

243
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,375
...isn't it?

[VEGETA]
Hmph.

246
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,041
I'll solve all our problems and
blow this place into oblivion.

247
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,458
No, you won't!

248
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,125
The sudden shock could
accidentally set Majin Buu free!

249
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,166
[VEGETA]
Hmm.

250
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,625
The degree to which you've
underestimated him

251
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,750
is astounding...
Don't you understand?

252
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,041
Even at a fraction of
his full power,,

253
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,875
Majin Buu could annihilate
this entire planet

254
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,791
and all of its
inhabitants in an instant!

255
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,750
He can't be stopped!

256
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,208
[growls] Hmph.

257
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,541
So, they've brought the
Supreme Kai with them...

258
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,541
How wonderful!

259

[laughs]

260
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,583
I thought there would actually
be a fight in this place.

261
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,250
Master Babidi...
Has the time come?

262
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,583
[BABIDI]
Oh... My dear Pui Pui.

263
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:26,208
Please... I'm becoming
quite anxious.

264
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,041
Then... let's put that
to good use...

265
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,000
Go see our guests and
don't leave a drop

266
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,125
of their energy behind.

267
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,500
Yes... Not a drop!

268
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,333
[sighs]

269
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,208
Look at me...
I almost forgot...

270
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,916
I should inject this energy
before it loses its purity.

271
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,250
[BABIDI]
Come with me, Dabura.

272
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,083
I think we know how
this fight will turn out.

273
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,958
[DABURA]
Yes, Sir!

274
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,291
[BABIDI]
Mm...

275
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,750
[DABURA]
Hmm...

276
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,000
[BABIDI laughs]

00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,458
[gasps]

278
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,916
[GOHAN]
Hm?

279
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,625
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

280
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,500
[PUI PUI laughs]
Welcome, fellow warriors.

281
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,875
You've arrived at Stage One.

282
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,000
S'bout time someone showed up.

283
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,500
[GOKU]
So, what's "Stage One"?

284
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,291
[PUI PUI] Master Babidi is at
the bottom level of this ship.

285
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,500
We are currently on the top
level, also known as Stage One.

286
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,375
And there's no way of
getting down to him

287
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,250
unless you beat the warrior
that appears at each stage.

288
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,708
You need not concern yourselves
with getting to Stage Two...

289
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,250
Because, unfortunately for you,
the first warrior you must face

290
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,833
is none other than me.

291
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,916
And that means that none of you
will make it out of here alive!

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,458
[laughs]

293
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,125
[chuckles]
All right, guys,

294
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,333
so which one of us
gets to fight first?

295
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,791
Huh?!

296
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,208
[BABIDI]
Mm...

297
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,041
[DABURA chuckles]

298
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,666
[BABIDI]
Huh?! What?

299
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,041
Half full?

300
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,541
We already have half
the energy we need...

301
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,666
Amazing. All of that
from just one shot.

302
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,375
Impossible.

303
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,541
[BABIDI]
Hmm...

304
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,875
And I'm wondering, from how
many hundreds of people

305
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,916
did Yamu and Spopovich
gather all this?

306
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,666
Well... it's too late
to ask them now.

307
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,000
Right.

308
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,333
But if they gathered this
from hundreds of people

309
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,583
in such a short
amount of time...

310
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,541
...maybe I shouldn't
have destroyed them.

311
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,458
No. You made the right choice.

312
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,250
The energy we gather
from those three fighters

313
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:15,041
in Stage One will be enough to
bring the gauge up to full.

314
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,666
It's possible that our
opportunity to resurrect

315
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,125
Majin Buu will come today.

316
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,708
[laughs]
Then we could mark today

317
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,000
as the beginning of the end!

318
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,625
You know... I've waited
so long for this,

319
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,291
it's hard for me to believe
that it's actually happening.

320
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,750
Let's see how Pui Pui is doing.

321
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,625
Show me Stage One.

322
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,416
[BABIDI] What? They haven't
started fighting yet?!

323
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,291
[GOKU, GOHAN, VEGETA]
One, two, three!

324
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:57,041
One, two, three! One, two,
three! One, two, three!

325
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,250
[BABIDI] Huh...? What?

326
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,750
What in the world
are they doing?!

327
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,375
...three! One...

328
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,250
...two...

329
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:07,000
...three! One, two, three!

330
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,666
[chuckles]
Scissors win.

331
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,833
Aww... I wanted to
fight this guy...

332
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,916
Well. Sorry you won't
get your chance.

333
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,541
[SUPREME KAI]
Wait, please!

334
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,083
You don't really intend to
fight him by yourself, do you?!

335
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,416
Of course I do!
What other way is there?

336
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,875
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

337
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:35,208
[chuckles] Master Babidi told me
to be very careful

338
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,416
because your high energy
makes you strong and dangerous.

339
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,250
But you're nothing
but a bunch of morons!

340
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,625
The only moron in
this place is Babidi.

341
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,291
He didn't investigate
this planet

342
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,041
very thoroughly, did he?

343
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,125
If he had, he'd know that the
most powerful fighter alive

344
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,708
is standing in front of you...

345
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,125
[PUI PUI] You? The most
powerful fighter alive?

346
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,750
[laughs]

347
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,291
[PUI PUI] That kind of
arrogance will get you killed!

348
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,416
[PUI PUI chuckles]

349
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,458
[SUPREME KAI]
Huh?

350
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,708
[GOKU]
Uh?

351
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,250
Don't underestimate him!

352
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,375
Babidi uses his magic to attract
the strongest warriors

353
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,666
in the universe!

354
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,958
Hey, calm down.

355
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,875
Let's just let Vegeta
take it from here.

356
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,916
Okay?

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,333
Are you sure?

358
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,416
You know, none of you
will ever leave here...

359
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,166
And every ounce of energy
you lose as I pound you

360
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,333
will be absorbed by this room.

361
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,041
And as the energy is absorbed

362
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,541
it will be channeled
directly to Majin Buu.

363
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,000
Well, I guess that's
unfortunate then.

364
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,916
Since you won't
be able to hurt me,

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,083
you won't be able to
steal my energy.

366
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,750
[PUI PUI]
Keep dreaming!

367
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,791
Before I'm done, I'll do
much more than hurt you.

368
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,333
When you fight Pui Pui,
death is a certainty.

369
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,541
[PUI PUI laughs]

370
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,333
[growls]
This guy is really annoying.

371
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,583
Welcome to the end of your life.

372
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,333
And I promise
it's going to hurt.

373
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,333
[PUI PUI growls]

374
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,375
Ready for the pain?

375
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,875
The fool has no idea
what he's up against.

376
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,875
[BABIDI chuckles]

377
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,500
[SUPREME KAI whimpers]

378
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,666
Vegeta...

379
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,708
[VEGETA chuckles]

380
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,166
[PUI PUI growls]

381
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,125
[PUI PUI yells]

382
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,583
[NARRATOR] The fight at
Stage One has begun!

383
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,291
Vegeta has the confidence
but does he have the power

384
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,041
to survive the battle with
Babidi's crony Pui Pui?

385
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,375
FInd out next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
