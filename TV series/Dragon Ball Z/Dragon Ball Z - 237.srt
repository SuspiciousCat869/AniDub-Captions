00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,375
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,416
Vegeta unleashed the full
force of his Super Saiyan

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,833
powers on the
monster Majin Buu.

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,125
He scored a hole in one by
sending a searing blast of

5
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,000
energy right through the
belly of the bloated beast.

6
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,291
[NARRATOR] But Majin Buu
wasn't down for long.

7
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,750
[NARRATOR] He was eager to
fill that empty spot

8
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,291
with a Super Saiyan sandwich.

9
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,666
[NARRATOR] And once this
monster's little mind is made up

10
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,791
there's no stopping him.

11
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,333
[BUU]
Big power!

12
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:54,583

[VEGETA grunts]

16
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,750
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu's amazing
demonstration of power

17
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,541
put a canyon sized
crater in the Earth.

18
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,375
It was then Vegeta realized

19
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,208
that a tangle with this
half-witted horror

20
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,916
would not only be dangerous,
it could be lethal!

21
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,750
[VEGETA]
How... can I beat him...

22
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:29,083
...if he's able to regenerate
himself after every attack?

23
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,583
Darn it!

24
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,875
You no fun.
You go bye-bye!

25
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:40,458
Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

[screams]

27
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,500
[NARRATOR]
With Vegeta on the run,

28
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,500
Majin Buu used his own body
to trap the Super Saiyan

29
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,166
and then dropped from the
sky like a ten ton brick.

30
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,416
As his father took the
beating of his life,

31
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,541
Trunks could barely
contain his anger

32
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,833
as he watched from
the sidelines.

33
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,416
[PICCOLO]
Stay where you are, Trunks!

34
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500
We don't want to lose you, too!
There's nothing you can do now!

35
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,500
[NARRATOR]
Vegeta's only chance of survival

36
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:12,416
lies in Trunks' hands.
Can Trunks save Vegeta?

37
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,791
Or will Majin Buu turn
the two Super Saiyans

38
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,500
into his very own
father-son picnic?

39
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,666
Trunks! Come back!

40
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,708
I'm coming! Wait up!

41
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,708
No!

42
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,791
Goten! I won't let
you go down there!

43
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,583
You'll just make things worse!

44
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,791
Let me go!
Trunks needs my help!

45
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,250
[growls]

46
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,583
If I were Gohan, I bet you'd
let me go, wouldn't you?!

47
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,125
[gasps]

48
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,625
Stop!

00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,625
No! Goten!

[BABIDI] Huh?! Who are
those meddling kids?!

62
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,708
So Vegeta still has
a few allies left?

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,791
Ha! Well they can
try to save him,

64
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,833
but it won't make
any difference.

It's all right now! We're here!

Come on, Dad! Wake up!

Come on! Wake up!

72
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,083
Is he alive?

73
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,166
Of course he is!

74
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,291
My dad's the toughest guy
in the whole world!

75
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:28,458
Yeah, but... but he
got hurt real bad...

76
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:33,333
Hey, Goten! Clean out your ears
and listen to me, okay?!

77
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,916
My mom told me. My dad...

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,041
He used to be the prince
of every single Saiyan!

[gasps]

80

He's a prince?!

81
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,083
[TRUNKS] That's right!
He's a prince, Goten, a prince!

82
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,250
And there's no way a prince
could lose to a stupid monster!

That's it! Dad!

Wait! Where is Majin Buu?!

Ha! So he's alive!

89
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,250
That poor fool!

90
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,791
It would've been a lot
less painful for him

91
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,291
if he just rolled over and died!

92
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,916
My Majin Buu is invincible!

That's not gonna happen!

What you and that monster
have done is unforgivable!

My, what a lovely shade

00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,875
Looking good.

100
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,833
Who could blame you.

101
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:57,208
After all, you've seen
the power of Majin Buu.

102
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,666
It figures you'd
turn green with envy!

No, I always look this way!

104

So there's no use in
flattering yourself, Babidi!

You've got some nerve talking
to me like that, you insect!

Yes! You had better
watch yourself

or I'll sick Majin Buu
on you next!

Yeah, why don't you
call him, wizard.

110
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,875
I'm sure he'd be glad to
see you writhing in agony

00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:58,041
The young Super Saiyan clings to
life after being assaulted

162
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,125
by the monster Majin Buu.

163
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,416
[NARRATOR] For these two,
the battle is over.

164
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,625
But for Vegeta, the
real fight is about to begin.

165
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,500
Why would you say that? Dad?

166
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,416
Why do you want me to take of
Mom? Are you going somewhere?

167
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,583
I want you two to leave
and get far away from here.

168
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,583
As for Buu,
I'll fight him alone.

169
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,000
[gasps]

170
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't do that!

171
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,666
Goten's right!
We'll fight with you!

172
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,041
You don't wanna
get killed, do you?!

173
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,708
You've got to let us
help you, Dad!

174
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,666
Are you in?!

175
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,666
Yeah!

176
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,041
See? We're with you!

177
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,500
Stop it... It's too
dangerous for you two.

178
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,666
I will finish this by myself.

179
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,791
Come on! It'll be easier to
beat him with me and Trunks!

180
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,333
We'll gang up on him!
He-He won't know what hit him!

181
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,916
Yeah! We're tough!

182
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,250
We could even beat that
big blob without your help!

183
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,125
Right, Trunks?

184
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,000
[TRUNKS]
You bet!

185
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,416
Might do better than you did.

186
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,125
[GOTEN]
Uh-oh...

187
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:29,166
[VEGETA] Trunks...
You are my only son and yet,

188
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,500
I haven't held you once
since you were a baby, have I?

189
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,416
Come here, Son.

190
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,583
Dad, what's wrong?

191
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,166
Aw, this is embarrassing...

192
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,958
Dad. Come on. Cut it out.

193
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,250
[VEGETA] Trunks, there's
something you must know.

194
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,375
You've made me proud, my son.

195
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,916
[TRUNKS grunts]

196
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,958
What did you do to him?!

197
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,166
Why'd you do that?!

198
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,666
What's wrong with you?!
Why did you do that to Trunks?!

199
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,583
You might have killed him!
Why?! Are you crazy?! Why?!

200
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,958
Why did you do it?! Tell me!
Why did you do that to Trunks?!

201
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,375
Your his dad!

202
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,666
Dads aren't supposed to do
bad things to their sons!

203
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,666
Why did you hit him? Why did you
hurt him like that?! Why? Why?!

204
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,583
[grunts]

205
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,041
[gasps]

206
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,916
[whimpers]

207
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,125
[PICCOLO]
Vegeta, I think I understand.

208
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,708
[PICCOLO] And one day,
so will Trunks.

209
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:06,708
[BUU humming]

210
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:13,166
[BUU humming]

211
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,458
[BUU] Me big mad!
Which guy hit Buu?!

212
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:23,375
Take the two boys as far away
from here as possible. Go now!

213
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,958
Of course.

214
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,958
It's time... Hurry.

215
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,291
You'll die... You know that.

216
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,375
[VEGETA] There is one thing
I'd like to know.

217
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:12,291
Tell me. Will I meet that clown
Kakarot in the other world?

218
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,208
I'm not going to lie
to you, Vegeta,

219
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,333
although the answer may be
difficult for you to hear.

220
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,583
This is the truth.

221
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:37,041
Goku devoted his life to
protecting the lives of others.

222
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,125
Because of his selflessness,
when he died,

223
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:44,000
he was allowed to keep his body
and travel to King Kai's planet.

224
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:48,791
[BUU hums]

225
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,333
You, on the other hand,

226
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,000
have spent your life in pursuit
of your own selfish desires.

227
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,583
You've caused too much pain.

228
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,666
When you die, you will not
receive the same reward.

229
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,666
Oh well... So be it...

230
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,458
[BUU hums]

231
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,250
[VEGETA] That will be all. 
Get out of here... And hurry!

232
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,750
You stay! You fight Buu!

233
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,625
Yes! That's right!

234
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,541
Huh...?

235
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,125
[VEGETA]
Your fight is with me!

236
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,416
The others are of
no concern to you!

237
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,375
Got it? You big,
bloated balloon freak!

238
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,916
Ohh! [growls]

239
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,583
Me no like you! Buu angry!

240
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,875
[chuckles]

241
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,750
You talk mean to Buu?!

242
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,500
[PICCOLO]
Hurry, Krillin!

243
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,833
You have to get away
from here right now!

244
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,291
Yeah, right.

245
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,458
Me make you hurt bad!

246
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,291
[chuckles]

247
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,916
Buu get big mad now!
Me want fight!

248
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,833
I think I finally
understand you... Let's go!

249
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,291
Oh...?

250
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,208
[KRILLIN]
What's Vegeta up to, Piccolo?

251
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,000
He's crazy!
He won't make it!

252
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:38,041
That monster is
gonna eat him alive!

253
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,708
For the first time...

254
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:45,041
...Vegeta is fighting for
someone other than himself!

255
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,500
Controlling his own fate!

256
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,416
Oooh!

257
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,583
You look tasty!
I make you chocolate...

258
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,291
Or maybe make you
cracker and cheese!

259
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,125
[chuckles]

260
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:28,625
You're a fool...
I'm going to crush you.

261
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,583
And throw you into the wind.

262
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,083
[gasps]

263
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,833
[thinking] Trunks, Bulma,
I do this for you...

264
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,666
...and yes, even
for you, Kakarot.

265
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,333
[gasps]

266
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,875
[growls]

267
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,750
[screaming]

268
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:12,041
[screaming]

269
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,500
Oh... Vegeta...

270
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:31,083
Vegeta!

271
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,541
[gasps]

272
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,458
[screaming]

273
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,666
[NARRATOR] And so, one of the
Earth's greatest warriors

274
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,458
has vanished in a
blinding flash of light,

275
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,833
having made the
ultimate sacrifice

276
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:50,708
for the sake of his loved ones.
His name... was Vegeta.

277
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,916
A proud Saiyan prince...
