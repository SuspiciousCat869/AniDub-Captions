00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,083
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,166
Majin Buu absorbed Gotenks
and Piccolo into his body,

3
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,708
transforming himself
into a new, Super Buu.

4
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,333
[NARRATOR] Possessing
the strength of Gotenks,

5
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,666
and the wisdom of Piccolo,
it was a form

6
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,125
that not even Gohan's
awakened powers could stop.

7
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,125
[NARRATOR] With both physical
and psychological attacks,

8
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,750
Majin Buu chipped away
at Gohan's Achilles heel:

9
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,250
his confidence.

10
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,416
But Gohan knew the
weight of Earth's survival

11
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,291
had been placed
on his shoulders.

12
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:56,458
And like a true Saiyan,
he refused to give up.

13
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:07,333
[GOHAN groaning]

14
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,833
[SUPER BUU]
Still alive...

15
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,833
Well I guess I'll
have to make sport

16
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,500
out of smacking you around!

17
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,916
[NARRATOR] But Gohan could not
hold out for long,

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,291
and elsewhere, desperate
new strategies were made.

19
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,041
[NARRATOR]
On the Supreme Kai's world,

20
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,208
the elder Kai
gave up his own life

21
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,083
so that Goku might
live and fight.

22
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,583
[NARRATOR]
And that's not all he gave him.

23
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,666
[OLD KAI]
Now simply have Gohan

24
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,375
snap this one onto
his right ear.

25
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,625
Immediately your bodies
will be bound together,

26
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,791
and much stronger,
my type of fusion!

27
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,083
[NARRATOR] What is the secret
to this new fusion?

28
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,625
Could it really be the
answer the Z-Fighters need?

29
00:03:56,458 --> 00:04:00,666
[gasp]

30
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,375
Are you sure people
can be fused together

31
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,083
just by using some earrings?

32
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,625
Don't be difficult. I'm a Kai,
of course I'm sure!

33
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,375
And it's much more effective
than that fusion dance

34
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,458
you must've picked up
from the Metamorese.

35
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,750
Why, didn't I know that?!

36
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,875
[OLD KAI]
That's a very great question.

37
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,166
Seems you missed out
on a good deal of training

38
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,291
when Majin Buu
eliminated the other Kais.

39
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,833
[SUPREME KAI]
Kibito, have you heard of this?

40
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,083
[KIBITO]
No, master!

41
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
Go on then,

42
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,458
you've got Kai earrings
don't you? Try it for yourself!

43
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,416
[SUPREME KAI] Oh, Kibito,
take off your left earring

44
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,000
and I'll take off my right.

45
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,833
We'll try and fuse our bodies.

46
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,208
Of course!

47
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,416
[SUPREME KAI, KIBITO yelling]

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,416
[SUPREME KAI]
I can't stop, Kibito!

49
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,416
[KIBITO]
Me neither!

50
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,125
[chuckles]

51
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:03,000
[gasps]

52
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,541
[laughs]

53
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,000
Look at us!
We're joined together!

54
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,375
Incredible!

55
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,791
Oh! Wow!

56
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,666
And now I'm ready to fight
alongside you Goku.

57
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,083
Let's go to Earth right now!

58
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,250
Hey! Don't get carried away.

59
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,041
Although you may
have become stronger,

60
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,666
your power is nothing
compared to Majin Buu's!

61
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,375
He could easily absorb you.
You'll stay right here.

62
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,250
Aw.

63
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,416
This earring trick
is just what we need!

64
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Hey! How long will the people
stay joined for, Old Kai?

65
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,250
[OLD KAI] The power of the
earrings has no time limit.

66
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,750
It lasts forever.

67
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:46,041
Once joined, you can never
return to your original body.

68
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,333
You mean I'm stuck this way?!

69
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,583
That's good to know.

70
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,291
Boy, I'd better choose
the right person then!

71
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,583
[OLD KAI] Indeed, I wish I could
do it all over again myself.

72
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,833
What? You used the earrings
to fuse with someone, too?

73
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,166
[OLD KAI]
Uh, yes. Yes, I did.

74
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,583
[OLD KAI] I wasn't always
a can of ugly, you know.

75
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,208
I used to be dashing!

76
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,958
But foolishly I let an old,

77
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,791
power-hungry witch
sneak up on me.

78
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,666
My boy, why are you
wearing an earring?

79
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,458
Give it to me!

80
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,958
[gasps]

81
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,625
This will look much more seemly
on a pretty girl like me.

82
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,916
[gasps]

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,416
Y-You mustn't!

84
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,875
[BOTH scream]

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,916
[OLD KAI] That's why I look
like a misshapen prune!

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,416
But on the positive side,

87
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,541
it gave me the impressive
powers you've seen me employ.

88
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,750
Guess, there's no other way.

89
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,291
It's going to be strange
joining with my son.

90
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:47,166
I just hope ChiChi doesn't
make me go to school with him!

going on down there?

00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,375
It looks bad.

can last much longer.

[SUPER BUU] It's not as fun
when he doesn't fight back!

114
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,041
Perhaps it's time to
put an end to this.

Now hurry and hide!

What's this? Gohan is
as good as new?

Would someone tell me
how that's possible?!

This is worse than I thought.

Hm. Why don't I show
you how it's done!

will be at its maximum.

162
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,833
No! That would be
dangerous, my boy.

163
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,666
Once you initiate the fusion you
may never be able to power down,

164
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,666
and if I remember
right about Saiyans,

165
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,125
they can't stay in their
powered up states forever.

166
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,333
The strain on your body
could shorten your life!

167
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,708
[GOKU]
Really?

168
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,250
Yes, but you will
find that once you fuse,

169
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,500
the additional power
won't be needed.

170
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,916
Now, are you sure you understand
that whoever you fuse with,

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,833
it'll be for keeps?

172
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,250
Yeah, I understand.

173
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,708
[OLD KAI] If for some reason you
need to go Super Saiyan,

174
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,458
you may do it after you fuse.

175
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,625
But trust me, you won't need it.

176
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,208
You'd better dispense
with the coaching!

177
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,583
Take a look at what's
happening on Earth.

178
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,375
[GOKU] Oh no! Well, thanks
for all the help you guys!

179
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,500
Yes, good luck.

180
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,375
[GOKU]
Thanks!

181
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:47,375
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

182
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,000
[SUPER BUU] So, not one
among you can stop me?

183
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:56,125
Then the end of the Earth
is on your heads!

184
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,333
[laughs]

185
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm sorry, old Buu!

What on Earth? Dad,
what're you doing here?!

00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,208

[gasps]

193
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,500
[MR. SATAN] Buu's body
has been split in two!

194
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,583
I didn't mean to do that! No!

195
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:51,666
What a shot! Oh curse
my deadly aim!

196
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,708
I'm too powerful!
You forgive me, don'tcha boy?!

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,833
You're Goku! Where did
you come from?

198
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,166
You're smarter than the
others to try a sneak attack!

199
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,708
Too bad, that won't save you.

200
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,541
Not from me, I've
absorbed your friends,

201
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,708
and taken their powers,

202
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,666
and soon I will do
the same thing to you.

203
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,083
[GOKU chuckles]

204
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,208
[GOKU]
You're wrong, Buu!

205
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,583
For your information,

206
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,125
I've got something that'll
make you finally answer

207
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,750
for every crime
you've committed!

208
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,708
[SUPER BUU]
What?

209
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,541
[gasping]

210
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:33,333
[SUPER BUU laughs] Do I have to
prove myself once again?

211
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,500
[TIEN]
Huh?! Ah!

212
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,333
[grunts] He was off guard!

213
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,125
Uh-oh!

214
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,041
See what just one kick
did to your friend?

215
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,916
Now imagine what I'll do to you.

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,583
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

217
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,750
You were giving a speech,

218
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,458
something about making
me answer for my crimes?

219
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:21,166
Honestly, I was finding
it a little cliché.

220
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,708
[chuckles]

221
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,958
But you sure were quick

222
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,125
to pull yourself back
together, weren't you?

223
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,500
I think you're starting
to get a little nervous.

224
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:36,041
You wish! Let me see what
you can do. I'm ready.

225
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,083
Sure.

226
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,166
Here, catch!

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,208
Huh?!

Hurry Gohan! Get that earring!

[GOHAN]
Uh. Okay.

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,791
Go and pick it up and
put in your right ear.

231
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,833
Then we'll join bodies,
and beat Majin Buu.

What is he talking about?

That's what you're up to?

234
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:05,166
More fusion?
Don't make me laugh.

235
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,583
You obviously do not understand

236
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,625
the power I have
recently acquired!

237
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,083
I could crush both of you.

Uh! Wait! Time out! Can you
give us just a minute, please?

The boys' fusion must have worn
off inside Majin Buu's body.

Now he's mostly Piccolo.

You were playing
against time, Buu.

Forget about it, Gohan.

There will be no need for us

But knowing you, Goku,

Awesome, I have way more

Now, the only problem
is you. Right, Dad?

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,500
Oh, I should've used this
when I had the chance.

[GOKU] Guess I'll have to
fuse with someone else.

[NARRATOR]
With the absorption of Gohan,

313
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,500
Majin Buu is stronger than ever,

314
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,375
and Goku's plan of fusing
with his Super Saiyan son

315
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,625
has been ruined.

316

The earring given to him
by the elder Kai

317
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,333
could be the only way
of defeating Buu,

318
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,958
but where is a suitable partner?

319
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,416
Is Goku so desperate

320
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,208
that he will join bodies
with the bumbling Hercule?

321

Choices must be made,
on the next Dragon Ball Z!
