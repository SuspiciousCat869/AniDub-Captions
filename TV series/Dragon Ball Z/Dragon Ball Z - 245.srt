[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,000
ready to do their
part to stop Majin Buu,

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,666
Trunks and Goten charged up
their Super Saiyan powers

4
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,458
for their first lesson
in the fusion technique.

5
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,291
[GOKU] Good, now raise
it to your maximums.

6
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,791
[NARRATOR] Elsewhere, the wizard
Babidi managed to uncover

7
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,458
some valuable information,

8
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,291
and paused his
spree of destruction

9
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,875
just long enough to make a
very important announcement.

10
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,000
[BABIDI using ESP] Attention,
Earthlings! Attention!

11
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,958
So sorry to
bother you once again.

12
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,041
Trunks, I am
very eager to meet you.

13
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,208
And I suppose that if I
can't get you to come to me,

14
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,541
then I'll just have
to come to where you live.

15
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,666
[BABIDI laughs]

16
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,666
[BABIDI] It's a place
called Capsule Corporation

17
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,291
and it's located in West City.

18
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,625
I hope that you're there
to greet me when I arrive,

19
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,125
because if you're not,

20
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,416
then your family and friends
will have to pay the price.

21
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,833
Goku, if we let Majin Buu get
to West City and destroy it

22
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,208
then he'll destroy
the Dragon Radar!

23
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,000
[NARRATOR]
In light of this new crisis,

24
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,875
Goku sent Trunks on a mission
to find the Dragon Radar.

25
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,500
Meanwhile, he would
try to slow down

26
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,916
Babidi and Buu by himself!

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,625
[GOKU] Yeah, but you let me
worry about them.

28
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,083
I'll be all right.

29
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,291
Hi.

30
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,166
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu was more
than pleased by Goku's arrival,

31
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,000
eager to face a new and
interesting challenge.

32
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,000
And that's exactly what Goku
was prepared to give him!

33
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,625
[NARRATOR] Unless Goku can
buy Trunks enough time

34
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,208
to retrieve the Dragon Radar,

35
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,416
all hope of repairing
Majin Buu's damage

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
to the Earth will be lost!

37
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,750
But in order to keep this
bizarre monster occupied,

38
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,000
Goku may need to use to some
unconventional tactics!

39
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,291
[GOKU]
I'm guessing an ascended Saiyan

40
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,125
isn't much of a
challenge for you.

41
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,833
So how about I take
it up to the next level?

42
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,000
As interested as I am
to see this trick of yours,

43
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,166
time is short.

44
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,333
The good people of
West City are expecting us.

45
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,833
Maybe next time.

46
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:39,333
Majin Buu! Hurry up and
do something nasty to him.

47
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,500
We have an appointment to keep.

48
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,708
[BUU]
Whoa-ho-ho, yeah!

49
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,833
Whoo, whoo-whoo! Whee! Whoo!

50
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,208
[laughs]

51
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,541
[thinking]
From the way he acts,

52
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,625
you'd never guess he could
really be that strong.

53
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,791
Then again, Vegeta probably
thought the same thing.

54
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,666
[thinking]
I'll have to be careful.

55
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,333
I only have to
distract him long enough

56
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,541
for Trunks to
find the Dragon Radar.

57
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,250
Don't worry.

58
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,916
It won't be long. I'm sure
Trunks has made it home by now.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,291
No, no he hasn't.

60
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,166
[thinking] What?! Why is
Trunks just sitting still?

61
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,833
We don't have time for him to
stop and check out the scenery!

62
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,416
He better hurry.

63
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,833
I don't want to go beyond the
second level if I don't have to.

64
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,250
I don't know, that power
I'm sensing... it's so huge.

65
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,708
What if it's
really that monster?

66
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,291
Goten's dad will need my help!

67
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,875
Oh, what am
I s'posed to do?!

68
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,000
I wish he'd give
me a sign or something!

69
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:12,833
[GOKU growls]

70
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,208
What are you doing?!

71
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,291
[grunts]

72
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,416
Stop goofing off
and get the radar!

73
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,875
Ahh, yeah!

74
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,250
What? "Radar"?

75
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,375
Did I just miss something here?

76
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,916
Who in the world
are you talking to?

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,166
And what's this
"radar" nonsense?

78
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,875
Don't worry,
it's not your problem.

79
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,375
I guess that settled that,

80
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,291
Goten's dad has
it under control.

81
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,333
But still, he didn't
have to yell at me.

82
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,916
I was only tryin' to help.

83
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,500
[BABIDI giggles]

84
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,000
Perhaps you're so terrified that
you've begun to hallucinate,

85
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,125
is that it?

86
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,666
Perhaps.

87
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,958
[thinking] I still need to
buy some more time.

88
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,708
Guess I'm gonna have to give
these guys a demonstration.

89
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:09,000
Why you go down? You no play?

90
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,375
[GOKU]
We'll get to that.

91
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,041
First, I thought
I'd take a minute

92
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,291
to teach you a thing
or two about Super Saiyans

93
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,625
starting with the basics.

94
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,208
Super Saiya-jin?

95
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,791
Don't bother with it, I never
asked you to explain anything.

96
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,125
You're going
to love this, trust me.

97
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,875
What you're seeing
now is my normal state.

98
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,958
This is a Super Saiyan.

99
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:41,250
And this... this is what
is known as a Super Saiyan

100
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,250
that has ascended
past a Super Saiyan.

101
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,708
Or, you could just
call this a Super Saiyan 2.

102
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,708
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

103
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,750
Ho-hum. What a
useless transformation.

104
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,541
You've changed
your hair, so what?

105

[GOKU chuckles]

106

Just wait.

107
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:04,750
Has he really found a way to
surpass an ascended Saiyan?

108
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,291
Is that possible?

109
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,958
He must be bluffing,

110
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,416
I mean, what would that
make him, double ascended?

111
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,833
And this...

112
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,791
What's he doing?

113
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:24,166

00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,250
There's a Super Saiyan 3 now?

163
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,458
Do you feel that energy?

164
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,916
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that was my dad!

165
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,500
But that's... crazy.

166
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,500
It IS Goku!

167
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,916
I have no idea how,
but it's definitely your father.

168
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,375
I'm certain.

169
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,166
That... That can't be Goku!

170
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,458
Saiyan powers are not strong
enough to be felt this far away.

171
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:39,750
Well, it is. And I don't
think that's a good thing.

172
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,541
[growls]

173
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,458
Buu not scared.
Big hair make you big funny.

174
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,041
Yes, I'm inclined to agree.

175
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:25,500
This "Super Three" whatever you
said, it's ridiculous.

176
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:31,125
Majin Buu, I think our friend's
in need of a haircut.

177
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm ready,
show me what you've got.

178
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,291
[laughs]

179
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,083
[BABIDI]
We will! You and everyone else!

180
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,291
The whole world will be watching

181
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,791
when Buu pounds
you into oblivion!

182
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,708
Pow! Pow-Pow!

183
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,541
[thinking] Trunks,
you better move it fast.

184
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,166
[TRUNKS]
Yeah, I made it!

185
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,208
Bulma, Trunks has just landed!

186
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,458
All right!

187
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,875
It'll just take him a second
to get the radar from my dad.

188
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,791
Then we're home free!

189
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,250
[TRUNKS]
Grandpa!

190
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,166
[DR. BRIEF]
Well...

191
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,208
How's my grandson today?

192
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,708
[MRS. BRIEF]
Oh, hi, Trunks.

193
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,875
What great timing,
I just made some tea.

194
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,291
No, we've gotta hurry!

195
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,708
Okay then.

196
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,250
I have some fresh vanilla
ice cream in the freezer.

197
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,958
Do you want a sundae?

198
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,000
There's not time for ice cream!

199
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,541
Well, let's see...

200
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,250
Would you rather have a nice
big sandwich, some roast beef?

201
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,541
I just sliced it myself.

202
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,083
You're not listening to me,

203
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,541
Grandpa, where do we
keep the Dragon Radar?

204
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,500
Dragon Radar?

205
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,291
[TRUNKS]
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

206
00:15:55,375 --> 00:16:04,166
Ah... Well, the last time
I saw it, it was umm...

207
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,916
Hurry up! We don't have time!

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,833
[BABIDI growls]

209
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,041
Do it! Take him down!

Oh yeah!

225
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,166
I don't see why Goku didn't
do this in the first place!

226
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,375
I knew it! No one in the
world can beat my dad!

227
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,833
Perhaps.

228
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,416
It's true that
Goku has proven

229
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,208
to be stronger
than any of us imagined.

230
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,208
But the chances he'll be
able to stop Majin Buu

231
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,708
by himself are still slim.

232
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:21,333
Well, if Goku can't do it,
is there anyone who can?

233
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,791
I hope.

234

Hey, somebody's
fighting with Majin Buu!

235

Who is it?

I don't know,
but he's my new best friend!

He's completely unharmed.

[thinking] Amazing. He can't
have seen it more than once.

258
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,125
But he's already mastered
one of Vegeta's best moves...

You're using too much power.

Please, please stop it!

While you still have some
time left. The Earth needs you.

need to get a move on.

to find the Dragon Radar
and escape from West City?

what can't be done and
finish off Majin Buu by himself?
