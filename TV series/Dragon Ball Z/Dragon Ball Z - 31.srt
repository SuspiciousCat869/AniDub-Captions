00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,583
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,791
Kaio-Ken! Times two!

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,125
[NARRATOR] Goku and Vegeta
went head-to-head

4
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,166
in a contest of
strength and skill,

5
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,166
increasing their levels of
power with every attack.

6
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,625
But as the
battle raged on,

7
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:30,625
it was clear that Vegeta
still had the upperhand.

8
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,916
Goku soon realized
his only hope

9
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,500
for defeating the evil
Saiyan was to push himself

10
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,083
beyond the limits
of his training,

11
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,791
to a level King Kai had warned
him never to attempt...

12
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,166
And though Vegeta, with his
seemingly unstoppable power,

13
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,333
loomed over him like a
predator toying with its prey,

14
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,500
Goku stood his ground as he
prepared to launch himself

15
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,416
back into the fight!

16
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,291
[GOKU] Time to see
what I'm made of...

17
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,000
[NARRATOR] Can Goku
find the strength

18
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,250
to stop the ruthless Vegeta?

19
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,250
Alright, here goes nothing... 
Kaio-Ken Attack times three!

20
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,041
[NARRATOR]
Stay tuned!

21
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:22,708
Haah!

22
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,625

Hm? What's this all about?

[ROSHI]

26
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,958
[CHICHI]
What is it?

27
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,416
Uhh... Ah!

28
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,125
No! I told him not
to go over a double!

29
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,208
His body isn't trained to
handle more than that!

[YAJIROBE]
He's winning!

66
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,541
All right! Goku might just
beat this guy after all!

67
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,541
[OX KING] Goku must be putting
up one heck of a fight, ChiChi!

68
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,458
If he did this
to the scouter.

69
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,583
There's no telling
how powerful he is...

70
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:18,875
But what
about Gohan?

71
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,791
I wanna know what's
happened to him!

72

Baba, can't you
get it to work?

73
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,666
Hmm... I'm trying dear. There's
just so much interference

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,333
from their
power levels...

75
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,958
Well, I hope you get
it working soon!

I'm tired of not knowing
what's going on out there!

77
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,833
His power did knock out
the scouter... So, uh...

78
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,416
Maybe he's
already won!

[BULMA] Yeah!

I don't know guys, but
I seriously doubt it.

[ROSHI] The power measured
from Goku was unstable.

Think about it... A candle
flickers most violently

it burns out.

that Goku's in trouble?!

[ROSHI] No, I'm
talkin' about candles...

from the last attack!

I am the most powerful
Saiyan in the universe!

211
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:22,041
He should be kneeling before
me, begging for mercy!

[VEGETA panting]

214
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,791
Wait a minute... Kakarot
doesn't have a tail,

215
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,375
which means there's no way he
can transform! I've got him!

216
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,958
Heh, ha, ha, ha!

217
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,791
I'll change into the giant ape
and crush him where he stands!

218
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,083
I hate him for
forcing me to do this!

219

That form is meant to
level civilizations

220
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,541
and destroy planets,
and now I'm using it

221
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:54,375
to wipe out one stubborn, little
insect... How repugnant!

222
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,791
All I need is the light
from this planet's moon

223
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,625
for this transformation
to take place...

224
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,625
But where is it?

225
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,250
The moon should
be out by now...

[KING KAI thinking] He can
look for it all he wants,

227
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,375
but he won't
find it...

228
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,041
The Earth doesn't
have a moon anymore!

229
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,625
Piccolo destroyed
the moon,

230
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:17,333
fearing and anticipating
this very situation.

231
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,666
But it
doesn't matter,

232
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,208
because Goku has used
up all of his energy.

233
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,166
Ape or no ape, he's in
no shape to face anyone!

234
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,458
If he can't regain
his strength in time,

235
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,125
his only option will be
to use the Spirit Bomb!

236
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,750
If he can manage to
pull one together

237
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,208
and blast it at Vegeta,

238
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,500
he might just make it
out of this alive...

239

[GOKU thinking] I know
he's up there somewhere...

240
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,333
But what's he doing?

241
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,041
I'm sure he's regained
enough strength by now...

242
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,750
Why hasn't he come
back to attack me?

243
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,625
He's up to something...
I've got to be careful.

244
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,666
[VEGETA] Oh, come on!
What have they done with it?

245
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,916
It's a moon... It's not like
you can hide it anywhere!

246
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,333
It can only mean
one thing...

247
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,833
Someone on this stinking
planet had enough foresight

248
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,333
to know that I
would need it,

249
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,916
and they've destroyed it to
prevent my transformation...

250
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,250
No matter...

251
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,583
We Saiyans have encountered
this problem before,

252
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,416
and devised a way
to deal with it...

253
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
They haven't
stopped me,

254
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,666
they've only delayed
the inevitable!

[VEGETA laughing]

256

Come on!
I'm ready...

257
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,458
[thinking] I've only
got one shot...

258
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,250
The Spirit Bomb!

259
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,958
I just hope I still have
the strength to do it...

260
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,416
[VEGETA] So, Kakarot...

261
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,666
You think you
can outsmart me?

262
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,458
Destroying the moon
won't stop anything!

263
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,250
Moon? What
about the moon?

264
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,541
Don't play innocent
with me, Kakarot!

265
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,833
Just know that your
efforts were in vain

266
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,708
because I don't need the moon
to complete my transformation!

267
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,500
Transformation?

268
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,833
[VEGETA] The moon merely
reflects the rays of the sun!

269
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,791
But as they're
being reflected...

270
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,333
A new energy called 
Blutz Wave is created

271
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,291
and added to
their composition.

272
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,791
These waves cause
the transformation,

273
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,750
not the moonlight by itself,
as you may have believed...

274
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,625
What is he
talking about?

275
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,083
[VEGETA] Although moonlight
is a natural source of

276
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,208
Blutz Wave power, it is not the
only way to form this energy...

277
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,583
There is another way...

278
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,625
[VEGETA] We Saiyans realized
that we were at the mercy

279
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,875
of the moonlight on
whatever planet we were on,

280
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,250
unable to control the
length of day or night.

281
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,791
It was completely
unpredictable,

282
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,750
and held our power
at a disadvantage...

283
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,208
Until we
discovered a way

284
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,083
to artificially create
our own moonlight!

285
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,416
[VEGETA laughing]

286
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,583
[VEGETA] By channeling the
energy from within ourselves

287
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,750
and combining it with the
planet's atmosphere...

288
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,458
We can make a synthetic moon,
complete with Blutz Waves,

289
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,625
anytime and anywhere
we want to!

290
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,375
As soon as I release
this into the sky,

291
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,041
the transformation
will begin,

292
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,708

you can do about it!
