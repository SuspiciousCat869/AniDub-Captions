1
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,875
Cell had a surprise for Goku!

3
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,000
[CELL] You almost
fell out of the ring!

4
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,708
If you had, I would
have been declared

5
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,250
the winner of this
little match of ours.

6
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,791
Huh?

7
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,916
Is the game too hard for you?
Should I make it easier?

8
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,583
Perhaps this will make
things more interesting!

9
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,083
[NARRATOR] In a reckless move,

10
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,083
the genetically-engineered
villain destroyed his own ring

11
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,416
so that he could fight
Goku without any boundaries.

12
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,625
[NARRATOR] And so,
across the desert landscape

13
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,375
the battle waged on.

14
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,375
Cell's attack was relentless,
but the valiant Super Saiyan

15
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,083
matched the attack
blow for blow.

16
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,708
It seemed the fighters had
been thrown into a stalemate,

17
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,750
and the bout
would last forever.

18
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,125
[NARRATOR] But after dodging
a string of lethal blasts,

19
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,000
Goku unveiled
a daring new strategy.

20
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,416
Soaring high into the air, he
gathered up tremendous energy

21
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,250
for his most famous move--
The Kamehameha Wave--

22
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,041
and aimed it
directly at the Earth!

23
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,625
[NARRATOR] Cell was quick
to call Goku's bluff,

24
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,708
knowing that he wouldn't
risk firing the blast

25
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,958
and exploding the entire planet.

26
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:29,000
But, Goku had
something else in mind...

27
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,541
[GOKU] Haaa... 

28
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,000
No, he wouldn't?!

29
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,208
[NARRATOR] At the
last moment, Goku used

30
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,416
his Instant Transmission
technique to appear below Cell

31
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,791
and deliver the bang
before the vile android

32
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,166
could put up his guard.

33
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,541
[CELL] NOOO!!

34
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,791
Haaa!!

35
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,041
[NARRATOR] Goku has
scored a direct hit!

36
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,458
Is this the final blow
that will win the tournament

37
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,250
and rid the Earth of Cell?

38
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,541
Find out... today!

39
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,416
[YAMCHA] Did you see that?!

40
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,750
Goku blasted Cell into pieces!

41
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,083
Nobody could survive
the Kamehameha Wave

42
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,541
at that close range!

43
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,125
[TIEN] You're right, Yamcha!

44
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,875
That little maneuver may have
just won Goku the tournament!

45
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,708
Yeah, he's won!

46

[VEGETA growls]

47
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,958
Uh, say, Champ, what
just happened down there?

48
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,416
Yeah! Goku did it, alright!

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,166
That Instant Transmission
Technique really did the trick!

50
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,833
Hey, everybody,
Goku won the tournament!

51

[YAMCHA] Come on, you guys!
This is good news!

54
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,250
We don't have to worry
about Cell anymore!

55
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,458
Huh...?

56
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,708
Man! I wish those guys
would lighten up a bit.

57
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,791
So, Mr. Satan, could this really
be the end of the Cell Games?

58
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,708
Hello, Earth to Hercule!

59
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,583
Oh! Uh? Of course!

60
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
Uh, this new guy
has some good moves,

61
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,916
and he might have
done a number on Cell,

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,750
but that's nothing compared to
what I would have done to him!

63
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,708

Oh, Mr. Satan,

66

it's such a pity you
never had a chance to fight.

67

Now the world will never get to
see what a great hero you are!

Well, there you have
it, ladies and gentlemen.

71
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,166
To our great regret, Mr. Satan
won't be able to demonstrate

72
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,666
his bone-crushing
moves in the Cell Games,

73
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,875
because this unknown contestant
has somehow turned Cell

74
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,375
into a pile of cinders.

75
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,500
Who is this insanely-hair-styled
hero and how did he do,

76
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,916
well, whatever he did?

the whole thing was fixed!

right... It's not over yet!

you with that blast, Cell,

No! Come on, Goku!

321
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,125
You can't end it this way!
You can't let Cell win!

322
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,250
[NARRATOR] Has Goku
lost his mind?

323
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,625
If he gives up now,
what will prevent Cell

324
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,083
from terrorizing
the Earth once again?

325
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,708
Has Dr. Gero's cruel
creation proved

326
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,791
that he is even more powerful
than our greatest hero?

327
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,166
The answers are coming,

328
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,291
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
