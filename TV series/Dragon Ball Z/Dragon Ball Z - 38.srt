00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,291
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,125
Mr. Popo led Bulma into
the barren reaches

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,458
of Yunzabit Heights,

4
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,250
in search of an
ancient spacecraft

5
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,875
that had once
belonged to Kami.

6
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,666
When their home
planet was in danger,

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,208
Kami's parents must have
put him on board this ship

8
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,541
and sent him here
to save his life.

9
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,125
[BULMA] It must run
by voice command...

10
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,458
But that means all of the
commands are in Namekian!

11
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,833
Let's try it...

12
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,583
See if you can tell it
to fly us to Jupiter...

13
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,666
Topurukuppa Jupe!

14
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,000
[COMPUTER]
Topurukuppa Jupe.

15
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,875
Look, we're here!
We're already at Jupiter!

16
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,000
All right! Now we can
fly this thing to Namek!

17
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,083
[NARRATOR] The adventure
continues... today!

18
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:16,041
[welding sounds]

19
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,250
[DR. BRIEF] I kind of feel
a little embarrassed asking,

20
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,708
but do you know
anything about

21
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,000
integrated micro-circuit
feedback loops

22
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,875
and their effect on after
burner ignition rates?

23
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,916
[BULMA] I didn't understand
anything you just said.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,291
So, I guess just
plug stuff in

25
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,083
where it looks like it
fits and hope it works!

26
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,458
[DR. BRIEF]
Right-o!

27
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,000
He's got it all under
control, and don't worry,

28
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,458
it's an awesome ship...

29
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,000
It took us to Jupiter
in under ten seconds...

30
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,541
Seriously, I blinked,
and we were there.

31
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,416
Can you speak up? I'm having
a hard time hearing you.

32
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,333
I'm talking as loud
as I possibly can!

33
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,750
What?

34
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,750
I can't talk now, Krillin.
[welding sounds continue]

35
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,250
I can barely hear
myself think.

36
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,625
But, I'll stop by later...
And we can talk then.

37
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:59,791
[CHICHI humming]

38
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,041
What?

39
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,916
Heh, nothing...
Don't mind me.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,083
[humming continues]

41
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,125
Here.

42
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,875
No...
Thank you.

43
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,958
Gohan, eat or you'll
never get better.

44
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,625
Do you want to spend the rest
of your life in a hospital?

45
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,166
No.

46
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,541
Good news... Goku!

47
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,041
[GOKU] Huh?
[door shuts]

48
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,083
Hey! Bulma said she
found a space ship

49
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,291
to take her to
Planet Namek.

50
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,833
She's already been
to Jupiter and back!

51
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,750
Her dad's
fixing it up now!

52
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,666
[GOKU]
Sounds great.

53
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,708

[CHICHI hums]

58
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,750
I thought these might
brighten up the room a bit.

59
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,000
Ah?

60
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,208
My little boy... Mm?

61
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,083
Huh?

62
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,833
[grunts angrily]

63
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,833
[CHICHI] What did you
do with my son?!

64
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,000
What do
you mean?

65
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,375
He's not here,
so where is he?

66
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,791
The last time I saw him, he
was in bed, reading his book.

67
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,333
That poor boy's hurt,
he needs to be in bed.

68
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,791
[grunts angrily]

69
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,083
[KRILLIN whimpers]

70
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,416
[CHICHI] And you just
let him run off!

71
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,833
[KRILLIN and GOKU scream]

72
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,875
Thanks for
the flowers.

73
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,166

75
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,791
Yow!

76
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,291
[GOHAN screams]

77

[GOHAN sighs]

78
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,458
That was...
a close one.

79
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,000
Gohan!

80
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,083
Surely he couldn't
go too far.

81
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,208
The doctor said his
legs were so weak.

82
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,541
I hope he doesn't
overexert himself!

83
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:41,708
[GOHAN grunting]

84
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,000
Here goes.

85
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,541
See, I knew
I felt better.

86
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,500
[CHICHI] Gohan!

87
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,416
Gohan!

88
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,125
Gohan!

89
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,625
I've been looking
all over for you.

90
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,041
Oh, hi Mom...

91
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,666
I, uh, thought some fresh
air would do me some good,

92
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,333
so I came up
here to read.

93
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,000
You had me
worried sick!

94
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,583
[GOHAN yells]

95
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,625
Hop on and we'll
go back to the room.

96
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,000
But... I can walk...
I feel fine.

97
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,833
[CHICHI]
Don't be silly.

98
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,166
Now, chop, chop... 
Come on, Gohan.

99
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:45,791
There... See? That's
not so bad, now is it?

100
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,666
[BULMA] If the ship holds
up like I think it will...

101
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,041
Then we could easily make
it to the Planet Namek

102
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,708
in less than a
month's time...

103
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,875
I still have a few
repairs to make.

104
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,875
But I'd say we could leave
within the next five days.

105
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,250
Wonderful luck.

106
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,875
I thought we'd
never find a way

107
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,041
to get the Dragon Balls.
Great job!

108
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,250
Yes, congratulations, Bulma.
You've saved the day.

109
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,750
Well, Mr. Popo
found the ship.

110
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,250
And with his help, I'll find
the Dragon Balls in no time!

111
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,541
Huh? But, Bulma,
I can't go with you.

112
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,875
[BULMA] What?

113
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,791
I'm really sorry, Bulma,
but I can't go and abandon

114
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,416
the Lookout for two
months... I can't.

115
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,750
But you're the only person
I know who can speak Namek,

116
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,125
and how am I going to
start the ship without you?

117
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,750
You know, this entire mission
was counting on you!

118
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,333
You can't
just back out!

119
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,791
I'm sorry...
I have to stay here.

120
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,833
[BULMA gasps]

121
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,333
[KRILLIN] Don't worry, Bulma,
we'll figure something out!

122
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,708
I'm sure Mr. Popo can teach
you the Namekian words

123
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,041
you need to use
the computer!

124
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,166
I guess... It shouldn't
be too hard to grasp.

125
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,291
But, I don't wanna
go all by myself.

126
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,125
So who's gonna come
along to keep me company?

127
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,125
Hey, let's not everyone
volunteer at once.

128
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,791
I thought you
were my friends.

129
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,750
I am your friend,
but there's no way

130
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,083
you're getting me
in that tin can.

131
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,083
Yeah, like she was
really hoping you'd go.

132
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,000
[ROSHI] Ahem.

133
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,375
Two months alone
with Bulma...

134
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,583
Sign me up!

135
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,875
It'll be the trip of
a lifetime, I promise!

136
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,291
You better watch
yourself, old man!

137
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,583
Goku can't make it either...
That leaves you.

139
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,125
Krillin, will
you go with me?

140
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,458
It's not that I don't
want to help...

141
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,250
But I need 
training...

142
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,291
We could be attacked
again at any moment...

143
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,416
And I want to be
ready next time.

144
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,916
Krillin... You can't
pass this up...

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,333
It would be a great
opportunity for training

146
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,458
once you get
to Planet Namek.

147
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,416
Alright, I'll go,
but when I get back,

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,166
I wanna see you in perfect
fighting mode again, Goku.

149
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,000
[GOKU] Don't worry about me.
I'll be out of here in no time.

150
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,916
Hey... Guys?

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,708
[CHICHI] What's wrong, Gohan?
Do you have a tummy ache?

152
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,125
[GOHAN groans]

153
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,125
I want to go with
Bulma and Krillin!

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,333
Wait a minute, Gohan...

155
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,416
You... don't wanna leave
me alone for two months.

156
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,958
But, Mom, Dad will
be here with you...

157
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,958
And... I really want
to go with them.

158
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,333
I... can't believe
what I'm hearing...

00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,250
You'd rather go with
them than stay with me?!

160
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,916
Sorry, mom... But...
I really need to...

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,541
...try to help
bring Piccolo back.

162
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,833
ChiChi... Aw, let him go.

163
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,958
[CHICHI] I can't take
this anymore! I swear!

164
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,458
Why couldn't I have
a normal family

165
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,083
that sits down
and eats dinner?!

166
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,125
And talks about
their day!

167
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,083
And then maybe watches
some TV and goes to bed.

168
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,291
[ROSHI] You better find
a safe spot to stand in...

169
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,500
[GOHAN]
Don't be silly, Mom.

170
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,666
[CHICHI] I'm silly?
My son tells me I'm silly?!

171
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,916
I'm not the one who wants to
run around and be a superhero!

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,958
[GOHAN] Bulma, you'll take
me with you, won't you?

173
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:08,958
[CHICHI]
That's it!

174
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,791
I'm putting my
foot down, Gohan!

175
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,958
I won't let you leave me again.
You just came home!

176
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,500
After you had been gone
for a whole year, Gohan!

177
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,541
You're a child!
Act like one!

178
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,916
Don't throw away
your childhood

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,625
trying so hard to
be a brave adult!

180
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,875
Being a kid's the
best part of life!

181
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,375
You should be making friends
and playing baseball!

182
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,500
Not trying to
save the world!

183
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,041
I'm going!

184
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,291
[KRILLIN and ROSHI whimpering]

185
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,541
How did I raise such
a stubborn child?

186
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,500
There's no time for those
childish things, anymore.

187
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,750
My friends are gone, and
they're not coming back.

188
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,250
[GOHAN] I've got to help
find the Dragon Balls.

189
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,333
Mom, Piccolo died
trying to help me,

190
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,541
so I think I should do
everything I can to help him.

191
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,291
I can't sit around and do
nothing while Piccolo needs me.

192
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm sorry I
yelled at you, Mom.

193
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:06,791
But I have to try...
You see, they're my friends.

[YAJIROBE chuckling]

195
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,166
Pretty good speech, kid.

196
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,541
You sure didn't learn
that from your father.

197
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,125
[OX KING]
Don't worry, ChiChi.

198
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,916
[OX KING] You have
a brave son there.

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,541
I'm sure he'll make
it back just fine.

200
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,166
[thinking]
That's my boy, Gohan...

201
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,583
Go show 'em what
you're made of.

202
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,041
I promise to keep an eye on
him at all times, ChiChi.

203
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,125
Nothing will happen
to your little boy.

204
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,500
[BULMA] And besides,
Krillin will be there, too.

205
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,208
Do you think you can learn
Namekian in five days?

206
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,666
Don't know... It could
take me a while longer

207
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,333
to input all the information
into the translator...

208

Hey... How 'bout we
meet up in ten days?

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,083
Sure.

On Namek,
hello is "Piconat".

[COMPUTER beeping]

00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,291
You get a clean
bill of health.

Aren't you
finished yet?

217
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,416
Be patient... Even
superheroes have to spend

218
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,791
some quality time
with their moms.

219
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,041
[CHICHI] It's time to
take your medicine.

220
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,541
I'll get
some water.

Here goes.

Don't hold
back, Gohan...

224
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,250
I need to see if
you're really okay.

225
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,125
Okay.

226

[GOHAN] Hyaah!

00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,916
Good... I think
you're ready, Gohan.

You sure made a
quick recovery.

229
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,833
But then again, I had
no doubt you would.

You've gotten
so strong!

After ten stressful days

preparing for
the long journey,

the group gathered on
Master Roshi's island

to say their goodbyes and
set out for Planet Namek.

[KRILLIN]
I don't know...

00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,333
You sure this
thing can make it

00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,708
there and back in one piece?
It doesn't look very big.

[BULMA] It'll get
the job done, Krillin.

[BULMA] And besides,
if I were you,

I wouldn't be complaining
about a free ride.

You're lucky I'm gonna
let you sit up front.

You think I'm
joking, but I'm not.

Did you do something with your
hair? Looks really good.

over with cheap compliments.

No, I mean it!

Well, thanks... I cut it
to fit in my space helmet.

That reminds me...

gonna need a space suit.

'Cause I don't
have one.

It's not something people keep
in their closet, you know.

You'll be fine
without it.

but you wouldn't believe
how much stuff we've brought.

enough room in there.

look that big.

I worried about not
having a space suit...

At least I don't have to
wear a little uniform.

think so, Gohan?

[KRILLIN] So, what's
with all this stuff?

and sleep mask.

And here's some snacks for
the trip and his medicine.

And we have
a hairdryer,

So, where should
I put this?

You said there was
a luggage compartment.

Just throw it in the
corner and sit down...

to something.

left my stomach back on Earth.

I'm starting to wish you
stayed back there with it.

[ROSHI] I'm sure they'll
have a great time.

305
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,541
Namek must be a
beautiful place.

back to me safely.

307
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,750
It'll be smooth
sailing from here...

308
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,125
And now that we're
on autopilot,

309
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,791
how about cleaning
up this mess?!

310
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,541
Sure, Bulma.

the Earth anymore.

00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,375
[KRILLIN] Where you
going, Bulma?

313
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,208
I'll be right back...
I'm just going to change.

314
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:46,750
You mean you made yourself a
space suit just for take-off?

315
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,583
Man, I was only
trying to make a joke.

316
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,000
I guess we better start
cleaning up... Ready?

317
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,125
Give me a minute.
I need to change first.

318
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,583
Yeah, that's
probably a good idea...

319
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,958
What was your
mom thinking?

320
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,541
Sometimes I think
she really is crazy.

321
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,250
[GOHAN] It's all right.

322
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,958
[GOHAN] I packed my own clothes
when my Mom wasn't looking.

323
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,791
[GOHAN laughing]

324
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,166
[KRILLIN] You really do respect
Piccolo, don't you?

325
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,708
Yeah... About as
much as I do my dad.

326
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,166
[door clacking open]

327
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,791
So... Did you make that
outfit yourself, too?

328
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,416
You look tough.

329
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,250
Good, but I'm trying
to look mean...

330
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,583
I've had just about enough
of your wisecracks, Krillin.

331
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,041
So from now on we're going
by a whole new set of rules.

332
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,708
[BULMA laughing maniacally]

333
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,875
Uh-oh... I don't think I
like the sound of that much.

334
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,250
[thinking]
Good luck, Gohan.

335
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,750
[NARRATOR] Everyone is
counting on the young group

336
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,833
of adventurers to return
safely from their mission...

337
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,541
[NARRATOR] But they have
a vast distance to cross

338
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,750
before they reach
their destination,

339
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:49,791
and many unknown dangers
to face along the way!

340
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:54,875

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
