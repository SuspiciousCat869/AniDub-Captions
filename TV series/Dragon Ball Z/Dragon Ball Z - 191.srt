[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,375
Gohan felt sure he had failed,

3
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,916
and that the
Earth would soon be lost.

4
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,666
But then came a voice.

5
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,208
[GOKU]
You've got to be joking!

6
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,708
Giving up already?

7
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,708
Well, that's nothing
like the Gohan I know!

8
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,083
Dad, where are you?

9
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,875
[NARRATOR] Teleporting Cell
to King Kai's planet

10
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,541
before the monster
self-destructed,

11
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,708
Goku managed to save the
Earth from certain doom...

12
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,208
...at the cost of his own life.

13
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:47,333
Trust yourself, Gohan. It may
feel like Cell weakened you,

14
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:51,583
but what's really draining all
your strength is your own doubt.

15
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,250
Okay! It's all starting
to become clear now, Dad.

16
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,166
I only have one arm,
but that's all I need!

17
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,375
[NARRATOR] Revitalized by his
father's vote of confidence,

18
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,125
Gohan buckled down
for one last run,

19
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,166
powering up to fire
Goku's own choice technique,

20
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,291
the deadly Kamehameha Wave!

21
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,458
Kaa...

22
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,250
Meeh...

23
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,875
[NARRATOR]
The two explosive fighters

24
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,250
have taken their stances,

25
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,625
with power levels
shooting far beyond

26
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,625
anything the Earth
has ever seen.

27
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,458
It's the final
shoot-out between giants

28
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,291
and one thing is for sure,

29
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,208
only one will survive the day!

30
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,250
--[GOKU] Meeh...
--[GOHAN] Meeh...

31
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,333
Now you die!

32
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,166
That's way too big!
Let's go!

33
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,500
Gohan.

34
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,375
[CELL cackles]

35
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,416
[KRILLIN screams]

36
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,583
They're gonna change the
shape of the whole planet!

37
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,208
Cell!

38
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,416
Oh! There's no use trying
to get away from him!

39
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,250
[MR. SATAN] It's a trick!
It's all a trick, I swear!

40
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,250
Someday I'll bring it
all to light! I will!

41
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,541
I can't believe that
you're still saying that!

42
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:19,291
[screaming]

43
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,666
Cell's decided
to kill us all now!

44
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,583
There's no hope
for us I tell ya'!

45
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,208
[DENDE] Cell is stronger
than ever before!

46
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:36,541
I hate to believe it, but not
even Gohan can fight him now!

47
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,875
I wasn't a good guardian!
I couldn't protect the Earth!

48
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,833
[CHICHI]
Gohan!

49
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,500
[GOKU]
Gohan! Hang in there!

50
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,875
This must be hard for you
with all those wounds.

51
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,375
I'm sure this makes them burn!

52
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,416
Gohan's losing it.
He's being overtaken.

53
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:34,166
And now this
is where you end!

54
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:52,416
I must admit, your kid
is one doozy of a fighter!

55
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,250
[GOKU]
What's the matter, Gohan?

56
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,250
You already have
all the power you need!

57
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,208
Just bring it out!

58
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,208
I can't! I can't keep this up!

59
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,625
I just can't hack it, Dad!

60
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,625
It's too much for me
to handle, I'm just a kid!

61
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,250
I haven't changed! Not at all!

62
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,041
[GOKU] Will you stop
attacking yourself?!

63
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,291
I don't know where you
got it in your head that

64
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,291
there's something wrong
with you, 'cause there's not!

65
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:35,291
You've saved my life and our
friends' lives so many times

66
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,000
And you're going to
do it again! Right now!

67
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,666
What on Earth are
you mumbling about?

68
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,375
Chanting a little
prayer before you die?

69
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,375
[GOKU]
Let it out, Gohan! Do it now!

70
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,666
[TIEN]
It's huge!

71
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,875
[YAMCHA]
They just won't give it up!

72
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,208
One will!

73
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,583
You fool!

74
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,333
Don't you realize yet you're
up against the perfect weapon!

75
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,791
No way!

76
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,208
Too strong!

77
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,875
[GOKU] Now what?! I've already
told him to give all he's got!

78
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,291
Wait! What if he's still--

79
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,500
[GOKU]
Gohan!

80
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,000
If anywhere in your
mind you're holding back

81
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,625
because you're worried about
the planet, forget about it!

82
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,000
[GOKU] All the damage
you do to the Earth

83
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,791
can be fixed with
the Dragon Balls!

84
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,041
So don't hold
anything back! Got it?

85
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, but I...

86
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:34,333
Yes! I can feel you slipping!

87
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,291
Gohan.

88
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,750
I'm coming, Gohan!

89
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,375
No wait!

90
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,583
[KRILLIN]
Piccolo!

91
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,583
He's really gonna
go through with it!

92
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,500
Masenko-ha!

93
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,750
Piccolo...

94
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,208
Piccolo!

95
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,291
Go...

96
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,791
Go-Gohan...

97
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,833
[VEGETA]
That's right! Good, Piccolo!

98
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,083
Where did Piccolo's brain go?

99
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,291
To think he could save
Gohan all by himself!

100
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:39,416
[TIEN] He didn't think he could,
but he tried to anyway!

101
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,000
[YAMCHA]
Oh, I get it!

102
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:49,666
Tien! Don't tell me you're gonna
go and pull a Piccolo on me!

103
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,166
Sorry, Krillin, but it's
just not my style

104
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,666
to wait for death without
putting up a decent fight!

105
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,666
Because you're a man of honor,

106
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,666
and a little pigheaded!

107
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,166
Maybe so, but I've
always liked the sound,

108
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,791
of that honor excuse more.

109
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,833
Hey, Krillin, I'll leave
Trunks with you.

110
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,583
Now you're going?!

111
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,208
Let's roll!

112
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,875
[KRILLIN] I guess playing
it safe is one thing

113
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,875
we'll never learn!

114
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,750
[KRILLIN] I hope you
and Trunks will be fine

115
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,291
on your own for now!

116
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,666
You know, 18, it really
was nice seeing you again!

117
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,208
Even if it was
for just a moment!

118
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:55,208
Foolish, really! I mean it's not
like they'll make a difference!

119
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,500
[GOKU] Dig deeper, Gohan!
It's still not enough!

120
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,083
These are your
last minutes, boy!

121
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,291
So try to make them count!

00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,416
Please, guys! Not too
close! Be careful!

126
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,208
[GOKU] Gohan! They can
take care of themselves!

127
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,041
Focus on your energy, Son!

128
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,375
I'm trying!

129
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,250
Would you stop interfering?!

130
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,791
Could this actually work?

131
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,083
You're all so anxious
to die, aren't you?!

132
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,208
Well all you
had to do was ask!

133
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,875
[GOHAN]
He hurt them...

134
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,916
He hurt them!

135
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,791
[GOHAN yells]

136
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,166
No, Gohan, I won't let you
die all alone out there.

137
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,916
'Cause, kid, you were the first
person to ever show me what

138
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,791
it means to have a friend.

139
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,291
Don't know why
I'm getting up again...

140
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,291
It'd be much
easier to keel over!

141
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,083
I know back in the day,
I never would've done this!

142
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,458
Guess I only have
Goku and Gohan to blame!

143
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,333
Those two guys really
changed me for keeps.

144
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:47,041
And you know, someday,
I'll get them for that.

145
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,458
[TIEN] Surpassing Goku
has been my goal

146
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,416
ever since I became
a Martial Artist.

147
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,458
Without him, there's no way
I would've come this far!

148
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:04,291
And how did I repay him? I stood
there and watched him die!

149
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,791
I will not make the same
mistake with his son!

150
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,750
[YAMCHA] Goku, I hope you know
how great a kid you've got!

151
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,708
Like father, like son, right?
Well, I won't let you down!

152
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,958
[VEGETA] It's not fear
that's holding me back!

153
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,875
It's... it's just...

154
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,083
[CELL] Why can't you
people just stay down?

155
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,583
Gohan! Raise it higher!
You can win this one!

156
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,291
They just keep
lining up to die!

00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,333
No chance! You have no chance!

159
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,416
Oh, no! The Earth
is gonna blow!

160
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,458
Gohan!

161
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,916
We tried!

162
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,875
We're all sorry, Goku!

163
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,875
We all did our very best
to be heroes like you but--

164
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,083
Just not enough!

165
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,208
[DENDE]
Gohan!

166
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,666
You can't take my
Gohan away from me!

167
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,916
He's my baby and no one
can take him away!

168
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,458
Right! You can't take him
'cause he's Goku's son!

169
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,208
He can't be beaten!

170
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,791
[GOKU] Release it, Gohan!
Release everything!

171
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,458
Remember all the
pain he's caused!

172
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,416
The people's he's hurt!
Now make that your power!

173
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,833
Say goodbye!

174
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,458
Vegeta!

175
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,375
Now's your chance!

176
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,791
[GOHAN yells]

177
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:05,041
[CELL screams]

178
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:18,166
[CELL]
I'm perfect!

179
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,000
[CELL screams]

180
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,458
[GOHAN panting]

181
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,458
He... did it!

182
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,250
Cell's energy has
completely vanished!

183
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,291
But, you mean we're
really safe again?

184
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,916
Yeah, bud, it looks like it!

185
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,166
Oh man. It's been a few years

186
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,916
since the last time
I heard someone say that.

187
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:07,000
[CHICHI] He did it!
He did it! My Gohan did it!

188
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:12,666
[KING KAI] Well, Goku,
your war is finally over.

189
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,666
[GOKU]
Yeah...

190
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,416
[GOKU]
Gohan, I'm so proud of you.

191
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,666
[GOHAN chuckles]

192
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,583
[NARRATOR] At last,
the terror known as Cell

193
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,458
has been silenced forever.

194
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:33,666
The battle is won, and the
world is safe once more.

195
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,833
Thank you, Goku,
for all that you gave.

196
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,541
The Earth will miss you.
