00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,625
Gosh Dad, what's the deal?

3
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,666
Man, don't you think
it's been long enough?

4
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,041
Where in the world are you?

5
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,291
[TORTOISE] Oh boy,
here he goes again!

Look out below!

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,708
Ah! Tidal wave!

13
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,375
Yikes!

00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,500

Still not good enough!

Hmm?

17
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,916
[ROSHI] He's been so serious
since he broke up with Maron!

18
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,125
No way! That won't cut it! Yeah!
I gotta turn it up a notch!

19

[ROSHI humming]

20
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,083
You know I bet
I could teach Krillin

21
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,750
a thing or two about
getting along with the ladies!

22
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,333
Getting them mad,
you mean!

23
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,458
[ROSHI yells]

24
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,083
[KRILLIN thinking] I know
you'll be back someday, Goku!

25
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,041
And whatever it is
that you're called to do,

26
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,500
I'll be here to help!

27
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,208
I'll be ready!

00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,500
Huh? What's up?

33
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,375
Ahhh!

[crash]

35
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,333

[GOHAN laughing]

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,166
Gohan! We have
a house guest! Say hi!

38
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,291
This is Mister Shu! He is
going to be your new tutor!

39
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,458
But Mom, why?

40
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,958
Mr. Shu is going to help you

41
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,791
take your studies to
the next level, Gohan!

42
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,958
And I was thinking that you
might want to get started today!

43
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,125
Can't I just study harder and
forget about the tutor? Please?

44
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,500
No! N-O No! And that's
the final word, Gohan!

45
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,250
Goodness! Why me?

46
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:20,833
First my husband leaves, then my
son starts rebelling against me!

47
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:25,083
Why me? Why?

48
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,875
Oh, it just isn't fair!
I feel so vulnerable!

49
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,125
Where did I go wrong?!

50
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,208
Ahem...

51
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,625
Gohan! It's time you
two got started!

52
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:40,250
There you go Mr. Shu,
he's all yours now!

53
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:44,250
Very well! I'll do what I can!
Madame, I'm very strict!

54
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,875
Oftentimes, slow
children like this

55
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,291
just need a little discipline!

56
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,083
My Gohan is not slow,
Mister Shu!

57
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,833
Of course not! Every parent
thinks their child is a prodigy!

58
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,666
I'm sure he's brilliant,
that's why you hired a tutor...

59
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,625
Now, please excuse us!
We have work to do!

60
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,125
Cat loves food!
Yea, yea, yea, yeah!

61
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:15,208
You goof! You're such a nut!
Where did you come up with that?

62
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,291
That was from an old
cat food commercial!

63
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,541
Puar hates it when I do that!

64
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:24,500
I ate catfood once! Oh man!
I thought it was tuna fish!

65
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,291
I had a weird dream last
night that Vegeta came back!

66
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,958
What?! Vegeta?!
You dreamt about him?!

67
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,208
You know, actually he was
pretty nice to me in the dream,

68
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,000
and a good
kisser to boot!

69
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,250
What? You kissed him?

70
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,083
It was just a dream, Yamcha!

71
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,666
You poor sap! You're jealous,
aren't you?! Admit it!

72
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,458
Right!

73
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,333
Speaking of Vegeta your Dad said
he should be running out of fuel
soon!

74
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:59,666
Hm?! Vegeta's running out of
fuel!

75
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,125
Man! Aw...

76
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,500
Please do not talk slang
when you're in my presence!

77
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,500
And I can see two
mistakes on here already!

78
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:12,916
Mistakes are to learn from!

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,250
And smarting off
to your instructor

80
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,000
is a mistake I'll teach you
not to make again!

81
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:23,500
Yes, that might be the toughest
lesson you've ever learned!

82
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:38,125
It hurt me to do it, but I'm
sure your mother will appreciate
the end result!

83
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,125
Gosh, this is so exciting!

84
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,166
Gohan's finally going to
get the attention he deserves!

85

How dare you, you insolent brat!

This is what you get when
you back talk to Mister Shu!

[whipping continues]

89

[MR. SHU] I've dealt
with your kind before!

90
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,541
Oh, yes! Little rebel punks!
Abandoned by their fathers!

91
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,291
But they all come
around, eventually!

Oh! Shhh!

Let's go, quick! Man,
you're a life saver, Icarus!

Of course it is!

a hug, tough guy?

believe it! It's you! It's you!

00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,666
It's okay, Gohan!
It's okay!

Huh?! Oh my goodness!

I guess I shouldn't have 
taken that left turn at Mars!

No problem!
What's a year and a half?!

Wow! I hope that's our dinner!

He's back!
I can't believe it!

124

[GOHAN] So what happened
up there on Namek, Dad?

125
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,541
What happened to Frieza?

126

a long story, Gohan!

hear it right before dinner!

you been all this time, Dad?

[MR. SHU] Ahhh!
Let go! Please kid!

137
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,250
Let go!
You're killing me! Ah-ah!

138
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,666
I beg of you!
Please let go of me!

139

My gosh! What are you?!
You... you mad man!

140
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,541
You almost broke my arm!

141
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,750
How dare you attack
me like that!

142
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,166
I was dreaming!

143
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,583
Well it's about time
you came to your senses!

144
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,750
That's your father's
influence, I'll bet!

I've heard the talk, yes.

146
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,833
He's a brainless brute!

[GOHAN growls]

How dare you! You punk!

149

Are you challenging me?!
Well, take this!

For your information, Mister
Shu, my father is not a brute!

152
00:11:55,708 --> 00:12:00,208
He's a great man!
Is that clear?!

153
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,916
You wouldn't!

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,375
Defend my Dad's honor?
You better believe I will!

155
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,625
Let's talk about this! With
your Mother here of course!

[MR. SHU] Yes, although he can
appear to be quite normal...

You're son is afflicted with
what I call the demon-seed!

Yes, it is a seed of rebellion
and contempt for his superiors!

164

You can let this seed grow,
or nip it in the bud!

gone off fighting somewhere!

Right! Right!
Am I right!

Of course I'm right!

178
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,208
It's only natural
that the child

should want to follow in
his father's violent footsteps

180

After being abandoned
by the worthless father,

Oh my! Maybe you'd
prefer some coffee?

I was hoping that Kakarot
might have finally returned?

just be the therapy I need!
