00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,166
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,041
Piccolo took on the ruthless
Frieza in a one-on-one battle.

3
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,416
With Piccolo and Nail
becoming one,

4
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,083
it appeared the fight against
the all powerful Frieza

5
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,708
had finally turned around.

6
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,208
[NARRATOR] Was the Namek
pair strong enough?

7
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,666
At least for a while
it appeared so.

8
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,291
All we have to do
is fight as one.

9
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,458
[NARRATOR] As Frieza learned
of the Namekian trick,

10
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:42,208
he upped his efforts,
launching an incredible blast.

11
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,208
[NARRATOR] But the new
Piccolo reflected it,

12
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,166
sending it straight back
to the evil Frieza!

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,583
However, it would take more than
that to stop this villain.

14
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,541
[NARRATOR] Piccolo gathered
his strength for another

15
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,750
massive assault
against Frieza.

16
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,500
[FRIEZA screams]

17
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,125
What the...?

18
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,333
[NARRATOR] But when
the smoke cleared,

19
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,791
Frieza was still standing.

20
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,416
[NARRATOR] The battle
continues... today!

21
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,875
Oh, wow. It looks like Piccolo
whipped Frieza's butt!

22
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,416
No! It is not over with!

23
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,208
Hey, Vegeta, from what I've
seen, Frieza's finished!

24
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,625
[thinking] Oh, these morons
just don't get it!

25
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,500
There's no way that
Frieza's dead!

26
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,833
And they think this is easy...

27
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,916
All right! Thanks to Piccolo,
Frieza's finally bit the dust!

28
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,375
Right on!

29
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,708
[thinking] Now I see why Piccolo
wanted to merge with Nail.

30
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,583
Their combined power was just
too much for Frieza to handle!

31
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:34,833
[thinking] Frieza's power level
is way down! Come on, guys...

32
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,250
You gotta tell us...

33
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,000
Did Piccolo defeat Frieza,

34
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,750
or are we still stuck up here
in this eternal limbo?!

35
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,375
Let's put it this way,
he's our only hope.

36
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,958
[KING KAI] Hmmm...

37
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,000
[PICCOLO grunts]

38
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,458

[GOHAN screams]

42
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:02,625
[FRIEZA laughs]

43
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,916
[PICCOLO] What the--?!

44
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,125
Ah! It doesn't matter how
quick I make a move,

45
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,583
he still beats me!

46
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,791
[PICCOLO grunts]

47
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,291
[FRIEZA chuckles]

48
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,958
What'd we do now...?

49
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,250
Don't worry, Gohan!
It's just like they say:

50
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,291
"It ain't over 'til
the fat lady sings!"

51
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,250
Well, I'd say she just
hummed a few bars.

52
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,541
[thinking] I've got to
find a way outta here.

53
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,125
I could save
myself at least...

54
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,208
[thinking] Nail...

55
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,875
[GOKU] Oh no! Piccolo!
What's happening?

56
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,708
Piccolo!

57
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,250
Well, King Kai?!

58
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,875
It is out of my hands.

59
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,000
All we can do right now
is trust in Piccolo.

60
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,458
[BOTH growl]

61
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,250
[FRIEZA chuckles]

62
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,541
[FRIEZA] Well, it looks like
the tables have turned again,

63
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,541
my friend, and this
time for the last time!

64
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,958
So, are you ready for a
taste of your demise?

65
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,583
Because it's coming
up right now!

66
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,166
[thinking] Darn it,
Frieza's taken a beating

67
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,708
and he's still not down!

68
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,166
How did I ever think I
could beat him on my own?

69
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,166
[FRIEZA] Hmm...?

70
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,458
[bones popping]

71
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,916
Alright, Frieza.
I don't have all day.

72
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,791
What?! You're serious?

73
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,500
Hmph.

74
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,041
[FRIEZA] Well, I will give you
bonus points for courage.

75
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,833
[FRIEZA laughs]

76
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,333
[FRIEZA] But that's all one
could expect from a Namek.

77
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,166
Sticks and stones, Frieza.

78
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:52,041
[thinking] Piccolo, you idiot!
Don't make him any angrier!

79
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,500
What the--? Piccolo!

80
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,916
I think I get it!

81
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Piccolo's gathering up his
strength inside from Nail,

82
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,375
and then he's going to
turn it all on Frieza!

83
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,208
Huh...?

84
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,000
It's time you feel the wrath

85
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,083
of all the Nameks
you've destroyed!

86
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,875
[PICCOLO yells]

87
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,583
[FRIEZA laughs]

88
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,083
[thinking] I can feel Piccolo's
strength. It's growing!

89
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,958
And it's bigger
than it's ever been!

90
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,041
Piccolo! I know
you can beat him!

91
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,916
Go for it! Come on!

92
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,416
Perhaps I was wrong
about this one?!

93
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,250
[FRIEZA] Well, I don't know
about you, but I'm ready.

94
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,166
So, whenever you're
finished "powering up",

95
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,750
then maybe we can
get started, hmm?

96
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,125

Oh, by the way, you
cow-headed clown,

104
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,416
I'm only getting warmed up.

105

--Yeah!

107
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,791
Did you see that?!

[DENDE laughs]

109
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,625
You did it, Nail!

110
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,458
I can't believe
it's over, Krillin.

111
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,916
Me neither.

112
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,583
[thinking] It looks like Piccolo
really did it this time.

113
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,166
And with Frieza out of the way,

114
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,583
it's only a matter of time until
I destroy the rest of them!

[VEGETA chuckles]

116
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,583

Frieza's history?

00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,583
[KRILLIN] I hope so!

121
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,250

What does a Namek have to do?

124

I just wish you could get
it through your head...

125
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,375
You can't defeat me!

126
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,000
Just watch me!

00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,833
[FRIEZA chuckles]

128
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,500
Your problem is you don't
know how strong I really am.

129
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,125
See, there is one thing
I should tell you about,

130
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,750
and that's my
power to transform.

131
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,708
You didn't see my
first transformation,

132
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,041
but I have others.

133
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,875
And each time, my strength
becomes much stronger.

134
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,291
Which means all your efforts
were against a weak me.

135
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,791
Understand?

136
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,916
Good! Now that that little
business has been cleared up,

137
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,375
I think it's about
time I finish you off!

138
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,416
[FRIEZA] Now you'll
see I wasn't bluffing

139
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,416
because I'll be transforming
before your very eyes.

140
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,875
Watch carefully now.

141
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,083
And keep in mind it's
not my ultimate form.

142
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,958
I still have one more
transformation!

143
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,416
You're full of it.

144
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,250
What's he doing?

145
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,833
Well, I'd say...
he's in trouble!

146
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:43,875
Y-You're right. Especially
if Frieza transforms again.

147
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,000
[thinking] You know, it's times
like this I think to myself:

148
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,500
Why didn't I just become
a shoe salesman?!

149
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:53,083
[FRIEZA] I suggest you stand
back while I demonstrate.

150
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,916
Ladies and gentlemen,
with great honor

151
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,166
I present to you

152
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,291
the most amazing
transformation ever witnessed!

never live to see another.

[FRIEZA chuckles]

168
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,958
[FRIEZA] So, tell me,
how do I look?

169
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,875
I may not win any
beauty contests,

170
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,208
but I'll beat your tail!

171
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,833
You? Disgusting.

172
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,083
[FRIEZA laughs]

173
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,041
Well, it doesn't look like
Frieza changed that much.

174
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,333
Are you kidding?! Unless you've
completely lost it, baldy,

175
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,666
Frieza's probably
indestructible, now!

176
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,791
[FRIEZA chuckles]

177
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,791
I don't get it. How'd
Frieza recover so fast

178
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,875
after everything
Piccolo did to him?

179
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,000
[GOKU thinking] What's
going on out there?

180
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:37,916
I can sense Frieza's power
growing every second.

181
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,625
But if I don't get my
strength back pretty quick,

182
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,291
we don't stand a chance!

183
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:47,750
And if that happens, I could
never forgive myself.

184
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,750
[thinking] Frieza has
turned into a far greater

185
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,250
monster than I ever imagined!

186
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,833
[FRIEZA laughs]

187
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,625
[PICCOLO growls]

188
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,916
[FRIEZA} You seem
pretty sure of yourself,

189
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,916
so why don't you come
and get a piece of me?

190
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,750
Well, it looks like I'll have
to get the ball rolling again.

191
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,375
[FRIEZA] Ha-ha!

192
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,958
[PICCOLO chuckles]

193
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,500
[thinking] You may be
stronger than me, Frieza,

194
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,000
but with my speed,
you'll never catch me!

195
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,708
[PICCOLO gasps]

196
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,416
[thinking] It's not possible!

197
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,833
Well, hello there.
Haven't we met before?

198
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,333
It's been so long
waiting for you.

199
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,541
Boy, it looks like Frieza's
way faster than Piccolo.

200
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,958
Faster, stronger, you name it!
Frieza's has Piccolo beat.

201
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,791
[thinking] C'mon, Nail,
hang in there!

202
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,041
[VEGETA chuckles]

203
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,916
Please listen. I have
the power to heal you.

204
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,750
[VEGETA thinking] Ah, yes,
the little green one.

205
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,708
He's going to come in handy.

206

We believe in you, Piccolo.

211

Yes...

Now, now, you're not

[FRIEZA chuckles]

224
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,666
So you really thought
your "superior speed"

225
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,833
was going to save you, eh?

226
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,875
Well, you're a lot
dumber than you look,

227
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,000
you inferior little Namekian.

228
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,125
Looks like it's time
to shut out the lights!

Oh man, would ya look at that?!

00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,041
How much more
can Piccolo take?

No, Krillin!

254
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,333
What do you think
you're doing, Vegeta?!

255
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,583
Come on, Krillin.
Don't be a fool!

256
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,708
[KRILLIN] But... Gohan
will never make it!

257
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,250
Look at me! if you really want
to save your little friend,

258
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,833
beat me up!

259
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:10,583
Don't waste your time taking on
Frieza. This is our only chance!

260
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,791
[thinking] If Krillin can beat
me to within an inch of my life,

261
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:22,291
that kid down there will heal me
and I'll finally become...

262
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,416
a true Super Saiyan!

[GOHAN yells]

264
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,416
[NARRATOR] Will Gohan arrive
in time to save Piccolo?

265
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,791
Or is Frieza too
powerful to defeat

266
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,000
since his second
transformation?

267
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,000
And how will Krillin handle
a battle with Vegeta?

268
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:53,000
