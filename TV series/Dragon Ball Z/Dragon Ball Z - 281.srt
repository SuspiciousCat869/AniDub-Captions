[NARRATOR] On the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,500
the battle to decide the fate
of the Universe continued,

3
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,208
as Super Saiyan 3 Goku
went head to head

4
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,666
with the elastic Majin Buu.

[KID BUU screams]

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,750
[NARRATOR]
Goku fought valiantly,

9
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,666
but the more brilliant
the attack,

10
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,458
the more demoralizing the result

11
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,333
against the seemingly
invincible Buu.

12
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,166
[NARRATOR]
It was an impossible situation

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,375
of nightmarish proportions,

14
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,833
one made to order for
the unshakeable Saiyan.

15
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,875
[NARRATOR] And after Vegeta
had tried and failed

16
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,541
to measure up to the same test,

17
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,000
the proud Saiyan prince
finally realized

18
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,208
that Goku was truly
in a league of his own.

You're better than me, Kakarot.

better than anyone

that I don't stand a chance

any other way, Kakarot?

All right, but on one condition.

I don't want you
to do anything reckless.

Just hold him off
and that's it, okay?

and blow yourself up again.

you won't exist anymore.
