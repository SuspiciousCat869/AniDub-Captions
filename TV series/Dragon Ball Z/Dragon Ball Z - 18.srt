00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,583
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,666
The two Saiyans, the strongest
fighters in the universe,

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,500
continued their intergalactic
journey towards Earth...

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,791
Their goal, torment
the population

5
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,541
and wreak havoc
on the planet...

6
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,791
That is unless Goku and
the other Z warriors

7
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,333
can stop them...

8
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,208
But they'll have to move fast
because time is running out.

9
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,875
Oh man, how far does
this road go on?

10
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,000
It seems like there's
no end to it at all.

11
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,791
I've been running
for days and days...

12
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,583
I hope this is worth it because
it's been almost a year now

13
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,333
and I still haven't
found King Kai!

14
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,958
[NARRATOR]
Hang in there Goku,

15
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,291
remember you've got
Gohan and on your side.

16
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,583
And right now he's being
trained by Piccolo,

17
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,583
who is a great martial
artist in his own right!

18
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,250
[PICCOLO] Haaa!

19
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,500
[GOHAN yells]

20
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,000
[NARRATOR] Piccolo's methods
may seem a little rough

21
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,916
but compared to what
the Saiyans will do,

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,666
this training session
is a walk in the park.

23
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,333
If Gohan can master these
new fighting skills in time,

24
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,416
Earth still might
have a chance...

25
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,083
If he can't, then
it's all over!

26
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,583
Come on, Gohan!
You can do it!

27
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,500
It's in your
hands now...

28
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,583
'Cause if you can't save
the day, then who will?

29
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:37,375
[COMPUTER] Wake up, Kakarot...
Destroy all life forms...

Wake up, Kakarot...

31
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,041

[GOHAN] Ow! My head
really hurts.

39
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,750
Let's take a break
for awhile, okay?

40
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,083
[PICCOLO]
You don't need a break!

41
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,458
Now stop whining and
let's get back to work.

42
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,666
No, really, I don't
think I can move.

43
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,583
Heh, heh. Yah!

44
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,208
[PICCOLO]
Huh?

Fooled ya!

47
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,333
[PICCOLO] Can't you jump
any higher than that?

48
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,458
[PICCOLO yells]

00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,708
[GOHAN]
Aaaahhh! Piccolo!

50
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,958
I'll make that kid
stronger than all of us!

finish you off!

I don't know!

back with the Dragon Balls.
