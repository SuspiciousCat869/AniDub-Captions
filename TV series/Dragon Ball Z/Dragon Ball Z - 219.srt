00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR] Last time
on DragonBall Z,

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,875
The Great Saiyaman,
or rather, Gohan,

3
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,458
entered the ring
with his opponent Kibito.

4
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,083
Gohan's true identity
had been revealed

5
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,208
so there was no sense
hiding it anymore.

6
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,083
But he didn't expect
that all his secrets

7
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,666
would be revealed.

8
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,750
[KIBITO] Gohan, I am curious to
see your Super Saiyan powers.

9
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,375
Show them to me!
We may be able to use them!

10
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,041
[NARRATOR]
To everyone's surprise,

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,541
Shin stepped forward to
reveal that Gohan

12
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,666
had become a pawn
in a much larger plan.

13
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,583
[SUPREME KAI] You do not
need to worry about Gohan.

14
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,750
He will be fine.

15
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,791
But no matter what happens,
I want all of you to promise me

16
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,500
that you'll stay out
of the ring.

17
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,500
Do you understand?

18
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,916
What? No way!

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,500
What do you want with Gohan?

20
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,333
[NARRATOR] This mysterious
message seemed to spell trouble

21
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,875
for Gohan, but when the
Z-Fighters learned that Shin

22
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,708
was none other than
the Supreme Kai himself,

23
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,750
they had no choice
but to obey his request.

24
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,916
Meanwhile, two pairs
of hungry eyes

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,583
closely monitor
Gohan's power, but why?

26
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,458
A conspiracy is brewing,
today on Dragon Ball Z!

27
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,625
Wanna see me turn
into a Super Saiyan?

28
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,083
Fine! I'll do it!

29
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,250
Just remember, you asked for it!

30
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,708
Goku, I got a bad
feeling about this...

31
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,916
I think Gohan's in trouble.

32
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,750
Listen, the instant
Gohan transforms,

33
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,208
I'm certain Spopovitch and
Yamu will try to attack him.

34
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,416
[GOKU] Hm?

35
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
[SUPREME KAI] But as
I've already told you,

36
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,500
you must not try to help him!

37
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,083
I don't know what you're after,

38
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,250
but Gohan can
take care of himself.

39
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,458
He doesn't need
any help from us.

40
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,166
Yes, of course...

41
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,791
What makes you so sure

42
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,375
that those two are
going to attack Gohan?

43
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,375
[SUPREME KAI] Spopovitch
and Yamu are not yet aware

44
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,833
of it, but Gohan is the one
they are searching for...

45
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:36,666
Don't worry. They don't want
his life--only his energy.

46
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,125
Energy?

47
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,291
[VEGETA grunts]

48
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,750
[VEGETA Hey!

49
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,583
Last chance for requests!

50
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,333
Do you just want to see
a Super Saiyan,

51
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,291
or should I take it up
to the next level?!

52
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,750
What's that?

53
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,416
There's a level beyond
a Super Saiyan?

54
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,875
[GOHAN grunts]

55
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:12,291

Hey, look! Yamu!

[YAMU growls]

65
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,250
All that energy! It's him!

66
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,083
You're kidding!
Is this for real?

67
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,416
Gohan is the Gold Fighter?

68
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,791
Impossible!

69
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:39,166
Ah! He's the Great Saiyaman
AND the Gold Fighter?!

70
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,041
Boy, he sure is
talented, huh?

71
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,791
[Oh wow, uh... he's strong...

72
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:50,375
[CHICHI] That's my boy! See?!
Didn't I tell you?! Huh?!

73
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:54,625
Now come on, you guys!
Let's hear it for Gohan!

74
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,583
Go, Gohan!

75
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,333
There, now you know
what I can do!

76
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,416
Is this good enough for ya?

77
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,416
What happens now?
Should I start fighting?

78
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,083
[KIBITO thinking]
What enormous energy...

79
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:13,041
He is far stronger
than I expected...

80
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,125
[VEGETA] Bah! Gohan had a lot
more power when he fought Cell.

81
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,541
I think your son has gone soft

82
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,083
in these peaceful times,
Kakarot.

83
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,875
You may be right, but he is
still the strongest fighter

84
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,375
at this tournament.

85
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,125
The only question is,
will it be enough?

86
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,791
[GOKU] Hm?! For what?

87
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,916
What does he mean?

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,250

What's the matter?
C'mon, fight me!

00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,416
[GOHAN]
What are you waiting for?

91
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,250
A written invitation?

92
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:53,166
Hey, hold on! Golden Boy, there!
I remember seeing that kid

93
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,125
when Mr. Satan
was fighting Cell!

94
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,541
Yeah, man, I think
you're right. It's gotta be him!

95
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,916
Come on! Let's get him!

96
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,500
Make sure you hold on
to him and don't let go!

97
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,041
Do you understand?

Kibito will take care
of Gohan now.

He has no need
of your assistance.

At least tell us what
you're gonna do with him?

It's time!

I must follow them and find out

where they are taking
Gohan's power!

I could use your help...

I understand if feel you
have to stay here...

00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,500
Long ago, at a time
when the human race

322
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,083
was still in its infancy
here on Earth...

323
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,750
a powerful wizard from the
distant edge of the universe

324
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,416
named Bibidi,
first appeared...

325
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
With him, he brought a
terrible monster

326
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:06,000
of his own creation, whose
sole purpose was to detsroy...

327
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,083
The name of that
monster was Majin Buu.

328
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,041
[GOKU] Buu, huh?
So what did this guy do?

329
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,625
[SUPREME KAI] Majin Buu had
no feelings or conscience.

330
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,708
He was designed as an
instrument of fear and terror.

331
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:22,041
His single desire was to
eliminate all living things.

332
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,500
And he was very good at it!

333
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,958
[VEGETA chuckles]

334
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,791
[SUPREME KAI] With Majin Buu
under his control,

335
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,333
Bibidi set about the
systematic destruction

336
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,000
of all life in the universe.

337
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,833
Hundreds of planets
were reduced to rubble.

338
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,708
Entire galaxies were
erased from existence.

339
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,666
No force could withstand
his evil power...

340
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,958
[VEGETA thinking]
This Majin Buu sounds like

341
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,958
he would have made
a decent Saiyan...

342
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,708
No, you're wrong Vegeta!

343
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:54,875
[VEGETA gasps]

344
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,041
There were five Grand
Kais at that time,

345
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,375
each one a thousand times
more powerful

346
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,041
than the one you called Frieza.

347
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,541
When they fought Buu...
only one survived.

348
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,791
[VEGETA growls]

349
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,583
He would have wiped out
your entire Saiyan race

350
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,625
with a breath.
Just like so many others...

351
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,291
Whoa! Not good.

352
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,500
[VEGETA thinking]
Why didn't someone tell me

353
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,833
he could read minds?!

354
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,541
In time, Majin Buu
became so powerful

355
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,583
that even Bibidi had
difficulty controlling him.

356
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,583
[GOKU gasps]

357
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,041
Whenever he needed to rest,

358
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,791
Bibidi used a spell to seal
Majin Buu inside a ball,

359
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,458
where he would lay dormant until
the counter-spell was invoked.

360
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,708
[KIBITO] Bibidi used
this spell to transport

361
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,750
Majin Buu from planet to planet.

362
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,166
The ball was brought here.

363
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,791
The Earth was intended to be
Majin Buu's next target.

364
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,833
No... That's terrible!

365
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,166
Obviously this action
was prevented,

366
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,333
but the ball that
contains Majin Buu

367
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,625
remains here on Earth
to this day...

368
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,166
Yes... The Supreme Kai
could have destroyed him...

369
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,833
He chose to leave him hidden.

370
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,166
[GOHAN] I don't get it.

371
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,458
Why didn't he destroy him
when he had the chance?

372
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,375
Because Majin Buu is no threat

373
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,083
as long as he is
confined to that ball.

374
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,791
And until now, we thought
Bibidi was the only one

375
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,125
who could release him.

376
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,958
Until now?

377
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,291
It would seem that we
have discovered another...

378
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,000
Bibidi had a son...

379
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,250
He's here on Earth.

380
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,791
Huh?!

381
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:23,375
Bibidi named his son Babidi.
At any cost we must stop him!

382
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,458
But what is he gonna do?

383
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,875
He intends to continue
his father's work.

384
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,291
He's going to
release Majin Buu!!

385
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,458
[NARRATOR] At last, the
source of Spopovitch and Yamu's

386
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:40,083
inhuman power has been revealed:
the Wizard Babidi!

387
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,166
Who, unless the
Z-Fighters can stop him,

388
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,708
intends to unleash a monster
that will eradicate the Earth!

389
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,500
The Supreme Kai has witnessed
the destructive force

390
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,250
of Majin Buu before...

391
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,083
Can he prevent it from
being released once again?
