00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,333
With Krillin and Gohan
closing in fast,

3
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,375
the outmatched
Guldo had no choice 

4
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,583
but to launch his
attack of last resort...

5
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,958
the paralyzing
"Mind Bind" technique!

6
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,291
Once snared in
Guldo's psychic web,

7
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,125
Gohan and Krillin
were forced to endure

8
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,291
every cruel and
unusual punishment

9
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,958
the evil green mutant
could think to dish out!

[GULDO laughs]

12
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:39,708
[GULDO] Whee!

13
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,875
What's wrong?

14
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,916
You don't like me
pulling on your cheeks?

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,416
So how 'bout I try
pounding instead?!

16
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,375
[NARRATOR] And just as
it began to seem Guldo

17
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,208
had covered every
possible method of torment,

18
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,791
he found yet another way
to stick it to our heroes...

19
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,625
this time
permanently.

20
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,833
It's no use! I still
can't move a muscle!

21
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:01,791
[GULDO laughs]

22
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,416
Ready or not...
Time to die!

23
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,750
[NARRATOR] Though Krillin
and Gohan struggled

24
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,541
with all their might,
there was no escape.

25
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,166
Krillin prepared himself
for the worst, when suddenly,

26
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,458
like a bolt out of the
blue, a savior appeared!

27
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,041
[NARRATOR] It was Vegeta!

28
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,333
The Saiyan Prince burst
in from the sidelines

29
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,125
to head off
Guldo's attack!

30
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,625
And in one bold stroke,
the villain was defeated.

31
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,000
I had my own reasons for
wanting to destroy that freak.

32
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,250
I saw my moment to strike,
and I acted on it.

33
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:41,083
That's all. It had nothing
to do with saving your lives.

34
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,041
[NARRATOR] But Guldo was the
weakest of the Ginyu Force!

35
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,625
Three powerful members still
remain on the battlefield!

36
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,166
Do Krillin, Gohan and
Vegeta have any hope

37
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,666
of surviving the
onslaught to come?!

38
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,625
Hope is a luxury none
of us can afford...

39
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,708
[NARRATOR] These three
unlikely allies continue

40
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,958
the fight for their
lives... today!

I'll take you all on at once.

fast there, Recoome!

That wasn't
the deal!

We're just not gonna stand here
and let you have all the fun!

for us like we agreed.

sly little devil.

[RECOOME] Hey, Vegeta!
What's the deal?

165
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,250
You didn't go and die
on me, did you?

166
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,125
Come on! I didn't get a chance

Now that was low...
Even for a Saiyan!

197
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,208
You are ruthless, Vegeta...

198
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,666
No wonder you were always
one of Frieza's favorites!

199

[RECOOME] It's almost

[RECCOME] Go ahead!

206
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,166
You got any more sneaky
tricks you wanna try?

207

Or should I just kill you now
before this gets too boring?

I knew from
the outset

that this battle would
be difficult to win...

211
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,083
But this
is insane!

212
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,083
I'm fighting at the
limits of my ability,

213
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,875
but he's just
toying with me!

214
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,208
Brushing off my attacks
like they were nothing!

215
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,500
[thinking] If this
keeps up, I don't know

216
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,458
how much longer I can last!

Yeah?

Look... It doesn't
matter anymore...

220

Whatever we do, we're
still gonna die...

We... We can't
beat these guys...

None of us!
Not even Goku...

223

[KRILLIN] There's nothing left
to lose... I'm goin' in!

You with me?

225

[GOHAN] Right!

226
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,791
You ready
for this?

227
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,791
Haaa!

There he goes...

come to the grand finale!

gonna rub you out!

All right. Here
it comes, Gohan...

236

As soon as he
starts his attack,

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,000
you get Vegeta
out of here quick!

238
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,333
I'll see if I can't
blindside that big gorilla!

coming after me...

opportunity to attack Recoome!

really think

254

he's going to let his guard
down like that again?!

heck of a dent...

he called it his "Eraser Gun".

gotta hang on!
