00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,666
[NARRATOR] Previously on
Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,208
Videl continued her desperate
bid to beat Spopovitch,

3
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,708
but the super-charged psycho
was able to counter

4
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,583
her every move with
his own punishing attacks!

5
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,125
Gohan watched in horror as
Videl was batted about the ring

6
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,666
like a rag doll.

7
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,541
And it didn't take long for
Spopovitch's brutal attack

8
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,208
to push the young hero
over the edge...

9
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,250
[GOHAN] This has gone on
way too long!

10
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,833
I'm taking him down!

11
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,458
[NARRATOR]
But before Gohan could act,

12
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:45,125
Spopovitch's fun was cut short
by his mysterious partner, Yamu.

13
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,666
[YAMU] Don't you remember that
we have

14
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,750
far more important things to do?

15
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,500
Finish it immediately!

16
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:02,541
Uh? Oh my... Videl? It's over!
She's out of the ring!

17
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,083
[NARRATOR] Videl fought
bravely until the end,

18
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,125
but Spopovitch's seemingly
endless supply

19
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,166
of supernatural strength
had guaranteed him

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,791
the victory from the start.

21
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,000
And though the fight may be
over, for Videl,

22
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:17,750
the real battle has just begun
today on Dragon Ball Z!

23
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,916
Uhh...?

24
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,166
[GOHAN thinking] I wonder
what's taking Dad so long?

25
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,375
Mr. Satan wants us to make sure
no one disturbs his daughter.

26
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,041
[GOHAN] Krillin,
I'm gonna go see Videl.

27
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,458
Sure...

28
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,291
But what about your dad?
Don't you want to wait for him?

29
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,333
He went to Korin's to get
some Senzu beans, remember?

30
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,208
Yeah! But how can I just
stand around like this

31
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,125
when I know Videl's
in the hospital?!

32
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,916
There's got to be
some way I can help...

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,666
Good luck.

34
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,625
[GOHAN] Hmm?

35
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,666
[KRILLIN chuckles]

36
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,708
You know what?

37
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,166
It sounds to me like
you and Videl

38
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,375
are becoming more
than just friends, huh?

39
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,833
[KRILLIN chuckles]

40
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:31,083
[VIDEL groans weakly]

41
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:36,875
Ah! Ah?! Hey, Doc! Are you
sure she'll be alright?!

42
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,416
She'll be fine!

43
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,083
Rest and relaxation
is all she needs now.

44
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,958
[MR. SATAN ] You better be,
'cause if anything happens

45
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,416
to her, I'm gonna
hold you responsible!

46
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,791
[NANCY] Mr. Satan!
Please, open up!

47
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,958
We'd like to know the
condition of your daughter!

48
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,208
Would you care to make a
statement for your fans, sir?

49
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,625
Please! The public
has a right to know!

50
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,208
[SOUND GUY] Uh...
Are you sure he's in there?

51
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,166
[ALL yell]

52
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,666
[SOUND GUY] ...Dude... ahh...

53
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,666
[MR. SATAN growls]

54
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,125
[SOUND GUY] Uh...

55
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,208
[ALL] Huh?

56
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,083
Like, so what's up with,
you know, Videl?

57
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,125
My daughter is just fine...

58
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,125
She's resting comfortably now...

59
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,375
Unfortunately, she is out of
the competition for good.

60
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,208
But you can tell my fans
to expect a big show

61
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,125
at my next match!

62
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,583
Of course.

63
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,333
But is there anything you'd
like to say to Spopovitch?

64
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,791
[MR. SATAN growls]

65
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,291
You better believe there is!
You give him this message:

66
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,541
You tell him that he'd better
watch his back

67
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:39,750
because Mr. Satan
is coming to get him!

68
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,375
[door slams]

69
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:45,250
[NANCY] Mr. Satan, wait!
Please,  just one more question!

70
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,125
I gotta get in there...

71
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,166
But there's too many reporters
around the room...

72
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,375
[VIDEL yells]

73
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:58,041
[grunting, groaning]

74
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,375
[VIDEL] No! I won't give up!

75
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,166
How could Spopovitch
have done this?

76
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,250
That guy's a cream puff!

77
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,041
At least he was...

78
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,041
[CROWD cheering]

79
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,375
[MR. SATAN] Yeaah! All right!

80
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:16,458
Mr. Satan, the champion
of the world! Yeah!

81
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,041
Oh yeah!

82
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:23,083
[SPOPOVITCH growls]

83
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,750
Spopovitch...

84
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,000
I can't believe they let an
amateur like you

85
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,625
step into the ring...

86
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,875
These are my fans.

87
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,208
Try to give 'em
a good show, okay?

88
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,166
And, hey, look on
the bright side:

89
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,750
At least you're gonna get
beat by a real champ!

90
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,500
Oh yeah?! I'll show you!

91
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:47,541
[grunting]

92
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,916
[SPOPOVITCH yells]

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,375
[SPOPOVITCH gasps]

94
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,500
So... You had enough?

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,458
[SPOPOVITCH] No way!

96
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,250
[MR. SATAN grunts]

97
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,666
[ANNOUNCER]
Spopovitch is out of the ring!

98
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,083
Mr. Satan has won the match!

99
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,750
Videl... How could you lose?

100
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,708
He's a wimp!
You should have won!

101
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,791
I taught you everything
I know about martial arts!

102
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,500
How could you possibly
need more than that?!

103
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,416
Hey, maybe you were
distracted by that skinny kid

104
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,333
who brought you
to the hospital...

105
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,208
Well, he won't
bother you anymore!

106
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,666
[VIDEL] Gohan...

107
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,750
[MR. SATAN snarls]

108
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,583
[SHARPNER] The coast
is clear. C'mon!

109
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,416
Do you think Videl
will be okay?

110
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,166
[SHARPNER thinking] That was
Saiyaman I saw with Videl.

111
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,541
I've got to find out
who he is...

112
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,291
If only my camera hadn't broken,

113
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,583
I'd have a picture
of him right now!

114
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,333
[laughter,
GOHAN gasps]

115
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,791
[shutter clicks]

116
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,958
Perfect!

117
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,583
I couldn't see it with the
shutter moving,

118
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,166
but it's gotta be on film!

119
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,250
And as soon as
I develop these pics,

120
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,125
I can make him
into a laughing stock

121
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,666
and Videl will just
have to like me!

122
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,500
[SHARPNER yelps]

123
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,875
[SHARPNER thinking]
He got lucky,

124
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,541
but sooner or later
he's gonna slip up!

125
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,583
[ERASA] Sharpner! Sharpner!

126
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,708
Do you think she'll
be all right?

127
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,583
Don't worry! I'll
find out who he is!

128
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,958
You can count on it!

129
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,416
[ERASA] Hmm?

130
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,125
[SHARPNER gasps]

131
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,083
Look! It's Saiyaman!

132
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,541
[GOHAN] Huh?!

133
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,833
Know what?

134
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,458
He really does look
kinda familiar to me.

135
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,166
I gotta find out
who that guy is!

136
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,291
[GOHAN] Hey, Krillin,

137
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,541
shouldn't Dad be back?

138
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,416
[KRILLIN] Mm-hmm. I don't know
what's taking him so long.

139
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,375
I don't want
to rush you, Goku,

140
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,750
but aren't you
forgetting something?

141
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,208
Don't they need you
back on Earth?

142
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,666
Yeah, I know.

143
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,291
But it's just that they don't
have good food like this

144
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,416
at Grand Kai's place.
This is delicious!

145
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,958
Yes...

146
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,583
But you came here for Senzu
beans not to stuff your face.

147
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,958
[GOKU] Yeah you're right,
as usual!

148
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,375
Thanks for the chow.

149
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,416
I tell you, Korin, there's
something really strange

150
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,791
about those guys
Spopovitch and Yamu...

151
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,958
We'd better keep
our eyes on them.

152
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:52,041
Spopovitch. The one we're
after may be one of them.

153
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,166
Don't worry...

154
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,625
We'll know soon
enough with this...

155
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,583
We'll wait 'til the next match.

156
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,375
[SPOPOVITCH] Mm-hmm.

157
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,958
You know what to do, Kibito.

158
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,291
My Gohan will be
fighting next!

159
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,250
Yeah, he's fighting

to win the tournament

to make a full recovery.

Videl feel better,

he's not back yet.

it before I start the match!

00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,875
[ERASA] Yeah!
Now we can see your face!

318
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,541
[GOHAN] Yeah, I know... Thanks!

319
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,166
Just like that...

320
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,708
And after all the effort I put
into finding out who he was...

321
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,416
YOU BROKE MY CAMERA!

322
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,041
[ANNOUNCER] Uh... I'm sure
our two fierce competitors

323
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,208
are ready to lock
horns at any moment!

324
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,500
Uh... Come on, guys,
we're all waiting!

325
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,416
[KIBITO grunts]

326
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,458
[GOHAN thinking]
What do I do now?

327
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,166
Bulma's idea to wear a
disguise worked great,

328
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,458
but without it,
I'm totally exposed!

329
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,916
If I show my powers now, I won't
be able to go back to school...

330
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,291
They'll think I'm a freak!

331
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,250
And this guy doesn't exactly
look like a pushover either.

332
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,541
Gohan, I am curious to see
your Super Saiyan powers.

333
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,000
Show them to me!
We may be able to use them!

334
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,208
Huh? Hey?! Hold on!

335
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,708
How do you know
I'm a Super Saiyan?!

336
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:46,541
And what do you mean by
"we may be able to use them"?

337
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,125
[KIBITO]
You'll know more in time.

338
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,958
Show me your
Super Saiyan powers now!

339
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,666
Now it begins...

340
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,000
Uh? Is this
some kind of a joke?

341
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,833
I'm not going to
transform out here

342
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,791
in front of all these people!

343
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,791
[KRILLIN] They're not fighting.
What are they doing?

344
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,541
They're just talking.

345
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,958
[GOKU] Kibito wants to see him
become a Super Saiyan!

346
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,416
[KRILLIN] Hm?

347
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,000
[YAMU] Spopovitch,
what does it say?

348
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,541
No... It's not them...
Low energy.

349
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,791
[PICCOLO] Gohan!

350
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,708
'Kay, here goes.

351
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,208
What is it, Piccolo?
What's happening out there?

352
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,333
I'm not sure, Goku...
We'll see...

353
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,291
[SUPREME KAI] It's time...

354
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,208
You do not need
to worry about Gohan.

355
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,125
He will be fine.

356
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,625
But no matter what happens,
I want you to promise me

357
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,041
you'll stay out of the ring.
Do you understand?

358
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,333
What? No way!

359
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,125
What do you want with Gohan?

360
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,250
[PICCOLO]
He wants to see his power...

361
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,291
Well? Let's see it.

362
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,208
[GOHAN] Ah, this is gonna
get me kicked out of school!

363
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,125
All right, then...
You asked for it!

364
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,458
I don't know you and you're
telling me what to do?

365
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,333
Who do you think you are?

366
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,416
Vegeta, show him
some respect...

367
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,833
That is no way to be
talking to the Supreme Kai!

368
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,125
[gasping]

369
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,916
I heard stories
from King Kai,

370
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
but I thought they
were just stories!

371
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,500
Shin! You're the Supreme Kai?!

372
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,500
--[MAN A] Hey, you losers!
--[CROWD jeering, yelling]

373
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,375
[MAN B] Come on,
start fighting, you sissies!

374
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,791
[MAN C] What is this?! Is this a
staring contest or something?!

375
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,250
[MAN D] I want my money back!

376
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,125
Oh no... Uh...

377
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,875
Everyone, please remain calm!

378
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,333
[ANNOUNCER grunts]

379
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,916
[CHICHI growls]

380
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,125
Keep your shirts on!
You want a show?!

381
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:08,166
You're gonna get a show!
My son Gohan always delivers!

382
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,708
[NARRATOR]
All eyes are on Gohan...

383
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,583
A suspicious group of spectators

384
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,166
watch his every move
from the sidelines.

385
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,041
Shin, the Supreme Kai,

386
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:25,375
wants no one to interfere
with Gohan's transformation.

387
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,458
Meanwhile, Spopovitch and Yamu
closely monitor

388
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,791
the fighters' power levels.
But for what purpose?

389
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,416
[NARRATOR] What dark designs
lurk beneath the surface

390
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,666
of the World Martial
Arts Tournament?

391
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,125
Shin, Kibito, Spopovitch, Yamu--

392
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,541
Which of these mysterious
fighters are friends?

393
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,291
And which are foes?

394
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,875
As Gohan begins his
powerful transformation,

395
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,166
the answers to these and other
important questions

396
00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:03,250
are sure to come to light!

397
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:13,250
are sure to come to light!

398
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:23,250
are sure to come to light!

399
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:33,250
are sure to come to light!

400
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:43,291
are sure to come to light!

401
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:53,291
are sure to come to light!

402
00:23:53,375 --> 00:24:03,291
are sure to come to light!

403
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:13,291
are sure to come to light!

404
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:23,333
are sure to come to light!

405
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:33,333
are sure to come to light!

406
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:42,541
are sure to come to light!
