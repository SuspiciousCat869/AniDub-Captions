[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,458
thousands flocked to
the small island where the

3
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,958
World Martial Arts Tournament
was scheduled to begin.

4
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,000
And the guest of honor
appeared as promised.

5
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,833
Goku is back! Permitted
to the living world

6
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,000
so he can fight
in the tournament.

7
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,375
[NARRATOR] It was a time for
hugs and laughter,

8
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:38,000
as friends were reunited
after years of silence.

9
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,791
[GOKU] And I've
missed you, ChiChi.

10
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,166
[NARRATOR] And a father met his
son for the very first time.

Whoa, kiddo.

15

[NARRATOR] But like
many good things,

16
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,208
there were
strings attached.

17
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,000
[BABA] Listen up, Goku.

18
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,833
Remember that you only
have twenty four hours.

19
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,833
That's all I can do.

20
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,791
[GOKU] Mm-hmm.

21
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,833
Yeah, I know.

22

[BABA] I'll see you then...

23
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,583
[NARRATOR] Goku has just
one day to spend on Earth.

24
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,916
So as the tournament gets under
way, how will he make it count?

we were disqualified

touched the ceiling.

all that tough.

I bet you my father could
beat him no sweat.

it well-waxed.

is automatically qualified.

00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,083
Piccolo?

322
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,666
A ring is a place for fighters,
not publicity seekers,

323
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,083
and I don't want you holding
back any of your strength

324
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,333
because you're afraid
of being discovered.

325
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,541
I want a good fight...

326
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,708
I see! Thank you!

327
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,791
That pose would've
made a great poster...

328
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,583
Oh well. I'll show
'em something!

329
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,083
[MR. SATAN yells]

330
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:52,083
[MR. SATAN yells]

331
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,750
Satan Punch! Raagh!

332
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,958
Incredible!

333
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,416
Mr. Satan has just scored one
hundred and thirty-seven points!

334
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,166
[CROWD gasps]

335
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:16,750
[MR. SATAN pants]

336
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,541
[VIDEL laughs]

337
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,125
Good luck to all you fighters!

338
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,458
I hope one of you at
least breaks a hundred

339
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,041
so we can have
a decent match!

340
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,625
All entries please
form a line in front

341
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,208
of the punching machine after
you've been assigned a number.

342
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,250
And anyone who is entering
the Junior Tournament

343
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,958
please gather over here by me.

344
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:48,833
Well, it looks like Mr. Satan's
gonna win again this year.

345
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay, kids! Good luck!

346
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,458
Sure...

347
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,708
Where's Tien? Shouldn't
he be showing up?

348
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,250
I don't know, Goku.

349
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:03,416
I think he and Chiaotzu both
said they weren't coming back.

350
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,000
Next up, number six!

351
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,291
[FIGHTER D grunts]

352
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,291
Okay... Ninety-seven points!

353
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,291
[FIGHTER E grunts]

354
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,291
[PRELIM REF] Number sixteen...
Seventy-seven points!

355
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,500
[GIRL] Good luck, Videl.
We're rooting for you!

356
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,958
[VIDEL grunts]

357
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,291
[FIGHTER F growls]

358
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,625
[PRELIM REF] Ooh! Very nice!
One hundred and twelve points!

359
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,083
How absurd!

360
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,041
Next, please! Number eighteen!

361
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,333
Lookie there! That girl's
pretty cute for a fighter!

362
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,583
Yeah! But I bet
she scores a thirteen!

363
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,666
[KRILLIN] Now, 18,
remember to take it easy!

364
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,125
[ANDROID 18] I know.

365
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,625
Seven hundred
and seventy-four?!

366
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,250
[gasping]

367
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,416
Wha...?

368
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,791
It seems to be out of order...

369
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,291
Sorry about that...

370
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,541
That's what you call
taking it easy?!

371
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,875
It's not my fault these
guys are weaklings...

372
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay, ma'am, would
you like to try again?

373
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,791
[gasping]

374
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,750
Two hundred and... three?

375
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:46,291
One hundred... and...
ninety-two points...

376
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,750
[gasping]

377
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,875
[gasping]

378
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,000
[PRELIM REF] One hundred...
and eighty-six points?

379
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,541
[gasping]

380
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,125
[PRELIM REF] Two hundred
and ten points?!

381
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,375
The pressure mechanism
seems to be broken...

382
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,166
See if you could fetch
the other machine?

383
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,625
[MONK E] Of course, sir...

384
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,166
[VEGETA] Now stand aside!

387
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,291
Oh, wow...

388
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:26,958
[GOKU sighs]

389
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,166
So much for restraining...

390
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,708
[VIDEL whimpers]

391
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,541
[NARRATOR] It's safe to say
Vegeta and the other Z Fighters

392
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,625
have qualified for
the tournament,

393
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,458
in addition to destroying
a punching machine,

394
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,166
a dozen cameras,

395
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,625
and the speaking ability of a
couple hundred fighters.

396
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,708
Stay tuned for more
mayhem on Dragon Ball Z.
