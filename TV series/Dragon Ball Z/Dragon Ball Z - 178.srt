[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,083
as the first competitor
in the Cell Game,

4
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,916
Goku came out swinging,

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,666
but everything he threw at
the slippery serpent Cell,

6
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,041
including the Kamehameha Wave
attack, had no effect. 

7
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,333
And, a behind the
back sneak attack

8
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,250
only made Cell more psychotic.

9
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:32,125
So much so that he nearly
polished the Super Saiyan off

10
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,625
with a series of
power-packed punches.

13
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,583
and determined to beat
the beast in battle,

14
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,000
Goku carefully planned
his next attack.

15
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,291
But Cell's uncanny ability

16
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,416
to anticipate every one
of his moves

17
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,250
stifled any chance
of a strategy.

18
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:00,083
[ANNOUNCER] That was
just their warm up?

Well, it looks like they're
gonna fight for real.

20
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,500
[NARRATOR] While a world wide
audience watched in horror,

21
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,791
the two warriors
stood their ground,

22
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,750
stone faced and silent.

23
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:15,083
Making it impossible to know
what was really on their minds.

24
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,958
[NARRATOR] Now its time for Goku
to pull out all the stops.

25
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,458
He's got to use his
Super Saiyan powers

26
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,916
to topple that titan
of terror Cell.

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,500
They both posses
incredible power,

28
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,125
but it's going to take
brains, as well as brawn,

29
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,875
to win this competition.

30
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,041
Cell's passion for
inflicting pain

31
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,291
makes him a fiercesome
force to fight against.

32
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,041
And, to him, defeating Goku
would be the ultimate prize.

33
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,750
When these two
clash again

34
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,125
only one of them
will be left standing.

35
