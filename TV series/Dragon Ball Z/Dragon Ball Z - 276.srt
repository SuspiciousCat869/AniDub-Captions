00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,333
deep in Majin Buu's head,

3
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,166
Goku and Vegeta found the pods

4
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,375
that housed the
captured Z Fighters.

5
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,250
And they made another
startling discovery as well.

6
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,916
[VEGETA] You don't like
that idea, do you?

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,041
Huh? Majin Buu!
In his original form!

8
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,166
[VEGETA] Yes, I see that.
But what does it mean?

9
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,375
[GOKU] Who knows?
How could he absorb himself?

10
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,750
Doesn't make sense.

11
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:45,250
Wow. This is deep.
Two Buus. Strange.

12
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,291
Maybe there were two Buus at
one time and this one lost.

13
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,333
[NARRATOR]
Unlikely? Yes. But true!

14
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,125
There had been more
than one Majin Buu.

15
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,125
And as Goku and Vegeta
unraveled the mystery,

16
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,750
the merciless pink monster

17
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,208
decided to make a
special guest appearance

18
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,750
inside his own mind.

19
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:11,583
[SUPER BUU] Who are you calling
"ugly", you ridiculous fool?

20
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,250
[NARRATOR] It was an
all-or-nothing battle,

21
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,458
but, coupled together,

22
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,958
it looked like Saiyan
might had prevailed

23
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,291
and the two warriors astutely
disposed of the last remains

24
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,166
of the Buu within Buu.

25
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,083
[NARRATOR] It was a job
well done to be sure,

26
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,500
but was Majin Buu
really gone for good?

27
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,416
[SUPER BUU]
Knock, knock.

28
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,333
[VEGETA]
Who's there?

29
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,375
[SUPER BUU]
Buu.

30
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,875
Buu who?

31
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:47,166
[SUPER BUU] Aw. Don't cry.
Everyone has to die sometime.

32
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,291
[SUPER BUU laughs]

33
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,250
[NARRATOR]
It was a rude awakening,

34
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,208
but the Super Saiyan duo
was realizing the hard way

35
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,583
that the worst place
to fight Majin Buu

36
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,333
is inside of his head--

37
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,458
where his slightest
whim can become reality.

38
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,916
[GOKU gasps]

39
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,500
[NARRATOR] Is the Saiyan
prince bound to become

40
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,583
just another hero in a pod
like the other tenants

41
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,833
in Buu's hall of
living collectibles?

42
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,875
[GOKU]
No!

43
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,125
[NARRATOR]
Stay tuned.

44
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,666
Ahh...

45
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,916
He'll bring much power...

46
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,125
Vegeta! Get up!

47
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,166
[GOKU]
Oh, no you don't!

48

Scared you, didn't I?!

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,416
No!

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,916
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,416
[SUPER BUU]

59
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,666
[SUPER BUU]
Where did he go?

[GOKU gasps]

61
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,250
That's it. Keep it up.

[SUPER BUU laughs]

63
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,750
You will eventually
wear yourself out.

64
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:58,458
But don't worry. You'll get
plenty of rest in your pod.

65
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:03,500
No way. Not me. You'll never
get me into one of those things.

66
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,625
[chuckles]

67
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,791
Oh, no? Well,
half of me believes you,

68
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,000
but the other half?

69
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,875
Well, that's another story.

I pray that you're holding up

76
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,541
better than my ancestor.

[SUPER BUU] Too bad.
It's almost over, isn't it?

84
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:18,125
I must say...
that I am impressed, though.

You've lasted pretty long.

How a weakling like you still
has energy left is beyond me.

88

Yeah, well. I don't expect you
to be able to comprehend me.

This won't hurt that bad.

105

[VEGETA] I'd get away
from him if I were you.

Huh?!

107
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,208
You've got bigger
things to worry about.

108

I didn't think so.

I wonder what you'd turn into

114

without this fat tub
of lard in your system?

115

Whatever it is,
I'm sure it won't be pretty.

[SUPER BUU]
No! Put that down!

Come now, you're not
really in a position

118
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,833
to be giving me orders,
now are you?

[SUPER BUU]
You don't understand!

120

Let go of that! Now!!

Oh, I think I
understand just perfectly.

[VEGETA]
I don't understand.

First, you're laughing at me
with that ridiculous laugh,

at me at the top of your lungs.

tear those attachments

You won't be you anymore?

to do it before.

00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,666
[VEGETA]
This whole place is erupting!

164
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,541
Kakarot, you were right.

165
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,541
It's exactly like
a volcano in here.

166
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,291
And at this rate we'll
all be cooked alive!

167
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:26,125
[screams]

168
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,250

00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,375
[yelps]

170
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,583
Kakarot!

171
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:53,041
[GOKU whimpers]

172
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,083
[VEGETA]
What are you doing?!

173
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:59,083
What do you think?! I'm trying
to cool my self off! Jeez!

174
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,541
[VEGETA]
What's going on down there?

175
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,791
[GOKU]
Nothing good. That's for sure.

176
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,416
[GOKU screams,
VEGETA growls]

177
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,208
[VEGETA] What the...?!
Whoa, d'you feel that heat?!

178
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,916
No kidding! Scorching...

179
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,375
That would melt the
skin right off your bones!

180
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,250
That steam's
hotter than lava. Wow!

181
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,833
Wait. This steam is rising,

182
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,083
which means it's
trying to find a way out.

183
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,625
This might lead us out of here!

184
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,000
Check it out. More holes.

185
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,458
[VEGETA]
Is that daylight?

186
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,375
[GOKU]
That would be a miracle.

187
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,166
But then again,
I never rule those out.

188
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,625
[VEGETA]
Let's go!

189
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,500
Hey, it is. All right!

190
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's closing!

191
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,458
Come on!

192
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,541
[VEGETA snarls]

193
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,083
[VEGETA]
You've got to be kidding me!

194
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,666
[GOKU]
Man! We almost had it!

195
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:23,000
[screams]

196
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,041
Open... Sesame!

197
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,083
[VEGETA growls]

198
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,541
[VEGETA]
Genius...

199
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,333
It's not working. We've got
to think of something else.

200
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,916
There is no "something else."

201
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,250
Maybe if it happened once,
it'll happen again.

202
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,625
Hey, you're right. Remember?

203
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,666
Buu's thoughts. We saw it
when we read his mind.

204
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,750
Every time he got mad
he kept blowing his stack.

205
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,125
That was it! The steam we saw!

206
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,625
So what's next?

207
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,458
Just hold on to these
and I'll do the rest.

208
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,583
[GOKU]
All right. Here we go.

209
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,625
Show time!

210
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,083
[GOKU grunts]

211
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,750
Ready?!

212
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,166
[VEGETA]
It's not open yet.

213
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,250
[VEGETA]
Now! It's open!

214
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,708
[GOKU]
Haaaa!

215
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,625
[growls]

216
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,291
[GOKU]
Let's go!

217
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,666
[GOKU]
Woo-hoo!

218
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,500
[SUPER BUU yells,

219

[laughs]

220
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,958
[GOKU]
Look, Vegeta. People popcorn.

221
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,250
[VEGETA]
What is he on?

222
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,833
[OLD KAI giggles excitedly]

223
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:21,416
Ah, this is magnificent! They
actually escaped from Majin Buu!

224
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,875
--Yeah!
--[OLD KAI cackles]

225
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,000
Spectacular!
Fresh air and sunshine. Wow!

226
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,458
[VEGETA] That was a
disgusting experience.

227
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,875
[GOKU]
Aw. It wasn't that bad.

228
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,750
[VEGETA]
Speak for yourself.

229
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,708
[gasps]

230
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,041
They're back! And they
have everyone with them!

231
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,500
What a relief!

232
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,875
[VEGETA] Let's find a
safe place to drop these guys.

233
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,833
We still have some
unfinished business.

234
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,291
[GOKU]
Right.

235
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,375
Huh?!

236
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,958
[gasps]

237
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,541

Oh, boy. Here we go again.

[VEGETA thinking]
How could he be increasing

242
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,208
instead of decreasing?!

243
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:33,708
[SUPER BUU yells]

244
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,000
If this keeps up,

245
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,833
he's going to be stronger
than he was before.

246
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,458
Yes. I know.

247

Uh-oh. Look.
This is serious.

Told ya.

251
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,208
He's, uh, twice as
big as he was before.

Hey, look.

Watch. He's about to change.

[grunts]

261
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,000
Into a better dancer, I hope.

262
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,666
[KIBITO KAI]
Oh, no. He's changing back...

263
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,666
[whimpers]

264
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,916
Back... to normal.

265
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,250
Huh? Whatd'ya mean? "Normal"?

266

268
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,333
He's totally puny!

269
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,250
Dear me...

270
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,041
[KIBITO KAI]
I'm afraid we're doomed...

271
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,500
[OLD KAI] You said that he
was changing back to normal.

272
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,125
I don't get it!

273
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,166
I haven't seen this form yet.

274
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,666
How could it be normal?

275
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,708
Do you know something that
you haven't told me yet?

276
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,208
[KIBITO KAI]
Y-Yes, sir.

277
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,708
He shrunk. And you
were you so worried.

278
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,416
Hah! You weren't worried, huh?

279
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,333
You had white knuckles
and you know it.

280
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:36,333
[KIBITO KAI whimpers]

281

[NARRATOR] A dark cloud
has appeared in the sky.

282
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,666
But if Goku and
Vegeta aren't worried,

283
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,166
then why is Kibito Kai?

284
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,375
What does he know about
this little Buu that they don't?

285
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:52,625
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball Z.
