00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,333
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,666
Vegeta decided to
stick to the fighting

3
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,958
and let Goku do the talking.

4
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,541
[GOKU]
We need your energy now!

5
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,166
Raise your hands up!
I beg of you!

6
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,500
[NARRATOR] Many old friends
offered up their energy

7
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,416
when they heard Goku's plea!

8
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,000
But the mass of
humanity didn't join in

9
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,708
until their beloved
champion, Mr. Satan,

10
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,958
asked them to lend a hand!

11
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,791
[CROWD]
Satan! Satan!

12
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,791
Satan! Satan!

13
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,041
[NARRATOR] At last the wall of
skepticism was knocked down

14
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,625
and mankind was freely offering
their collective energy

15
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,333
to help beat the Buu!

16
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,208
[NARRATOR]
Out it poured from the Earth,

17
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,416
arriving like a
flood in Goku's hands.

18
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,166
The Spirit Bomb swelled
to massive proportions!

19
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,416
[GOKU]
Here we go!

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
[NARRATOR] It was almost
too good to be believed!

21
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,666
Goku finally had what he
needed to defeat Majin Buu.

22
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,000
Just when time
was about to run out,

23
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,208
the mighty Saiyan was
ready to aim and fire!

24

You've got to get out of there!

I can't, Vegeta!

This is bad! Very, very bad!

00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:44,041
He won't...
He won't fire the bomb!

43

But... he must!
