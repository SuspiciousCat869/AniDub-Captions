1
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,208
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,666
Vegeta unleashed
his terror

3
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,833
upon an unsuspecting
Namekian village,

4
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,791
and his conquest has brought
him one step closer

5
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,125
to achieving his
ultimate goal.

6
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,041
By taking one of
the Dragon Balls

7
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,666
and hiding it in
the watery depths,

8
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,000
Vegeta ensured that
Frieza and his men

9
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,333
would not be able to
gather all seven.

10
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:36,416
Now, there is only one
Dragon Ball left to find,

11
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,833
and then Vegeta can
focus on stealing

12
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,916
the five already in
Frieza's possession.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,541
Meanwhile, as events
unfolded on Namek,

14
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,791
Goku raced through space
to meet these deadly foes.

15
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,625
But his intensive
training session

16
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,541
was unexpectedly
interrupted!

17
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,750
[KING KAI]
Goku, can you hear me?

18
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:58,125
[NARRATOR] It was King Kai!
With exciting news...

19
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,541
You gotta be kidding me!
Everyone made it?

20
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,625
They all reached you together?
That's great, King Kai!

21
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,791
[KING KAI chuckles]

22
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,041
You guessed it!

23
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,291
They're here, and they
want me to train them

24
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,000
even harder than
I trained you!

25
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,250
[NARRATOR] The adventure
continues... Today!

26
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,250
[YAMCHA] King Kai,
can I say hello to him?

27
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:30,666
Of course. Just rest your hand
on my shoulder and speak.

28
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,458
Hey, Goku,
guess who?

29
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:37,250
Hey! Yamcha! I'm glad
to hear you made it okay!

30
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:41,041
Yeah. The trip down Snake
Way wasn't all that bad.

31
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,333
It's this increased
gravity here

32
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,333
that's gonna be hard
to get used to.

33
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,458
[GOKU] Heh! Believe me,
I know what you mean.

34
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,333
I've been trying to
do some training

35
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,166
under heavy
gravity myself.

36
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,375
I'm on my
way to meet

37
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,333
Bulma, Krillin, and
Gohan on Planet Namek.

38
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,208
And unless I get a lot stronger
in the next five days,

39
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,166
we're gonna be in
serious trouble.

40
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,208
Uh? Why's that?
What's wrong, Goku?

41
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,791
Well, while I was
in the hospital,

42
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,083
Krillin, Bulma, and
Gohan decided to go

43
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,458
to Planet Namek
without me

44
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,000
so they could start
looking for the Dragon Balls.

45
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,541
But, when they
got there,

46
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,250
they found out that
Vegeta was there, too,

47
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,125
trying to do
the same thing!

48
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,416
--[YAMCHA] Oh, no!
--[KING KAI screams]

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,958
What happened? Did
Vegeta try to attack them?!

50
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,333
[TIEN] Huh?

51
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,041
No... Not yet. They've
managed to avoid him so far.

52
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't think he
knows they're there.

53
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,000
But, it gets worse.

54
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,125
It looks like there's another
force on the planet.

55
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,541
I don't know
who they are,

56
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,125
but they've been searching
for the Dragon Balls, too.

57
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,500
I guess they're
not Saiyans,

58
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,125
even though Bulma says they
wear the same uniforms.

59
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,458
But it sounds like
they're some bad guys.

60
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,250
And, if that
wasn't bad enough,

61
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,750
their leader is supposed to be
even more powerful than Vegeta!

62
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,500
[BOTH] No way!

63
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,125
What's up?
What's going on there?

64
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,875
There's... There's a...
A fighter...

65
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:58,000
Even stronger than
Vegeta on Namek...

66
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,333
You... didn't happen to
catch his name, did you?

67
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,333
Is it Frieza?

68
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,291
[GOKU] Sorry, I don't know.
Bulma didn't say.

69
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:10,291
[KING KAI whimpering]

70
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:14,750
Well, Goku, I'd better take
a look, just to be sure.

71
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,541
That's great.
Thanks, King Kai.

72
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,958
[KING KAI] Let's see...

73
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,750
I think I get the best
signals from Namek over here.

74
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,750
Yamcha, what does
all this mean?

75
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,458
[KING KAI grunts]

76
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,125
I can sense an enormous
power level already!

77
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,500
Now if I can just see
where it's coming from...

78
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,166
Noooo!

79
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,000
It's Friezaaaa!

80
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,333
[ALL gasp]

81
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,500
[GOKU] Hey! What's wrong?
Did you see who it is?

82
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,041
Goku, listen to me!

83
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,000
This is the strongest
and fiercest opponent

84
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,291
you could ever face!

85
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,750
There's no way
you're ready for him!

86
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,083
But... What do you
mean, King Kai?

87
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,208
[KING KAI] I'm not just saying
this for your sake, Goku,

88
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,125
but for all
people everywhere!

89
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,000
You can't
anger Frieza!

90
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,166
If you do, his wrath
will follow us

91
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,958
to the ends of
the universe!

92
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,750
I'm ordering you not to
go anywhere near him!

93
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,208
Now, you promise me!

94
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,416
Promise you won't attempt
to face Frieza at any cost!

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,208
You can't win.
All you'd do is provoke him!

96
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:44,125
It would be just like hitting
a beehive with a stick!

97
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,000
The best thing you can do is
stay away from him altogether.

98
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,875
But, what about
the Dragon Balls?

99
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,833
I at least
have to try.

100
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,791
No! You have to
promise me! Right now!

101
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,625
Come on...

102
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,791
Absolutely nooooot!

103
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,791
Hey. Don't
listen to him.

104
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,250
You just get those Dragon Balls
and wish us back to life.

105
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,583
Piccolo!

106
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,250
[PICCOLO] In the meantime,
we'll do some training

107
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,291
with King Kai
to get ready.

108
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,208
Yeah!

109
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,375
Between you, me,
Gohan, and Krillin,

110
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,458
we should be able
to handle this guy.

111
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,166
[KING KAI grunts]

112
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,291
No! You don't have any idea
what you're talking about!

113
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,291
[PICCOLO] There's no time
to waste. Start training us.

114
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:32,083
[KING KAI] No way! Not if
you're going to fight Frieza!

115
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,125
Promise you won't! That's
the only way I'll teach you!

116
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,375
All right.

117
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:43,750
I hope you mean that.
I'm trusting you.

118
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,208
And all of
you, too!

119
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,750
[ALL] Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,166
[thinking] Heh, heh, heh.
He's crazy if he thinks

121
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,916
I'm gonna stick
to that promise.

122
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,291
[thinking] I've got to train
hard, just like Goku.

123
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,541
His strength increased
so much it was amazing.

124
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,291
For us to face
this Frieza,

125
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,541
we'll all have to
be at our best.

126
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,625
Hmph.

127
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,500
Good. Now, let's
get started.

128
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,125
[thinking] I've been waiting
for this training forever.

129
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,208
[thinking]
Show me what you've got.

130
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,750
[KING KAI] Are you sure
you're ready for this?

131
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,083
[YAMCHA] Hmm.

132
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,208
Fine, in that case...

133
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,166
Then your first challenge
is to make me laugh!

134
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,500
You don't make me laugh,
I don't train you! Got it?

135
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,958
[ALL gasp]

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,791
Okay, even if don't
fight this Frieza,

137
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,125
he didn't say I
couldn't keep training!

138
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,708
Alright! Let's see what I can
do under thirty-times gravity!

139
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,833
Hey, so if we keep on
flying at this speed,

140
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,208
how long will it 
take us to get there?

141
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,541
Well... I'd guess
about five more hours.

142
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,000
[KRILLIN sighs]

143
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,250
Bah! I should've
been able to sense

144
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,916
some more of these
Nameks by now!

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,166
Where are they?

146
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,208
There must be a village
around here somewhere!

147
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,666
[thinking] Wait a second.
I do sense something.

148
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,458
It's faint, but there's
two of them moving.

149
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,750
And they're not
with Frieza.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,458
Interesting. Let's see
where they're headed.

151
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,583
[NARRATOR] And so, the
great joke contest began.

152
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,750
[KING KAI laughing]

153
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,750
[NARRATOR] Yamcha and
Chiaotzu proved themselves

154
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,333
to be quite
the comedians.

155
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,791
However, Tien and

00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,791
And I intend to see
him grovel at my feet,

319
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,625
as soon as I've
made my wish!

320
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,125
You mean with the
Dragon Balls.

321
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,500
The winds of change
are blowing, Zarbon.

322
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,041
Soon, the power of
immortality will be mine!

323
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,708
And with it, I will
rule this galaxy forever!

324
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,666
[ZARBON] You're dreaming! Frieza
already has five Dragon Balls.

325
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,666
It won't take us long
to find the rest.

326
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,666
[VEGETA] Please. You're
blind without your scouters.

327
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,041
That's a liability
I don't share.

328
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,041
My powers have
improved in more ways

329
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,791
than you could
ever imagine.

330
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,291
[ZARBON chuckles]

331
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,750
So you've learned some
new tricks, then?

332
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,291
It doesn't
change a thing.

333
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,791
What makes you think
your abilities

334
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,583
even hold a candle
to Frieza's?

335
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,333
I'd say you already know
the answer to that question!

336
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,333
Dodoria did too!

337
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,000
And before he died,
he told me everything!

338
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,833
Frieza fears
the Saiyans!

339
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,916
Which means,
he's afraid of me!

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,208
Don't flatter yourself.

341
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,958
What Frieza feared was
the entire Saiyan race

342
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,500
rising up
against him.

343
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,375
All alone, you're
no threat to anyone.

344
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:14,750
Well.
We'll see.

345
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,000
[ZARBON grunting]

346
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,375
[VEGETA chuckling,
ZARBON grunting]

347
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,375
[VEGETA yells]

348
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,833
[ZARBON shouts]

349
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,708
[ZARBON grunts]

350
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,625
[ZARBON]
Haaaah!

351
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,541
[VEGETA chuckles]

352
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,625
Rraaahh!

353
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,416
[ZARBON gasps]

354
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,875
You surprise
me, Vegeta.

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,166
Whoa... Those power
levels are incredible!

356
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,083
I guess that's where Vegeta
ran off to in such a hurry.

357
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,666
Yeah, that's
him all right.

358
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,875
He must be fighting one of
Frieza's goons or something.

359
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,083
Well, good.
I say let 'em fight.

360
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,416
Maybe we'll get lucky and
they'll take each other out.

361
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,208
'Cause if either
one finds us...

362
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,750
[DENDE whimpering]

363
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,500
[KRILLIN] Hey!

364
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,458
Hang on tight, kid!

365
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,583
We gotta move!
If we turn up the speed,

366
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,291
we might be able to get
to the Eldest Namek

367
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,708
while they're
still fighting!

368
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's hope
they're too busy

369
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,833
beating each other
up to notice!

370
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,833
[ZARBON grunting]

[ZARBON gasps]

374
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,583
[ZARBON gasps]

375
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,916
[VEGETA]
Hyah!

376
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,583
[ZARBON grunting]

377
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,625
[VEGETA laughing]

378
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,291
[VEGETA] Well, I think I
proved my point, Zarbon!

379
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:12,041
[ZARBON whimpering]

380
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,958
[VEGETA chuckles]

381
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:20,708
[whimpering becomes chuckling]

382
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:21,958
Hmm...?

383
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:28,083
[ZARBON laughing]

384
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,041
[ZARBON]
Well, I have to admit...

385
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,791
You do impress me, Vegeta.

386
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,875
Your fighting skills
have come a long way

387
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,166
since the last time we met,
but not quite far enough!

388
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,958
[ZARBON chuckling]

389
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,500
[NARRATOR] Even with
all of his might,

390
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,333
it seems
Vegeta's attacks

391
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,541
have had little effect
on the terrifying Zarbon.

392
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,208
Has the Saiyan prince
finally met his match?

393
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:55,416
Find out in the next explosive
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
