00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,416
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,166
the merciless Frieza
dealt the final blow

3
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,833
to his long-time ally,

4
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,041
Vegeta, the Saiyan Prince.

5
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,541
[NARRATOR] Miraculously, the
once cold-hearted warrior

6
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,625
began to overflow with emotion

7
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,833
as he related to Goku the cruel
circumstances under which

8
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,833
he became Frieza's ward.

9
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:42,166
Don't let him do this...
to anyone else...

10
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,541
[NARRATOR] In a passionate plea,

11
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,625
he begged his fellow
Saiyan to exterminate

12
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,750
the darkness of Frieza
once and for all.

13
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,791
[GOKU] Goodbye, Vegeta...

14
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,958
You're not as cold-hearted as
you believed yourself to be.

15
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,541
A heart of stone can't shed
tears like you did.

16
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,250
You must've been holding
them back your whole life.

17
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,791
[NARRATOR] In an instant,

18
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,166
Goku became the last surviving
Saiyan in the universe.

19
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,541
[NARRATOR] And with
a fiery will, he promised

20
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,125
to carry out Vegeta's last wish
to the best of his ability.

21
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,708
[NARRATOR] Full of
a new compassion

22
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,250
and understanding for Vegeta,
the great warrior from Earth

23
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,416
provided a proper burial
for his former rival.

24
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,125
You never had a chance
to be anything else...

25
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,583
It wasn't all your fault.

26
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,541
[NARRATOR] Though saddened
by Vegeta's passing,

27
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:50,083
Goku was more determined than
ever to take down Frieza.

28
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,666
The battle begins today!

29
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,583
[GOKU] I'll do my best to
carry out your wish!

30
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,458
You seem to delight in
seeing other people suffer.

31
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,333
And you treat life like
a disposable commodity.

32
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,500
[GOKU] You destroy homes...

33
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,416
...you take the lives of
innocent, peace-loving people...

34
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,750
[GOKU] You even take
the lives of children.

35
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,958
[GOHAN growls]

36
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:58,750
[GOKU] And all of this, for your
own amusement or personal gain.

37
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,583
[GOKU] Well... now
it's your turn!

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,208
Oh... Is it really? And I
suppose the great Super Saiyan

39
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,666
is going to arrive
and magically defeat

40
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,583
what has never been defeated?

41
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,666
It's legend... fantasy.

42
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,375
Who cares? Look, I don't care
about the stupid legend! See?

43
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,875
It's me who's
going to stop you!

44
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,333
[KING KAI whines]

45
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,166
Hey, what's up?
Well, come on, shoot.

46
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,666
Mmm... Vegeta... he's gone.

47
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,875
What?! You're kidding!

48
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,083
Huh?!

49
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,416
Man! This Frieza guy
really is unstoppable!

50
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,041
Yes... it's a real
pity... Yes, indeed.

51
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,208
But something good happened

52
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,958
right before Vegeta
left that world...

53
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,791
He told Goku that he had
been under Frieza's control

54
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,625
since he was a small boy.

55
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,250
He was in tears.

56
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,541
His heart was opened up.

57
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,250
Wow! Vegeta was crying?
No kidding? That's wack.

58
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,458
Yes, there is nothing more
unpredictable than life.

59
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,000
Change can strike
like lightning.

60
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,333
So what now?! I guess Goku's
on his own! Man, that bites.

61
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,333
Can he win?

62
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,916
I don't know, Tien.

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,208
He has a chance, but
it's a real slim chance.

64
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,125
He'll do it!

65
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,208
[KING KAI] Maybe, Chiaotzu...

66
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,291
He will!

67
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:35,291
[KING KAI] I hope so, guys...
with all my heart.

68
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,125
C'mon, Goku! You can do it!

69
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:25,083
[thinking] Just look at him!
He never ceases to amaze me!

70
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,958
I wouldn't mind fighting him
again someday, just for grins.

71
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,041
Huh?

72

Gohan, Krillin, let's go!
Now! You're distracting him!

Hey, let's get out
of here, Gohan!

You can only get in the way!

I'm leaving you, Dad!
Don't you dare lose!

Shoot! Where did
this guy come from?

101
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,791
How could a Saiyan
have this kind of power?

102
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:49,041
So many of them have tried,
and they all died.

103
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,666
Even the greatest of them

104
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,708
were just child's play. But this
one's different. He's fantastic!

settle down, Goku!

when he was here?

Yes, he was highly unusual.

Still innocent enough to
believe that there was nothing

he couldn't do.

00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,333
[GOKU] Whoa! Big one!

164
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,250
Huh...?

165
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,750
[GOKU] Uh-oh!

166
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,791
[GOKU] Man! This whole
planet is coming apart!

167
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,458
Huh?!

168
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,291
[FRIEZA cackles]

169
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,083
[GOHAN] Man, what the heck
is going on over there?!

170
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,625
[KRILLIN] I don't know,
but I bet it's not good!

171
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,708
It feels like the whole
planet's gonna blow!

172
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,083
Dad...

173
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:51,333
No! You've got to have faith
in your dad, Gohan! He's fine!

174
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,833
But if you show up,
he'll be vulnerable!

175
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,625
Come on, Dad...

176
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,083
Goku...

177
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,166
[GOKU] Yikes!

178
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,208
Oops!

179
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,500
Whoa, man, that's really deep!

180
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,208
Whoa!

181
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:34,125
Wow! Towering walls of
molten lava! This isn't good!

182
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,000
This planet is
completely unstable!

183
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,875
[FRIEZA chuckles]

184
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,833
[FRIEZA yells]

185
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,250
[GOKU yells]

186
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,375
The end.

187
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,833
Huh?!

188
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,250
[GOKU shouts]

189
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,125
[GOKU screams]

190
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,916
[FRIEZA] A pity, really.
Such an uneventful ending.

191
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,125
And for such a great fighter.

192
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,625
Hey, what have you done
to him?! Where is he?!

193
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,208
[FRIEZA] Where is who?

194
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,708
[PICCOLO] You know who
I'm talking about!

195
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:28,083
Oh, yes! I seem to recall him
melting in the river of lava.

196
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,250
How would you like to join him?
I'm making a stew down there

197
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,458
and I wouldn't mind adding
a Namek for seasoning.

198
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,291
Yes, that's just what it needs.

199
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,750
Perfect! Consider it done.

200
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,500
[FRIEZA giggles]

201
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,541
[GOKU sighs]

202
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,875
That was close!

203
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,833
Man, you could get a wicked
heat-rash from that!

204
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,125
[GOKU screams]

205
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,833
[GOKU yelping]

206
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,333
Oh! Mama! Yow!

207
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:31,416
[FRIEZA} Whatd'ya say,
Namek? Are you ready? I am.

208
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,875
Ai-yai-yai-yai! Whoa!

209
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,291
[GOKU screams]

210
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:39,916
Hm?!

211
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,250
[GOKU screaming]

212
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,791
My butt's on fire!

213
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,250
Yes!

214
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,166
Hyaah!

215
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,833
Hrrgh!

216
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,916
[GOKU growling]

217
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,875
[growling continues]

218
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:36,250
[GOKU growling]

219
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,416
[GOKU] Man, I hope
that patch holds!

220
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,458
Phew...

221
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,875
Hey! Goku! Look out!

222
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,166
[GOKU] Hey, just what's
your deal anyway, Frieza?

223
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,250
[FRIEZA] Basically,
I'm trying to kill you.

224
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:26,041
[GOKU] Then leave this
planet out of our fight!

225
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,666
Got it? Let it be!

226
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,583
[FRIEZA] Hmph.

227
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,500
Okay, have it your way.

228
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,083
[GOKU] Fine! Then it's agreed!

229
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,458
[FRIEZA] I've never met a
sentimental Saiyan before.

230
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,458
It'll be your downfall.

231
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,708
[GOKU] Well, if having
feelings is a weakness,

232
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,041
why am I the only Saiyan left?

233
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,625
[NARRATOR] The battle between
Goku and Frieza continues

234
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,958
on the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
