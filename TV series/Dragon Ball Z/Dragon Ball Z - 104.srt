00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,583
Goku said his
farewells to Frieza,

3
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,375
deciding that the
weakened tyrant,

4
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,833
was no longer a threat
to the Universe!

5
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,291
[GOKU sighs]

6
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,958
[GOKU] Goodbye, Frieza.

7
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,416
May you live the rest
of your life in peace.

8
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,958
"Peace"?!

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,791
[NARRATOR] But peace wasn't
quite what Frieza had in mind!

10
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,041
As Goku launched off
towards his ship,

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,416
Frieza unleashed
his final attack:

12
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,875
[FRIEZA] Never!

13
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:46,208
I will never... never...

14
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,083
[NARRATOR] An energy disk that
can cut through anything,

15
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,291
and will follow Goku
wherever he goes!

16
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,291
You truly are a helpless fool!

17
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,541
I gave you one last
chance to live!

18
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,458
[FRIEZA laughs]

19
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,875
[GOKU growls]

20
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,916
[GOKU] And this is
how you repay me?!

21
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
[GOKU growls]

22
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,125
[NARRATOR] And so, the epic
battle between good and evil

23
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,750
swings back to life.

24
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,166
But with little time to spare!

25
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,500
Can the enraged Goku
avoid this last attack,

26
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:51,125
put an end to Frieza, and escape
from Namek before it blows?

27
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,333
[NARRATOR} It's a time bomb
the size of a planet,

28
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,958
on this explosive
episode of Dragon Ball Z!

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,791
[FRIEZA thinking] He thinks he
can pull up at the last second

30
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,708
and make the disc hit me!

31
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,500
[FRIEZA giggles]

32
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,125
[FRIEZA laughs]

33
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,708
[thinking] As if
I'm stupid enough

34
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,291
to be cut by my own attack!

35
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,958
You'll have to be much
more clever than that!

36
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,000
[FREIZA yells]

37
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,958
Gotcha!

38
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,625
[FRIEZA growls]

39
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,416
[GOKU] Looking for someone?

40
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,291
An after-image, eh?

41
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,666
That's a pretty good
little trick for a primate.

42
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,916
I don't understand why you call
Saiyans by such mindless names.

43
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The only thing it does is reveal
your own fear and ignorance.

44
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,625
[FRIEZA growls]

45
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,416
I guess name-calling
is your only attack

46
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,458
because you're too weak to
challenge me any other way.

47
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:55,833
[FRIEZA growls]

48
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,583
[thinking] No one talks
to me like that!

49
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,083
Hmm...

50
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,000
Tell us, King Kai... What now?

51
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,791
[KING KAI] Goku seems
to be in complete control.

52
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,000
Huh?!

53
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,125
Then, you mean
Frieza's gonna lose?

54
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,958
[KING KAI] Yes, Chiaotzu...

55
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:48,333
It looks like Frieza's on
his last legs, but who cares?!

56
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,416
Maybe Goku is winning! Maybe
he'll beat Frieza after all!

57
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,166
But even if he does, the
planet is going to explode!

58
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,875
And Goku will still be doomed!

59
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:13,291
So my energy disk wasn't
challenging enough for you, huh?

60
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,750
[FRIEZA chuckles]

61
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:19,458
[FRIEZA] I guess we'll just
have to raise the stakes!

62
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,125
And double the fun!

63
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,791
As you wish, Frieza...

64
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,125
Give me a break!
Not this stupid routine again!

65

Oh, this is too much! One
little explosion and "boom",

72

Frieza and Kakarot
are both out of my hair!

73

At last, I'm the most powerful
fighter in the Universe!

for this day!

Those years with Frieza,
swallowing my humiliation!

Frieza's every command,

annihilated millions of people,

84
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,000
just to expand Frieza's empire!

fast we banged up that planet?!

give us a huge reward!

We have returned
from the planet Shik.

Everything was
done as you desired.

Tell me, Zarbon,

how long do you think
it would take you

119

to conquer a planet like Shik?

120
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,916
Well, I imagine one
full day would be enough.

have to listen to me!

ordered it all!

To have your father killed!
And to blow up our home planet!

you know what he's done to us?!

[VEGETA] So he killed my father,
destroyed my people...

that matters in this world.

above and conquers all!

I can beat him now.

163
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,000
But wait and see,
as the last of the Saiyans,

164
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,958
we have flowing
through our veins

165
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,958
the blood of a warrior race!

166
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,208
The more we fight, the
more powerful we become!

167
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,291
And with each fight, I'll
get stronger and stronger!

168
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,833
[VEGETA growls]

169
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,791
[VEGETA] And one day I'll be
strong enough to beat Frieza,

170
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,166
and I will rule the Universe!

171
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,000
Exactly as I was meant to...

172
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,166
At last, that
great day has come!

173
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,000
Everyone who would
stop me is already dead!

174
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:20,833
[VEGETA laughs]

175
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,791
You're wrong about
all that, you know!

176
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,625
My father is coming back alive!

177
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,791
Huh?

178
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,875
[VEGETA chuckles]

179
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,416
[GOHAN growls]

180
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,291
[VEGETA sighs]

181
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,375
You sure do have a
wild imagination, kid.

182
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,875
No, it's the truth!

183
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,791
My dad'll beat Frieza
and come back home

184
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,541
and then
you'll be sorry!

185
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,583
[GOHAN growls]

186
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,833
[FRIEZA chuckles]

187
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:06,000
Monkey, I do think it would be
wiser for you to keep running!

188
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,458
[FRIEZA laughs]

189
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,916
Because I would just hate to
see you sliced into pieces!

190
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,708
[GOKU grunts]

191
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,666
When will you
ever learn, Frieza?

192
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,833
Please! Can't you try
something a tiny bit different?

193
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,416
[GOKU grunts]

194
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,875
Huh?!

195
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,166
[FRIEZA growls]

196
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,250
[FRIEZA] Nothing
but a lucky shot!

197
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,291
Now where'd that monkey go?!

198
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,041
[GOKU growls]

199
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,291
[FRIEZA grunts]

200
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
[FRIEZA growls]

201
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,708
[grunting]

[FRIEZA yells]

00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,791
[FRIEZA grunts]

205
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,750
[GOKU] I'm gonna slap
some sense into you!

206
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:27,333
[FRIEZA grunting]

207
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,625
Oh yeah! Okay! Give it to
him, Goku! Oh boy! Uh-huh!

208
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:35,041
Make him really feel it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

209
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,000
[FRIEZA yells]

210
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,583
[GOKU yells]

211
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,583
[FRIEZA gasps]

212
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,375
[GOKU yells]

213
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,833
[FRIEZA grunts]

214
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,208
It's time to finish this
fight once and for all!

215
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,791
Hey! Look out behind you!

216
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,041
Get down now!

217
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,375
Huh...?

218
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,833
[GOKU gasps]

219
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,000
My own attack...

220
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,291
[KING KAI screams]

221
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,375
Just tell us, King Kai,
we can handle it!

222
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,375
It's Goku! He's
been defeated, right?

223
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,791
[KING KAI] Umm, no...

224
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,791
Let's just say Frieza
isn't feeling, uhh...

225
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,916
Quite complete.

226
00:18:56,458 --> 00:19:05,583
[FRIEZA whimpering]

227
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,791
Though you brought
all this on yourself,

228
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:28,000
it's a shame that your life had
to end in such a miserable way.

229
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,416
[FRIEZA coughs]

230
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,625
I wanted to save you Frieza,
but you wouldn't let me...

231
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,833
And now you will have to
share the fate of planet Namek,

232
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,916
which you yourself destroyed.

233
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,708
[FRIEZA coughs]

234
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,125
[GOKU] I'm tired of
fighting. I'm going home.

235
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,583
[GOKU] Goodbye, Frieza...

236
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:01,166
[FRIEZA whimpers]

237
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,583
Please... help me...

238
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,583
You... can't leave me here...

239
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,083
[GOKU gasps]

240
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,541
[FRIEZA] You can't...
let me... die like this...

241
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:28,666
[GOKU growls]

242
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,958
[KING KAI gasps]

243
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,583
Goku! You mustn't listen to him!

244
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,916
You have to get off
the planet now!

245
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,666
[GOKU growls]

246
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:51,458
You... have to help... me...

247
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,833
[GOKU growls]

248
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,875
Don't... let me die...

249
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,750
[GOKU growls]

250
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,791
Please... have mercy...!

251
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,541
How many people begged for
their lives at YOUR feet,

252
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,875
and you killed them anyway?!

253
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,333
Did you show ME mercy
when I asked you to spare

254
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,791
my best friend Krillin?!

255
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:18,166
[FRIEZA] Please... Please...

256
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,125
For... give... me...

257
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,125
[GOKU sighs]

258
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,958
[GOKU yells]

259
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,666
[FRIEZA grunts softly]

260
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,625
Huh...?

261
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,583
I gave you some
of my own energy...

262
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,666
You should be able to move.

263
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,333
[GOKU] Go and do
as you like with it.

264
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,625
[GOKU] You're on your own now.

265
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,083
[VEGETA laughs]

266
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,166
Hurry back, Dad...

267
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,791
[NARRATOR] At last, the mighty
Frieza has been derailed,

268
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,166
cut down by his
own deadly attack.

269
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,333
Could this truly
be the end of Frieza?

270
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,958
On the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
