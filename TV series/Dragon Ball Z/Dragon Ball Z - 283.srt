1
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR] It looked to be
lights out for Vegeta

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,500
on the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,208
until the World Martial
Arts Champion himself

4
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,000
stepped in to
challenge Majin Buu!

5
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,083
[NARRATOR] The champ was
cruisin' for a bruisin',

6
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,083
but when Buu tried to attack,

7
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,166
he became crippled with agony!

8
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,041
Until, he hocked up the
source of his pain, that is,

9
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,250
and spit it out for good!

10
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,041
[NARRATOR]
It was the gentle Buu.

11
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,166
And now that his kind influence
had been expectorated,

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,791
the evil Buu was going to
make Hercule dead! But wait!

13
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,833
[BUU] You leave alone!
Him Buu's buddy!

14
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,791
[NARRATOR]
And so, the battle between

15
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,000
the good and evil Buu's began.

16
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,541
Meanwhile, Goku attempted
to gather enough energy

17
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,041
to join the action!

18
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:11,916
[GOKU] I need to relax.
Let go. I'm way too tense!

19
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,375
[NARRATOR]
It was a horrifying sight to see

20
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:20,500
the great Super Saiyan Three
completely sapped of his power.

21
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,916
Can there be any
hope of victory now?

22
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,083
[growls]

23
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:05,750
[MR. SATAN] Get him, Buu!
Yeah, come on, pow!

24
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,875
[barking]

25
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:22,958
[GOKU gasping]

26
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,916
Hey! What's the deal?

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,583
Were you playing some kind
of stupid joke on me, or what?

28
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,250
That didn't tickle, you know!

29
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,708
[panting]

30
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,083
Sorry, I misjudged.

31
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,166
Man, how strange!

32
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,875
When I was training
in Other World,

33
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,416
Super Saiyan Three
was, well, easy!

34
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,375
But this body, it chugs.

35
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,583
Yeah, I'll bet it uses
twice as much energy.

36
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,375
Wait a minute, guess
you're pretty mad.

37
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,291

[BUU, KID BUU grunting]

00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,250
He can't even land
a punch. Come on, Buu.

58
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,291
Hang in there. Don't die!

[VEGETA thinking]
Darn it!

60
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,208
We can't overpower him,

00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,750
we're just going to
have to outsmart him!

got to be a way! But how?

need to talk to you right now!

Uh?!

[VEGETA] I need your assistance!

[OLD KAI]
Yes, yes! We're here.

00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,583
Good! Now, look. Go to the
new planet Namek right away!

71
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,791
Quick, there's no time to waste!

72
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,750
Gather the Dragon Balls.

73
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,416
[DENDE]
I'll have to tell them what for.

74
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,250
To save our hides!
That's what for!

75
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,083
But if you don't hurry,
it'll be too late!

76
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,750
[OLD KIAI]
The Dragon Balls?

77
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,958
We can't use them to
settle our affairs.

78
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,708
[DENDE] But Sir, Vegeta needs
them! He must have a plan.

79
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,250
Plan schmann! No can do.

80
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,625
But this isn't our affair!
Don't you see? It's everyone's.

81
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,666
And if we don't do everything
in our power to help,

82
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,583
we're as guilty as Buu.

83
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,166
All right! Take it easy!

84
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,916
You made your point.
Now, let's get going.

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,458
[DENDE]
Thank you, Sir.

86
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,291
Well, it's about time.

87
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,083
Hey, I know you've got a plan.

88
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,958
[VEGETA]
Yes! And?!

89
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,041
Well, I hate to pry, but,
um, what is it, exactly?

90
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:29,500
Kakarot, how many times have you
saved the world up till now?

91
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,750
Hm. What? How many?
I'm not sure.

92
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,916
[VEGETA]
Just a ballpark.

93
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,916
Well, gosh! Half a
dozen, at least!

94
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,291
[VEGETA]
Then perhaps it's time

95
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:46,125
to let the world fend
for itself, for once.

96

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,958
Hmm? Not bad! Nice, short grass.

99
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:13,166
Uh. Yes, but where is everybody?

100
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,083
This is too good to be true!
It even smells the same!

Ahh! My beautiful home!

you haven't forgotten
about us all together.

104

perhaps, Dende?

[NAMEKS murumur]

108

[DENDE] Hi, everybody!
It's good to see you all again!

109
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,375
Elder, you truly are
the picture of wisdom

110
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,875
and good health.

111
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,916
Oh, Dende! You've grown into
a strong and noble guardian.

Haven't you, my boy?

113

Well, sort of!

114
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,000
The planet I was guarding,

115
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,750
it, kind of, met with a
little accident and blew up.

116
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,583
[OLD KAI]
Excuse me!

117
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,666
I hate to interrupt
your lovely reunion,

118
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,833
but we do have something
of a crisis on our hands.

Yes, very true.

Sir, with your permission,

122
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:14,666
we need to summon Porunga
as soon as possible!

123
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,583
Hmm... I See, well, uh...

124
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:22,083
You know our rules concerning
the use of the Dragon Balls.

125
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,500
I'm surprised that you would
make such a request, Dende.

126
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,958
[DENDE]
But, Sir!

127

[MOORI]
Yes?

00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,125
[DENDE]
I, uh. Uh.

129
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:35,041
[MOORI]
I'm disappointed in you, Dende.

[NAMEKS laughing]

131
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:41,916
[MOORI] You shouldn't
have given up so easily!

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,208
I was only testing you, my son!

133
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,791
Of course, you
can use the balls.

134
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,541
Sometimes, a guardian
must follow his heart

135
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,541
instead of the rules!

136
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,458
Ha. Lord Kais, forgive me, Sirs!

137
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,875
I really just couldn't resist.
Please, name your wishes.

138
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,958
[clears throat]
Dende, do the honors!

We're on Namek right now,

142
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,291
and we have all seven
of the Dragon Balls!

143
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,500
We just need to know
what your wishes are.

144
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,250
[VEGETA]
Got it!

145
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,916
Now, listen carefully, Dende!
This is very important!

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,541
[DENDE]
Ready when you are!

147
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,208
I have two wishes
I want to make.

148
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,833
First, I want the planet
Earth to be restored

149
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,291
to its original state.

150
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,083
And second, I want all of
the people who were killed

151
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,541
since the morning of the
World Martial Arts Tournament

152
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,083
to be brought back to life!

153
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,958
Do you understand?

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,208
[VEGETA] Did you get that,
Dende? Those are my two wishes!

155
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,541
Uhh! Yes! I understand!

156
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,791
Should I make the wishes now?

157
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,125
[VEGETA]
Yes, right now!

158
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,958
[DENDE]
I-I'm sorry...

159
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,000
Dende! I'm putting my
faith in Vegeta's plan,

160
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,125
and I'd like for you
to do the same, okay?

161
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,458
[DENDE]
Of course, Goku!

162
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,291
What would you like the
third wish to be, Vegeta?

163
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,125
Only those two wishes matter
to me, so do what you please.

164
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,375
[GOKU]
Hey, just out of curiosity,

165
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,083
why didn't you ask the Dragon
to bring all of the people

166
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,000
who were killed
by Buu back to life?

167
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,958
Wouldn't that be easier?

168
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,208
Ha. No thanks! That would mean
Babidi would be revived,

169
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,583
and I never want to
see that little imp again!

170
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,750
Also, that wish wouldn't
restore all the innocent lives

171
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,166
I destroyed at the stadium.

172
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,416
I see! Wow! I'm impressed.

173
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,666
You really thought
this thing through.

No! I almost forgot! Porunga!

176
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,041
He only has the power to

177
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,125
bring one person
back to life, per wish!

178
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,791
Mm! You're kidding me!

179
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,625
That's right! He's
different than Shenron!

[DENDE]
This is awful!

181
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,291
We didn't give
Porunga that ability

182
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,875
because Nameks don't believe
in wishing people back to life.

As Earthlings say: Chill out!

185
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,125
After that Freiza debacle,

186
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:38,375
we restyled the Dragon Balls
and increased Porunga's power.

187
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,958
You mean, he can grant the wish?

188
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,583
Ah, yes he can.

189
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,208
Oh, sure, just great.

190
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,708

wrong, everything's a go!

Thank goodness!

194
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,083
Please, proceed now!

Name you first wish.
and I will grant it!

Ah, well, Mr. Guardian of Earth.
