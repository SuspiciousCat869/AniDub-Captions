[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,416
an evil android creature
arrived from the future

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
to take over the world.

5
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,500
And mankind seems
powerless to stop it.

[COUPLE screams]

7
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,333
[NARRATOR] Fortunately,
Goku has fully recovered

8
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:31,041
from the devastating virus that
had a grip on him for so long.

9
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,916
And now he's ready to
put his plan into action.

10
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,291
[NARRATOR] Goku has to
get into fighting shape,

11
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,083
and he's taking Vegeta, Trunks,
and Gohan to Kami's place

12
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,916
where they can get a year of
intense training in one day.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,208
[VEGETA] All right, I'll go!

14
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,666
[NARRATOR]
The door is open,

15
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,125
all they have to do
is step through...

16
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,333
[MR. POPO] Good luck.

17
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,416
[NARRATOR] Is Trunks
tough enough to survive

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,541
being locked in a
room with Vegeta?

19
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,458
If Goku is right,
this training will push

20
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,333
all of their Saiyan powers
to the next level,

21
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:05,500
transforming them
into Ascended Saiyans.

22
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,166
This plan had better work,
because those three

23
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,833
devious androids are
still hot on his trail.

24

[ANDROID 17] Hi...
Can Goku come out and play?

25
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,000
Where has Goku gone?

26
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,958
If you don't tell us
where he's hiding,

27

I'll make you tell us.

Very well...
If you really want to.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,125
[NARRATOR] Piccolo's definitely
got his hands full now.

32
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:37,416
Locked into a deadly
duel with Android 17.

33
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,333
Since uniting with Kami,

34
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,458
Piccolo has been pumped up
with extra power.

35
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:47,166
But does he have the strength to
pull the plug on Android 17?

36
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,333
Find out today!

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,208
Tell us where Goku is...
or I'll make you.

38
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,083
Last chance.

what you're getting into
by challenging me.

43
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,291

is going to be tough because

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,375
I won't be able to keep
an eye on the other two.

51
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,625

they won't attack me

Don't worry.

Those two are only spectators.
This is between me and you.

[thinking] Perfect!

57
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,250
If it's just him, then
I won't have any problem

58
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,833
shutting him down.

59
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,541
I'll take out Android 17 first
and then I'll get the others.

60
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,583
If I can beat them, then Cell
will have nothing to absorb

61
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,500
and he won't be able
to become complete.

get in Piccolo's way!

As soon as we
finish our training,

those plans to Android 17?

162
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,625
Yeah... But man,
it's a lot of work!

163
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:22,125
I'm trying to isolate the
android's main power source,

164
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,000
and then, I can shut it off!

165
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,666
The only problem is

166
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,541
there are thousands of
circuits to sort through!

167
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,916
Don't give up!

168
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,125
I've gone too far
to turn back now!

169
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,250
But I only hope this remote
control I made can zero in

170
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,833
on the frequencies of the
circuits and turn them off!

171
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:43,208

to make these androids

It feels like a fierce

but I can't tell who's winning,

Is it Piccolo or the android?

I know who's going to win!

211

There's no way that Android

Piccolo's energy
is incredible, yes,

but we really don't know
how strong the Android is!

216
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,708
For all we know, that Android
is as strong as ten Piccolos.

217
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,791
[ANDROID 17] What a shame.
