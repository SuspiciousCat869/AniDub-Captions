00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,083
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,333
two young juniors vied for
the title of World Champion!

3
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,083
One of them was Trunks,
son of Vegeta.

4
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,791
The other was Goten,
son of Goku.

5
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,583
The winner could
rightly be called

6
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,083
the strongest boy in the world.

7
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,583
The action paused
for only a moment,

8
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,833
when the confident
Trunks took a time out

9
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,083
to make an
interesting proposition.

10
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,083
[GOTEN] Huh?

11
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,125
Yep! That's right!
Now look, you...

12
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,666
You're cooked!

13
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,166
I'm going to win this thing
without using one of my arms!

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,250
Come on, Trunks!
You wouldn't have a chance!

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,750
Ahh! You! You can't
beat me with one arm!

16
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,250
[TRUNKS] No left arm!

17
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,958
[TRUNKS growls]

18
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,416
[grunting]

19
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,000
[GOTEN] No fair!

20
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,625
[NARRATOR] The two young
warriors faught passionately

21
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,333
to the end, when Goten
made a head-on attack

22
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,333
that would determine the match.

23
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,250
[GOTEN] Here I come!

24
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,333
[GOTEN yells]

25
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,791
[TRUNKS] What?!

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,375
[GOTEN screams]

27
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,875
[NARRATOR] A victor has emerged!

28
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,333
Young Trunks is the new
Junior World Champion!

29
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,958
And now it's time for him to
fight an exhibition match

30
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,750
with the reigning World
Champion himself, Mr. Satan.

31
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,500
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen,

32
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,125
we are proud to bring
to you an exhibition match

33
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,416
between Trunks, the new
Junior World Champion,

34
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,291
and Mr Satan, the greatest
Martial Arts expert alive!

35
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:06,083
[CROWD cheers]

36
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,166
Mr. Satan!

37
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,708
[ANNOUNCER] That's right, fans!
Give it up for Mr. Satan!

38
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,375
Let's get him out here!
[MR. SATAN whimpers]

39
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:19,333
Yeah! What a strong junior
and over three feet tall!

40
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,375
It's going to take
everything you have

41
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,000
to win this one, Mr. Satan!

42
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,583
[ATTENDANT laughs]

43
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,958
Well, the truth is,
I don't have a chance

44
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:27,833
of beating him!

45
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,500
[ATTENDANT laughs]

46
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,416
Yeah, right!

47
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,083
[MR. SATAN laughs]

48
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,750
No, hey, uh,
I'm totally serious...

49
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,458
[BOTH laugh

50
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,708
[ATTENDANT] That's a good one,
sir! You crack me up! Aw, boy!

51
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,958
Whew!

52
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,250
Hey, kid, do you want to
rest before we begin?

53
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,875
[TRUNKS] Nah, I'm fine.

54
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,208
Alright, then.

55
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:53,583
Ladies and gentlemen!
Introducing... Mr. Satan!

56
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,916
Don't be too hard on him, sir!

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,166
--[MR. SATAN squeals]
--[ATTENDANT laughs]

58

[MR. SATAN whimpers]

59
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,333
Yeah! Mr. Satan rules!

60
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,416
You're the king!

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,958
[MAN 3] Show him
how it's done, Champ!

62
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,291
Yeaah!

63
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,875
Alright, you people!
I hope you're ready to rock,

64
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,958
because Mr. Satan's
gonna raise the roof!

65
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:18,041
[CROWD] Mis-ter Sa-tan!
Mis-ter Sa-tan! Mis-ter Sa-tan!

66
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,833
[MR. SATAN laughs]

67
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,416
Alright, little man!

68
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,291
Are you ready to go
toe-to-toe with the Champ?!

69
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,541
Yeaaah! Ha, ha, alright!

70
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,291
Well, you better watch it, son!

71
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,625
I'm the greatest
fighter of all time!

72
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,375
And I forgot to
bring my kid gloves!

73
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,291
Yeah! Ahhhhh!

74
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,583
[thinking] Now what
am I going to do?!

75
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:44,291
This kid has
no fear of anything!

76
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,750
[thinking] I wonder if this guy
is as strong as he says he is?

77
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:52,000
He looks like a big gorilla!
Looks can be deceiving, though.

78
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,083
Hmm...

79
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,333
Tear him apart, Trunks!
You can do it!

80
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,541
[MR. SATAN squeals]

81
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,583
Quiet there, kid!
Watch your mouth!

82
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,916
Let's not encourage
him too much, okay?!

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,375
[GOTEN] Huh?

84
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,041
Man! He's just too
pitiful to watch!

85
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,958
Does, uh, anyone else
wanna get something to eat?

86
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,458
Sure, that sounds
good to me.

--Let's do it!
--[VIDEL] Huh?

Hey, wait you guys!

89
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,458
Don't you want to see the fight
between Trunks and my dad?!

90
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,166
He is the reigning
World Champion, you know?

91
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,833
Don't you want to
study his technique?!

92
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,208
Ha, ha! Yeah! Of course we do!

93
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,375
Whatd'ya say, guys?! Sounds like
a great opportunity, huh?!

94
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,583
[GOKU] Thanks, but I
think we'll pass! See ya!

95
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,208
[MR. SATAN] Ohh yeah...

[thinking] What in the
world is he doing?!

103
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,500
He couldn't have
been serious just then!

104
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,750
He must be trying to trick me
into thinking that he's weak!

105

Well, I'm not buying it!

Hey, kid! Let's
take it easy, okay?!

108
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,958
This is just an
exhibition match!

109
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,083
Right?! We're not
supposed to be too serious!

110
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,458
Exhibition means
a pretend fight!

111
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,416
See?! Huh?

112
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,666
No way! I'm going
to try my best!

You little runt!
Don't you get it?!

115
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,500
It's not supposed
to be a real match!

116
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,041
I'm going for the win, jerk!

117
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,250
No, no!! Don't you understand
what I'm trying to say?!

118
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,250
Exhibition matches
are make-believe!

two great warriors!

If that were my son,

in the ring with Mr. Satan!

to let him in there!

really serious pain!

have to have it looked at!

right back into place!

It's painful but it
works like a charm!

back into place and

00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,041
Let the match begin!

160
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,041
Whoa-whoa-Whoa!
Wait just a second!

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,458
Good luck, kid!
May the best man win!

162
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,083
Hey, let's make real sure not
to hit each other really hard

163
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,500
when we're doing
the Champions' gGreeting

164
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,833
at the beginning of the match!

165
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,500
Champions' Greeting?

166
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,583
That's right!

167
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,375
World Champions
have a special way of

168
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,291
greeting each other
before a match!

169
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,958
It's like a punch, only super
soft, right in the face!

170
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,750
Get it?! Little tiny touch!
Right there on the cheek!

171
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,583
Except with fists! Okay...?

172
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,916
Now remember, kid!

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,041
When you think "Champions'
Greeting", think soft!

174
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,208
Am I clear?! Do you understand?

175
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,375
I think so! It sounds
simple enough!

176
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,833
Yeah!

177
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,041
[MR. SATAN] Alright!
We're ready whenever you are!

178
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,708
[MR. SATAN laughs]

179
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,375
[MR. SATAN]
Just discussing strategy!

180
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,166
This one's a real firecracker!

181
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,000
Reminds me of myself
when I was his age!

182
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,458
Wow... Tender moments...

183
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,875
Alrighty then! Here
we go, sports fans!

184
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,791
Our champ has given
the thumbs up!

185
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,541
Without further delay,
let the match begin!

186
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:54,041
Yeah! Oh yeah! Let's do it!

187
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,250
Egads! Look at that!
In the confident style

188
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,666
of a true champion, Trunks is
being offered a free shot!

189
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,958
Now that's a fighter,
ladies and gentlemen!

190
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,416
What a class act!

191
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,625
--How great!
--Hang in there, kid!

192
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,041
[MR. SATAN] It's time
for the greeting, kid!

193
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,250
[MR. SATAN groans]

194
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,958
[MR. SATAN yells]

195
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,958
[ANNOUNCER whimpers]

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,083
But...

197
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,166
One punch, it's, uh...

198
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:05,875
Father!

199
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,500
Ahh, darn it, Trunks!

200
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,750
Why'd you have to go and
do something like that?!

201
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,333
[TRUNKS] Hmph.

202
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,458
[ANNOUNCER] Wow! Oooh!

203
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,000
[ANNOUNCER gasps]

204
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,375
[GOTEN] Huh?

205
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,750
[ANNOUNCER] Oh, my goodness!
Mr. Satan's out cold!

206
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,208
Oh, Dad!

207
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,166
[MR. SATAN grunts]

208
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,833
[ANNOUNCER] Wait! Wait a minute!
He's getting up!

209
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,166
[MR. SATAN laughs]

210
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,625
What a punch! Man!

211
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,333
[MR. SATAN laughs]

212
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,458
Yeah! He beat me up
fair and square! Yep!

213
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,041
What a great little fighter!

214
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:11,208
Well! That's it! Young Trunks
has defeated Mr. Satan!

215
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,458
Wow! What a guy!
He let the kid win, didn't he?!

216
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,458
Heck yeah! That kid
didn't have a chance!

217
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,041
Now that's what I call
a hero, alright!

218
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:22,416
[MR. SATAN] Thank you!
Thank you! I love you all!

219
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,875
[TRUNKS] Hm?!

220
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,541
[ATTENDANT laughs]

221
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,666
Satan... You're always
so full of surprises!

222
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,208
Come on.

223
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,333
You didn't really think that
I would fight a kid, did you?

224
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,666
[thinking] I can't
figure that guy out!

225
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,416
Is he super strong
and just lost on purpose?

226
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,041
Or is he just a
stupid weakling?!

227
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,291
[FAN 2] Alright,
Hercule! You rule!

228
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,541
[MR. SATAN sighs]

229
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,000
[MR. SATAN yells]

230
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,416
The pain! The pain!
Oh, I can't stand it!

231
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,916
Oh, I just wanna die!
I hate that kid!

232
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,916
Ahhh! The pain!

233
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,791
Well, congratulations, Trunks!

234
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,375
You're stronger than the
World Champion, kid!

235
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,333
[CROWD cheers]

236
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,166
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen...

237
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,375
The main event, the World
Martial Arts Championship,

238
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,750
will begin in just
thirty minutes!

239
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,250
And don't forget to visit one
of our concession stands

240
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,500
during the intermission!

241
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,875
We've got cold drinks,
chili dogs,

242
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,500
and mouth-watering nachos!

243
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,750
I've had those nachos. Yuck!

244
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,708
Yeah, no joke! You've got
one day, you gotta eat well!

245
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,833
Hey, there's the waiting
area for the athletes!

246
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,708
They always have
good food in these places!

247
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,333
Whoa! Hold on!

248
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,166
The general public's
not allowed in here!

249
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,416
This is for qualifiers only!

250
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,875
Heeey, relax man!
We are qualifiers!

251
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,708
We all passed
the qualifying test,

252
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,083
and with flying colors
I might add...

253
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,250
Ohh? We'll see about that!

254
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,166
Names please! You first!

255
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,458
I'm Goku.

256
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,000
The name is Krillin.

257
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,500
Number 18.

258
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,625
Vegeta.

259
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,666
Majunior!

260
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,958
Huh...? "Majunior"?

261
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,166
Yeah, I thought
I'd go undercover.

262
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,083
Protect my identity
a little bit.

263
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,958
Oh, yeah. Sure, I get it.

264
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,708
Alright! Looks good!

265
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,375
Your names are
on the list!

266
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,583
Welcome to the
athlete's resort area!

267
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,333
You can take a sauna or a
whirlpool bath,

268
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,541
have a massage, play ping-pong
or enjoy our buffet style lunch!

269
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,583
Make yourselves at home!

270
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,583
[KRILLIN] Gee, thanks!

271
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,166
[GOKU] Yeah! That's really nice.

272
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,708
[VEGETA] Well,
I'd say it's about time

273
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,083
we got some special treatment!

274
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,125
[KRILLIN] Well, they
do make their money

275
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,625
'cause people
wanna see us fight!

276
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,125
Speaking of money,

277
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,750
think you can save some of
that prize money for me, Goku?

278
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, you don't have to worry.

279
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,458
I don't need money
where I'm going.

280
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,125
Can't take it with you, huh?

281
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,291
Well, as your good friend,

282
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,291
I'd be happy to look
after your winnings.

283
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,000
No thanks. Why don't you
come to Other World with me?

284
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:58,416
What, no way! I'm married now,
bro! This is the good life!

285
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,708
Right, babe?

286
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,208
Goon.

287
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,208
[LADY REPORTER] Has anyone ever
told you how cute you are?

288
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,583
[TRUNKS] No.

289
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,291
So Brief is your last name!
Trunks Brief! I like it!

290
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,375
He's gonna be a
real heart-throb!

291
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,708
That's for sure!

292
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,583
Do you have any words for
your fellow countrymen

293
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,208
as the new Junior World
Martial Arts Champion?

294
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,916
Uhh, anything?

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,375
[TRUNKS] No.

296
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,375
What is your favorite
T.V. show, Trunks?!

297
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,958
Hey, Trunks! What was it like
fighting against the Champ?!

298
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,125
Ahh! Ask him!
He's coming out!

299
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,708
--[REPORTERS] Huh?!
--[TRUNKS] Goten!

300
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,916
[GOTEN] Huh? Oh, ha, ha!

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,208
Huh?! Look! There he goes!

302
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,208
[REPORTERS] Huh?!

303
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,541
[REPORTERS] Trunks, come back!

304
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,916
We haven't gotten
our interview yet!

305
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,125
[TRUNKS &amp; GOTEN grunt]

306
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,750
Reporters... They're
just rude people.

307
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,750
Yeah, whew.

308
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,250
Hey, don't forget your promise!

309
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,791
You've gotta give me
three of your toys, right?!

310
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,541
Ahh... Yes, I do.

311
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,166
But we have more important
things to talk about!

312
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,375
Huh?!

313
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,833
Yeah, think!

314
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,541
Wouldn't it be cool to fight
in the big championships?

315
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,250
Well, yeah! But are
we allowed to do that?!

316
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,458
[TRUNKS] Well, hmm...

317
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,416
[GOKU slurps]

318
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,416
[WAITER 1] There you are, sir.

319
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,250
[GOKU slurps]

320
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,791
Whew! This is good stuff!

321
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,458
Ugh... You know, I...

322
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,166
don't think I'll ever
get used to this...

323
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,458
Man, Goku. You sure
eat a lot for a dead guy.

324
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,958
You know, that's exactly what
King Kai always tells me!

325
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,291
But what can I say?
I just love to eat!

326
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,291
[KRILLIN] You're tellin' me...

327
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,291
Cool! It's chow time!

328
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:02,125
[GOKU] Gohan! Hey! Alright!
How did it go, guys?

329
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,500
[GOHAN] It was
pretty interesting!

330
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,166
Trunks beat Mr. Satan
with one punch!

331
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,625
[GOKU] Really?!

332
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,333
But everyone thinks that he
lost the match on purpose

333
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,541
just to be a gentleman!

334
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,083
[KRILLIN] Hmph!
What a guy, huh?!

335
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,291
He should get an
Academy Award for that one!

336
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,958
And just what do
you mean by that?!

337
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,541
You don't know Krillin!
He's always joking like that!

338
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,708
[GOHAN laughs]

339
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:25,166
Isn't that right?! You never
know when to stop, do you?!

340
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,333
[KRILLIN] That's right!
Now let go, please!

341
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,791
[VIDEL] Hmm...

342
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,250
Hey, guys! We ordered
for you already!

343
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,375
Pull up a chair!
It's really good!

344
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,625
Alright! Great! I'm famished!

345
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,583
Hey, Dad! We're out of pasta!

346
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,500
'Scuse me! More
spaghetti please!

347
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,791
[VEGETA] And bring some more
eggrolls while you're at it!

348
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,791
Good grief! You Saiyans are
like bottomless pits, I swear!

349
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,958
What's a Saiyan?

350
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,250
Krillin! Hello?!

351
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,000
[KRILLIN] Oops!
I'm sorry, Gohan!

352
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,333
I'm just not going
to talk anymore!

353
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,625
Yup, lips are sealed!

354
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,333
[GOKU] Mmmm, ahhhh!
That was incredible!

355
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,791
What a feast!

356
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,958
[GOKU] Woweee! I'm so full!

357
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,416
If I have to fight
one of you guys,

358
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,208
please don't punch
me in the gut!

359
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,333
You didn't eat anything!
You must be on a diet!

360
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,916
[KRILLIN] Believe
it or not, Gohan!

361
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,666
Most athletes don't like
to stuff themselves

362
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,416
before a big match!

363
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,083
[ANDROID 18] Hey, we should
go check the draw.

364
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,625
See who's fighting who.

365
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,958
[VEGETA] Well, if I have to
fight Kakarot the first round,

366
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,000
the first thing I'm going
to do is punch him in the gut!

367
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,541
--[PICCOLO] Hm?
--[GOKU] Aw, man! No mercy!

368
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,625
Huh...?

369
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,166
Hey, Gohan!

370
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,041
I'm picking up some
weird vibes from these guys!

371
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,583
Good afternoon.

372
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,500
You wouldn't be Goku by
any chance, would you?

373
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,833
Yeah. How did you know
that my name is Goku?

374
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,916
Well, your reputation as a
great fighter precedes you.

375
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,375
I was actually hoping for a
chance to fight you

376
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,833
during the tournament.

377
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,416
It's not that I'm confident
about beating you. Not at all.

378
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,333
It's just that I want to have
the greatest challenge

379
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,291
that I can think of,
and I know you're a man

380
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,791
who understands that.

381
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,958
Well then, It was
a real pleasure.

382
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,458
I'm honored...

383
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,833
And I'm very much looking
forward to today's competition.

384
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,291
I've traveled very far
for this opportunity

385
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,708
to meet you in battle.

386
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,500
You might even say that
I'm one of your biggest fans.

387
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,250
In any case, after meeting you,

388
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,333
I'm certain that I
won't be disappointed.

389
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,125
[GOKU] Gosh, thanks!

390
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,458
Goku, may I shake your hand?

391
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,458
Huh? Yeah, of course!

392
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,291
[chuckling]

393
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,083
Huh...?

394
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:40,250
Alright! Thank you. You're as
brave as everyone says you are.

395
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,708
[GOKU] Uhh...

396
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,583
Good day.

397
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,666
[GOKU] Hey, wait a second!
I didn't catch your name!

398
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,083
I don't like the feel
of it. They're strong.

399
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,875
Real strong...

400
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,333
But, hey, isn't that what
this tournament's about?

401
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,041
Finding the unexpected challenge

402
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,958
and seeing who
emerges as the victor?

403
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,583
[VEGETA] Hm!

404
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,291
Gee, I don't know...

405
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,708
They don't seem all
that strong to me, guys.

406
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,416
To tell the truth,
I don't think they know

407
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,375
what they're getting
themselves into.

408
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,833
[VEGETA] Well, we'll find
out soon enough, won't we?

409
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,500
I, for one, will be more than
happy to take on either

410
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,166
of those two clowns.

411
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,208
[NARRATOR]
Two strangers have appeared

412
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,041
at the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

413
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,916
What does their
eerie presence portend?

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Are they really as strong
as Goku says they are?

415
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,041
On the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
