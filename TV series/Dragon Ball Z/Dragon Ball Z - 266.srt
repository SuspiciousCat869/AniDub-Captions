00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,125
[NARRATOR]
Last time, on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,791
Using a strange sneak attack,

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:22,250
Majin Buu ensnared both Piccolo
and the freshly fused Gotenks...

4
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:33,750
[NARRATOR] ...and absorbed
them into his body.

5
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,000
Knowing he could not match
Gohan's newly acquired powers

6
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:41,250
in his present state, Majin Buu
opted for a transformation.

7
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,916
Incorporating the powers of
Gotenks at Super Saiyan Three,

8
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,291
and the combat
wisdom of Piccolo,

9
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,250
a new, Super Buu was created.

10
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,291
And because it merged
Gohan's childhood teacher,

11
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,916
as well as his little brother,

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,125
it was a Buu who
knew Gohan all too well.

13
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,333
[GOHAN gasping]

14
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,833
[SUPER BUU]
What do you think of it?

15
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,625
New clothes,
and a few new abilities.

16
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,541
[GOHAN] If you're using
Piccolo's brains,

17
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,000
you know you've
got thirty minutes

18
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,166
until this newfound
strength of yours defuses.

19
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,791
[SUPER BUU laughs]

20
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,208
[SUPER BUU] I assure you,
it will be over before then.

21
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:24,083
And I didn't absorb you
because I needed a punching bag.

22
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,958
I kept you around because
I'm stronger than ever,

23
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,833
and I have to try it on someone.

24
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,791
[GOHAN]
Sounds fine, I'm all yours.

25
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,833
Let's do this.

26
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,000
[NARRATOR]
And so the battle

27
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,833
with the newest
incarnation of Buu began.

28
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,500
And where Gohan had previously

29
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,583
been in total control
of the action,

30
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,166
he was now struggling
with all of his might

31
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,625
just to stay alive.

32
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,250
[SUPER BUU] Remember, not so
long ago, I was the one hiding.

33
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,958
I needed time to stall.

34
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,375
Is that what you're
doing now, Gohan?

35
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,208
Your beloved Piccolo
is a part of me,

36
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,375
and I can sense that
you're alive down there, kid.

37
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,791
[NARRATOR] Will Gohan
have to fight this battle

38
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,291
for Earth totally alone?

39
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:17,083
Find out now,
on Dragon Ball Z!

[GOHAN grunting]

42
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:49,291
Come on, you're going to
have to try harder than that.

43
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,375
[groans]

44
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,916
You're not paying
attention to my moves.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,250
Piccolo taught you better
than this, didn't he?

46
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,875
Yes, he did!

47
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:08,708
[gasps]

48
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,416
[SUPER BUU]
Could've been your head.

49
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,791
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

50
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,125
[SUPER BUU] And with all that
training on the cliffs.

51
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,875
[GOHAN growls, groans]

52
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,583
I can't see what's happening.

53
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,583
Uh, Gohan's in top form,

54
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,833
but it's simply
not going to be enough!

55
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,666
Gohan!

56
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,583

Oh no!

[sighs]

64
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,041
[SUPER BUU] Now that
felt like a Piccolo technique.

65
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,291
[GOHAN groans]

66
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,666
[SUPER BUU] I really didn't
think the Special Beam Cannon

67
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,541
packed that much of a punch.

68
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,333
[SUPER BUU] But maybe
it's just that much stronger

69
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,458
now that it's coming through me.

70
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,500
What do you think of that?

71
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,791
Are you even awake?

72
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,208
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

73
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,416

You're letting them down again.

00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,583
And I'll use them all
to kill you!

Did you see that?!

00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:43,208
Majin Buu just burped up
some kinda mini Buu!

87

What is that?!

[SUPER BUU] You can thank
Gotenks for that technique.

00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,583
I know my little Superghost

100
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,125
could've spun a dozen
different moves at you,

101
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,458
but you just keep
making it so easy, Gohan.

102
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,166
It's kind of sad.

103

Ah...

00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:11,000
There must be something you're
still anxious to prove, Gohan.

107
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,125
How amusing.

108

don't let me be dead,

things I never did!

There's got to be
something we can do!

That's an interesting
point you make, Goku.

127
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,125
Perhaps we can help Gohan
by sending you down to fight.

Yes, that's correct.

In his present state,

132
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,708
he's unable to return
to Earth ever again.

[SUPREME KAI]
Huh?

I'll give you the life
that's left inside of me.

136
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,333
Then you can make
your return to Earth.

137
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,958
You mean you're giving
up your life, for me?!

138
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,083
Venerable Elder, this is
the most unorthodox behavior.

139
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,916
You can't just
offer up your life

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,125
to handle a single situation.

141
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,375
As usual, you're missing
the bigger picture.

142
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,791
After Earth,
Majin Buu will come here.

143
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,541
If that is true, then
let me give up my life!

What? No, master!

145

Majin Buu has been
my enemy to destroy

since Bibidi,
thousands of years ago,

147

and repeatedly I have failed.

148
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,875
You must allow me
to pay my own debt!

149

You're ambitious,
but too hard on yourself.

150
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,708
Let the old men
sacrifice their lives

151

so that the young ones can live.

What is going on here?

155
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,708
Is this some kind of a joke?

156
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,875
No, far from it.

157
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,291
We're going to send the best
fighter we have here

158
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,375
to help them fight Buu.

159

I want you to escort
him there, Baba.

160

I will take care of the rest.

161

For the record,

162
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,375
you should know
that this is a bad idea,

163
