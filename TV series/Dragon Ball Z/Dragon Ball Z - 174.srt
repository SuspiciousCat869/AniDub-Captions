00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,583
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,125
Goku journeyed into space
and brought back a friend.

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,500
Dende!

4
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,208
Taking over Kami's position
as guardian of Earth,

5
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,833
the young Namek
didn't waste any time!

6
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,583
His first task: a new
set of Dragon Balls!

7
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,000
[NARRATOR] By restoring
the dragon,

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,708
Goku hopes to bring
back all the people killed

9
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,041
during Cell's violent rampage.

10
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:41,791
Now all he has to do is
find the Dragon Balls!

11
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,875
And as history has shown,
that can be a painful task.

12
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,291
[GOKU] Only five more.

13
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,875
[NARRATOR] But he
better make it quick,

14
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,333
because the evil Cell
is growing impatient.

15
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:59,083
[CELL] How boring, I should
not have given them this long.

16
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,500
[NARRATOR] And the
tournament is coming soon.

17
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:08,416
Now, get ready for today's
episode of Dragon Ball Z!

18
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,583
[TRUNKS yells]

19
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,875
[grunting]

20
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,000
[TRUNKS yells]

21
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,791
Uh, are... you
really studying, Gohan?

22
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,541
Yeah! I've spent all this
time training with my dad,

23
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,000
so I kinda figured I should
study for a while

24
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,583
like my mom wants.

25
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,791
Yeah! I guess that'd be fair.

26
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,166
[DENDE] Hey, I brought
some notes with me too.

27
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,875
Here, we'll study
them together!

28
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,791
[KRILLIN] Whoa, gee! They give
you guys homework on Namek too?

29
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,166
[DENDE] Well, yeah!

30
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,833
It takes a lot of
hard work to learn

31
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,000
how to be a good
guardian, you know.

32
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,083
Huh. And here I thought
that all just came naturally.

33
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,041
All this homework!

34
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:19,375
This is giving me bad
flashbacks from algebra class.

35
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:23,083
[ALL laugh]

36
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,000
[TRUNKS grunts]

37
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,875
[laughing continues]

38
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,833
[KRILLIN] Well,
you guys give me a shout

39
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,083
if you need a study break.

40
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,541
I'm gonna go to Master Roshi's.

41
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,000
[GOHAN] Okay!

42
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,958
There are only
a few days remaining.

43
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:45,208
I wonder if Goku will be able
to find all the Dragon Balls?

44
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:53,333
[ANNOUNCER] Welcome everyone
to today's extravaganza!

45
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:58,000
Now let me ask you a question:
Who here loves Mr. Satan?!

46
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,000
'Cause I sure don't hear ya!

47
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:05,041
[CROWD roars]

48
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,208
[cheering continues]

49
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, here he is! The
man with the iron hands!

50
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,333
World-wide
Martial Arts Champion!

51
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,166
[drumroll]

52
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,958
[ANNOUNCER] Hercule Satan!

53
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:35,041
[MR. SATAN growls]

54
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:40,083
[CROWD roars]

55
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,958
[growling continues]

56
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,291
[ANNOUNCER] I-I simply
don't believe it!

57
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,541
Mr. Satan is not pulling one!

58
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,791
Not two! Not three!

59
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,166
But FOUR tour busses behind him!

60
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,583
--Oh my! Isn't that incredible!
--This guy's too much...

61
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,958
[CROWD cheering]

62
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,833
[MR. SATAN] Who do you love?!

63
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,416
[MR. SATAN yells]

64
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,375
[CROWD cheers]

65
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,291
What's this? He's pulling
something from his cape...

66
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,416
What do you suppose
our hero has got?!

67
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,833
Oh my!

68
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,958
He's got three
mega-sized phone books!

69
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,583
They're from West Town,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

70
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,125
and you all know
how big THOSE are!

71
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,583
[MR. SATAN growls]

72
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,041
Surely he's not
going to rip them all?!

73
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:40,583
[MR. SATAN yells]

74
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,458
[ANNOUNCER gasps]

75
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,291
[MR. SATAN laughs]

76
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,250
[CROWD murmurs]

77
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,125
He did! He really did it!

78
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:59,416
[CROWD roaring]

79
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,625
Mr. Satan, can you tell
us all about your ambitions

80
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,125
for the Cell Games?

81
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,583
So, you want to know
what I'm gonna do to Cell?!

82
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,958
Exactly the same thing
I'm gonna do to this bus!

83
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,416
[MR. SATAN yells]

84
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,541
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

85
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,625
[ANNOUNCER] Well,
that settles it, folks!

86
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,666
Cell's about to have
a big iron fist

87
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,333
where his stomach should be!

88
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:28,083
Let's have a cheer
for the man of the year!

89
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,500
[CROWD roars wildly]

90
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,041
[ANNOUNCER]
Seriously, Mr. Satan,

91
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,000
is there anything you can't do?

92
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,166
Hold on!

93
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,083
[MR. SATAN growls]

94
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,625
[laughing]

95
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,083
[ANNOUNCER] Now why
don't 'cha come over here

96
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
and sign some autographs?

97
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,666
[CROWD cheering]

98
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
That's just sad...

99
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,833
[ROSHI sips]

100
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,375
It sure is. Somebody
could have used that bus.

101
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,875
[GOKU] Alright! This makes four!

102
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,083
So... how'd it go?
Did you advance?

103
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,625
[VEGETA chuckles]

104
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,291
[PICCOLO] Not bad, Vegeta.

105
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,541
[PICCOLO] But it's not enough.

106
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,208
Oh, wow! How do you like that?

107
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,458
Two Dragon Balls
are moving at once!

108
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,958
Somebody must've beat me to 'em!

109
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:59,625
[chickens clucking]

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,375
[TAO grunts]

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,750
[INTERCOM] Who is it?

112
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,208
[TAO] It's me.

113
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,125
[INTERCOM] Oh, General Tao!
I've been waiting for you!

114
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:40,666
So Tao, I sure hope you brought
the goods that you promised me.

115
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,333
[TAO chuckles]

116
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,666
[TAO] But of course!

117
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,958
[VODKA gasps]

118
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,125
[TAO chuckles]

119
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,375
So these are the
famous Dragon Balls

120
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,625
that make any wish
come true, is that right?

121
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,041
A valuable buy at any price,

122
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,000
and a bargain at just
two hundred thousand each.

123
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,416
And even if that monster
destroys everyone on Earth

124
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,750
I can still survive with these?

125
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,583
I can sit as snug as a bug
in my fortress here

126
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,125
and wait for
Cell to go away, ah?

127
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,333
I accept gold only.

128
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:15,125
And then, after Cell
has done his dirty work,

129
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,708
I will step out from
the rubble and build an empire!

130
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,250
Think of it!
No rival gangsters!

131
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,250
No meddling police!

132
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,541
They will call me "Emperor!"

133
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,250
Now how long
will it take you

134
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,125
to find the rest of
the Dragon Balls?

135
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,166
[TAO] Don't you
worry about that,

136
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,708
notice how quickly
I found these two!

137
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,041
Yeah, that's right!
I trust you there, General!

138
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,833
[TAO chuckles]

139
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,583
[TAO] I probably won't
find the others

140
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,208
on the black market like these,

141
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,041
but he doesn't have to
know about that.

142
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,750
That's what I call a big door!

143
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:06,125
[sirens blaring]

144
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,583
Huh?!

145
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,291
Hey, I'm not expecting anyone.

146
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,625
Huh? That's funny!

147
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,875
What? A Dragon Ball?!

148
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,375
What the--?!

149
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,208
I'll bet they're
in here for sure!

150
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,291
Seems the chicken has
brought his own frying pan.

151
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,250
Huh? Chicken?

152
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,958
Where's a--?

153
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,708
[TAO] We should take
care of him at once!

154
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,833
[VODKA] Huh? Uh...

155
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,041
Oh! Oh, yeah, sure!
Let's get him!

156
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,500
[VODKA chuckles]

157
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,125
Chicken...?

158
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,541
Huh?

159
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:54,791
Hello? Is anybody home?

160
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,375
Well, I'm coming in now!

161
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,333
[VODKA chuckles]

162
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:07,375

It's time to cook your chicken.

I'm talkin' about!

Wow! These things are sharp!

168

[VODKA] Uh, what just happened?

171

Could someone please explain?

172
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,000
Looks like your weapons haven't
been inspected very recently.

173
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,666
Well, have they been?!

174
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,208
[HENCHMEN] No, boss! We, uhh...

You idiots!

176
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,541
How many times have I told you
to inspect the weapons

177
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,708
so that they'll work
when we need them to?!

[HENCHMEN] You never said that!

Well then, we'll just
have to wait

'til he comes in here
with his Dragon Balls

181
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,250
and then we'll
threaten him in person!

182

Hey, I'm really close.

183

you come in here and visit?

say the same thing.

192
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,208

and then go away

coming to you live.

324
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,875
We're standing here
on a cliff

325
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,791
above the infamous
fighting arena

326
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,083
where the Cell Games are about
to begin in one short hour!

327
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,291
And Cell seems
frozen like a statue!

328
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,333
Who will be victor
in this ultimate match?

329
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:43,083
Will it be the perfected Cell?
Will it be our hero Goku?

330
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:46,041
Or is the Earth's salvation
to be found in the hands

331
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,500
of one of these brave fighters?

332
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,375
Let the games begin,

333
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,458
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
