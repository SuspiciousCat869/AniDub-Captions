on Dragon Ball Z,

Krillin stepped into the
ring to show his stuff

3
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,250
in the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,916
His opponent had the
pounds to throw around,

5
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,375
but a well-placed punch
knocked the wind

6
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,833
out of the overweight warrior.

7
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,666
From there, a slap-kick
combination assured

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,708
an easy victory for Krillin.

[NARRATOR] The stage was set
for the second bout to begin!

11
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,333
But before the
fighting could start,

12
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,250
Piccolo made a
shocking discovery

13
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,541
about his mysterious
opponent, Shin.

14
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,958
[PICCOLO thinking]
Why would he be here?!

15
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,583
I promise you'll know soon.

You'll know soon.

18
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,000
[PICCOLO] I'm sorry.

19
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,833
I can't...

20
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,458
[GOHAN] He's quitting?

21
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,875
[NARRATOR] That's right!

22
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,958
To everyone's surprise,
Piccolo withdrew from the match

23
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,541
and left the ring before
a single punch was thrown.

24
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,375
[SHIN] Perhaps he knows more
about me than I thought...

25
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,541
[NARRATOR] Despite this
unusual turn of events,

26
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,166
the competition continued.

27
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,916
To thunderous applause, Gohan's
feisty girlfriend Videl

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,916
and her opponent Spopovitch
entered the stadium.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,583
Even though they differ in size,

30
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,208
Videl is heavily favored
to win the match.

31
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,375
However, this suspicious glance
Shin gave Spopovitch

32
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,750
as they passed seems to
suggest that there's more

33
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,333
to the bald-headed brute
than meets the eye.

34
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,875
What is it that Shin knows
about Spopovitch?

35
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,500
And how will it
affect the outcome

[VIDEL] Ahh...?

327
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,875
[GOHAN gasps]

328
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,666
He's alive!

329
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,083
[SPOPOVITCH grunts]

330
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:40,208
[SPOPOVITCH grunting,
bones creaking]

331
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,666
[VIDEL gasps]

332
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,333
[SPOPIVITCH snarls]

333
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,500
[VIDEL whimpers]

334
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,958
[GOHAN whimpers]

335
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,541
Gah! Guh! Ah!

336
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,250
[SPOPOVITCH grunts]

337
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,083
[ANNOUNCER] I don't know
how to explain this,

338
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,625
but somehow Spopovitch has
pulled himself together!

339
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,125
[SPOPOVITCH chuckles]

340
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,875
Who is... this guy?!

341
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:23,208
[SPOPOVITCH chuckles]

342
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,916
[SPOPOVITCH growls]

343
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,375
[GOHAN gasps]

344
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:38,125
[SPOPOVITCH laughs]

345
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,416
Whoa! Goku was right!
Videl should have forfeited!

346
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,291
Oh, this guy is
definitely not normal!

347
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,666
[SPOPOVITCH yells]

348
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,416
--Rrgh?!
--[ANNOUNCER] Ahh!

349
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,291
Videl has once again out
maneuvered her opponent

350
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,208
by taking to the air!

351
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,875
Yeah! That's it!

352
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:13,291
You just stay up there, Videl,
'til you get your strength back!

353
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,208
[SPOPOVITCH growls]

354
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,291
[chuckling]

355
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:25,333
[SPOPOVITCH growls]

356
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,041
He's flying!

357
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,916
No, he can't?!

358
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,916
[SPOPOVITCH growls]

359
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,375
[NARRATOR] Videl has
no place left to hide

360
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,125
now that Spopovitch
has taken flight.

361
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,958
The bald-headed brute
refuses to give up

362
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,625
and he's determined
to clip Videl's wings

363
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,041
and win the match.

364
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,541
What is the secret to
his unstoppable power?

365
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,416

next Dragon Ball Z!
