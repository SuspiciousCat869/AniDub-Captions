1
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,666
Gohan trained Videl and Goten
in the secret art of flying.

3
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,958
[NARRATOR] After learning to
concentrate her energy,

4
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:31,000
Videl worked on using this
power to lift into the air.

5
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,166
It was a lesson learned
with impressive speed,

6
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,291
as what she lacked in experience

7
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:40,000
was made up for with
strength and determination.

8
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,333
[GOHAN] That's incredible,
Videl!

9
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,041
No one learns how to
fly on their first day!

10
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,875
Is that a fact?

11
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,666
[GOTEN] A birdie! A birdie!

12
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,000
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Vegeta and
Trunks did training of their own

13
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,041
in an enhanced gravity room.

14
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,125
And Vegeta learned a
surprising ability of his son...

15
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,625
[VEGETA] So what
are you going to do?

16
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,708
Guess I'll go... Super!

17
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,291
Huh?!

18
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,041
[TRUNKS yells]

19
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,083
[NARRATOR] The preparations
are in the works,

20
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,250
and the tournament day is near.

21
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,250
[VEGETA] When was it that the
transformation to the legendary

22
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,958
warrior of the Saiyan race

23
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,458
was reduced to a
children's plaything?!

24
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,916
[VIDEL giggles]

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,125
[VIDEL] Look, Gohan!
I'm higher than the trees!

26
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,833
[GOHAN] Yeah!

27
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,750
You soak this stuff up
like a sponge!

28
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,166
[VIDEL laughs]

29
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,250
[GOHAN] Now we can work
on the harder moves!

30
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,375
[laughing continues]

31
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,375
[GOTEN] Hah! Yeah!

32
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,916
[GOTEN laughs]

33
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:13,041
[VIDEL] So... how long does
it take to fly around like that?

34
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,708
Um... Well...

35
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,208
It just depends on
the person, really.

36
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,125
I won't stop
'til I fly like him!

37
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:27,208
Ah? Uhh...
Hold on just a second...

38
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,791
This is so awesome! Yeaah!

39
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,791
[GOTEN laughs]

40
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,458
[GOTEN laughs]

41
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,791
[GOTEN] Whoa!

42
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,250
Hey, bro... Try to slow it
down while Videl's here,

43
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,958
--could ya?
--But how come?

44
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,958
Just do it for me, okay?!

45
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,916
[VIDEL] Problem?

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,791
No! Just gave him
a little advice!

47
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,333
[VIDEL sighs]

48
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,791
It's break time...

49
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,791
[VIDEL] Listen...

50
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,875
I'd rather you don't tell
my dad about these lessons.

51
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,666
I want it to be a surprise
at the tournament, okay?

52
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,125
Sure! Don't worry.

53
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,291
I never run into him!

54
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,000
And that's for good reason!

55
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,166
If he knew I was hanging out
at a boy's house...

56
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,375
Well, I know exactly
what he would say...

57
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:31,291
I forbid it! You find a boy
who's stronger than I am

58
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,416
and then maybe I'll consider!
I mean, maybe I'll consider...

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,208
He says it 'cause he knows
there aren't any boys like that.

60
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:43,375
I mean, he saved the
whole world with his strength.

61
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,791
You're a pretty tough
guy, Gohan.

62
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,958
But you can hardly say
something like that!

63
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,583
[GOHAN laughs]

64
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,083
Videl...

65
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,083
Has your dad ever let you have
practice matches with him?

66
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,166
Come on, are you kidding?
He's the World Champion!

67
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,208
He'd tear me apart!

68
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,083
Dad doesn't even let me
watch him train now!

69
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,583
It's all a secret.

70
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,541
[GOHAN laughs]

71
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,041
[thinking] Yeah, no wonder.

72
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,166
He doesn't want Videl to know
she's stronger than he is!

73
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,583
So, um...

74
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,583
In the extremely unlikely
chance that someone, say,

75
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,000
beats your father...

76
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,250
You think you'd freak out?

77
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,916
I wish he'd lose!

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,083
This fame has gone
to Dad's head!

79
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,625
I know mom's been
gone for a while...

80
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,416
but that doesn't mean he
can go flouncing everywhere

81
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,166
with these silly women!

82
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,750
If he got beat,
they'd all disappear!

83
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,208
[GOHAN laughs]

84
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,458
[thinking] Perfect!

85
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,250
Now I can beat her dad
without feeling guilty!

86
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,625
[VIDEL] But unfortunately
that'll never happen.

87
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,333
My Dad's too strong
for his own good.

88
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,708
Now I've got a question:

89
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,041
Who taught you
these martial arts?

90
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,875
Well... First someone named
Piccolo and then my dad...

91
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,666
So, if your dad knows a
few fighting techniques

92
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,750
how come you've never
introduced him to me?

93
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,416
--My dad's not with us.
--But he's gonna be soon!

94
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,583
The lady's bringing him
back from the dead,

95
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,541
so he can play at
the big tournament!

96
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:20,166
What? What's back from
the dead? And what lady?

97
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,791
What do you mean?

98
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,541
Clamp it, Goten!

99
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,500
You're not supposed to
talk about that!

100
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,916
[GOTEN gasps]

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,875
Oh! I get it! Your
parents are now divorced!

102
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,291
And he's with a new woman!

103
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,583
And she's bringing
him to the tournament

104
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,750
so he can fight and win money!

105
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,958
Is that right?

106
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,458
[GOHAN] Hm?

107
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,791
[VIDEL] Oh yeah...

108
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,625
Seems we both have trouble
with parents. Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,083
I... guess...

110
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,750
All the more reason
we have to work together!

111
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,125
[MR. SATAN] Hey, you!
Servant guy!

112
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,916
Has Videl come in yet?!

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,750
[SERVANT] No sir.
The Mistress is still out.

114
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,541
She said she had errands to run.

115
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,875
[MR. SATAN growls]

116
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,208
[MR. SATAN] Errands my foot!

117
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:11,083
She's probably with
a boy right now!

118
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,708
[NARRATOR] The days roll on, and
Videl's long training sessions

119
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,833
are starting to pay off.

--[GOTEN yells]
--[VIDEL] Oh!

121
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,375
Sorry about that, Goten!

123
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,833
[thinking] Videl is really
something special.

124
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,583
She's nearly mastered flying
after only ten days of practice!

125
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,875
Guess that does it, Videl!
You've graduated flying school!

126
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,541
Thanks a lot, Gohan.

127
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,083
Now I can go home and
finish off my training

128
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,541
in time for the tournament.

129
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,250
Yeah, me too...

130
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,916
Well, I'm off.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,458
Hey, wow!

132
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,625
I bet I can fly home this way!

133
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,250
Yup.

134
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,708
Goodbye, boys! I'll
see you at the big match!

Finally, she's gone!

[GOHAN] Hey...
She's not so bad...

139
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,375
But yeah... Now that
it's just the two of us,

140
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,083
we can start our real
training sessions together!

[YAMCHA] Me? Nah,
I'd just embarrass myself.

goes for you kids too...

212

I think we should all agree

213
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,875
to not turn into Super
Saiyans during the fights.

guys transform,

from the broadcasts
of the Cell Games!

And after that! Well...

220
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,375
The journalists would
get all your names

off of the entry forms and--

all over my front yard!

what I have to deal with

It's a real mess!

see the problem.

you behave yourself?

Fine... It's settled...

There'll be no Super Saiyan
transformations

in the battles...

231

Of course, I'll still
have the advantage.

with us, Dad!

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,541
Oh, sweetheart...
I've missed you...

321
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,208
I've missed you, ChiChi.

322
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,166
Huh?

323
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,375
[GOTEN] Oh!

324
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,875
Goten, it's okay.

325
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,416
Hey!

326
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,041
I think there's a little ME
hiding behind your leg, ChiChi!

327
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,666
I'm Goten.

328
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,333
[OX-KING chuckles]

329
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,208
[GOKU] And I'm Goku.

330
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,666
Hi!

331
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,958
--Daddy!
--Hey!

332
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,708
Whoa, li'l guy!

333
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,541
You're a strong one, aren't you?

334
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,833
[GOKU laughs,
GOTEN chuckles]

335
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,375
[GOKU &amp; GOTEN laugh]

336
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,375
[GOKU] Here you go!
You want to be an airplane?

337
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,125
[GOTEN] Yeah!

338
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:30,750
[GOKU &amp; GOTEN laugh]

339
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,708
Listen up, Goku.

340
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,625
Remember that you only
have twenty-four hours.

341
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,500
That's all I can do.

342
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,666
[GOKU] Mm-hmm.

343
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,375
Yeah, I know.

344
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,791
--[BABA] I'll see you then.
--[GOKU] Alright.

345
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,291
Thank you, Baba!

346
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,333
Hey! I think we should move
on to the registration desk

347
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,208
before it closes.

348
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,416
[RECEPTIONIST A] Sorry,
what was that name again?

349
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,791
[GOHAN] The Great Saiyaman!

350
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,500
Great... Saiyaman?

351
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,625
That's right!

352
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,458
Huh? Who is that?

353
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,166
[GOHAN] It's my super
hero name! Cool, huh?

354
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,625
Sure! I guess so!

355
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,333
[GOKU laughs]

356
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,750
Next, please!

357
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,541
Ah... Yes...

358
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,125
Another for the junior division!

359
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,250
[TRUNKS gasps]

360
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,625
What's that mean?!

361
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,333
It's for everyone
under 15 years old!

362
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,708
Oh, that's great.

363
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,375
They're sticking us with
all the little kids, Goten!

364
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,125
Huh?!

365
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,958
They've changed it from
the old tournaments.

366
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,666
What a good idea!

367
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,791
Thanks for the offer, man, but
we'll take the adult section!

368
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,375
I'm sorry, but I
can't do that!

369
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,583
There's rules!

370
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,458
But that's boring!

371
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,458
[KRILLIN laughs]

372
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,375
Your attention please!

373
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,583
All competitors come
to the waiting area!

374
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,208
This is your last call!

375
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:59,083
Now, good luck, Goku
and Gohan and Goten!

376
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,791
I want you boys to do
the best that you can!

377
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,375
Yes!

378
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,791
Don't worry, ChiChi, I'm sure
one of us is gonna win!

379
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,958
[thinking] It's gonna be
great to see Dad fight again!

380
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,875
See you in the finals!

381
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,583
I'll be there!

382
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,541
Don't forget to cheer
for your Daddy, okay?

383
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,000
[MARON] Okay!

384
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,500
[VEGETA] Hmph.

385
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,833
Buh-bye, Mom!

386
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,375
[CHICHI] Bye!

387
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,750
Be careful, okay?

388
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,208
Break a leg!

389
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,083
[NARRATOR]
After all these years,

390
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,583
Goku is back in the
land of the living.

391
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,541
The Z Fighters reassemble,

392
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:49,041
and the World Martial Arts
Tournament is set to begin.
