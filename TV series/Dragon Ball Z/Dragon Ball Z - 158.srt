00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,291
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,791
Cell tested his might
against Vegeta,

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,375
the Super Saiyan Prince.

4
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,500
Composed partly by cells from
all of the greatest warriors

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,000
in the Universe,

6
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,791
Cell already knew Vegeta's
fighting techniques by heart.

7
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,875
And, suddenly, Vegeta found
himself on the other end

8
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,791
of a Gallic Gun blast.

9
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,916
An attack that he had
invented himself, long ago.

[CELL gasps]

13
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,541
[NARRATOR] But when
the dust settled,

14
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,000
it was Vegeta who proved
himself to be the stronger one.

15

[CELL yells]

16
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,791
[NARRATOR]
Having trained for a day

17
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,375
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

18
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,083
Vegeta had transcended
the level of Super Saiyan

19
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,416
and achieved a new level
of speed and strength

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,208
that not even Cell
was any match for.

21
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,791
Do you understand
how fruitless this is?

22
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,541
I've been allowing you to
deceive yourself, that's all!

23
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,333
You never had a chance to win!

24
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,750
If by some miracle
you managed to get by me,

25
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,458
Trunks would've
finished you off!

26
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,666
Face it, Cell, you
took a gamble and you lost!

27
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,166
[CELL yells]

28
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,583
[NARRATOR] Could this
really be the end of Cell?

29
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,416
Find out today
on Dragon Ball Z!

30
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:58,083
Man! Cell's just
dying to find 18!

31
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,833
[KRILLIN] Somehow,
I've got to find her first

32
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,541
and use this on her!

33
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,708
Once she's immobilized,
I'll blast her!

34
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,250
Oh, man! What a job...

35
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,666
[KRILLIN] Surely she's
not still on this island?

36
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,291
She might be though!
Girls are funny.

[KRILLIN] Boy o'boy!
Cell doesn't sound like

39
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,875
he's having a very good
time down there...

This can't be!

[CELL yells]

44
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,375
[KRILLIN] Holy cow! I wouldn't
want to be Vegeta right now!

45
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,416
Man! Scary!

Not fair...

51
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,875
If only I could
complete my evolution!

52
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,416
[CELL] Someone like
Vegeta would be nothing!

53
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,583
Fool! He thinks he knows power!

54
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,250
Huh...?

55
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,833
[VEGETA] I couldn't
help overhearing

56
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,916
your annoying babbling!

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,333
Yes! Funny! But I thought
I heard you say that I'm a fool

58
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,791
who doesn't know
what real power is!

59
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,791
That's right! You have no idea!

60
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,541
Your power is substantial,
I'm not denying that!

61
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,958
But if I absorbed
Android 18, you would

62
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,291
quickly discover that
you had serious limitations!

63
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,333
And then you would be a nobody!

My gosh!

73
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,750
Was Vegeta just pretending
to be weak when he fought me?

74
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:13,416
No. He is not the type
that would hold back.

75
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,708
You were stronger then.
Now he is the strongest.

76
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,833
[ANDROID 18] But how could
he gain that much strength

77
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,291

I have to use this thing!

learned on the battlefield

to do this, and fast!

Fighting you in this state
is just a waste of my time!

Do you honestly believe that
you could challenge my powers

if I allowed you to

It sounds interesting!

No! Father! You can't!

after he absorbs you.

don't have anyway to test it!

I know your Saiyan blood
is boiling for a challenge!

Allow me to absorb the android!

can resume where we left off!

Just a little bit closer
and this thing should work!

do it! I'm in range! This is it!

think this over a bit first!

going to immobilize her

she can be absorbed by Cell!

00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,875
And she wouldn't even
be able to defend herself!

162
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,000
[thinking] I can't
let that happen!

163
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,125
I'm going to have to
charge over there

164
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,333
and blast her when
I push the button!

165
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,958
The big guy's
not going to like it,

166
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,125
but he looks like
he's pretty banged up!

167
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,291
[thinking] Why can't I stop 
thinking about that kiss?

168
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,125
[thinking] Come on, Krillin!
Snap out of it!

169
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,833
She's an android,
for goodness sake!

170
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,208
She's not even a real person!

171
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,625
[KRILLIN thinking]
On the other hand,

172
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,333
she's standing right over there!

173
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,708
Doesn't that make her real?
And she looks scared...

174
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,208
She has to be real!
She's so beautiful...

175
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,208
[thinking] There I go again!
What's wrong with me?!

176
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,416
I can't stop thinking about her!

177
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,250
Could I be in love
with an android...?

178
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,708
[KRILLIN thinking] No!
That's impossible! Isn't it?

179
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,458
Can a man fall in love
with an android?

180
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,750
Ugh! It doesn't matter anyway!
Everyone's counting on you!

181
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,125
You have to push
the button, Krillin!

182
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,250
I can't!

183
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,583
You have to!

184
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,083
I can't!

185
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,750
You have to!

186
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,708
I can't!

187
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,958
Aaahhh...

188
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,750
[GOKU laughs]

189
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,166
[GOHAN laughs]

190
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,083
[GOKU] Whew! Pretty toasty, huh?

191
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,375
[GOHAN] Yeah! It feels
like one of Mom's baths!

192
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,125
Aahh...

193
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,750
Are you worried, Dad?
About Krillin and the others?

194
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,791
I feel kind of guilty taking
this relaxing bath

195
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,708
when we could be
out there training!

196
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,958
I know, Son! But
you have to understand,

197
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,500
sometimes rest is as
important as training!

198
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,708
Maybe even more important!

199
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,041
[GOHAN] It is?

200
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,166
[GOKU] Sure it is! If we
give our muscles a chance

201
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,125
to rest and build back up, we
can get a lot more out of them

202
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,458
than if we just kept
training the whole time!

203
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:50,500
[GOHAN] So... if we rest,
we can train even harder!

204
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,333
[GOKU] Exactly! Now
you've got it, Gohan!

205
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:57,125
So no more wasting your
energy on feeling guilty! Deal?

206
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,833
Deal! But you have
to promise not to give me

207
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:04,166
any special treatment just
because I'm your son! Okay?

208
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,250
[GOKU] Okay!

209
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,125
[GOKU laughs]

210
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,375
[GOHAN] Hey! No fair!

211
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,125
[GOKU giggles,
GOHAN yells]

212
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,541
Alright, Dad!

213
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,666
You asked for it!

214
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:19,125
[BOTH laughing]

215
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,500
[GOHAN] Give it up, Dad!
You're mine!

216
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,166
[GOKU] No way! Here comes the
Super Saiyan Splash Attack!

217
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,416
[BOTH laugh]

218
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,791
[GOHAN] No! I give up!
I give up!

219
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,416
[laughing continues]

220
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,583
[thinking] C'mon, Krillin!

221
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,208
You might not get another
chance like this! Don't blow it!

222
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,291
[ANDROID 16] Please, 18.
You must go.

223
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,666
[KRILLIN] You can't let
your personal feelings

224
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,416
cloud your judgement!

225
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,458
Good luck...

226
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,125
[KRILLIN thinking] Oh, man!
That was cloudy!

227
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,208
That was very cloudy!

228
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,791
C'mon Krillin! Get rid
of all those clouds!

229
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,541
Very poor visibility!

230
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,166
See ya!

231
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,208
[thinking] Don't let your
feelings cloud your judgement!

232
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,750
[thinking] What am I doing?
I can't do this!

233
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,500
[thinking] I can't
let her go! The others!

234
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:35,250
[thinking] They're all counting
on me! I can't let them down!

235
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,541
[thinking] Krillin! Hold on!

236
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,916
You can do it!

237
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,958
She's just an android!

238
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:52,333
[VOICES echoing]

239
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,333
[KRILLIN thinking]
I can't do it...

240
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,791
I love her...

241
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,666
[BOTH gasp]

242
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,291
Hey, it's you...

[ANDROID 18 gasps]

244

[ANDROID 18 thinking] Oh, no!

245
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,166
That's an Emergency
Suspension Controller!

246
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,166
How did that little guy
get a hold of one of those?

247
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,041
Uhhh... He looks mad.

248
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,125
[CELL chuckles]

249
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,125
[CELL] Your thirst for
the ultimate challenge

250
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,083
may very well lead
you to your doom!

251
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,833
But you will seek it anyway,
won't you, Super Saiyan!

252
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:46,041
I have ascended beyond
the level of Super Saiyan!

253
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:52,541
Fascinating! Yes, this
will be a rare match indeed!

254
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,625
If you don't run away.

255
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,750
Now you're dreaming.

256
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,416
[TRUNKS] Huh?

257
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,750
So be it! You've managed
to arouse my curiosity!

258
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,958
Now go and absorb your android!

259
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,125
Oh, no!

260
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,875
[VEGETA] Hopefully
the next time I see you,

261
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,583
you won't be in such
a pitiful state!

262
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,250
It's embarrassing!

263
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,291
Please, no! Father!

264
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,166
That's your weak point!

265
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,625
Can't you see?

266
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,583
Cell's exploiting
your only weakness!

267
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,666
Shut up, you fool!

268
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,250
Mind your own business!

269
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,208
I don't remember asking you
for your opinion on the matter!

270
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,333
How can you
understand my power?!

271
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,958
I've gone beyond
the Super Saiyan!

272
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,041
Now go!

273
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,666
Get out of here
before I change my mind!

274
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,958
[CELL] As you wish!

275
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,833

Look, if Cell finds you,
then we're all doomed!

Please, go!

289
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,875
You can sneak off of to the
other side of the island!

Just fly low...

Why are you doing this?

00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,250
It ends here!

320
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,166
[CELL] Rrrrgh! Curse you!

321
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,583
Hey, Vegeta! Look!

322
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,291
I thought we had an agreement!

323
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:13,333
Huh? It can't be!

324
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,875
[thinking] Android 18!
She's here!

325
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,875
This is too good to be true!

326
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,000
Huh?

327
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,625
Oh, no!

328
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:30,708
The Android!

329
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,458
She's here!

330
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,083
[NARRATOR] Unaware that she
has been discovered by Cell,

331
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,458
Android 18 stands
transfixed before Krillin,

332
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,416
both wondering
who will draw first

333
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,291
in this
emotional showdown.

334
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,333
The pressure is on Krillin to
put an end to this ordeal.

335
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,833
But the real danger lies above!

336
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,666
Hovering ominously with
the darkest of intentions,

337
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,291
and the blackest of desires.
