1
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,625
Goku,
beaten and weary,

3
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,791
gave Krillin all of
his remaining energy

4
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,791
to fuel an attack
on the evil Vegeta.

5
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:27,291
[VEGETA screaming]

6
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,125
[NARRATOR] But instead
of defeating him,

7
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:32,458
it only sent the Saiyan
into a furious rage...

8
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,208
[VEGETA yelling]

9
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,375
[NARRATOR] As the Earth
crumbled around him,

10
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,125
Vegeta's power
seemed unstoppable.

11
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,583
His victory
was certain,

12
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,583
until he made an
unsettling discovery

13
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,833
about the
young Gohan.

14
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:01,041
It can't be!
He... He has a tail!

15
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,375
Which way?

16
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,916
Let's see, turn to
the left a little bit...

17
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,791
[CHICHI] Do you see anything?
Are we almost there?

18
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:26,041
[KORIN] Keep your shirt
on, I'm looking...

19
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,541
Hey! I think
I see it!

20
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,583
That's the island where Goku
and the others are fighting!

21
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,916
[CHICHI] Can you tell
if they're alright?

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,083
My husband? My son?
How are they? Tell me!

23
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,125
Please...
stop... choking...

24
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,125
I'll choke all nine
lives out of you

25
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,458
[CHICHI] unless you answer me!
[KORIN] I... don't... know!

26
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,916
You kids be good or we'll
have to pull this thing over...

27
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,416
[thinking] Goku, I can
only hope that you've

28
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,958
put an end to
this by now.

29
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,916
You're the only
chance this world has

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,125
against that
monster...

31
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,208
Gohan's tail...
I forgot about that...

32
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,833
It must have
grown back...

33
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,125
[VEGETA] The Blutz Waves!

34
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:34,000
I can't allow this brat
to transform! Not today!

35
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:39,041
Haah...

36
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,500
[YAJIROBE]
Leave him alone!

37
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,750
[VEGETA] What?

38
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,166
[YAJIROBE yelling]

39
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,208
[VEGETA screaming]

40
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,583
[VEGETA] You cut
through my armor!

41
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:59,416
[VEGETA shouting]

42
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:13,208
[YAJIROBE laughing]

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,250
[laughing continues]

44
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,208
I got him! I got him!
I got him! I got him!

45
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,000
I beat you, dirtbag!
I can see it now...

46
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,666
Earth's greatest threat
brought down by Yajirobe!

47
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,666
Oh, yeah! Took him down!

48
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,583
You should learn not
to mess with the best!

49
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,041
You can't
handle it!

50
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,416
[YAJIROBE chuckling]

51
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,083
What was that, tubby?

52
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,958
[YAJIROBE] Uh...
Wait a minute!

53
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,375
Hey, hold on!
I was...

54
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:10,083
I was just kidding about
the whole dirtbag thing!

55
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,791
You really thought I was
trying to hurt you, didn't you?

56
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,041
That's funny! I was just
messing around with you!

57
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,625
[YAJIROBE] No, wait! Listen!
I don't think you understand!

58
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,333
That... hurt...

59
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,166
[KRILLIN] Oh, no!

60
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,541
How dare you! No one
attacks me on my blind side

61
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,250
and gets away
with it! No one!

62
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:05,625
[VEGETA] Don't... you... ever...
do... that... again!

63
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,500
Yajirobe...

64
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:16,416
[GOKU thinking] Gohan...
Gohan, can you hear me? Gohan!

65
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,041
[GOHAN] Uh... Hello?

66
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,458
[GOKU thinking]
Gohan, listen to me!

67
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,666
Daddy...?

68
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,875
[GOKU thinking] Look at the
power ball in the sky, Gohan...

69
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:40,250
But, I don't understand...
Dad, where are you?

70
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,458
[GOKU thinking] I'm not far
away, but I need your help.

71
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:47,750
You can help me by staring
up at that light in the sky.

72
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,833
[GOKU thinking]
That's it, Gohan...

73
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,958
Don't turn away from it...

74
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,791
The boy's tail!
I've got to stop him!

75
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,041
[VEGETA] It's too late!

76
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,333
[VEGETA] No!
Stop changing! Stop it!

77
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,541
He's transforming
into the ape!

78
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,125
[thinking] Yes, Gohan!
You can do it!

79
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,833
Gohan!
He's changing!

80
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,041
That fake moon
made him transform!

81
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,750
The tail! I've got
to cut off his tail

82
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,875
before he goes
completely berserk!

83
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,416
Right now!

84
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,166
[APE GOHAN roaring]

85
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,083
[VEGETA grunting]

86
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:57,125
[roaring continues]

87
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:18,208
[APE GOHAN howling]

88
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,125
Gohan...

89
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,541
He's... He's
out of control!

90
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,583
Gohan's just a mindless,
raging beast now!

91
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,708
It's just like when
Goku used to change!

92
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,875
He doesn't
remember anything!

93
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,541
As long as he's like that, he's
just as dangerous as Vegeta!

94
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,791
Gohan, stop it!

95
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,750
Oh man, I've just got to
think of some way

96
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,291
to get through to him!

97
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:57,333
But how? When Goku
was like this,

98
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,458
he didn't
recognize any of us!

99
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,916
[YAJIROBE] Help!
Somebody please help me!

100
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,958
[KRILLIN] Gohan! Wait!
We're your friends!

101
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,958
[GOKU thinking]
Gohan! Stop!

102
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,750
No! Gohan!

103
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,125
What happened?

104
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:40,666
[KRILLIN] Hey! Gohan!
Get the other guy!

105
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,833
Hurry! He's getting away!

106
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,208
Hey, don't
get him excited!

107
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,625
I'm... I'm trapped!

108
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,000
Now!

109
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,000
[APE GOHAN roaring]

110
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,208
I'm glad
I'm not him!

111
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,166
Gohan!
Smash that guy now!

112
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,583
Somehow, Goku must
have gotten through

113
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,166
to Gohan
telepathically...

114
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,083
Finish him, Gohan!
It's all up to you, now!

115
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,166
My moon's going to shine
for at least another hour,

116
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,416
and there's no way I can
keep outrunning him!

117
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,791
I've got to cut
off that tail!

118
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,333
Man, he's tough!
He punched Gohan's head in!

119
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:18,083
This guy's insane!
Can't anybody stop him?

120
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:58,291
Haaa!

121
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,250
Okay, fur-ball...

122
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,583
Take this!

123
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,250
Wait! I can't
get around him!

124
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,750
[VEGETA screaming]

125
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,208
Hey! What's happening?

126
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:09,333
[GOHAN snoring,
VEGETA whimpering]

127
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,541
He... He got him!

128
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,291
[snoring continues]

129
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,041
Gohan beat him?

130
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,166
Spoke too soon...

131
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:35,125
[VEGETA grunting]

132
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,916
[INVESTIGATOR 1] Let's get
these two loaded in the truck.

133
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,208
I want a team to
take them apart

134
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,708
and examine
them thoroughly

135
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,416
before we crate them up and
claim that they don't exist.

136
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,833
[electronic beeping]

137
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,500
[INVESTIGATOR 2] Whoa...
Did you hear that?

138
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,958
Aahh!

139
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,125
[KRILLIN]
What is that thing?

140
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,125
What's it doing?

141
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,458
[VEGETA] Yes! It's here!

142
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,791
Ha! Those fools! They haven't
seen the last of me...

143
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:26,708
I'm Vegeta! The strongest
Saiyan in the universe...

144
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,375
I'm Invincible!

145
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:36,291
It-It must be his space
ship! I've gotta stop him.

146
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,000
[VEGETA]
Almost... There...

147
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,583
Krillin! Use my
sword! Hurry up!

148
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,375
[thinking] The sword...

149
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,833
Yeah, this thing cut
through his armor!

150
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,916
It might just
come in handy...

151
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,541
[KRILLIN]
Hey, Saiyan!

152
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,666
[KRILLIN] You think you can
just slither out of here

153
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,166
after what you've
done? Well...

154
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,791
Think again!

155
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,666
No... No! You can't
do this to me!

156
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,833
[KING KAI] Yes! They've
stopped those Saiyans!

157
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,708
I'm so relieved...

158
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,000
Goku and his friends
did a good job!

159
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,250
They stood together
and saved their planet...

160
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,291
He's really
come a long way!

161
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:03,208
Goku did things I didn't
think he was capable of!

162
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,708
Amazing!

163
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,750
But, I... I sense that
there's an even greater evil

164
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,375
headed their way...

165
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,250
[KING KAI] These Saiyans
are only the beginning...

166
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:20,416
[KRILLIN] Urryaaughh!

167
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,875
[GOKU] Stop!

168
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,833
[GOKU] Don't do it!

169
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,125
[KRILLIN]
Goku? Is that you?

170
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,541
We've... We have got
to stop this guy

171
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,541
while we
have the chance!

172
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,125
He's... He's pure evil...

173
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:41,791
No! Listen...
Just let him go, Krillin...

174
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:48,541
Show him what it means
to be merciful...

175
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,583
Merciful?!
But... Goku, he's--

176
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,875
[GOKU] I know what you
must be thinking, Krillin,

177
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,375
but believe me.
I know what I'm doing...

178
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,166
But this is the guy
that threatened

179
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,000
all of the people
here on Earth!

180
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,875
Surely he'll try to come
back and destroy us again!

181
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,625
I just don't think it's a
good idea to let him escape

182
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,041
now that we have a chance
to stop him for good!

183
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,208
[GOKU] By doing this,
we're showing him

184
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,750
that there is another
way, a better way!

185
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,916
[KRILLIN] Goku, I don't think
this is the kind of guy

186
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,958
that can learn a
lesson like that!

187
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,708
He'll just think we're weak! 
It won't change him at all.

188
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,166
[GOKU] Don't be so sure
about that, Krillin.

189
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,416
It wouldn't be the first time
something like that happened.

190
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,000
Think about it...

191
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,958
When Piccolo
first came to us,

192
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,583
he was just as evil
as his father had been.

193
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,625
He nearly destroyed not only
me, but the entire planet!

194
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,791
And now?

195
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,583
And now, he's one of us!

196
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:53,583
[GOKU] Right! And if someone
as evil as Piccolo can change,

197
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,125
I think anyone can!

198
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,833
[GOKU] Vegeta deserves
to have that same chance!

199
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,750
By showing him that the
people of this planet

200
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,875
have compassion and
can show mercy,

201
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,250
maybe he can learn to
show some of his own.

202
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,458
Piccolo learned, and now he's
not only a powerful ally,

203
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,500
he's also a
good friend.

204
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,791
He even took care of
Gohan while I was gone,

205
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,500
and traded his own life
to protect him. Who knows?

206
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,708
Vegeta might do the same thing
for one of us someday...

207
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,250
[KRILLIN] Rrgh!

208
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,750
[GOKU] Krillin, please! I know
this is the right thing to do!

209
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,000
You've got
to trust me!

210
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,666
But, the Saiyans killed
Yamcha... and Tien...

211
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,291
Chiaotzu... I can't
let him get away!

212
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,833
[GOKU] Don't do it, Krillin!
I know it seems like justice,

213
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,333
but it's not right!

214
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,458
If you strike him down,
it will only show

215
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,333
that we aren't any
better than he is!

216
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:57,208
It means that they've won,
no matter what! Be strong!

217
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,458
[GOKU] Don't forget, Krillin...
I'm a Saiyan, just like he is.

218
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,833
[GOKU] Thanks, Krillin...

219
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,416
That took a lot of
strength and courage...

220
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,166
I'm proud of you...

221
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,375
Goku... I sure hope you're
right about all of this...

222
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,708
I'd hate to think of what
might happen if he comes back

223
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:32,291
to try this again...
But, if he does...

224
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:36,833
We'll be ready for him,
and we'll stop him again!

225
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,625
You bet!

226
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,208
[thinking] I hope Goku
knows what he's doing.

227
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,791
I sure wouldn't
want for Earth

228
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,625
to have to face
that evil again...

229
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,833
Huh?

230
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,791
When I come back
to this planet...

231
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,250
You're all
going to suffer...

232
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,416
And when you beg
me for mercy...

233
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,708
I'll stare into your eyes as
I crush the life out of you.

234
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:07,750
[KRILLIN growling]

235
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,416
What? Huh?

236
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,833
[NARRATOR] After a long
and grueling battle,

237
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,166
Vegeta has finally
been defeated.

238
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,166
But the price of
victory was high...

239
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,375
Paid with the lives of Yamcha,
Tien, Chiaotzu and Piccolo.

240
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,541
Thus, one chapter in the
great adventure has ended,

241
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,541
and another is
about to begin,

242
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,375
as Goku and the others
must find a way

243
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,583
to bring their
friends back to life.

244
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,458
New dangers and powerful
new villains await,

245
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,125
as the story continues...

246
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,458
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
