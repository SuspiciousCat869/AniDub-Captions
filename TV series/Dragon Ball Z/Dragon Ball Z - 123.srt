[GOKU] Be right back!

00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,625
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,625
a mysterious boy
named Trunks

4
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,791
arrived from the
future with a warning:

5
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,750
An unprecedented force
of evil is on its way!

6
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,625
[TRUNKS] ...morning of
May 12th at 10AM...

7
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,375
A horribly destructive duo
will show up on an island

8
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,708
nine miles southwest
of South City.

9
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,791
What's the deal?
Are they aliens?

10
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,166
[TRUNKS] No.

11
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,708
They're both androids
created right here on Earth.

12
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,250
There's no rhyme or
reason to what they do.

13
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,041
They're machines
of destruction.

14
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,166
Man-eaters!

15
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,625
It's mind-boggling
how strong they are.

16
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,500
[NARRATOR] And while Trunks bid
a final heartfelt farewell

17
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,208
to his past...

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,333
[TRUNKS] Father...

19
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,333
I'm glad I got to see you.

20
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,666
Farewell, young Mother.

21
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,375
May the good spirits
keep you safe.

22
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,250
[NARRATOR] The fate of
the world once again rests

23
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,583
on the shoulders of
its greatest champion.

24
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,166
[VEGETA growls]

25
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,208
[NARRATOR] But is even
Goku's strength enough

26
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,166
to change the course of history?

27
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,125
Stay tuned!

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,291
[GOKU] Sorry, guys.

29
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,916
I guess all of this trouble
must have followed me

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,541
home from Namek.

31
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,250
Tell me, Kakarot,

32
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,208
Exactly how did you
escape from Namek anyway?

33
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,958
Oh yeah, that's right.

34
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,958
Frieza's ship was
wrecked wasn't it?

35
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,583
King Kai told us there was no
way you could have survived

36
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,916
when Namek exploded.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,750
We thought you were a goner.

38
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,333
How did you get away?

39
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,000
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

40
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,333
[thinking]
But there were moments

41
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,125
where I didn't
think I'd make it...

42

00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:28,458
No! Wait! I take it back!
You're not a piece of junk!

00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,416
Oh nooo!

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,250
[GOKU screams]

51
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,166
[KRILLIN] So Frieza's ship
wouldn't work at all?

52
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,541
Wow, Goku! I bet you
must've been really scared.

53
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,291
Yeah, but it's a
good thing for me

54
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,041
I was able to keep a
clear head through it all.

55
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,458
Enough with the
suspense already!

56
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,833
Get on with the blasted story!

57
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,500
All right! Where was I...?

58
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:02,000
Hmm... Planet Namek was
just about to blow...

59
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,083
[GOKU] Come on,
you piece of junk!

60
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,208
Go! Go! Go!

61
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,833
[GOKU] I had almost
given up hope.

62
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,250
But then, at the last minute,

63
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,833
I caught a glimpse of
another space ship!

64
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,125
[VEGETA] Another ship?!

65
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,291
Ahh, it must have belonged
to the Ginyu Force!

66
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,625
[GOKU] Whoever it belonged to,

67
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,541
I knew it was my only
chance, so I went for it!

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,166
[GOKU] There was no time
for me to plot a course,

69
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,625
so I just fired up the
engines and punched it!

70
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,041
[GOKU] I made it off of Namek

71
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,250
with just a couple
of seconds to spare!

72
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,291
[GOKU] The only problem was I
had no idea where I was going!

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,083
[GOKU screams]

74
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,208
[GOKU] The next thing I
remember is crash landing

75
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,458
on some strange planet
light years away from Namek.

76

It's my lucky day...

82
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,916
I didn't know that the
circus was in town...

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,375
[ALIENS continue warbling]

84
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,958
[GOKU] It turns out I'd landed
on the Planet Yardrat,

85
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,375
and the inhabitants
were really friendly!

86
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,625
They were kind enough to
nurse me back to health,

87
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,333
and they even
repaired my spaceship!

88
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,666
So once I was strong enough
to make the journey,

89
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,875
I packed up and headed home!

90
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,125
That may explain where you've
been for all of this time,

91
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,000
but there's still a few
things I'd like to know.

92
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,541
For starters...

93
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,708
where in the world did you get
that absurd looking outfit?

94
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,958
[GOKU] It's the latest fashion
on Planet Yardrat

95
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,208
but I guess it does
look a little strange.

96
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,416
But at least it's not pink!

97
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,791
Never mind!

98
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,833
Who cares about your
stupid clothes anyway?!

99
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,666
Now it's pretty obvious
that you've been training!

100
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,416
I want to see what
you've learned!

101
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,291
[GOKU] Hmm...

102
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,833
Now where to begin... Oh yeah!

103
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,166
Alright!

104
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,791
I knew that Goku wouldn't
come back empty handed!

105
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,541
Come on! Show us
some new tricks, Goku!

106
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,583
Alright, let's see if
I can remember it now!

107
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,458
How did it go again...?

108
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,333
It's not an easy trick to do...

109
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:48,375
I like to call it,
"The Instant Transmission!"

110
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,875
[ALL] The instant
what?!

Hey! Come on.
Let's see it!

112
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,666
Okay. Watch this!

113
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,000
Alright, to begin with,
I need to imagine a person.

114
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,791
A person far away...
Now who should it be?

115
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,375
Someone with a whole lot of
life energy would be good!

116
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:10,000
Now... who's it gonna be...?

117
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,041

118
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,500
Ready?

Now don't you think we ought to
talk about some other things...

like androids?

Androids?! Gosh! I guess I
almost forgot about them.

[ALLL gasp]

On May 12th, three
years from now,

on an island, 9 miles
southwest of South City

So... What you're saying is we
should keep that day open, huh?

This one could get
a little bit rough.

So you'll have to decide
if you're in or you're out!

When the time comes,

you won't be able to hide
behind those sunglasses!

Hey, hold on. I just
had an great idea...

I know a way we can save
the Earth and not fight!

Get rid of Dr. Gero!

[ALL gasping]

171
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,125
Here's what I think
we should do:

172
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,958
Use the Dragon Balls to
summon the Dragon,

173
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,791
He'll tell us where
the doctor is.

174
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,625
We take out the doctor and
all of our problems are solved!

175

Ya get it?

176
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,500
That's great! In fact, Bulma,

177

I'm surprised I didn't think
of that before you did!

I mean who wants to wait
around for three years anyway?

00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,041
Do you want our only
son to grow up to be

319
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,125
a muscle bound thug
Without a brain?!

320
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,333
Hmph! You can go,
but Gohan stays here!

321
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,750
ChiChi... We need
Gohan for this battle.

322
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,166
It's important!

323
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,083
It's only this one time...

324
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,833
Then he can spend
the rest of his life

325
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,458
with his nose in the books!

326
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,416
Hm?

327

[CHICHI growls]

328
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,833
I don't want our son growing
up without an education

329
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,625
the way his father did!
Is that so wrong?!

330
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,708
Honestly, all the pain and
torment I go through

331
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,916
just because I want the
best for my little boy...

332
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Boy I never knew you felt so
strongly about it ChiChi.

333
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,291
But look, Gohan wants to go!

336
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:56,041
Absolutely not! No
way! And that's final!

337
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,166
But... are you trying to
tell me that Gohan's studies

338
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,166
are more important
than saving the Earth?

339
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,750
That's right, mister!

340
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,625
There's nothing more important
than Gohan's studies right now!

341
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,916
If Gohan takes three
years off, he'll fall behind!

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,291
Aw relax, ChiChi.

[GOKU gasps]

345

[GOKU] Oh no, what have I done?!

346
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,083
I've been in space so long,
I don't know my own strength!

347
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,458
There...

348
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,708
I guess I'm not used to the
gravity on Earth yet, ChiChi!

349
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,875
Listen, Goku. I'll let
Gohan train with you

350
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,791
but I want him to
try and study too.

351
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,291
I don't think that's
unreasonable.

352
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,125
I mean a boy his age can't
spend everyday rough housing.

353
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,541
He needs an education and I
want to make sure he gets one.

354
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,125
Have I made myself clear?!

355
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,666
That's one battle
Goku will never win.
