on Dragon Ball Z,

The battle between
Cell and Gohan raged on.

00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,166
And Gohan demonstrated
that his powers

4
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,625
had transcended those
of any other Super Saiyan.

00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,541
Cell was forced to reveal
the full extent of his power.

14
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,541
Until now, the evil android
had been holding back,

but against Gohan's
awesome abilities,

16
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,958
he had no choice but
to pull out all the stops.

17

Cell expected to see the
fresh-faced challenger

gifted young Super Saiyan

that flattened Gohan,
but the young fighter

24
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,791
was unphased by his
fearsome foe's attack.

25
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,333
He returned fire with an iron
fist that sent Cell reeling.

Gohan was unstoppable.

With just two punches,

29
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,500
the heroic youth put
Cell's lights out.

30
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,750
[CELL] He only... had two
punches that made contact!

31
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,166
Gohan just won it all!

32
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,125
[NARRATOR] Now Gohan has Cell
right where he wants him.

How could Gohan

177
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,291
have that much
power inside him?!

178
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,125
He released a bigger
Kamehameha Wave than Cell!

179
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,541
He should be exhausted!
What's his secret?!

180
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:37,625
[grunting]

181
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,166
[KRILLIN] Man,
who would have thought

182
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,333
getting rid of Cell
would be such a blast.

183
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,000
[KRILLIN chuckles]

184
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,583
No! Cell is still alive!

185
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,583
There's no way he could be!

186
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:55,458
[KRILLIN] Yeah, that energy wave
swallowed him up completely!

187
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,375
[thinking] It looks
like Piccolo's right.

188
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,083
Gohan might
have slowed him down,

189
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,875
but he is still very much alive.

190

Heh...

192
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,791
[thinking] Gohan's power has
grown far beyond mine.

193
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,250
When were training in
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

194
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,375
I knew he had hidden strengths,

195
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,333
but I never knew he
would ascend to this level...

[GOKU thinking]
Each time we trained,

199
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,583
his energy level increased,

200
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,583
and I saw his
fighting techniques improve.

201
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,291
It wasn't long before
he was as good as me.

[GOKU thinking] Even when I
knew he couldn't take any more

205
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,375
he refused to give up!

206

[GOHAN whimpers]

207
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,583

We practiced for
twenty hours already!

210
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,250
Come on, Gohan I think
it's time for a break.

211
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,125
[GOHAN] Wait, Dad!

212

[GOHAN] Let's keep going!

215
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,791
[GOKU thinking]
Watching Gohan that day,

216
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,541
I realized that there were
hidden depths to his power

217
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,250
I would never
even begin to fathom!

218
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,125
[GOKU thinking]
And that's when I knew!

219
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,708
If anyone was going to
have a chance at beating Cell,

220
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,166
it would be him.

[GOHAN yells]

222
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,458

of you, Gohan.

223
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,166
You've mastered
your powers.

224
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,333
Now go show Cell
what you're made of!

225
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,500
[TIEN] Hey, what's wrong?
What's he waiting for?!

00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,333
No! He's a boy!

227
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,250
There's no way that little
brat can be so strong!

[PICCOLO gasps]

229
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,750
Hey! If he waits too long,
Cell will regenerate himself!

230
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,125
[ALL] Huh?!

231
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,500
Remember, he has
my cells inside him!

232
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,916
Gohan!

233
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,291
You've got to take Cell down
now before he can regenerate!

234
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,125
Take him down now?

235
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,375
No, I think I'll wait.

236
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,541
I'm going to let him
suffer for a little while.

237

Wait? No, Gohan...

238
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,750

out of time, Goku!

from the belly of the beast,
Cell's power is fading fast.

Gohan knows that with
his Super Saiyan strength

297
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,750
he could finish Cell off easily.
But what is he waiting for?!
