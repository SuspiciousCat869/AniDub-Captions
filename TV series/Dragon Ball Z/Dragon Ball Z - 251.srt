00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,083
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,000
Gohan mastered the Z Sword

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,208
and it was time to put the
legendary blade to the test.

4
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,791
[GOKU]
Here it comes!

5
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,583
[NARRATOR]
And who better than Goku

6
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,458
to deliver a solid
block of Katchin Ore,

7
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,916
the hardest known
metal in the Universe.

8
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,625
[NARRATOR] But tragedy
struck and the Z Sword

9
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,208
wasn't able to bear
the strain of being handled

10
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,833
by the mighty
father-son duo.

11
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,208
[NARRATOR]
Impossible but true!

12
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,458
The greatest sword ever
made was in pieces.

13
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,166
[NARRATOR] But mystically
emanating from the sword,

14
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,583
after being trapped inside
of it for untold centuries

15
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,166
was Old Kai, an ancient
ancestor of Supreme Kai,

16
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,250
who claimed to have
the ability to awaken

17
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,583
a person's sleeping powers.

18
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,583
Right!

19
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,083
[OLD KAI mumbles nonsensically]

20
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,791
[NARRATOR]
And, with gusto,

21
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,291
he set out to do
just that for Gohan.

22
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,083
But will it really work?

23
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,791
Meanwhile, Trunks and
Goten had finally mastered

24
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,875
the form for the
Fusion Technique

25
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,750
and they were ready to turn
the concept into reality.

26
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,333
[MARON giggles]

27

[OOLONG]
Stop trying to psyche me out!

28
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,666

30

[OOLONG]
You're using some of that

31
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,750
mystical master stuff
on me, aren't you?

32
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,125
[BULMA]
She's so cute!

33
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,125
[YAMCHA]
Hey, guys.

34
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,958
[ROSHI]
Hmm?

35
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,833
[VIDEL]
What's up, Yamcha?

36
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,541
Well, it's fusion time.

37
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,416
Trunks and Goten have
mastered the form.

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,208
So the boys are ready
to give it a try, huh?

39
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,125
[KRILLIN] Cool!
I say we all go watch.

40
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,125
[BULMA] Yeah, this should
be interesting.

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,500
[MARON] Are Trunks
and Goten one boy, Mommy?

42
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,416
[ANDROID 18]
Not yet, sweetheart.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,916
So, ah, if you could
fuse together with somebody

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,500
and it could be anyone in
the world, who would it be?

45
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,333
I mean, hypothetically.

46
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,666
Gosh, that's a tough one,

47
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,083
but I think I'd pick your
old girlfriend Maron!

48
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,583
[laughs]

49
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,166
Right on! Bald and
beautiful! So deadly!

50
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,666
Oh, dear!

51
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,500
What are we going to call our
newly combined son, Bulma?

52
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,833
Huh?

53
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,708
Let's see. Goten and Trunks.
What about Trunkten?

54
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,125
Hm. That's weird.

55
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,791
Maybe something like
Gotrunks would be better.

56
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,291
Hey! Why are you
racking your brain?

57
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,375
The fusion's only temporary.

58
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,958
It only lasts about
thirty minutes or so.

59
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,833
True. But still,
a name would be nice.

60
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,250
This oughta be good.

Hey, Trunks.
Hold your power back a bit.

I can try. There.

Yes. That's perfect. Your
levels are exactly the same.

Okay. Whenever you're ready.

to look like that?

I, uh, guess so.

well equipped, isn't he?

It's the form. Trunks made
a slight error. He did this.

But he shouldn't have
fully extended his fingers.

[yells]

323
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,750
Woohoo! Buu go bang, bang!

324
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,375
Wow! He's alive!

325
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,416
[CHICHI]
Did you do it, Gotenks?

326
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,333
[BULMA]
Did you beat Majin Buu?

327
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,583
[GOTENKS]
Not exactly.

328
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,958
He's a, heh, a little
tougher than I thought.

329
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,958
[ALL] Uuuh!

330
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,541
[PICCOLO]
So, you're back.

331
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,541
Serves you right!

332
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,041
You fool! You could've blown
our only chance to win!

333
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,125
From now on
we do things my way!

334
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,875
Tomorrow you're going to
fight Buu as a Super Saiyan

335
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,750
and until then, we train!

336
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,833
Understood? Trunkten?

337
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,833
[MR. POPO]
Actually it's Gotenks.

338
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,000
What?!

339
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,125
[MR. POPO] His name.
It's uh, Gotenks.

340
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,000
[PICCOLO] His name is Mud
as far as I'm concerned.

341
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,916
[OLD KAI chants nonsensically]

342
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,791
[NARRATOR] The Old Kai is
a movin' and a groovin',

343
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,750
but will his efforts pay off?

344
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:42,125
Can the wizened sage really
awaken Gohan's latent powers?

345
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,625
The question really is,

346
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,875
can Gohan wait another
thirty hours to find out?

347
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:50,125
And after being beaten
roundly by Majin Buu,

348
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,041
can Gotenks
rebound and conquer

349
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,333
as a fused Super Saiyan?
