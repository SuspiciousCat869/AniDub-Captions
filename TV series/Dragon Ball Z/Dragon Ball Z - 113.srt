[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,750
Garlic Jr. and his henchmen
watched with delight

3
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,583
as Piccolo, under the spell
of the Black Water Mist,

4
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,250
set upon Gohan in
a vicious attack.

[blows landing]

9
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,375
[NARRATOR] Gohan had
no choice but to submit

10
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,333
to this brutal beating;
unwilling to defend himself

11
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,916
against his friend
and former teacher.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,750
Piccolo, however, had
no such reservations,

13
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,625
and he launched himself
at Gohan in full force.

14
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,625
[grunting,

15
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,833
[PICCOLO growls]

16
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,208
[NARRATOR] Despite
his best efforts

17
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,708
to evade Piccolo's
onslaught, in the end,

18
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,500
the young Saiyan was
finally overwhelmed.

19

--[PICCOLO grunts]

20
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,875
[NARRATOR]
Unconcious and helpless,

21
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:03,166
it seemed he too would become
one of Garlic Jr.'s victims...

22
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,916
[PICCOLO] Hmm?!

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,416
Wait! I think I will
finish him off after all.

24
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,083
[NARRATOR] ...when suddenly:

25
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,708
[PICCOLO] Oh, the
pleasure is all yours.

26
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,208
[NARRATOR] Piccolo
sprung his trap!

27
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,333
[PICCOLO] Krillin! Catch!

28
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,791
[NARRATOR] Kami is free!

29
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,583
And hope for saving
the Earth returns.

30
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,041
Today!

31
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,250
[GARLIC JR. growls]

32
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,333
You'll pay for that!

33
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:51,625
Yeah, well I don't think that's
going to happen, garlic breath!

[GARLIC JR. growls]

37
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,708
Hey! That was one heck
of a plan, Piccolo! But...

38
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,083
Gohan here is
pretty messed up...

39
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,458
[PICCOLO] Ha! He's
fine. Don't worry.

40
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:21,791
I know I've trained Gohan to
withstand a lot worse than this.

[GOHAN grunts]

[GOHAN gasps]

00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,500
[GOHAN] Mr. Popo...?

45
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,208
Huh...?

46
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,708
And Kami?

47
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,166
[POPO chuckles]

48

00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,583
[GOHAN] Piccolo... I-I
thought that you were...

50
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,125
[PICCOLO screams]

51
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,041
[PICCOLO hisses]

[PICCOLO chuckles]

53
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,666
The Black Water Mist had
no effect on me at all.

54
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,541
Oh?

55
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,500
[KRILLIN] Yep! We fooled ya!

56
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,333
Piccolo was one of
the good guys all along!

57
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,333
[PICCOLO growls]

58

[PICCOLO yells]

59
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,500
[PICCOLO] Listen carefully
to me, Krillin.

60
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,833
I'm going to attack Gohan now.

61
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,416
[PICCOLO] Garlic Jr.
would like nothing more

62
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,666
than to see me fight Gohan,

63
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,916
so I must make
this battle look real.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,125
And... when he drops his guard,

65
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,333
I will grab the bottles
that contain Kami and Popo!

66
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,333
I guess it's true what they say:
you can't trust anyone anymore!

67
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,000
[KRILLIN laughs]

68
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,416
[GARLIC JR. growls]

69
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,833
Krillin, you and Piccolo
are really good actors.

70
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,041
I didn't suspect a thing!

71
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,250
You two were acting,
weren't you?

72
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,375
[KRILLIN chuckles]

73
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,375
With Kami and Popo
as hostages,

74
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,500
that was the only way
I could get close enough

75
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,041
to Garlic Jr.
to release them safely!

76
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,875
[KAMI] Thank you for
freeing us, Piccolo.

77
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,833
We are eternally grateful!

78
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,333
Spare me your thanks.

79
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,791
I didn't rescue the two of you
because I wanted to, Kami.

80
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,333
[KAMI] Hmm...

81
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,916
[PICCOLO] The only
reason I did it

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,375
was because with
you captured,

83
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't fight
at my maximum power.

84
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,583
Yes, of course.

85
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,166
[VINEGAR chuckles]

86
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,250
I'll take care them!
Deliver the Sacred Water

87
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,166
before it's too late!

88
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,083
Yes, I will.

89
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,291
Garlic Jr., your plan
is going to fail!

90
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,875
I'm going to send you back

91
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,708
to the dark world
that you came from!

[GARLIC JR.] It's not easy
taking over the universe.

97
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,750
Huh?

98
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,250
[GARLIC JR.]
But it's days like this

99
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,125
that make it all worthwhile!

100
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:27,333
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

101
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,791
Don't you fools realize
that it's too late

102
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,875
to use the Sacred Water?

103
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,000
What's that?!

104
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,125
[GARLIC JR.] It will be
dawn long before you can

105
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,291
spread your Sacred Water
over the planet,

106
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,416
and by then it will be too late!

107
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,750
By that time, every
living thing on Earth

108
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,208
will have succumbed
to the effects

109
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,791
of the Black Water Mist!

110
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,375
They will all belong to me!

111
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,541
So no matter how hard you try,

112
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,666
you will never
be able to defeat me!

113

[GARLIC JR. giggles]

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,333
You are about to witness
the birth of a new world

115
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,625
of darkness and evil!

116
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:04,291
And I will be the ruler
of this beautiful new world!

Quiet. We'll be all
right if we stay here.

125
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,791
I can't believe what's
happening to everyone.

126
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,958
Why are they acting so violent?

[GARLIC JR.] With an army of
darkness under my control,

135
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,458
Earth will become the most
feared planet in the universe!

136
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,583
And every second that ticks by

137
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,791
brings me closer
to realizing my dream!

[VINEGAR chuckles]

143
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,125
[POPO] We might still
have a chance, Kami!

144
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,166
There is a way we can spread

145
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,291
the Sacred Water
everywhere quickly!

146
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,500
Tell me!

147
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,958
Huh?

148
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,833
[POPO] You can take the Sacred
Water through there, Kami!

149
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:11,375
It leads directly to the
seven air currents of the world!

150
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,583
Are you certain, Mr. Popo?

151
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,833
[POPO] Yes, Kami.

152
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,750
The air currents flow
just below your lookout!

153
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:21,833
It's the best way for you
to spread the Sacred Water!

154
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,708
Then let's go!

155
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,000
I must warn you that
if you choose this path,

156
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,041
it will be dangerous
and there's a chance

157
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,666
you will never
be able to return!

158
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,500
Yes, I know...

159
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,208
Ahh... Okay, you know
we'll have to pass through

160
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,583
the place where the spirits
of the former guardians

161
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,541
of the Earth go
to their eternal rest!

162
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,750
There is a risk that
your spirit could be

163

Yeah, so be afraid.
Very afraid!

329
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,791
[VINEGAR guffaws]

330
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,333
[GARLIC JR. growls]

331
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,666
[PICCOLO growls]

332
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,541
[KAMI] This is it,
Mr. Popo. Let's do it!

333
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,500
[KAMI gasps]

334
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:19,958
[KAMI yells]

335
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,500
Who are you?

336
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,250
[NARRATOR] It doesn't look good

337
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,375
for Piccolo,
Gohan, and Krillin.

338
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,375
With the Makyo Star
in Earth's orbit

339
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:41,250
increasing his power,
Garlic Jr. seems unstoppable!

340
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,791
Meanwhile, in the depths
of their mystical lookout,

341
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,458
Kami and Mr. Popo have found

342
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,708
yet another obstacle
standing between them

343
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,666
and saving
planet Earth.

344
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,125
Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
