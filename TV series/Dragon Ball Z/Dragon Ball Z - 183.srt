00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,250
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,000
the match between Cell
and Gohan opened with a bang,

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,833
as Cell released a
merciless assault

4
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,208
on the 11 year-old powerhouse.

5
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,125
[CELL yells]

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,333
[NARRATOR] And on-lookers
began to question if

7
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,208
Goku's confidence in 
his son was well deserved

8
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,166
as the young boy
refused to fight back.

9
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,291
[PICCOLO] Goku, you fool!

10
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,791
We told you this
would happen. We told you!

11
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,791
But you just
wouldn't listen to us!

12
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,875
Not so fast, Piccolo!

13
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,833
Can't you sense
his energy? He's fine.

14
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,958
Huh?!

15
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,416
[NARRATOR] With an
explosive re-entrance,

16
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,083
Gohan showed that he'd
endured the android's attack

17
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,250
with only minor
scrapes and bruises.

18
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,666
Clearly, Gohan had the
potential to defeat Cell.

19
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,833
But the boy
did not want to fight,

20
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,916
afraid of what
his own powers would do.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,750
[GOHAN] I've gotten
much stronger,

22
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,375
and if I were to lose control,

23
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,250
there's really no telling
how powerful I might become.

24
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,250
And there's no telling
what kind of damage

25
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,125
a power like that might cause.

26
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,083
Well, your story didn't work,

27
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,041
but you have given me
something to work for.

28
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,250
You see, Gohan...

29
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,791
this "hidden power"
of yours intrigues me,

30
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,875
and now that I know about it,

31
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm determined
to see it for myself!

32
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:39,625
[GOHAN gasps]

33
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,083
[grunting]

34
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,958
[NARRATOR] Cell is
thirsty for a fight,

35
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,208
and his
curiosity is aroused.

36
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,083
Now that he knows
about Gohan's power,

37
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,791
Cell will not stop until
this hidden beast is uncaged.

38
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,916
[NARRATOR] Playing with Gohan
is like playing with dynamite.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,333
But detonation is
exactly what Cell wants.

40
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,375
Just how far will he go?

41
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,791
What vicious
tactics will he employ

42
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,791
to light the Saiyan's fuse?

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,125
Well then. It looks like I might
actually get through to you yet!

44
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,208
[thinking] You can do this,
Gohan, I know you can.

45
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,166
Show everyone what an
incredible fighter you are!

46
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,375
What's happening down
there, Hercule?! Is it bad?

47
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:09,083
Of course it's bad! This is
no place for a child to be!

48
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,125
Unless a hero is found to
put down this terrible monster,

49
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,708
everyone on the
Earth will be massacred!

50
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,791
Must we all put our futures

51
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,166
in the hands of one fragile,
helpless little boy?

52
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,125
This reporter hopes not!

53
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,625
Mr. Satan, how's your stomach?

54
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,000
Ohh...

55

[MR. SATAN groans]

56
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,750
[MR. SATAN] Why'd you
make me think about it?!

57
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,875
--Oh, the pain!
--Well, there you have it,

58
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,583
the champ is still crippled
by a most lethal stomach virus!

59
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,333
We must be cursed for this
to happen to our greatest guy!

60
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:50,375
Gohan! Let's see if we can
give your engine a jump start!

61
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,208
Uh?

Careful, Gohan! That's one of
Frieza's finishing moves!

00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,625

I can feel your bones
beginning to crack,

to act, I'd do it now.

It's so horrible!

And I'm sure
if we don't get help,

Cell will torture
us all like this!

Goku, you can keep
standing there all you want,

No, you're not!

94
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,166
You and I both know you're
not strong enough to fight Cell!

95
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,375
So wait. Just
a little bit longer!

96
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,208
For what?
For Gohan to get killed?!

97
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,166
For Cell to rip him
to pieces while we watch?!

98
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,166
Wait until he has no choice.

99
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,291
[PICCOLO] Huh?

100
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,791
And then...

101
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,583
Right when Gohan is backed
into a corner with no way out,

102
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,333
he'll awaken his
furious inner strength.

103
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,458
[KRILLIN] Huh?

104
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,541
And when that happens,
you watch.

00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:06,083

down once and for all!

gone insane?!

That's it! Scream out!

mad that you're in pain!

[PICCOLO] Enough
of this game, Goku!

You're wrong about your son!

113
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,500
Gohan may have that power,
but it doesn't matter!

114
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,000
He doesn't thirst
for battle and mayhem!

115
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,916
He's not a fighter like you!

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,375
Huh?!

117
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,666
Do you want to know
what he's thinking?!

118
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,666
He's not thinking about
strength, or about competition!

119
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,791
He's wondering why his father is
standing there letting him die!

120
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,541
And so your son may be
the most powerful person

in the world, but he's also
