00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,000
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,541
The struggle
against the Saiyans

3
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,125
took a
devastating turn,

4
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:23,208
as Yamcha was bested
by the evil Saibamen.

5
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,416
And the horror
only intensified

6
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,958
as the Saiyans
themselves entered the fray!

7
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,333
In a desperate attempt to save
Tien from the rampaging Nappa,

8
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,291
Chiaotzu made the
ultimate sacrifice.

9
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,291
[NARRATOR] Tien would
not let his friend's

10
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,750
final effort be in vain.

11
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,083
Tien channeled all
of his rage and fury

12
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,916
into a powerful energy
blast aimed at Nappa.

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,708
But it was no use.

14
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,416
Having spent the last of
his strength in the attack,

15
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,666
Tien collapsed while the
Saiyan remained standing.

16
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,625
No... I failed...

17
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,958
[NARRATOR] And though things
looked increasingly bleak

18
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,875
for our heroes,
a glimmer of hope remained!

19
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,375
Goku completed his
journey down Snake Way

20
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,791
and was transported
back to Earth by Kami,

21
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,166
where he quickly raced
to aid his friends!

22
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,791
But even with
all his speed,

23
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,708
Goku is still miles away
from the battlefield.

24
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,375
Can he get there before
more of his friends succumb

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,625
to the Saiyans?
Find out... Today!

26
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,166
Where's Kakarot?!

27
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,125
Where's that pitiful
excuse for a Saiyan hiding?!

28
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,458
[VEGETA]
What a coward...

29
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,625
Don't you say that about
my Dad! He's not a coward!

30
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,666
Come on...

31
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,791
Goku, where are you? Hurry!

32
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,500
Hang in there, guys!
I'm coming!

33
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,416
Faster, Nimbus!
Faster!

34
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,666
Until Goku arrives, it'll
be up to the three of us

35
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,083
to slow these
guys down...

36
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,208
Krillin, are you ready to
put this plan into action?

37
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,708
You bet! First, I distract him
by getting his attention.

38
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,041
[PICCOLO]
That's right, Krillin.

39
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,541
Then I'll come at him from
behind and grab his tail,

40
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,000
the Saiyan's
weak spot...

41
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,041
With any luck, he'll be
completely immobilized.

42
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,708
Then I attack him head
on and finish him!

43
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,041
All right, then...
Let's do this!

44
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,291
Heh!

45
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:13,916
Aah, secrets, secrets...

46
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,500
[NAPPA] What're you fools
whispering about over there?

47
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,375
That's for us to know, but
you'll find out soon enough...

48
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,625
[NAPPA] Sounds interesting...

49
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,458
Well, don't keep me
waiting too long.

50
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,791
The suspense
might kill me!

51
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,208
[NAPPA laughing]

52
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,458
Oh, sorry.

53
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,750
Guess I shouldn't get
your hopes up like that.

54
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,666
Not that you had any to
begin with. Hope, I mean.

55
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,500
It doesn't really
matter what you do.

56
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,250
You're still
gonna die!

57
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,041
Fiend!
Take this!

58
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,625
Yaahh!

59
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,333
Oh! I'm terrified!
Should I run away?

60
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,833
[KRILLIN shouting]

61
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,833
[thinking] That's it,
Krillin, keep him busy...

62
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,791
Hyaagh!

63
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:04,708
Huh?!

64
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,166
[thinking] Now!

65
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,125
Hn?

66
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,916
Hey! What the--?

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,750
Gohan!

68
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,541
[GOHAN screaming]

69
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,833
It worked!

70
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,583
[GOHAN continues screaming]

71
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,375
[NAPPA chuckling]

72
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,375
Give me a break...

73
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,416
Hyaah!

74
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,875
[GOHAN shouting]

00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,708
[VEGETA chuckling]

76
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:42,041
[PICCOLO sputtering]

77
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,250
Wah, Piccolo!

78
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,166
[GOHAN whimpering]

79
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,000
[NAPPA] What's wrong, Namek?

80
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,833
[NAPPA laughing]

81
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,541
You look surprised!

82
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,125
Oh, now don't die on
me just yet...

83
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,375
You've still gotta tell
us about the Dragon Balls!

84
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,750
[KRILLIN] What happened?
What went wrong?

85
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,458
Piccolo had his tail!

86
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,458
Ha, ha, ha! Grab his tail!
That was your big plan?

87
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,791
Nappa and I have
evolved far beyond

88
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,958
that ridiculous
little weakness!

89
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,000
Good for us,
very bad for you!

90
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,625
One hit, and he's
supposed to be

91
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,416
one of the strongest
on this planet!

92
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,208
Piccolo?

93
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,875
Wake up!
Wake up!

94
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:31,083
Please, say something!
Piccolo, we need you!

95
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,250
Is he... Is he?

96
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,291
That's that...

97
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,166
Guess I'll have to find
someone else to play with

98
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,000
until he wakes up...
Hmm... How about you, kid?

99
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,958
[GOHAN whimpering]

100
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,750
Hmm. You know, you should
be proud. You're a Saiyan, too.

101
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,750
Well, I suppose you're
only half-Saiyan.

102
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,291
But still, that's
pretty good.

103
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,875
The Saiyans are the strongest
race in the galaxy...

104

[GOHAN whimpering]

105
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,416
Yep. Someday, you could've
been a mighty warrior...

106
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,916
Someday, but
not today...

something! Fix it!

going on out there!

[OOLONG] What do
you mean by that?

115
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,375
They've stopped
broadcasting,

116
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,500
which means that something
has gone horribly wrong...

[OOLONG laughing]

118

dare you give up on them?!

Huh?

122
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,458
[ROSHI] Hey! What's that
sound? Where's it coming from?

123

Uh, ChiChi, why are you...
Where did you get those guns?

them behind...

No, ChiChi, please!

It's time for action!

care? Let me go!

Just look at us.

It's hard to believe 
how happy we were then...

little Goku, all grown up.

you're out there somewhere...

here to save us...

[KRILLIN grunting]

00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,041
Hnn?!

00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,666
[GOHAN whimpering]

165
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,583
[thinking] Time to see if all
that training paid off...

166
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,750
Here! Catch!

167
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,125
Destructo Disk!

168
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,083
Play catch, huh?
Why not!

169
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,791
Nappa! Don't touch it!

170
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,708
What a fool! That shot
would have sliced him in two!

171
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,291
So... close!

172
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,791
You! You cut me!

173
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,666
Oh, you've gone
and done it now!

174
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,333
You've scarred my
beautiful face!

175
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,541
And you're
gonna pay for it!

176
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,500
Here, little man!
Catch this one!

177
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,625
Hyaah!

178
00:13:55,458 --> 00:14:00,375
[KRILLIN grunting]

179
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,083
Ah! Krillin! No!

180
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,666
[NAPPA laughing]

181
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,666
Sorry!
You lose!

182
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,958
[NAPPA shouting]

183
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,291
What in the...
Who did that?

184
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:34,166
[NAPPA snarling]

185
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,291
You Namekian trash!

186
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,333
You think you can shoot me in
the back and get away with it?

187
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,708
How dare you!!

188
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,375
[PICCOLO] I thought
it was your face...

189
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,083
Oh! Why you...
I'm gonna...

190
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,708
[VEGETA laughing]

191
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,208
I don't know Nappa, it's
an easy enough mistake.

192
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:57,916
Bring it on! I'm tired of
you and your loud mouth!

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,375
[NAPPA]
You arrogant fool!

194
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,750
Your life is mine to
take, whenever I want!

195
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,583
The only reason you're
still breathing

196
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,666
is because we need you to
tell us about the Dragon Balls.

197
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,041
And once we have that, you'll
be nothing more than a memory!

198
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,541
You caught me by surprise.
It won't happen again!

199
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,500
What in the world
am I sensing?

200
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,625
There's an incredibly
huge power level

201
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,916
that's heading
straight for us!

202
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:27,458
It's... It's my Dad!
He's different somehow,

203
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,250
but I know
it's him!

204
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:35,666
I knew he'd save
us... Get 'em, Goku...

205
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,125
Bah! You're just
trying to distract me!

206
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,916
You can't sense power levels
without some sort of device...

207
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Afraid you're
wrong.

208
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,333
You're
bluffing!

209
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:53,041
Oh? Wait and see.

210
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,541
[thinking] Goku, they can't
hold out much longer!

211
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,583
You've got to hurry!

212
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,708
It's Goku,
all right!

213
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,666
He's on his way
here right now!

214
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,166
And judging by the
power I'm sensing,

215
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,541
you Saiyans are in store for
the fight of your lives!

216
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,083
Wow! This is great!

217
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:13,666
I knew my Dad would make it
here in time! Hurry up, Daddy!

218
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,416
Yes. I love it!

219
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,541
You're all a bunch of
liars! Where is he?

220
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,750
I don't see
anyone! Vegeta!

221
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,500
Whadda you think? Is Kakarot
really coming or not?

222
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:34,208
Calm down, Nappa! Certainly,
there's nothing to worry about!

223
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:38,083
Who cares anyway?
Let him come!

224
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,666
I feel two huge
power levels...

225
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,000
Two weaker ones...
One fading...

226
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:56,958
That only makes five. Something
terrible is happening!

227
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,250
Haah! Go, Nimbus! Hurry!

228
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,375
[NAPPA] Vegeta!
Hey, Vegeta!

229
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,958
Snap out of it!

230
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,791
You look like you've
seen a ghost or something!

231
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,375
[NAPPA laughing]

232
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,583
Come on! Don't tell me
there some sort of truth

233
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,833
to what these
fools are saying!

234
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,333
Something is definitely
headed this way.

235
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,666
But it can't
be Kakarot.

236
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,666
The power level's
too high...

237
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,625
Whatever is coming has a
power level of five-thousand.

238
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,958
What?! No way!
Five thousand?!

239
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,375
[VEGETA thinking] There's no
way that could be Kakarot!

240
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,166
How could he have
become so powerful?

241
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,833
Well, whatever it is, I have
to be prepared for anything.

242
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,000
The people of this
planet have ways

243
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,541
of hiding their
true power levels.

244
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,666
Five thousand could just
be the beginning.

245
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,375
It can't be! Your scouter
must be malfunctioning!

246
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,708
[PICCOLO laughing]

247
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,333
[PICCOLO] So then, you
still think I'm bluffing?

248
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,000
Nappa! Quickly!
Kill them all!

249
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,250
We can't let them join
with this fighter!

250
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,416
If it is Kakarot,
he has to know

251
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,750
that we will not be
opposed by anyone!

252
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,625
Huh?!

253
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,875
Uwaah!

254
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,666
[KRILLIN growling]

255
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,333
[NAPPA] But... what
about the Dragon Balls?

256
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,958
[VEGETA] We don't need
these fools to find them!

257
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,833
It's all becoming
clear to me now!

258
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,208
It must have
been the Nameks

259
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,500
who created the Dragon Balls
here on this planet...

260
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,166
I've heard of the Magic
Balls of Namek before,

261
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,083
but I'd always thought
they were just a legend!

262
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,541
It can't just be a coincidence
that while searching

263
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,375
for these Dragon Balls,
we find a Namek!

264
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,791
I get it!

265
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,333
A Namekian is all we need
to make the Dragon Balls,

266
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,875
and Planet Namek is
loaded with them!

267
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,791
And if this one doesn't
want to cooperate,

268
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,458
we can always find another
Namekian that will!

269
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,541
So you're...
expendable!

270
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,208
Hey! Piccolo!
Leave now!

271
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,208
I can take care of
this bully by myself

272
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,791
until my Dad
gets here!

273
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,166
What?

274
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,750
If we lose you, then the
Dragon Balls will disappear

275
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,083
and we won't be
able to wish

276
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,708
any of our friends
back to life!

277
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,916
Thanks for your
concern, Gohan,

278
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,333
but I really don't think you
can handle these guys alone...

279
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,708
Just for that...
you go first.

280
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,416
I need to
help them...

281
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:41,000
But how? I can barely
move... Piccolo... Gohan!

Okay, brat!
You die!

00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,125

Hnn?!

289

[PICCOLO]
I don't believe it...

290
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:25,000
Uh, Gohan...
Was... was that you?

291
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,833
[NAPPA snarling]

292
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:58,458
You!
I'll kill you!

Where am I?
Where's my dad?

[PICCOLO thinking] Gohan!
No! No!

307
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:01,416
Until now, training
you was out of vengence,

308
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,333
making you worthy enough
to be my opponent.

309

But... something's changed...

310

No matter what happens
to you, Gohan,

I will always be
there to protect you.
