[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,250
the elder Kai gave Goku an
empowered set of earrings,

3
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,250
allowing him to perform
an instant, effortless fusion.

4
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,333
But, there was a catch.

5
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,083
Whoever wore the
matching earring

6
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,208
would fuse with him forever.

7
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,166
[SUPER BUU laughs]

8
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,000
[NARRATOR] Back on Earth,
the super-charged Majin Buu

9
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,083
tried to destroy the
remaining survivors

10
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,375
with one, terrifying blast.

11
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,375
But thanks to a timely arrival
by the revitalized Goku,

12
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,333
Buu's attempts were cut short.

13
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
[NARRATOR]
Down but far from out,

14
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,625
Majin Buu quickly
incapacitated Tien,

15
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,208
who had returned from seclusion
to play his small part.

16
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,958
[GOKU]
He was off guard!

17
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,291
[NARRATOR]
And pulling himself together,

18
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,083
Majin Buu readied to battle
Goku head to head,

19
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,750
with powers that not even the
great Saiyan hero could stop.

20
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,541
[GOKU]
Here! Catch!

21
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Aware of the desperate odds,

22
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,416
Goku threw the Kai's
earring to Gohan,

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
deciding to save the Earth

24
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,333
by merging permanently
with his son.

25
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,416
But Gotenks' fusion wore off
inside Buu's body,

26
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
causing a sharp drop
in the monster's power.

27
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,541
Goku chose at the last minute

28
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,541
not to go through
with the fusion.

29
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,500
And that's when
Buu made his move.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,458
[GOKU]
Gohan!

31
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,791
[NARRATOR] Just as he had done
with Piccolo and Gotenks,

32
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,708
Majin Buu absorbed
Gohan into his body,

33
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,375
and gained his incredible power.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,666
[SUPER BUU laughs]

35
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,625
[NARRATOR]
Now, Goku must convince

36
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,958
someone else to fuse with him.

37
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:06,041
A task that may prove
very, very difficult.

38
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:18,125
[laughs]

39
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,041
[GOKU grunting]

40
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,375
[SUPER BUU] So, what're
you going to do now?!

41
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,666
Think, Goku! Both of your
sons are a part of me now.

42
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,958
Maybe we should seek
family counseling?

43
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,083
[laughs]

44
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,083
[GOKU]
Poor Tien...

45
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,958
[GOKU] Man, I've got to
find some more power!

46
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,583
[SUPER BUU] You know they all
resent you for leaving, Goku.

47
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,916
They're telling me.

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,125
That won't work on me!

49
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,416
You're the monster who devoured
everyone we care about!

50
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,041
[laughs]

51
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:08,500
Yes, I suppose I did, but you
were supposed to stop me.

52
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,291
[growls]

53
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,666
Oh, don't take it
too personally, Goku.

54
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,041
Everybody fails.

55
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,375
Your failure just means
the end of the world!

56
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,875
Don't worry,

57
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,541
if I get a chance, I'll get
rid of that creep for good!

58
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,333
Well, only one problem.

59
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,125
I don't have any bullets left.

60
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,666
Pretty lucky for Buu, huh?!

61
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,083
Yes, lucky him.

62
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,083
Tell you what I'm going to do.

63
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:41,291
I'll give you a chance to
join bodies with someone.

[gasps]

65
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,000
You have until the count of five
to find a suitable partner,

66
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,875
so get moving!

67
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,166

Two!

70
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,166
[GOKU thinking] No, Dende's
size would hurt more than help.

71
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,208
Besides, we need him
for the Dragon Balls!

[SUPER BUU]
Three!

73

[GOKU] Oh man, Mr. Satan's
not exactly a warrior.

74
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,000
His lack of understanding
about energy could hurt, too,

75
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,583
but, he does know
basic martial arts.

76
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,500
Four!

00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,833

He's here!

84
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,666
This is as far as I go.

85
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,166
I'm sorry we're not closer,

86

but I've got my health
to think about, you know!

Heh/ That's fine, we can
wait here for now.

88
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm sure Buu will
find me soon enough.

tried to fuse yet!

What happened to your halo?

[OLD KAI]
Very interesting development.

107
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,708
Yes, I should've
seen this coming.

108

Look! It's-It's Vegeta.

Ah, what good luck!

If those two join bodies,

111
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,541
they will be a force
to be reckoned with.

112
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,791
[SUPREME KAI]
But Vegeta, sometime earlier,

113
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:56,000
he destroyed his body in
an attempt to stop Majin Buu.

114
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,416
How is it he has returned
to the living world?

115
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,791
King Yemma must have seen
the situation and intervened.

116
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,958
Yemma may look like
a brainless bear,

kind of a long story,

321
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,625
To the end of Earth!

322
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,458
All right! It's on!

323
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,333
Great! Thanks, Vegeta.

324
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,166
[laughing]

325
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,666
[VEGETA grunts]

326
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,416
[laughs, gasps]

327
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,500
[gasps]

328
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,666
All right! Ha, ha, ha!

329
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,541
[NARRATOR]
Unbelievable!

330
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,208
Goku and Vegeta have put
aside their differences,

331
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,750
and fused into one warrior!

332
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,625
A new page in Z-Fighter
history has been turned,

333
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:55,416
but how will they fare
in the fight against Buu?
