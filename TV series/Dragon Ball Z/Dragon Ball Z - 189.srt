[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,250
realizing that there
was no way to beat Gohan,

4
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,708
Cell decided to
go out with a bang.

5
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,541
[CELL] I'm going to
blow myself up now!

6
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:26,166
And I'm going to take
you with me! Ha, ha, ha!

7
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,416
So, say good bye to
your precious planet!

8
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,333
No, don't!

9
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,375
What?
Blow up the Earth?!

10
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,000
[NARRATOR] That's when Goku
took matters into his own hands.

11
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,541
Goodbye, my son...

12
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,125
[NARRATOR] With mere seconds
remaining, Goku had to act fast.

13
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,166
Using his Instant
Transmission Technique,

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,916
he transported Cell
to King Kai's planet,

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,541
just as the bloated beast popped
his top and blew up big time.

[NARRATOR] Cell was blown

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,291
but his detonation also
had dire consequences for Goku.

20
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,750
King Kai's planet was
completely destroyed

21
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,375
along with everything on it.

22
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,958
[GOHAN] Daddy!

23
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,458
[NARRATOR] In a bold, final
move to save the Earth,

24
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,125
Goku had made
the ultimate sacrifice.

25
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,125
But there was little time
to mourn the fallen hero.

26
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,625
[PICCOLO] What was that?

27
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,541
[NARRATOR] From out of nowhere,
a giant storm cloud arose!

28
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,500
Could this be some freak act
of nature? I don't think so.

29
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,541
Forget the forecast, even I can
predict trouble when I see it.

30
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,791
No! It can't be!

31
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,208
What is that?!

32
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,500
He's... He's back!

33
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,583
[NARRATOR] There was
no denying the danger.

34
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,791
Gohan and the gang
could feel it in the air.

35
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,708
But there was little warning for
what was about to happen next.

The demented demon has come
back from the great beyond.

40
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,333
He's already blasted Trunks,

41
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,166
now he has his sights set
on the rest of the Z Warriors.

42

Can the good guys
get it together

them off one by one?

What do you mean, King Kai?
That's impossible!

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,708
I saw him blow up!

I can't explain it to you.

But somehow Cell
survived the blast!

Oh, come on!

He's still alive!

What can we do?

never see me again, didn't you?

Well, too bad! I'm alive!

But, I'm afraid I cannot
say the same thing for Goku.

Want to know how
I survived the blast?!

actually quite simple.

It is all in here.

It's part of my design.

Every cell has
a life of its own!

91
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,166
I can't die. It is impossible.

92
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,833
Even if I self destruct,
I will always come back.

this is the only place

[CELL] I don't remember
much after the explosion.

100
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,000
But somewhere amongst
the planetary debris,

101
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,958
the core of my being
still existed.

102
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,166
One living cell survived!

103
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,666
And that is all I
needed for my regeneration.

104
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:11,458
Soon, that single living cell
began to multiply into many.

105
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,625
It wasn't long before I became
conscious of my transformation.

106
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,208
I could feel every
part of my body growing,

107
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,958
crackling with
new life and energy.

108
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,958

began to sprout new limbs.

then my arms.

And in no time, my
whole body was restored.

that I had brought myself back
from the brink of extinction.

that each of my cells

of my former self.

to make me whole again.

had lost Android 18.

the power and stored it away,

Goodbye, friends...

00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,375
Thanks to him, I am stronger
than I have ever been!

Come on! This is
between you and me!

[thinking] How could I let
this happen to my son?!

174
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,208
He has sacrificed
everything for me,

175
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,208
and I have done
nothing but ignore him!

176
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,958
No! I won't
give up on him!

There is still time
to change things!

We never had a chance
to finish our fight!

[thinking] Cell has crossed
me for the last time!

180
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,958
He has tricked me in battle,
mocked my Saiyan ancestry!

181
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,166
But this! This time,
he's gone too far!

182
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,291
He will pay the ultimate price

183
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,500
for what he has done to my son!

Hmph! I will never understand

you done?! You hothead!

that is no way to help Trunks!

Gohan is the
last chance we've got!

00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,958
But he's hurt!
and Cell is so powerful!

255
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,000
This is so unfair!

256
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,833
Cell's sneak attack
on Trunks was bad enough

257
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,625
but now Vegeta
is in the same shape.

258
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,958
Without these two in the fight,

259
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,500
that means Gohan has to
face Cell all by himself!

then your friends, and
then this worthless planet!

264
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,541
But before I do, I want
you to remember something.

Since regenerating into

268
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,666
an indestructible force of evil,

269
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,791
there seems to be no
stopping the maniacal Cell.

270
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,000
But Gohan is determined
to stand until the end!

271
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,541
The young Super Saiyan has
faced overwhelming odds before,

272
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,125
but never this great.

273
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,500
Can he muster the strength to
stunt Cell's growth permanently?

274
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,833
Or have our young
hero's days come to an end?
