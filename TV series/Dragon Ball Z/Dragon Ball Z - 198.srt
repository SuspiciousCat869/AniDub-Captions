00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,666
Arqua from the East Quadrant
started his fight against Goku

3
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,375
by transforming the arena
into a whirl-pooling aquarium.

4
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,791
[NARRATOR] Deep in the water
and deep into trouble,

5
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,083
Goku was unable to match

6
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,041
the finned fighter's
underwater speed.

7
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,291
[GOKU] Solar Flare!

8
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,416
[NARRATOR] But with the help
of the Solar Flare technique,

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,875
Goku managed to blind Arqua long
enough to escape into the air.

10
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,791
[NARRATOR] Wasting no time, Goku
used his most trusted attack:

11
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,041
The Kamehameha Wave.

12
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,000
[GOKU] Haaa!

13
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,416
[NARRATOR]
And Goku's fishy foe

14
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,875
was blown right
out of the water.

15
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,416
[ARQUA screams]

16
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,875
[grunts]

17
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,875
[NARRATOR] But the fighting
was far from over.

18
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,750
Next on the mat:
Pikkon vs. Olibu!

19
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,625
The most anticipated
match of the tournament.

20
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,750
Both fighters had been training
for centuries for this chance.

21
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,500
Both boasted incredible
skill and strength.

22
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,000
Both were hoping
to win the gold.

23
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,916
But only one would
stay standing...

24
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,791
[MUSHROOM MC]
It's official, people!

25
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,791
Pikkon haaas won!

26
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,416
[NARRATOR]
The battle between giants

27
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,291
has been fought to its end.

28
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,083
Olibu is out.

29
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,000
Now, if Goku wants to
win the tournament,

30
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,583
he'll have to get past Pikkon.

31
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,541
[GOKU] Gee... Beating Pikkon
is gonna take all I've got...

32

Maraikoh! I know you're
not from my quadrant

36
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,708
but I want you to
pound that rookie!

37
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:58,083
It's quite something that our
newcomer has come this far...

38
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,958
[WINGED MAN] Hmph. You know he
won't make it through this bout.

39
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,166
No, there's something
about his energy--

40
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,041
he may be the first person
from the North Quadrant

41
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,416
to earn the
Grand Kai's lesson...

42
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,916
You're dreaming...

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,583
And who says the dead
don't know how to party?!

44
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, what do you say we move
right on to the first match

45
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,958
of the semifinals!

46
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,375
Maraikoh from the West...

47
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,166
And Goku from the North!

48
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,791
C'mon, people, let's do this!

Now you better get
those pedals moving
