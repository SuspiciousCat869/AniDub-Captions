Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

Spopovitch and Yamu attacked,
armed with a mysterious device

4
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,208
that drained Gohan
of his energy.

to be the Supreme Kai himself,

of Gohan's assailants.

the true nature

rushed to face...

not be able to defeat them!

to beat those two?

but will he be ready to meet
a powerful new enemy?

22

[SUPREME KAI]
There...

That's it, drones,
lead the way.

40
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,333
So, it's obvious
you were able

41
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,083
to defeat
this wizard Bibidi

42
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,708
before he could unleash
Majin Buu on the Earth.

43
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,791
But you didn't
destroy Majin Buu.

44
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,166
You chose instead to leave him
here, lying dormant.

45
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,000
That's right...

46
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,916
We thought it best that way.

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,333
We believed that Bibidi
was the only one

48
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,083
who could free Majin Buu...

49
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,541
We were mistaken in that belief.

50
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,291
Bibidi has a son--
also a wizard.

51
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,625
And if he isn't stopped,
Majin Buu will live again.

52
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,250
So I guess Bibidi's son is
controlling the guys

53
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,708
from the tournament?

54
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,666
[SUPREME KAI]
Yes. His name is Babidi.

55
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,958
And as is often the case
in this universe,

56
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,000
the son is as evil
as the father.

57
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,375
[KRILLIN] Great.
Why does that not surprise me?

58
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,041
It's simple. All we have
to do is stop Babidi

59
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,333
from waking up Majin Buu, right?

60
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,916
Yes, that's right...

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,541
But I'm afraid that it won't be
as easy as you make it sound...

62
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,041
Babidi's abilities as a wizard
are not to be underestimated.

63
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,583
It may take all of us
to defeat him.

64
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,791
[GOKU]
Wow...

65
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,958
It sounds like this
guy's pretty strong...

66
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,208
Babidi's strength
lies in his magic.

67
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,625
Physically, he is
not very powerful...

68
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,166
Nor was his father.

69
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,541
But a wizard does
not need to be...

70
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,125
Instead, his magic enables
him to harness the evil

71
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,166
that exists in the hearts of
people like Yamu and Spopovitch,

72
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,833
and thereby control
their actions.

73
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,166
Imagine what would happen

74
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,250
if someone truly powerful
came under his spell...

75
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,166
[GOHAN]
If Yamu and Spopovich

76
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,750
didn't enter the
tournament to win,

77
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,291
then why were they even there?

78
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,250
I mean, what did they do to me?

79
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,000
Babidi intends to
resurrect Majin Buu,

80
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,333
but before he can do this,

81
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:03,041
he requires a tremendous
amount of pure energy.

82
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,000
So they came after me?

83
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,791
Babidi sent them
to the tournament

84
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,500
because he believed that it
would be the easiest place

85
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:14,041
to gather such a large
amount of energy...

86
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,375
Only after they saw you
transform into a Super Saiyan

87
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,666
did you become their target.

88
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,750
The Supreme Kai
and myself knew

89
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,375
that Babidi would send
someone to the tournament.

90
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,416
We also entered.

91
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,083
The ball containing
Majin Buu has vanished...

92
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,750
We journeyed to where it laid
before, but found no sign of it.

93
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,958
So we believe it is
in Babidi's grasp,

94
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,458
and he waits only for
the energy to open it...

95
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,458
And upon his success...

96
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,541
...the world will
slip into darkness

97

been viewed by human eyes.

I'm... I'm fine.

I don't think
I understand.

102
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,833
I mean, you had your chance
to finish off Majin Buu

103
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,541
when you were fighting
Babidi's father.

104
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,041
Why didn't you take it?

105
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,500
It wasn't worth
the risk...

106
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,041
We feared that any
external stimulus

107
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,875
might accidentally
set him free...

108
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,000
The ball in which
Majin Buu was confined

109
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,416
was hidden deep
within the earth,

110
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,833
where no human
could ever find it.

111
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,958
So we allowed him
to lie dormant.

112
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,250
If our actions had
caused him to be released,

powerless to stop him...

Yeah, you've got it...

161
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,375
Be careful flying back,
and when you get there,

162
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,291
could you be sure to tell my mom
and my brother what's going on?

163
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,083
They're probably worried.

No problem...
but tell me something.

It was really you, right?

Uh...

Yes. I-I'm sorry I lied to you.

I-I-I just didn't want
everyone to know...

169
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,625
So, seven years ago,
that strange group of people

170
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,583
that showed up during
the fight with Cell...

171
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,416
That was you guys...

172
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,000
And you were the little boy
that was with them, weren't you?

173
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,458
[GOHAN]
Mm-hm.

174
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,875
Then... My father wasn't the
one who beat Cell, was he?

175
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,833
No, it was you.

176
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,125
Yes... It was.

177
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,041
I knew it!

178
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,416
I always had a
feeling about that.

179
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,125
It just seemed strange
to me that my father

180
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,291
was capable of that
kind of strength...

181
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,291
And now it all makes sense!

182

[SUPREME KAI]
No, it's not.

227
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,166
It's one of his minions.

Hey...

229
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,000
That ground looks like its
been disturbed recently,

230
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,333
like it's been all
dug up or something.

231

It's so obvious now!

232
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,833
That's why we couldn't
find his spaceship

233
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,041
when we were flying over...

234
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,833
He buried the whole
thing underground!

235
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,333
And that means...

236
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,291
There's a chance Babidi has
learned that Kibito and I

have followed him here to Earth.

Otherwise...

there would be no reason
for him to hide his ship.

I say we attack them now.

The longer we wait here,

the more time we give them

[SUPREME KAI]
No. We will bide our time.

They will release Majin Buu
outside the ship.

What is this Demon World?

Yes, it is...

And he is the most
dangerous of them all.

279

Remember, it is not his size you
must concern yourself with.

00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,916
It's his magic.

281

If he is able to keep a being

such as Dabura
under his control...

Just imagine the horror
he could inflict on this world.

strong and Babidi has him,

what's going to keep us from
falling under his spell?

A wizard seeks out the evil
desires in a person's heart.

00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,041
Once discovered, he manipulates
them, enhances them...

And ultimately uses
them to control.

This is how Dabura was captured.

290
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,625
Once Babidi infiltrates
a person's heart,

his influence is complete.

All he needs is to find
but a trace of evil

293

to bring someone
under his power.

and free of evil desires,

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,291
have everything
covered without me...

318
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,333
And I'd hate to think of what
your wife would do to me

319
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,833
if I let anything
happen to you.

320
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,666
Yeah. Ha, ha... She does
have a bit of a temper.

321
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,916
But, hey! [laughs]

322
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000

You've done well...

00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,833
We are now one step closer
to achieving our goal.

[SPOPOVICH laughs]

329
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,458
When you're as
strong as us,

330
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,333
this kind of job is like
taking baby from a candy.

331
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,708
[BABIDI]
It's such a shame

332
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,458
that your business
with me is finished.

[BOTH gasp]

[BABIDI] I'm afraid I have
no more use for you!

You know, I really
liked him, too...

347

Yes...
A terrible loss...

00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,625
Now, for our other... "friend."

would you please kill him?

[NARRATOR] At last, the ruthless
wizard Babidi has been revealed.

And with the combined
powers of the villains

363
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,791
he's brought under his control,

364

his opportunity to resurrect
Majin Buu might just be at hand.
