00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:14,291
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,000
hundreds of would-be
fighters gathered to compete

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,000
in the World Martial
Arts Tournament,

4
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,750
dreaming that maybe--just
maybe--they could

5
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,208
clench the title
of World Champion.

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,500
But the path
has many obstacles.

7
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,375
First off, there were one
hundred and ninety-four

8
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:35,125
adult entries, and
only sixteen spots.

9
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,333
And one was already
guaranteed to

10
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,375
the current holder of the
champion belt--Hercule.

11
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,666
The world's most famous fake.

12
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,583
To decide who would
stay and who would go,

13
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,250
a punching machine
was brought in

14
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,458
to measure the
fifteen strongest.

15
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:54,625
Hercule started the bidding with
an impressive one thirty-seven!

16
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,916
[PRELIM REF] Incredible!

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,125
He scored one hundred
and thirty-seven points!

18
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:03,583
[MR. SATAN pants]

19
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,666
[NARRATOR] At least, it seemed
impressive at the time.

20
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,291
Ha... ugh!

21
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,166
Next, please!
Number eighteen!

22
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,666
[NARRATOR] The Z Fighters
soon stepped to the plate,

23
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,166
trying their hardest to conceal
their ground-breaking strength.

24
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,500
But that's not
always easy...

25
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,666
[PRELIM REF] Seven hundred
and seventy-four?!

26
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,125

[gasping]

28
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,416
[NARRATOR] Then came Vegeta...

29
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,125
And, as we all know,
restraint is not his specialty.

30
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,583
[VEGETA grunts]

31
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,750
Oh, wow...

32
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,375
[NARRATOR] Needless to say,
the Z Fighters have

33
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,000
earned their places in
the tournament ring.

34
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,375
But it just might be a
while before the officials

35
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,250
can form enough
words to announce it!

36
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:26,000
[FIGHTERS whimpering]

37
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,916
[whimpering continues]

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,958
[VEGETA] Hmph.

39
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:41,000
[gasping, whimpering]

40
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,291
Break, you buy, right?

41
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,916
I'm giving up!

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,583
That guy would turn
me inside out!

43
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,541
[VIDEL gasps]

44
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,833
Nice, Vegeta...

45
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,166
Uhh...

46
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,750
Wait! You're not in the
least bit surprised?!

47
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,750
Didn't you see what
he did to that machine?!

48
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,041
Oh! I saw! Surprising!

49
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,750
I don't understand it!
It's like they're...

50
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,791
all in this big group together!

51
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,708
And... they can all
lift cars and busses!

52
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,791
They're all scoring
in the two hundreds

53
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,791
and my dad only got
a one thirty-seven!

54
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,083
Yeah... How weird...

55
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,125
Um... Hello...

56
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:26,333
We're experiencing a few...
technical difficulties,

57
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,250
but we should be getting
a new machine out here

58
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,208
pretty quick, so,
uh, stick around...

59
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,000
Hey, Vegeta...

60
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,375
I heard they're starting
the Junior Competition

61
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,625
in a few minutes in the
main arena! Do you wanna go?

62
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,875
Fine... Let's go...

63
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,041
Anything's better
than this lame sideshow!

64
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:50,666
[FIGHTERS gasping]

65
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,666
Just look!
See how they walk?

66
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,000
So tough...

67
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,083
Hello there!

68
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,333
Huh?!

69
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,375
So... you're the girl
I keep hearing about!

70
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,916
Introduce her, will ya?

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,916
Yeah! She's--

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,875
Ah...?

73
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,875
She's my friend, Videl!

[KRILLIN giggles]

Come on, Gohan!

76
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,083
Don't you mean
to say "girlfriend"?

77
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,250
You're embarrassing me!

78

[GOKU] Well, we don't want to
be late to see

Trunks and Goten fight.
It was nice meeting you, Videl.

80
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,250
[KRILLIN] Good luck, Gohan!

81
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,708
Bye!

82
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,458
[GOHAN] I wish they'd hurry
with that punching machine...

83
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,625
You know them?!

84
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,041
[GOHAN] Sure!

85
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,916
The man wearing
the orange uniform,

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,250
he's my dad!

What?!

88

I thought your dad was
with another woman!

Oh no! Just dead!

90

Didn't you see the ring
floating over his head?

91

to lie down...

and 5 mil for the runner-up!

And we've also got
something extra special

for the Junior winner this year!

it makes me wish

for the chance!
