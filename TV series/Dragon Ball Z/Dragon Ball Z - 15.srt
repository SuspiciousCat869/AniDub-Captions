00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,250
Goku took a snooze and
was haunted by nightmares

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,958
of the two terrifying Saiyans

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,500
who are making their way
towards planet Earth...

5
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,250
That got him
back on his feet

6
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,541
and moving even faster
along Snake Way...

7
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,208
He came across a castle that
he thought was King Kai's,

8
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,083
but it turned out that it
belonged to the charming

9
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,708
but deadly
Princess Snake...

10
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,625
And oh boy, did she ever
live up to that name!

11
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,750
Once the Princess
shed her skin,

12
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,250
Goku realized he was in
the belly of a beast.

13
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,250
So he made a
hasty retreat...

14
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,958
But it turns out that the
Princess never lets her guests

15
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,958
leave her with
an empty stomach,

16
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:53,083
and Goku almost became
the hot item on the menu!

17
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,000
Not wanting to
end up snake food,

18
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,041
Goku shook the
Princess off his tail

19
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,083
by setting a trap
of his own...

20
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,708
Using himself as bait,
he tied the Princess up

21
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,375
and left her
tightly tangled

22
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,333
and got back
on Snake Way...

23
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,666
Now he's on
track again,

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,208
still in search
of King Kai

25
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,541
and the special
martial arts training

26
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,416
that he so badly needs...

27
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,291
Meanwhile, Gohan is doing
his own training on Earth...

28
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,625
It won't be long until
those two evil Saiyans

29
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,166
arrive on the planet.

30
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,833
I sure hope Goku and Gohan have
what it takes to stop them!

31
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,791
[NARRATOR] Every good
martial artist knows

32
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,750
that you have to train your
mind as well as your body,

33
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,708
and Gohan is no exception...

34
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,625
With his daily
training completed,

35
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,291
he keeps his mind busy with
his school homework...

36
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,458
But all the arithmetic and
language lessons in the world

37
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,000
can't keep memories of
his mother and father

38
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,375
from creeping
into his head...

39
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,458
[GOHAN hums]

40
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,958
[GOHAN] Let's see...
Carry the one and add two...

41
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:02,333
No... X equals one and
carry the one... Hm...

42
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,041
[CHICHI] What a smart 
boy you are, Gohan!

43
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,041
You just solved one of the
hardest problems in your book!

44
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,458
Thatta boy!

45
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,666
You keep studying like that
and you're going to be

46
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,666
a great scholar one
day. I just know it!

47
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,208
Yup! He's a chip
off the old block!

48
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,541
[GOHAN] I miss my Mommy
and Daddy so much...

49
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,708
[NARRATOR] On the other
side of the planet,

50
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,916
Piccolo works on his own kind
of intensive training...

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,583
Recalling his near-disastrous
battle with Raditz,

52
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,750
he works out new
fighting strategies

53
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,791
and attack
combinations...

54
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:46,708

He... He dodged it...

65
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,500
He's faster than the...
the speed of light!

66
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,708
You took a chunk
out of my armor.

67
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,583
I guess even you can
get lucky sometimes...

[RADITZ chuckles]

69
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,416
I won't let it
happen again.

70
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,916
[PICCOLO] Ha. You won't even
see the next attack coming!

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,791
You don't even come
close to my power level.

72
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:59,125
Give it up! You're through!
Your life will end today!

73
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,041
I don't think so!

00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,208
It'll make you feel
better! Come on!

167
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,666
[CHICHI]
I'm not hungry...

168
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,708
ChiChi... You haven't eaten
anything in the last week.

169
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,125
Have some food.
Come on... Open up now!

170
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,625
[CHICHI]
Leave me alone...

171
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,250
Eh... Oh...?

172
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,125
[thinking] The poor
girl really misses

173
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,125
Gohan and Goku...

174
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,666
[GOHAN grunts
rhythmically]

175
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,041

[TIGER growls]

177
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,541
[GOHAN]
Yahoo!

178
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,208
[GOHAN laughs]

179
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,708
[GOHAN] Hey...
This looks familiar!

180
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,083
I came back to the
same place I was before!

181
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,833
Oh, no...

182
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:59,625
[TIGER pants]

183
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,583
[GOHAN]
This way, Mr. Tiger!

184
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:23,083
[GOHAN grunts
excitedly]

185
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:31,208
[GOHAN exhales]

186
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,833
An... island?
I'm on an island?

187
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,916
[GOHAN] I must be a long,
long way from home...

188
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,416
That means I'll have
to figure out a way

189
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,958
to get off of this
island... somehow.

190
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,833
I can do it...
I have to!

191
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:14,791
Mm hmm... Well, I guess
that might work, maybe.

192
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,666
[thinking] My greatest
opponent is myself...

193
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,458
If I can discover
what my weaknesses are,

194
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:25,541
then I will be an even stronger
fighter than I already am...

195
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,166
Hm?

196
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,458
[OTHER PICCOLO roars]

197
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,583
Special
Beam Cannon!

198
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,375
[GOHAN] This should
do the trick.

199
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,333
Guess I'll have to
chop it down!

200
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,500
[GOHAN]
Hyaaa!

201
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,625
Hi-yaaa!

202
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:49,458

203

[TIGER grunts]

204
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,750
[GOHAN]
Thank you!

205
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,166
Ahh...

206
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:12,583
[GOHAN] Whew! That was hard
work! Now it's time for a snack.

207
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:34,375
[hammering]

208
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,208
Finished!

209
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,666
I did it!
I did it!

210
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,958
[GOHAN laughs]

211
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,500
Okay!

212
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,958
[GOHAN grunts]

213
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,666
[GOHAN]
I'm going home!

214
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,458
[TIGER groans]

215
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,500
[GOHAN] Don't worry,
Mr. Tiger, I'll come back!

216
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,541
I just need to go home
and see my Mom first, okay?

217
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,125
[TIGER groans]

218
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:09,875
And stroke... and stroke...
and stroke... and stroke...

219
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:15,791
And stroke... stroke...
stroke... stroke...

220

[TIGER howls]

221
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,875
Good... There's
some wind!

222
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,541
[GOHAN laughs]

223
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,333
[GOHAN]
Whoa!

Whoa-ho-ho!

[PICCOLOS grunt]

229
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,750
It's the kid!

230
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,375
Gohan?

231
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:38,250
[PICCOLO roars]

232
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:48,916
[GOHAN snores]

233
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,708
[GOHAN] Oh, no!
A storm is coming!

234
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,041
[GOHAN lurches]

235
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:18,125

[GOHAN coughs]

237
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,666
I've gone too far to go
back now, and just in case,

238
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,333
I better eat this food
while I still can!

239
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,125
Uh-oh! I'm taking
on water! Oh, no!

240
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,375
Maybe this wasn't such
a good idea after all.

241
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,500
Boy, I wish
I could swim!

242
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,583
[thinking] Where is he? I sense
he's around here somewhere!

243
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,416
[GOHAN yells]

244

[GOHAN]
Help me, Daddy!

[GOKU pants]

248
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,583
[NARRATOR] All alone
on a stormy sea!

249
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,541
How will Gohan get
out of this one?

250
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,708
Hopefully Piccolo
will find him in time.

251
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,500
If he doesn't,
you can say bon voyage

252
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,125
to the pint-sized Saiyan...

253
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,541
Hang on Gohan, hang on!

254
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,875
And don't you miss the
next exciting episode

of Dragon Ball Z!
