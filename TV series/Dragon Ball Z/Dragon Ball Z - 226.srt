Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,125
Goku and the others entered
an underground spaceship

3
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,375
in a bid to foil the wizard
Babidi's plans to revive

00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:24,958
Majin Buu, an evil being
of immeasurable power!

After surviving the
first two stages

6
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,500
of the battle, Goku, Vegeta
and Gohan were awaiting

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,375
the commencement of Stage Three,
while their opponent,

8
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:37,958
Dabura, was making his own
preparations for the showdown!

9
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,708
Known as the King
of the Demon World,

10
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,750
no mortal has ever survived
a fight with Dabura!

11
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,833
And once fully energized,
this fearsome champion

12
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,583

to wreak havoc on Goku

13

their next opponent!

Meanwhile, back at the

15
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,250
World Martial Arts Tournament,
an epic struggle

16
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,250
was taking place
between Number 18

17
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:07,041

it out in a righteous rumble!

[NARRATOR]
The battle was evenly matched

19
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,791
until 18 launched an
attack that had Mighty Mask

20
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:20,208
coming apart at the seams!

21

22
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,250
[NARRATOR] Goten and Trunks
decided to continue

23
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,291
fighting after the
split but the word

24
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,000
from the judge's chair was "No!"

25
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,291
And the two delinquent
members of Mighty Mask

26
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,208
were disqualified!

27
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,625
Now only two competitors remain!

28
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,625
Will 18 become the first
female World Champion

29
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,083
in the history
of the tournament,

30
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,583

though, it's way too small!

319
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,708
A secluded place in the
mountains sounds good

320
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,625
or maybe a nice
spot on the beach!

321
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,041
Wait! No!

322
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,291
Then we'll get
sand in our boots!

323
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,041
[gasping]

324
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,291
[growls] Bah! Silence child...

325
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,166
Haaaa!

326
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,041
You will fight me here and now!

327
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,625
[BABIDI]
Dabura, wait a second!

328
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,541
Huh?!

329
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,333
[GOHAN]
Hm?

330
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,541
[BABIDI] I was just
thinking and it might not

331
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:51,583
be such a bad idea to pick
another location for the fight!

332
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,291
You see, to revive Buu,
we're going to need

333
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,416
the spaceship intact!

334
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,166
Yes... I understand!

335
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,708
[BABIDI]
Any preferences?

336
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,416
Perhaps a planet
similar to this one!

337
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,458
I don't want an
unfair advantage!

338
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,333
[giggles] Dear me!

339
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,000
You really want to show them,
don't you, Dabura!

340
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,000
Very well! As you wish!

341
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:14,958
Here goes!

342
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,041
Ooooh!

343
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,625
Papparapa!

344
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,916
[GOHAN]
Huh?!

345
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,625
Ahh! What's this?!

346
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,208
Well, then!

347
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,500
Let's begin, shall we?!

348
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,083
Sure!

349
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,541
Gohan! Stay focused!

350
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,833
[GOHAN]
Right, Dad!

351
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,625
[GOHAN grunts]

352
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,708
[DABURA]
Hmm...

353
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,166
[DABURA, GOHAN grunting]

354
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,833
[VIDEL] So this strange man
told them that he needed

355
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,125
their help to stop the wizard
who's trying to revive

356
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,916
this evil monster
Buu with his magic.

357
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,416
So that's where your dads are!
And Gohan went with 'em!

358
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,291
[GOTEN] Then the whole
world's in danger!

359
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,541
[TRUNKS] Yeah! T-They're
gonna have to fight!

360
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,458
[VIDEL]
Huh?

361
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,875
[GOTEN]
Wow! Magic?!

362
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,500
[VIDEL]
Yes, that's what the man said!

363
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,458
A wizard?!

364
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,458
[VIDEL]
Uh-huh!

365
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,166
Can you believe it!

366
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,000
Cool! This is major!

367
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:45,916
Way major!

368
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,541
[laughs]

369
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,041
[laughs]

370
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,250
[BOTH laughing]

371
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,833
Huh?!

372
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,541
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
You know what this means...?!

373
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,833
We get to save the world!

374
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,750
Uhh, boys?!

375
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,041
[GOTEN]
They went that way, right?

376
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,375
[TRUNKS]
Yeah!

377
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,416
I hope it's not too far,
or we'll never catch 'em!

378
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,125
You guys aren't going, are you?!

379
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,166
It's dangerous over there!

380
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,541
Hey, yo!

381
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,875
If we don't hurry, we could
miss the whole thing!

382
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,125
Let's get a move on!

383
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,208
I don't wanna miss it!
I don't wanna miss it!

384
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,375
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's goooo!

385
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,833
Yeah!

386

--[GOTEN] Yay!
--[TRUNKS] Woo-hoo!

387
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,166

We're gonna kick some boo-tay!

388
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,625
Insane.

With Gohan turning
up the flames,

it looks like the battle
is about to get serious!
