00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,625
Vegeta launched
an all-out attack

3
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,708
against the
brutish Recoome,

4
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,416
but the Saiyan Prince's
strength was no match

5
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,000
for the might of
the Ginyu Force...

6
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:31,166
Fortunately, Krillin and Gohan
were standing by at the ready!

7
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,041
But even though
Vegeta was spared

8
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,916
the brunt of
Recoome's blast,

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,583
Krillin's counter-attack
had little effect.

10
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,166
Fool!

11
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,083
Hey! Jeice!
Burter!

12
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,375
Can I kill
this one, too?

13
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,375
[NARRATOR] And then the
unthinkable...

14
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,500
Krillin fell!

15
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:57,250
It's... all right... It's
time to face the facts.

16
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,166
The Dragon Balls
are gone...

17
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,750
[NARRATOR] Now, with Krillin and
Vegeta out of commission,

18
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,583
only one fighter remains to
challenge the evil Recoome.

19
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,541
You stay away!

20
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,500
I-I'm not gonna let you
hurt my friend any more!

21
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,125
[RECOOME] Let me get
this straight, little man.

22
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,458
You're gonna
stop me?

23
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,458
You think you're 
tough, don't you?

24
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,750
Well, come on then,
let's see what you've got!

[JEICE] Ugh. We should've
kept our turn...

29
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,958
[BURTER] Aw, let
Recoome have him.

30
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,583
I mean, it hardly
seems worth it now.

31
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,833
This kid won't put up
much of a fight on his own.

32
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,958

Yeah! For a second there,

I don't mind gettin'
my hands dirty.

[MRS. BRIEF] ChiChi?
Did you say something?

66
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,833
Is everything
all right, dear?

67
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,833
[ChiChi] I-It's my Gohan...

68
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,958
He's in trouble.
I just know it!

69
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,166
Ahh. Oh...

70
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,291
[ChiChi] He... He's
lost without me...

71
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,791
I have to
do something!

72
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,583
Don't worry
yourself too much.

73
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,833
I'm sure Gohan is
doing just fine.

74
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,500
After all, he's got my
Bulma to take care of him!

[MRS. BRIEF giggles]

76
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,958
[ChiChi] Dr. Brief!
I need that ship!

77
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,500
[DR. BRIEF] Oh, ChiChi!
Good, you're just in time!

78
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,541
I was just putting on
the finishing touches!

79
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,541
She's a beauty,
isn't she?

80
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,750
I had all the plans worked
out from the first one,

81
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,583
so putting this one
together was a snap!

82
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,750
I even managed to get
the cappuccino maker

83
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,208
installed this ti--

84
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,208
All that's left to do
now is test her out!

better let me just show you

how to work the

Let's go already!

[DR. BRIEF] No, ChiChi! Wait!
It hasn't been tested yet!

what you're doing!

you have more than

outdone yourself,

00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,791
[GOHAN] My friends'... My
friends' lives depend on it!

163
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,291
Haa...

164
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:22,125
[RECOOME shouts]

165
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:22,958
Haa...

166
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,166
[GOHAN grunts]

167
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,625
Hm?

168
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,458
[RECOOME grunts]

171
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,125
[GOHAN growls]

172
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,291
Come on,
squirt!

173
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,000
Don't tell me that's
the best you've got!

174
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,791
[GOHAN grunts]

175
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,250
[GOHAN screams]

176
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,000
Uhhh...

177
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,291
[GINYU growling]

178
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,625
[FRIEZA] U-Uhh..
M-My wish...

179
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,416
Maybe it already came
true... I don't know.

180
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,541
Does it feel like you
have eternal life?

181
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:28,083
[FRIEZA] No... At least,
I... I-I don't think so...

182
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,458
Nothing's changed...

183
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,166
Why? What's wrong?!

184
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,500
Wait!

185
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,833
Here, it's yours!
Go ahead and take it!

186
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,125
It doesn't matter.
You'll never succeed!

187
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,458
Even if you do find
all seven balls,

188
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,333
you still won't be able
to make your wish...

189
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,333
[FRIEZA] Before I destroyed
his village and took

190
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,958
the second
Dragon Ball,

191
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,166
one of the elder Nameks
warned me this would happen.

192
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,208
I didn't think much
of it at the time.

193
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,333
People will say anything
when they're about to die.

194
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,541
But now it seems the old
geezer was telling the truth!

195
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,083
Urrgh... I can't
make my wish!

196
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,666
There must be some secret
to unlocking their power!

197
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,250
A password! A code!

198
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,666
Some sort of special ritual
to release the dragon

199
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,541
that only Nameks
would know!

200
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,208
I could scream!
Curses!

201
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,000
I have all seven Dragon Balls,
and they're worthless!

202
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,083
Now I need a Namek to
show me how to use them!

203
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,625
Check the Scouter,
Lord Frieza.

204
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,875
There's bound to be
one or two of them left.

205
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,708
[FRIEZA growls]

206
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,833
[FRIEZA] Hmmm...

207
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,958
[FRIEZA] The rest of the Ginyu
Force is in that direction.

208
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,041
Perhaps Vegeta or
his new friends

209
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,916
can tell us what
we need to know.

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,416
Uhh?! It's best not to stop
the men once they get started.

211
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,958
I'm sure if we
keep looking...

212
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,916
Oh... Hey,
there we go!

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,791
There's still a small band
of Nameks in quadrant three.

214
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,875
You see? There's two of
them, due north.

215
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,916
And the third is
approaching from the East.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,833
Somehow, they've managed to
avoid detection until now.

217
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,291
As usual, my men weren't
nearly as thorough

218
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,333
as they should have been
while searching the planet...

219
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,458
Normally, I'd be angry,
but in this case,

220
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,791
their incompetence has turned
out to be rather fortunate,

221
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,291
wouldn't you say?

222
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,541
Lord Frieza, just
give me one hour

223
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,708
and I'll find out
everything you need to know

224
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,000
about the
Dragon Balls!

225
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,750
I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

226
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,416
But I prefer to
handle this myself.

227
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,291
I've dealt with
enough Nameks now

228
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,375
that I know exactly
what buttons to push

229
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,458
to make them spill
their secrets...

230
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,916
You stay here,
Captain Ginyu.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,625
I'm counting on you to
keep my Dragon Balls safe!

232
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,666
Right! You can
count on me, Lord!

233
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,541
I'll guard
them with my life!

234
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:49,833
Ha! Ready or not,
Nameks... Here I come!

For Piccolo... For Yamcha...

240

They're all
counting on me...

[RECOOME chuckles]

242
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,333

to let them down!

I... won't... quit...

up. Neither will I.

Well... Who's
the big man, huh?

Really, kid...

00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,833
I've fought some stubborn
characters in my day...

But you...
You take the cake.

Now! Let Recoome
show you your doom!

gonna let you win!

so we can report back to Frieza!

00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,875
[BURTER] Yeah, we don't
want to spend all day

who that is?

[BURTER] We're not
expecting anybody...

305
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,541
Maybe some Nameks
coming home from vacation?

has arrived on Planet Namek!

he's ready to face
the challenges ahead.

But even with all of
his awesome strength,

314
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,125
will he be able to
save his friends?

315
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,333
Or is he already
too late?
