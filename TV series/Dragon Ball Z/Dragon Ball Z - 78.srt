1
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,458
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,583
Piccolo and Nail
fused into one being.

3
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,000
And while Goku was
still trying to heal,

4
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,541
the battle between
Frieza and the warriors

5
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,583
from the planet Earth began.

6
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,666
Fool!

7
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,750
[NARRATOR] Luckily, Vegeta
became their ally once again,

8
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,083
and was taking most of the
heat from the evil super-power.

9
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,333
[NARRATOR] With Vegeta's
increased strength,

10
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,666
it seemed like an even match
between the two warriors.

11
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,083
[NARRATOR] But Vegeta knew
that Frieza was holding back

12
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,791
and he began to talk
Frieza into transforming

13
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,166
and revealing his true power!

14
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,541
[NARRATOR] But look out!

15
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,291
Perhaps pushing for
the transformation

16
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,500
wasn't the wisest
decision after all.

17
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,041
What danger awaits Krillin,
Gohan, and Vegeta now?

18
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,500
Find out today!

19
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:55,250
[FRIEZA growls]

20
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,875
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN shout]

21
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,583
[FRIEZA] Ahh...

22
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,375
[BOTH whimper]

23
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,250
[FRIEZA giggles]

24
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,833
So? Who do you think
you're fooling?

25
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,208
You grew two inches and
got rid of your armor!

26
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,750
You call that a transformation?

27
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,333
[FRIEZA giggles]

28
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,708
[FRIEZA] Oh, Vegeta, it pains me
to see you behaving this way.

29
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:47,333
What a waste. I had
favored you so much.

30
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:51,125
Why couldn't you just
have continued to obey me?

31
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,291
Obey? I only pretended
to obey you, you idion!

32
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,875
I've been waiting patiently

33
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,541
for any chance I could get to
destroy you once and for all!

34
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,625
Yes, you're just like
you're father, aren't you?

35
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,333
The good king.

36
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,375
[FRIEZA] You probably don't
remember your father very well,

37
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,166
do you Vegeta?

38
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,666
[KING VEGETA] What? The planet
Tazbah hasn't been occupied yet?

39
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,958
No, Sire! The resistance
there is much stronger

40
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,291
than we ever expected.

41
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,208
We're now estimating
three more days.

42
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,500
Three days?!

43
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,083
[SOLDIER] Yes, Sire.

44
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,250
[KING VEGETA] Have you forgotten

45
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,291
that we promised to
deliver that planet

46
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,041
to Lord Frieza by tomorrow?!

47
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,750
No, of course not, Sire. I know!

48
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,291
But the full moon there
is three days away...

49
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,833
[KING VEGETA] Get lost!

50
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,291
[SOLDIER] Sire?

51
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,250
What's wrong? You heard me!

52
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,125
[SOLDIER screams]

53
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,041
[FRIEZA giggles]

54
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,333
[KING VEGETA] Hm?

55
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,166
[FRIEZA] You're such
a brute, Vegeta.

56
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,416
Those two days
didn't matter to me.

57
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,875
Oh, well! Too late.

58
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,041
You don't mind if
I sit down, do you?

59
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,958
Ah, that's better. Very comfy.

60
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,208
Now, are we still in
agreement about your son?

61
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:24,083
Yes, we are. You can have him.

62
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,791
[KING VEGETA growls]

63
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,041
Splendid!

64
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,916
You can bring him when
you come to inform me

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,875
about the progress on Tazbah.

66
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,458
Hmph.

67
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,708
You should try to be a little
more lenient on your subjects.

68
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,750
[FRIEZA laughs]

69
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,666
Please, Sire. We can't
hand over the Prince to him!

70
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,625
I'd rather die than do that!

71
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,750
Me too. But for now
we'll do as he says...

72
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,875
[ELITE SAIYAN] Please, Sire.

73
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,250
I don't have a choice, Zorn!

74
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,291
We have to strike when
the time is right!

75
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,833
If we act too hastily, they'll
be nothing left worth defending.

76
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,125
Yes, my King.

77
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,666
[KING VEGETA] Don't worry,
we'll have our day.

78
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,208
[FRIEZA giggles]

79
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,416
[FRIEZA] Oh, yes,
he had his day alright.

80
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,708
Just like you're
having yours now.

81
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you remember?

82
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,583
What are you saying?!

83
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,250
You were there, safely tucked
away in the bowels of my ship

84
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:33,083
while your father was
making his ill-fated plans.

85
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,625
[KING VEGETA] Remember now,

86
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,583
the Prince is on
board Frieza's ship,

87
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,916
so we want to try
and keep it intact.

88
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,666
[KING VEGETA] You are the
greatest fighters on our planet.

89
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,125
You are the elite!

90
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,958
Together you will fight and
together you will conquer!

91
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,333
[ZARBON] Lord Frieza!

92
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,083
King Vegeta has arrived escorted
by a squadron of his men.

93
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,708
He's requested an
audience with you.

94
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,208
Lord Frieza?

95
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,958
[FRIEZA] Zarbon, you would be
well-advised not to rush me.

96
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,458
Yes...

97
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,958
Now open the doors.

98
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,500
[ZARBON] As you wish, my lord.

99
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,500
Some of you, go! Take that way!

100
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,291
[CAPTAIN] There they are!

101
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,041
[KING VEGETA shouts]

102
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,000
[screams]

103
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,250
[grunting]

104
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,333
[KING VEGETA] Raaagh!

105
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,625
[HENCHMEN scream]

106
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,500
[distant rumbling]

107
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:14,041
[FRIEZA] Why, those
nasty monkeys!

108
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,500
Zarbon! Go ahead
and open my door.

109
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,541
Vegeta wanted an
audience with me

110
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,500
and that's what
he's going to get.

111
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,000
Right!

112
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,541
[FRIEZA] This is no way for
guests on my ship to behave!

113
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,333
[KING VEGETA] Frieza!
We have some business!

114
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,000
[KING VEGETA] It's over, Frieza!

115
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,125
We've come to put an end
to your reign of terror!

116
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,791
"We"? You and who else, Vegeta?

117
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,458
Your army is so petrified
that they're actually

118
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,666
turning blue in the face!

119
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,125
Hmm?

120
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,583
[KING VEGETA growls]

121
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,041
Fools!

122
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,666
[KING VEGETA growls]

123
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,750
The King! No!

124
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,916
Hm?

125
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,000
[FRIEZA] My, my, what a pity.

126
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,333
[ELITE SAIYANS gasp]

127
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,208
[FRIEZA] Don't be so glum guys.

128
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,250
You haven't lost
your king for good.

129
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,583
Wherever he is,
you're about to join him!

130
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,250
[ELITE SAIYANS growl]

131
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,958
[FRIEZA growls]

132
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:52,041
[ELITE SAIYANS scream]

133
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,291
I say we torch the
whole barrel of monkeys!

134
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,625
How 'bout it, Zarbon?

135
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,958
Is it necessary now that
Vegeta's out of the way?

136
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,708
Yes, because when one revolts,
the others are sure to follow!

137
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,250
You know, monkey see, monkey do!

138
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,375
[ZARBON gasps]

139
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,083
[ZARBON] Well...
I suppose you know best.

140
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,208
[FRIEZA] Just look at
all those lost sheep

141
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,750
waiting for the good
news from their king!

142
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,083
[FRIEZA cackles]

143
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,583
What? No!

144
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:53,250
[BARDOCK screams]

145
00:11:53,333 --> 00:12:03,291
[ELITE SAIYANS scream]

146
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:12,250
[ELITE SAIYANS scream]

147
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,291
[FRIEZA cackles]

148
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,583
Oh, my! This is... stupendous!

149
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:22,333
Wow! What a great show!
Unbelievable! Just look at that!

150
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:27,916
[FRIEZA cackles]

151
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:38,958
[FRIEZA] I really wanted you
to enjoy the fireworks, Vegeta.

152
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,750
They were to...
die for!

153
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,166
[VEGETA] How absurd! You
were afraid of the Saiyans

154
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,708
so you destroyed
their entire race

155
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,125
along with their whole planet.

156
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,166
And yet, you left
the strongest one alive.

157
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,041
You fool! This is one mistake
you're going pay dearly for!

158
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:59,000
[FRIEZA] Why you insolent tree
monkey! I've had enough of this!

159
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,291
You're the one who's
going to pay!

160
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,625
Talk! All you are
is a bunch of talk!

161
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,958
Allow me to show you something
that not even your father

162
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,083
saw in his lifetime!

163
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,083
What now?

164
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:13,833
[FRIEZA growls]

165
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:18,416
[shouting]

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,833
[FRIEZA yells]

167
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,625
[BOTH whimper]

00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,625
[FRIEZA yells]

169
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,583
[BULMA grunts]

170
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,958
Oh, man! I can't even go on.

171
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,541
No reason to live anymore,

172
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,250
except to get even
with those jerks!

173
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,500
[distant rumbling]

174
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,375
Hm?

175
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,416
[BULMA gasps]

176
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,291
[distant rumbling continues]

177
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,166
What the heck? What is it?

178
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,125
Hmm?!

179
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,500
[BULMA screams]

180
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:49,125

[BULMA screams]

183
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,291
Why me?! Why me?!

184
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,708
[roaring]

185
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,166
[BULMA] A cave!

186
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,916
Oh, my gosh!

187
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,666
[roaring]

188
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:27,583
[BULMA screams]

00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,583
[roaring]

190
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,833
[BULMA] Oh, no! I'm lunch meat!

191
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,958
[BULMA] Hm?

192
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,958
Hey, what's the deal?

193
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,583
What in the world
are they scared of?

194
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,041
[FRIEZA screams]

195
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,333
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN whimper]

196
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,625
[screaming continues]

197
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,333
Oh, crap!

198
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,375
[FRIEZA screaming]

199
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:27,875
[distorted screaming]

[whimpering]

203
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,166
[roaring]

204
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,833
Unbelievable! Absolute madness!

205
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,333
It was nice knowing
you, Krillin...

206
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,916
Yeah... So long, Gohan...

207
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,750
[FRIEZA chuckles]

208
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,583
Well, this is it! I hope
you're not disappointed.

209
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,833
[GOKU groans]

210
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,833
[GOKU] Uh-oh!
Something's not right.

211
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,708
Holy smoke!

212
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,708
All of a sudden it feels
like there are ten Friezas!

213
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,416
Hang on, Gohan!

214
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,666
[whimpering]

215
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,708
[FRIEZA] My, my, what's the
matter with you little insects?

216
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,208
You seem frightened!
Vegeta, you're speechless.

217
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,666
Don't tell me that you've run
out of bold threats already?

218
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,500
Such paultry playthings.

219
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,125
Not worth transforming for,

220
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,916
but I guess some amusement
is better than none.

221
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,291
[FRIEZA giggles]

222
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,291
[GOHAN] Wow...

223
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,333
Yeah. It retracts!

224
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,083
You like that, huh?
Why, thank you.

225
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:32,750
Most opponents never see it
coming! I'm somewhat impressed.

226
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,583
By the way, Vegeta.
Did I happen to mention

227
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:40,291
that my fighting power in
this form is over a million?

228
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,041
What? No way!

229
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,833
One million?

230
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:50,291
[VEGETA] I-I don't believe it!
That's impossible, even for him!

231
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:55,750
So, some non-believers, huh?
Well, allow me to demonstrate.

232
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,041
[grunting]

233
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,833
[yelling]

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,958
[screaming]

235
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,625
[PICCOLO] What's going on?!

236
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:49,666
No way! It's Frieza! How could
he have so much power? How?!

237
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:10,208
[GOHAN] Krillin! Hey, Krillin!

238
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,875
Where are you?!

239
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:13,666
[KRILLIN] Gohan!

240
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,625
Huh? You okay?

241
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,916
[KRILLIN grunts]

242
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,458
Nah! I'm fine! It's just
a scratch, no problem!

243
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:30,000
Now what's wrong? Please!
I can't take the long faces.

244
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:35,833
Cheer up! It's a beautiful day
to die! Don't you agree, Vegeta?

245
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,625
I mean really, what else
could you ask for?

246
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:43,875
The sun is shining!
The sea is a sparkly blue!

247
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,250
The mountains can be
seen in the background!

248
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,583
It's positively perfect!

249
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,208
Now all we have to do is decide
which one of you

250
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,958
gets to die first.

251
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,458
[DENDE] Krillin, I'm scared...

252
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,666
[FRIEZA] Now, let's see...

253
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,541
Hmmm...

254
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,541
[GOHAN gasps]

255
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,291
[DENDE whimpers]

256
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,083
[DENDE] Krillin...

257
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,916
[FRIEZA shouts]

258
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,625
Huh?!

259
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,083
[KRILLIN gasps]

260
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,666
[DENDE] Nooo!

261
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,750
Krillin! No!

262
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,208
My god!

263
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,708
[KRILLIN whimpers softly]

264
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,833
[DENDE whimpers]

265
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,541
[NARRATOR] Darkness
has descended

266
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:41,291
and the valiant Krillin
has met his end.

267
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,666
Can the monstrous
Frieza be stopped

268
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,750
before any more blood is shed?

269
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,958
No! How could you?!

270
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,791
[NARRATOR] On the
next Dragon Ball Z.
