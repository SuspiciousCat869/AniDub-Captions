00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Zl

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,375
it was Namek against machine

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,791
as Piccolo spear-headed the
battle against the Androids.

4
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,583
[NARRATOR]
After reuniting with Kami

5
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,666
and becoming a Super Namek,
the mighty Piccolo

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,916
was the only one on Earth

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,666
with enough strength to
challenge the Androids.

8
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,500
[NARRATOR]
As Piccolo fought,

9
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,708
Goku waited for
Vegeta and Trunks

10
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,916
to finish their task
in the Pendulum Room

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,750
so that he could
take his turn.

12
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,041
[GOKU] And, Son,
I know how you feel.

13
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,125
[NARRATOR]
Their mission:

14
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,291
To go beyond the level
of Super Saiyan

15
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,333
and achieve a new and
higher level of power.

16
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,500
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Bulma
wasn't wasting any time.

17
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,791
Using her extensive
knowledge of electronics,

18
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,541
she invented a remote control

19
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,583
that could cripple
the Androids' circuitry

20
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,916
and render them helpless.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,750
[TIEN] That's great!
Now we can destroy them!

22
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,458
[NARRATOR]
Back at the battlefield,

23
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,958
Piccolo was
proving himself

24
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,041
to be an equal match
for Android 17.

25
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,083
But his bid for
victory was cut short

26
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,375
when a much more formidable
adversary arrived!

27
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,041
[NARRATOR] Cell!

28
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,208
The android nemesis
that was cloned from

29
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,375
the cells of the greatest
fighters in the galaxy.

30
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,666
His purpose:

31
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,125
To integrate Androids 17
and 18 into his body

32
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,458
and become the most
powerful creature

33
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,416
in the entire universe.

34
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,250
[CELL]
Hello, Piccolo.

35
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,166
Thank you for 
bringing 17 and 18 here.

36
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,125
It pleases me greatly.

37
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,000
Aahhh...

38
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,791
[PICCOLO] Oh, great. I thought
I'd have more time than this.

39
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,375
Man! Now what?

40
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,333
If he merges with those
two, it's all over!

41
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,791
Hey! What is that thing?

42
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,375
[thinking]
He doesn't know!

43
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,583
They don't even
know who Cell is!

44
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,041
[CELL sighs]

45
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,166
I have been aching to
behold this for so long.

46
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,875
It's almost as if
I've seen them before;

47
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,291
I recognize them somehow.

48
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,750

Amazingly efficient!

[CELL] Wha...?
Who is this one?

51
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,041
He bears the
Red Ribbon insignia,

52
00:04:56,125 --> 00:05:00,583
he must be one of Gero's
earlier, less efficient models.

53
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:09,208
I have sniffed the bouquet,
and now it's time to drink.
