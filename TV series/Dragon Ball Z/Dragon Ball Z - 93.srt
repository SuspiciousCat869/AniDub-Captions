1
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,791
[NARRATOR] Last time
on DragonBall Z,

2
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,750
Frieza was still
taking shots at Goku.

3
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,500
[NARRATOR] And though
it seemed Goku

4
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,166
was throwing his arms
up in defeat,

5
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,583
he was actually powering up
for the ultimate attack.

6
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,125
[NARRATOR] Taught by King Kai,
this attack called on

7
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,375
the entire Namek
solar system for help,

8
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,875
drawing its energy from every
living organism around.

9
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,958
[GOKU thinking] I know I
shouldn't use the Spirit Bomb.

10
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,750
Its force could wipe
out this entire planet...

11
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:02,041
[FRIEZA] Pity.
He tries so hard.

12
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,541
[NARRATOR] But in
all his arrogance,

13
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,541
Frieza hasn't realized the
danger of the incoming assault,

14
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,125
thinking the weakened
Goku is merely trying

15
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,000
to delay his own demise.

16
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,000
[KRILLIN gasps]

17
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,375
There... in the sky!

18
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,083
That's the Spirit Bomb!

19
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,083
[NARRATOR] With the fate of
the universe on the line,

20
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,666
could it be the last hope?

21
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,416
Find out, today!

22
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:41,125
[GOKU grunts weakly]

23
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:53,833
[weak grunting]

24
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:07,833
[GOKU grunts weakly]

25
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:57,541
[GOKU grunts weakly]

26
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,541
[thinking] What is he doing?

27
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:03,375
I can't figure him out.
Is he taking a break?

28
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,750
[GOKU thinking] I call upon the
trees and the water, the sun,

29
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,458
the moon and the stars,
the plants and the animals...

30
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,375
All living things...

31
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,708
Let me share your power!

32
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,750
[GINYU] Ribbit... Ribbit...

33
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,916
Tell me,
Mr. Frog,

34
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
how strong do you
think Goku really is?

35
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,250
I mean, I know he's
strong and everything,

36
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,083
and that he did learn
from Master Roshi

37
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,791
which does account
for something...

38
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,041
And when he was a kid,

39
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,833
he won every competition
he ever entered.

40
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,750
Goku beat every single person
that tried to take him on.

41
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,208
[GINYU groans]

42
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,125
Do you understand?!

43
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,583
[GINYU croaks]

44
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,291
I guess what I'm saying is
I hope Goku's strong enough

45
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,333
to beat that horrible alien.

46
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,333
Hey, you're a friend of
that freak, aren't you?!

47
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,833
[GINYU growls]

48
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,291
Well, you better tell
your buddy back there

49
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:32,333
that he better give up before
Goku decides to get serious!

50
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,375
And don't think
I didn't warn you!

51
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,041
[GINYU] Ribbit...

52
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,041
[BULMA] Get going!

53
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,708
You don't have
any time to waste!

54
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,625
Ah, man, look at it!

55
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,416
It gets bigger every second!

56
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,958
I've never seen
anything like it!

57
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,458
[GOHAN] Krillin, do you
think it will keep growing?

58
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,625
[KRILLIN] I'm not sure...

59
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,041
It all depends on
Goku's concentration.

60
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,208
[GOHAN] Ohh!

61
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,958
The ball's around
50 metres in diameter,

62
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,041
which means Goku must
be drawing energy

63
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,875
from other planets as well...

64
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,500
And if that's the case,
there's no telling how big

65
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,083
the Spirit Bomb will become!

66
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,708
Frieza doesn't seem to be
capable of detecting the attack.

67
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,041
So tell me what's taking
Goku so long to use it?

68
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,375
Probably because Goku
doesn't think it's big enough

69
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,083
to defeat Frieza...

70
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,125
At least that's the only
explanation I can think of.

71
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,916
[GOHAN] Oh, please hurry, Dad...

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,583
There isn't much time left!

73
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,916
[thinking] Stars in heaven,
give me more power!

74
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,500
One question,
my unworthy opponent:

75
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,750
What do you think you're doing?

76
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,291
Watering your garden?

77
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,916
An interesting way of
spending your last few minutes

78
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,041
before I annihilate you.

79
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,833
[GOKU growls]

80
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,875
[thinking] Drawing in enough
power is taking too long!

81
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,666
I just hope he holds off
for a few more minutes!

82
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,875
Recoome!

83
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,916
Burter!

84
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,125
Jeice!

85
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,125
Guldo!

86
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,916
[GINYU FORCE]
All of us together are...

87
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,291
the one and only Ginyu Force!

88
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,166
Well, I can see that
they're impressed!

89
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,500
[JEICE] I gotta admit our
fighting poses are awesome

90
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,000
no matter how many
times we do them!

91
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,750
Ohhhh!

92
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,833
By the looks of it this place
seems to be a real nice planet.

93
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,041
I think we should make it our
new fighting headquarters.

94
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,458
Now that sounds a plan!

95
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,375
And, using our
superior strength,

96
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,500
we, the Ginyu Force,
will conquer this planet!

97
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,375
Tien...

98
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,791
these guys are idiots!

99
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,125
You can say that again.
And If I'm not mistaken,

100
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:04,291
wasn't it the Ginyu Force that
took on Vegeta and got beat?

101
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,000
I think you're right!

102
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,125
So, you're friends
with Vegeta's, huh?

103
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,041
That makes things
a little clearer...

104
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,333
We're the Ginyu Force.

105
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,041
The most elite fighting
force in the universe.

106
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,708
Your friend Vegeta was
an insignificant worm

107
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,041
compared to us!

108
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,333
That's right!

109
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,416
We would have beaten
that monkey with one blow

110
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,166
except we ran into
a little bad luck!

111
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,458
[ALL] Hmph.

112
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,250
Yeah, but that's all
ancient history...

113
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,916
Besides, we are here now
and we like this place.

114
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,750
And we are going
to make it our home!

115
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:41,208
So why don't you make
like a hair and split!

116
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,083
Hey, just who do
you think you are?!

117
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,833
It's you who's going to leave!

118
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,666
[CHIAOTZU] Yeah, get lost!

119
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,708
[GULDO laughs]

120
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,791
Please, don't
make me laugh!

121
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,958
[GULDO laughs]

122
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,291
If they want to fight,

123
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,541
bring it on!

124
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,458
'Cause I believe we all
could use the exercise!

125
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,541
Ohhhh!

126
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,458
Wait a second...

127
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,958
Remember what our
fearless leader said?

128
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,958
"When on a new planet, make sure
that you test your powers first!

129
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,666
Because the
climate might affect

130
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,666
your ability to fight!"

131
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,375
You got a point
there, Recoome.

132
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,791
All right...

Nicely done!

On a scale of one to
ten, definitely eleven!

There's ten times
the gravity up here!

 What a strange fellow?

Hey, Odd-Ball, how would you
like to come andplay with us?!

With your
limited powers,

168
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,375
I don't think it would
be a very fair fight...

[RECOOME guffaws]

Oh, you're making
a joke, huh?

171
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,500
Well, then, why
don't you try me

172
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,500
and figure it out for yourself?

173

to quit stalling?

Not yet...

What seems to
be the problem?

189
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,000

decided to give up?

And this may sound strange...

I never could
quite understand

your pathetic Saiyan mind.

But that really
doesn't matter now.

What is that up there?!

244

It's some kind of
enormous ball of energy...

business to take care of!

[FRIEZA] So that's what he's
been up to all this time!

Collecting energy
into one giant ball!

But where did he
get so much power?!

turn and run for it!

C'mon, get moving
before I use it!

Oh no, he's not taking the bait!

260
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,333
He must know it's
not strong enough yet!

Oh, I get it.

That ball is your idea
of a clever diversion.

Well I hate to ruin
your little "game",

won't work on me!

finish collecting energy

for your attack!

got to hurry up!

power I had left in me!

[FRIEZA growls]

00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,666

one pitiable Namek who got away!

them what you've got!

Goku to gather enough energy

for his Spirit Bomb Attack?
