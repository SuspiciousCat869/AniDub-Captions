1
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,083
[NARRATOR]
Previously, on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,125
the wicked wizard, Babidi,

3
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,750
resurrected the radically
powerful Majin Buu!

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,958
[NARRATOR] Though the misguided
Buu eventually saw the light,

5
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,833
his evil counterpart
destroyed the Earth

6
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,250
and had no intention
of stopping there!

7
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,500
[NARRATOR] With the entire
universe in danger of extinction

8
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,250
the Dragon of Namek was
summoned to bring the Earth

9
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,958
and its inhabitants
back to life!

10
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,333
And in a desperate
bid to stop Buu,

11
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,583
humanity offered up its
collective energy to Goku,

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,500
who used it to form
a massive Spirit Bomb!

13
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:58,125
[NARRATOR] The future of the
universe was now in his hands!

14
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,625
[NARRATOR] At last
the nightmare was over!

15
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,500
Once again Goku
had found a way!

16
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,250
The curse was lifted!

17
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:16,916
And now the story continues, ten
years since that fateful day!

18
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,583
Huh! That's weird!

19
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,666
She seems to be running
a little sluggish.

20
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,333
Nah, I'd rather fly
the old fashioned way.

21
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,250
[TRUNKS]
It's tune-up time for you!

22
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,458
Much better!

23
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,208
Yeah!

24
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,333
Whoa.

25
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,708
[TRUNKS] It's been so long
since I've been here!

26
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,125
[TRUNKS]
Hello?

27
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,166
Anyone home?

28
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,916
[CHICHI]
We don't want any!

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,166
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

30
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,083
Oh! It's you, Trunks!
Welcome to Mount Paoz!

31
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:02,666
It's great to be out here!
Say ah, is Goten around?

32
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,333
Well, when he wants to be.

33
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,250
Right now he's
out with his father.

34
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,958
They left this morning.

35
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,166
But hey! Go ask Gohan.

36
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,166
I'm sure that he
knows where they are.

37
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,250
Oh that's cool! I actually
wanted to see Gohan anyway!

38
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,666
It's nice to see
you again, ChiChi.

39
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,458
Hey! Knock, knock!

40
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,333
Hello? Gohan?

41
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,166
Huh?

42
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,791
Good afternoon! Welcome!

43
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,083
This is the mid-day
edition of Wether News!

44
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,250
Where we bring you
the latest breaking news...

45
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,833
[GOHAN]
I don't believe it!

46
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,958
Trunks! What are you
doing down there?

47
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,791
Hey! Long time no see!

48
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,791
Yeah! What a great surprise!

49
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,375
Would you mind grabbing
some of these for me?

50
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,125
Sure!

51
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:14,083
Oh, wow! These books, you're
doing a bit of reading, huh?

52
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,500
[GOHAN]
You could say so!

53
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,916
I'm getting ready
for a big conference!

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,500
Oh, hey! Put
those on the table!

55
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,500
Sorry about that.

56
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,625
[TRUNKS]
Whoa!

57
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,083
Dad was right! You're a
bit of a nerd, aren't you?

58
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,291
[GOHAN]
Well maybe, yeah!

59
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:35,041
Videl come on down and
say hi to an old friend.

60
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,000
[VIDEL] Trunks! Wow, what a
surprise! How've you been?

61
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,708
Oh, pretty good!
It's nice to see ya!

62
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,916
[VIDEL] It's been way
too long! Look at you!

63
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,458
You're a young man now!

64
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,000
[MR. SATAN]
What? Who says I'm too old?

65
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:52,166
Why my megaton punch is as
strong as ever! Watch this!

66
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,833
[TV] Check your local listings
for tomorrow's tournament!

67
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,291
[sighs]

68
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:11,083
That's my dad, all right!
He has no shame whatsoever!

69
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,791
Well, he is the World Champion!

70
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,250
Besides, my dad said

71
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,458
that he really helped
him and Goku beat Buu!

72
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,250
I just wish he would stop
taking credit for things

73
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,250
that he really didn't do!

74
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,750
It's like he's a
professional wrestler

75
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,166
and the whole world is his ring!

76
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,541
So, uh, Trunks,

77
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,583
what brings you all the
way out here from west City?

78
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,041
I almost forgot! I came
up here looking for Goten.

79
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,250
Oh! He's out training
with my dad on the south face!

80
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,875
Your folks are on
their way out there as well!

81
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,833
Huh? They didn't
say anything to me!

82
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,458
[GOKU]
Yeah! Hahahaha!

83
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,541
[GOTEN]
Ow!!

84
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,708
[GOHAN]
Ha, ha, ha! Gotcha!

85
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,500
[GOTEN]
Hey! That's not fair!

86
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,041
[GOKU]
Why not?

87
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,875
[GOTEN] You're in
for it now, Dad!

88
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,583
[GOKU]
Oh, yeah?

89
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:03,041
Now tell me! What's
so important about this?

90
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,833
[pants]

91
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,916
One of these days the shoe's
going to be on the other foot!

92
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,333
[giggles]

93
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,291
Huh?

94
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,625
Hey!

95
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,958
Wow! What a surprise!
How ya doin'?

96
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,625
Now you wouldn't know
that! Would you, Goku?

97
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,041
How could you?

98
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,250
You never call and if we
didn't come to visit you--

99
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,125
we'd probably
never see you again!

100
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,041
Hey! Come on!
You know that's not true!

101
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,958
Didn't we just see each
other not too long ago?

102
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,791
Five years, Goku!

103
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,416
Every time we get
together with everyone,

104
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,625
you say you have to train!

105
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,250
[GOKU]
Well, it's true! I uhh...

106
00:08:55,333 --> 00:09:00,000
Uhhhh... Huh? Heh...

107
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,583
[GOKU] Whoa!
It really has been long!

108
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,208
[BULMA]
What do you mean?

109
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,791
What? Say it!

110
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,041
Well... it's just that
you look middle aged!

111
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,875
Shut your rude mouth!

112
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,500
I'll have you know
that most people think

113
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,833
I look good for my age!

114
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,708
Excuse me for not being an alien
monster that never changes!

115
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,541
We Saiyans evolved
as a warrior race!

116
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:28,000
We retain our youthfulness
so we can fight longer!

117
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,291
Hmph! I guess your race didn't
evolve with enough brains

118
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,208
to have good manners!

119
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,250
By the way, Kakarot!

120
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,541
Is it true that you
are going to be fighting

121
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,708
in the World Championships?

122
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,333
Yep! Sure am!
And you should compete as well!

123
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,416
You can't beat
those stadium hotdogs!

124
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,625
Hot dogs? Enough already!

125
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,625
Tell me the real
reason you're fighting.

126
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,375
Okay, but I'd really
rather talk about hot dogs!

127
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,541
But if you insist
there's this guy

128
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,916
who signed up
to fight yesterday!

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,833
I think he might be really good!

130
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,458
Really?

131
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,125
Hmm...

132
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,833
You'd think I could
sensed a spirit like that.

133
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,458
That's true. If he wasn't
suppressing his energy!

134
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,250
No, I think this
guy is really shrewd!

135
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,000
We may have
ourselves a challenge!

136
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:17,666
Hmm! I don't believe it!
A real fighter on this planet?

137
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,750
Is he an alien or what?

138
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,208
Uh-uh! This guy's an Earthling!

139
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,208
An Earthling?

140
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,958
Wait, are you talking about
some kind of android, Kakarot?

141
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,250
Nope! This guy
is home grown.

142
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,458
One hundred
percent human being.

143
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,333
[BULMA]
How could that be possible?

144
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,291
You and Vegeta are the best.

145
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,041
There's no way an Earthling
could be on par with you!

146
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,791
Give me a break!

147
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,875
[GOTEN]
Trunks?

148
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,458
I don't believe it!

149
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,500
[TRUNKS]
Hey!

150
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,291
Now, Trunks!
Hay is for horses, son!

151
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,750
[TRUNKS]
Grass too, Mom!

152
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,791
So! Just grazing, huh?

153
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,541
I thought you'd be training!

154
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,458
Are you going to be
fighting in the tournament

155
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,833
or are you chickening out?

156
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,333
Yeah, my dad's
gonna make me fight.

157
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,875
I actually had a
date for tomorrow night.

158
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,666
Until he made me...
cancel, that is!

159
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,875
Aw, come on, Goten!

160
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,416
There's plenty time
after the tournament!

161
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Hm! So your son has the
same slack attitude as mine?

162
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,375
[GOKU chuckles]

163
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,041
Well, it's easy to get a
little soft in times of peace.

164
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,500
Ahh... Excellent!

165
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,125
Now there's a real go-getter!

166
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,958
Well, look who it is!

167
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:44,166
Grandpa! I just flew around
world again! Good, huh?

168
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,041
Yeah! I think that was
your fastest time yet, Pan!

169
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,416
Think I'll be ready
for tomorrow then?

170
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,791
Wait? No way!

171
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,000
Pan! You're not
really going to fight

172
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,291
in the tournament
tomorrow, are you?

173
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,166
Yeah! Of course I am!

174
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,708
What? But there's not going
to be a junior division

175
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,833
at the tournament
this year, guys!

176
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,833
Don't tell me she's
fighting with adults!

177
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,458
Ah, don't you guys
worry about Pan.

178
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,041
She can hold her own in
just about any division!

179
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,708
She might not
win the championship,

180
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,666
but she'll do just fine.

181
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,833
Pan has the right attitude!
I'm going to enter as well!

182
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,750
And guess what else?
Trunks is entering!

183
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,583
Aren't you, son?

184

I'll cut your allowance in half!

come by? We're your friends!

Yeah! Ten years from now!

Oh man, I don't know
what it is about that guy,

mad at him very long! Hah!

this the way we always do, Buu!

261
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,916
You're going to go out there
and beat all of the challengers

262
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,416
and then of course
lose to me in the finals.

263
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,041
But remember to be very gentle
in those early rounds

264
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,500
so the other
challengers don't withdraw!

265
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,208
One of these days
maybe I'll let you win

and you can be Champion!

If one of us makes
it to the finals,

the victory, is that okay?

Wow! Really?
You'd really do that?

Of course we would! Why not?

294
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,500
But that's assuming we make it!

I mean, someone else
might make it to the finals!

00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,333
Well, I'm not gonna
take this sitting down!

317
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,041
This is absurd!

318
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,000
Wait! Bulma! Please!
Let me go talk to my father!

319
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,333
Look, Mama!
I can see everything!

320
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,666
Wonderful!

321
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,125
Well, sometimes it pays
to know the right people, huh?

322
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,500
Ahh! What a relief!

323
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,916
Yeah! Bulma was about to
go ape on us! Hahahahaha!

324
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,875
Huh?

325
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,541
Ooo! Someone's coming, Mama!

326
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,250
[ANNOUNCER clears throat]

327
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,750
Ladies and Gentlemen,

328
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,916

It's time to introduce
you to our finalists!

330
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,208

these great athletes

331
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,208
who have passed
the preliminary rounds!

332
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,916
[ANNOUNCER]
Yes! Yes! Give it up! Yeah!

333
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,916
Hey! Goten! Who was it that won
the last time we fought here?

334
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,125
That was last time!

335
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,541
Yay!

336
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,500
Aa! There he is!

337
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,583
All right! Go! Go! Buu!

338
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,250
Whoa! Check out the Buu!

339
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,041
He's become really
popular with the ladies!

340
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,875
[ANNOUNCER] All right!
All right! Here they are!

341
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,875
The greatest
fighters in the world!

342
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:22,125
Each vying for the right
to be called World Champion!

343
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,375
Which one will it be, folks?
Your guess is as good as mine!

344
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,916
[ANNOUNCER] And now it's time
for the fighters to draw lots

345
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,916
to see how they'll be matched up
in these exciting first bouts

346
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,041
of the final rounds!

347
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,666

is about to be fired!

349
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:48,041
Who is the mysterious fighter
whom Goku was speaking of?

350
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,166
And which competitor will
be named the new Number One
