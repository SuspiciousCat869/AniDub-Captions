[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,208
Cell displayed
a most uncanny ability.

4
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,583
It's hard to believe,
but Cell can use

5
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:25,125
the special attack moves
of all the other fighters!

6
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,833
Yes, even Goku's
mighty Kamehame-Ha Wave

7
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,583
is a part of the Android's
deadly arsenal...

8
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,041
a fact Piccolo
found out the hard way!

9
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,250
[NARRATOR] With this
incredible ability unleashed,

10
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,625
it seemed that the
injured Namek had no choice

11
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,041
but to raise the white flag.

12
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,416
But Piccolo had a plan.

13
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,666
I am Cell.

14
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,208
I am an android
created by the great Dr. Gero.

15
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,541
[NARRATOR] Counting on
Cell's unbridled arrogance,

16
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,708
Piccolo persuaded
the mysterious Android

17
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,083
to divulge the story
of his origin!

18
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,958
It seems Cell has traveled here
from 24 years in the future,

19
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,500
in search of a very
specific energy source.

20
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:13,291
[CELL] I now require the energy
of Androids 17 and 18.

21
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,000
Once I have
absorbed them I will be

22
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,833
the most powerful being
who has ever lived!

23
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,041
[NARRATOR] But while Cell
was busy telling all,

24
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,250
Piccolo had enough time to
regenerate his injured arm.

[NARRATOR] Back in one piece,
Piccolo stands ready

29
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,333
to fight the Android once again.

30
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,958
But will his powers
be enough? Find out today!

31
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,041
[thinking] That's odd!

32
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,750
This storm just
blew up out of nowhere!

33
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,333
And there seems to be
a great energy behind it.

34
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,666
[thinking] It's gonna take
all I've got to help Piccolo.

I just hope I'm not too late.

Don't give me all the credit--
the idea was Kami's.

Kami?

Mmm... Ah, yes... Kami!

Now you've got it... Ha!

not as dumb as I am!

Yeah!
He smiled all right!

[ROSHI] It's that same
peculiar smile he gets

177
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,708
just before he's about to
engage in a colossal battle.

He needed to get stronger
to fight the Androids,

[stammers]

322
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,791
[BUS DRIVER yells]

323
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,666
[birds chirpping]

324
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,333
I hope you know
how much I hate this outfit!

325
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,416
I look like a cowgirl!

326
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,000
Do you think
we'll have the time

327
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,625
to find me something better?

328
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,625
I suppose...

329
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,000
Just a brief stop in Nickytown

330
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,250
and then it's off
to find those Androids.

331
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,625
[KRILLIN] Are you serious?!

332
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,458
[VEGETA] You're saying
he possesses cells

333
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,833
from Kakarot and me?!

334
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,708
We have two choices.

335
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,916
We can either track down
and destroy Cell

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,458
or find Androids 17 and 18.

337
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,833
Because if we destroy them,
then Cell cannot absorb them

338
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,500
and reach his final form.

339
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:51,291
[PICCOLO] I say we go for Cell
since he'll be easier to find.

340
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,291
Whatever we do,
we must do it quickly

341
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,500
because there'll be no stopping
Cell once he is complete.

342
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:04,458
[gasps]

343
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,291
[VEGETA thinking]
This cannot be happening!

344
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,833
Every time I reach
a new level of strength,

345
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:13,333
a greater power appears
to challenge my authority!

346
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,458
It's as if fate
is laughing at me

347
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:19,625
with a big stupid grin,
just like Kakarot!

348
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,791
Look at all the savory people...

349
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,625
[chuckles]

350
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,750
It's a pity I won't
be able to stay too long.

351
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,791
[CELL] Wait for me,
Androids 17 and 18.

352
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,500
I'll be ready
for you soon enough!

353
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,791
[NARRATOR] Terror has
descended upon Nickytown!

354
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,333
Can anything save its citizens
from being sucked away

355
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:53,333
by Cell's deadly tail?
Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
