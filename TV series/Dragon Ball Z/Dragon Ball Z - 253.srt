[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,791
With the wizard Babidi no longer
acting as his puppeteer,

3
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:22,833
the hideous Majin Buu set
forth to destroy the world.

4
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,208
And he came dangerously close!

5
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,416
[NARRATOR But somewhere beneath
the surface of the Earth,

6
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,375
the last hope of
a savior was waiting.

7
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,125
The world champion Mr. Satan

8
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,000
emerged from his
training facility,

9
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,583
determined to put an end

10
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,083
to Majin Buu's violent rampage!

11
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,000
[NARRATOR] But his method
of attack was quite different

12
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,916
from any the Z Fighters
had thought to try.

13
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,875
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

14
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:59,750
[NARRATOR] And, unfortunately,
it was also less productive.

15
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,125
[BUU] Buu really like when
the video game goes boom!

16
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,958
Wow, that's the part
most people would hate.

17
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,375
[thinking] Yeah, you just
enjoy your bath, tubby.

18
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,875
I've got you right
where I want you.

19
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,333
I hope.

20
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,250
[GOKU] Do you think
that Gohan's power

21
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,458
is really going to increase
like that old dude says?

22
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,625
I don't about you two,
but all this sitting still

23
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,916
just makes me want
to take another nap.

24
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,500
It will work.

25
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,833
There is no reason
to doubt my ancestor.

26
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,833
He seems very
confident of the process.

27
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,291
[GOKU]
I guess.

[snores]

32
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,125

Where am I?!

35
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,708
You fell asleep, didn't you?

36
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,750
No, I didn't!

37
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,916
I was in a meditative state!

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,208
It just appeared
that I was asleep.

39
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,208
It appeared to me
that you were snoring.

40
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,250
To the untrained, meditation
can appear as sleeping.

41
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,166
Besides, it's a well-known
fact that Kais do not lie.

[OLD KAI]
So, come now,

43
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,708
this is no time to be
questioning your tutor.

44
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,500
Let's get back to work!

I don't care what he says,

49
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,375
you don't have
a bubble floating

from your nose if you're awake.

Now, it's time
for the next step.

52
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,708
You must try fusing
as Super Saiyans.

53
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,958
Right!

54
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,375
[PICCOLO]
And if you are successful,

00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,083
do not let your ambition
control your emotions.

Yeah, and on their
first try, too!

[PICCOLO] Yes, it's an
impressive transformation,

Not so fast.

It's dangerous, showing off
in a place like this.

What's that?!

We don't want to
blow everything up, do we?
