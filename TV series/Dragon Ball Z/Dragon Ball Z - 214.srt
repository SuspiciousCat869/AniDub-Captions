1
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,875
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,791
Trunks was named the new
Junior World Champion!

3
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:22,791
As his prize, he was given
the chance fight Mr. Satan.

4
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,375
It only took one punch
from the new champ

5
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:29,375
to send the old one
flying into a world of pain!

6
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,166
[NARRATOR] And as the
Z Warriors were preparing

7
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,125
for the main event, the World
Martial Arts Championship,

8
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,833
they encountered two strangers.

9
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:48,458
Good afternoon. You wouldn't be
Goku by any chance, would you?

10
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,250
Well, your reputation as a great
fighter proceeds you!

11
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,375
I was hoping for a chance to
fight you during the tournament.

12
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,833
Uh...

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,041
Huh?

14
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,583
Gosh! Well, thank you!

15
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,291
[NARRATOR] These mysterious
newcomers are overflowing

16
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,208
with enormous power.

17
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,250
And they're eager to fight Goku.

18
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,208
Is this some sign of trouble
on the horizon?

19
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,500
Or are these just two more
contestants that will be

20
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,333
sent to the floor?

21
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,333
Today, on Dragon Ball Z!

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,166
Those two are
not to be trusted.

23
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,708
[chuckling]

24
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,000
Why?

25
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,416
[PICCOLO] I sense
something from them

26
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,291
and I'm not sure what it is.

27
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,916
They're very powerful,
but their power is... different.

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,166
[VIDEL] Huh?

29
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,125
Why can't we trust them?
They seem nice enough.

30
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,416
Uh... Well,
sometimes Piccolo is...

31
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,583
a little on the paranoid side.

32
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,750
I guess you're right.

33
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,541
He does seem a little
bit high strung.

34
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,625
[PICCOLO growls]

35
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,125
C'mon, guys,
let's get out of here...

36
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,916
I wanna find out who they got
fighting in the tournament.

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,750
Yeah, good idea!

38
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,541
[MR. SATAN groans]

39
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,625
[MR. SATAN] Darn that Trunks!

40
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,875
How does a
little kid like that...

41
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,375
pack so much power
into one punch?!

42
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,125
[TRUNKS] Goten,
you gotta check this out!

43
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,208
Yeah?

44
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,791
Okay.

45
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,791
Look at him...

46
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,500
That's a nice mask
and cape, huh?

47
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,500
[growling]

48
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,750
[GOTEN laughs]

49
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,333
[GOTEN] He looks like
he's wearing a dress.

50
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,833
[TRUNKS] Only people who've made
it through the elimination round

51
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,833
are allowed to be in
this area over here...

52
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,291
So, then... What d'ya see we
try and give it a shot?

53
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,541
[GOTEN] Huh...?

54
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,625
We can use that ugly mask
that he's wearing

55
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,541
to disguise ourselves.

56
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,208
Wait, I don't get it...

57
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,083
We very quietly sneak down
there, knock that moron out,

58
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,250
out, and take that
silly costume away from him.

59
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,958
Then the two of us can fight
in the championship.

60
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,541
Are you crazy, Trunks?!

61
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,875
We could get in so much trouble!

62
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,208
What's wrong?

63
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,625
You too chicken to go out
and fight with the grown-ups?

64
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,208
I'm not a chicken, Trunks...

65
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,708
Okay... So, let's do it!

66
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,583
No, wait!

67
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,875
Hello.

68
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, what?

69
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,875
You want somethin'?

70
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,375
There's this guy over there
who bet he can beat you

71
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,708
at arm wrestling
for a thousand zeni.

72
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,916
Who?

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,666
don't know, but he's
really skinny and small.

74
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,708
That sounds like easy money!

75
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,791
[TRUNKS] C'mon, he's right
around the corner...

76
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,708
I'm telling you, you're
so much stronger than him,

77
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,208
it's embarrassing!

78
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,625
Where is he, kid?

79
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,916
I could... I could
really use that money.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,916
Thousand zeni would
buy me that new cape

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,083
I've been eyeing all week!

82
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,333
[MASKED MAN yells]

83
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,000
Done!

84
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,375
What did you do?

85
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,666
We arm wrestled...

86
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,375
I won.

87
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,833
[MASKED MAN whimpers]

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,208
Pretty good job, huh, Goten?

89
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,375
Let's get this costume off.

90
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,750
[TRUNKS] Help me out, will ya?

91
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,875
[GOTEN] This isn't
going to fit you.

92
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,291
[TRUNKS] I know that.

93
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,625
[GOTEN] You're too small.
Everyone will notice.

94
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,541
[TRUNKS] I'm not
wearing it by myself.

95
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,875
You're wearing it with me!

96
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,416
What?!

97
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,333
With you?!

98
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,125
[MASKED MAN whimpers]

99
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,750
You don't think they'll
know that it's us?

100
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,208
Nah... don't worry about it.

101
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,583
Yeaaah!

102
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,625
[TRUNKS laughs]

103
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:40,208
Perfect! No one can tell.
We look great!

104
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,083
I'm not so sure...

105
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,791
Yeah. Oh!

106
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,041
Huh...?

107
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,500
They start drawing for
the pairings very soon.

108
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,416
[TRUNKS] Of course.
We're, er, I'm on my way.

109
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,416
Told ya!

110
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,833
Yeah!

111
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,708
I'm ready to fight--

112
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,125
Whoah, whu...

113
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,208
No, Goten, you're
walking the wrong way!

114
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,666
[GOTEN &amp; TRUNKS grunt]

115
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,458
[GOTEN] I can't see
where I'm going!

116
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,791
[TRUNKS] Then poke
out some eyeholes.

117
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,833
[GOTEN] That's a lot better!

118
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,250
Now we'll be invincible!

119
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,500
[KRILLIN] So, 16 fighters
in all, huh?

120
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,250
I sure hope at least one of them
is going to be worth fighting.

121
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,250
I don't want this
to get too boring...

122
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,125
Oh, you're here!

123
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,875
Hi!

124
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,291
Oooo... kay. Well, it
looks like everyone

125
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,083
who's supposed to
be here is here now.

126
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,541
Should we call in Mr. Satan?

127
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,333
[FRIAR #4] I'm sorry,
but Mr. Satan asked

128
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,708
if we would draw
without him.

129
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,333
He is a little incapacitated
at this time.

130
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,291
Okay, sure... I guess.

131
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,666
Okay, people!
This is how it works...

132
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,833
I will call your name,

133
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,875
and you will come up here
to draw a ball.

134
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,041
The balls you choose will
determine your opponent

135
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,125
in the match.

136
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,375
Okay...

137
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,916
I don't ask for much,

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,458
just please, please don't make
me fight any of my friends.

139
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:07,125
Krillin... destiny is not
something that you can control.

140
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,500
Hey, it never hurts
to try...

141
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,958
Especially not Goku!

142
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,500
[GOKU] Hmm...

143
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,875
Most of these guys look like

144
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,666
they're not going to
be much of a challenge...

145
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,083
But those two...

146
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,916
they really send chills
down my spine.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,083
[BOTH snarl]

148
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,958
Uh... I wonder what's
making them so angry?

149
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,625
Maybe they didn't have
a good breakfast...

150
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,416
Huh?

151
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,625
[TRUNKS &amp; GOTEN grunting]

152
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,125
[GOKU] Who's that?

153
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,166
Euugh...

154
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,375
Is he actually going
to wear that?!

155
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,041
He looks so weird!

156
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,041
When I call your name,
please come up...

157
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,125
Uh... Mister Killa!

158
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,583
Yeah!

159
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,333
Turn of mine...
first off, 14.

160
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,750
Thanks... Number
14 goes to Killa.

161
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,166
Number 14 goes to Killa!

162
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,583
Number 14 goes to Killa!

163
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,333
Lookie there!

164
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,541
They've already started pairing
people for the first round!

165
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,916
[CROWD cheers]

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,041
Next is... Kibito!

167
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,125
Kibito?

168
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,583
[KIBITO growls]

169
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,291
And... you're number 7.

170
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,750
Kibito is number 7.

171
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,875
[ANNOUNCER] And next up for the
drawing is, uh... Krillin.

172
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,000
Huh?

173
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,708
Guess it's my turn.

174
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,291
I hope my number's not
too late in the match.

175
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,333
What in the world
did I do to deserve this?!

176
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,791
[ANNOUNCER] It's time for
the Great Saiyaman.

177
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,250
Yes!

178
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,416
[GOHAN] Let's see here...

179
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,750
I'm number 8.

180
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,416
And that puts me up against...

181
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,791
Kibito.

182
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,125
Yikes!

183
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,208
He's a big guy,

184
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,166
but remember: a true warrior
fights with the mind.

185
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,833
Oh... right.

186
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,250
With the mind.

187
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,666
And now we have...

188
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,000
Miss Number 18?

189
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,375
[ANNOUNCER] Is, uh,
Number 18 your real name?

190
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,000
My father was pretty dull.

191
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,666
[ANNOUNCER gasps]

192
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,583
Now I'm number 9.

193
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,666
Shin's up next!

194
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,666
Ready.

195
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,208
[PICCOLO] Hm?!

196
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,625
[GOKU] Mm-hmm...

197
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,833
I'm number 3.

198
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,500
Shin and Kibito, huh?

199
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,833
I certainly hope that Piccolo
is wrong about those two.

200
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,625
[GOKU] He carries himself
with such grace...

201
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,250
like he hasn't got
a care in the world.

202
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,875
What's his secret?

203
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,666
We've got a lot of people out
there waiting for a good fight!

204
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,041
Hey, Goten...

205
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,333
What do you think
this guy's name is?

206
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,791
[GOTEN] I don't know.
Didn't you ask him?

207
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,166
Next in line we have
Spopovich...

208
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,583
You're up.

209
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,541
Hello?

210
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,083
Spopovich if you are here,

211
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,083
please step forward
for your number.

212
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,416
No one is answering.

213
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,083
This costume has gotta
belong to Spopo-whatever!

214
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,208
[GOTEN] Are you sure?

215
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,875
Yeah. Let's go.

216
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,583
[GOTEN] Alright.

217
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,875
[ANNOUNCER]
Is there a Spopovich here?

218
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,250
[TRUNKS] Coming!

219
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:48,750
I'm Spopo-hnnngh. Here I am!
I'm ready to draw now.

220
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,750
[TRUNKS grunts]

221
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,333
Give me a good one.

222
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,166
Excuse me, but aren't you
the one they call Mighty Mask?

223
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,625
Huh?

224
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,166
[SPOPOVICH]
Out of my way, you worm!

225
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,708
I am Spopovich!

226
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,291
Oh, yeah... hello.

227
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,166
[TRUNKS &amp; GOTEN grunt]

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,541
[TRUNKS] I can't believe this...

229
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,500
We totally made fools
out of ourselves!

230
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,791
[GOTEN] Don't blame me, Trunks.
This was all your idea!

231
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,750
Well, I must say...

232
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,708
You have changed a lot
since the last time I saw you...

233
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,125
Been drinking
that milk there, bud?

234
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,583
[ANNOUNCER] You're number 6.

235
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,458
[SPOPOVICH] Right!

236
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,708
Jeez...

237
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,166
Why didn't that big stupid oaf
just answer him

238
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,458
when he first called his name?

239
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,750
[ANNOUNCER] Next up
for the drawing is Jewl.

240
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,333
I am number 16.

241
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,125
[ANNOUNCER] Okay,
Jewl at number 16, then.

242
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,208
Oh yeah, Jewl's on
the board, man!

243
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,500
And I'm tellin' you that dude is
gonna take everyone else down!

244
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,916
[grunting]

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,375
Up yours! He don't stand a
chance against Mr. Satan!

246
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,916
Goku better get a good
spot on that board;

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,125
we need that grand prize!

248
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,041
It'll take a lot of luck to win

249
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,125
a competition as closely
matched as this one.

250
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,041
Father! Would you
watch your mouth?!

251
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,291
That is not the kind of support
I need from you today!

252
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,708
Do you understand that
if Goku doesn't win

253
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,625
we will be completely broke?!

254
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,500
We'll have no money at all!

255
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,666
And I refuse to raise
my son on the streets!

256
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,791
And if you don't
understand that,

257
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,375
then I'm really sorry for you.

258
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,875
Goku, your turn now!

259
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,041
Alright, here we go, Goku!

260
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,125
Which one will it be?

261
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,333
Ah!

262
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,625
It's number 11.

263
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,083
[GOKU laughs]

264
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,333
I wonder who
I'll end up fighting...

265
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,291
Well, I'll find out soon.

266
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,333
Next up is... Videl.

267
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,791
Yes!

268
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,291
Do you know
where my dad is?

269
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,500
Uh...

270
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,375
Mr. Satan is taking
a small rest right now.

271
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,000
Cool. Fifteen.

272
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,333
Hold it!

273
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,708
Did she just say that
Mr. Satan is her father?!

274
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:42,750
Yeah...

275
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,500
Keep your voice down, Dad.

276
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,250
Ah... I'm afraid I don't see the
resemblance between them...

277
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,541
She is quite the looker.

278
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,083
Really? I hadn't noticed...

279
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,541
You just throw on a
little bit of that charm

280
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,041
and I'm sure
she'll go out with you.

281
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,375
Shut up, Krillin!

282
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,833
I don't like her!
I never said that I liked her!

283
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,708
[KRILLIN laughs]

284
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,041
[KRILLIN] Right...

285
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,791
Pintar is number 2.

286
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,750
Huh?

287
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,041
That's my opponent?
And to think I was worried!

288
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,000
[PINTAR] You the one
they call "Krillin?"

289
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,166
Yep. That's me.

290
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,875
You may be a
scrawny little thing,

291
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,916
but I promise when we
get out in that ring,

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,041
you're gonna be
screaming for your mommy!

293
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,625
Yeah, you know...

294
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,750
That's just the sort of garbage
I expect to come out

295
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,625
of the mouth of
an incompetent fighter.

296
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,375
So, if you could just
go away now, thanks.

297
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,500
[KRILLIN sighs]

298
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,125
Ah! You brat!

299
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,375
You think that size
doesn't matter?!

300
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,916
Well, I'm gonna show you
otherwise, little man!

301
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,458
You should pick out a
coffin because you will die

302
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,041
out there today! You hear me?!

303
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,375
[ANNOUNCER] Vegeta, you're next!

304
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,833
[VEGETA] Hm?!

305
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,666
[VEGETA chuckles]

306
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,750
[GOKU gasps]

307
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,333
So, you're number 12?

308
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,291
Not the two of them!

309
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,166
Goku and Vegeta!

310
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,166
[FRIAR #5] Vegeta is number 12!

311
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,166
--[KRILLIN] Golly!
--[GOHAN gasps]

312
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,333
Vegeta and Goku
right off the bat!

313
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,250
That figures...

314
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,166
[VEGETA] A fight with Kakarot...

315
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,375
Perfect!

316
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,291
Just the opportunity
I've been waiting for

317
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,750
to prove my true
Saiyan abilities!

318
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,750
[TRUNKS] Cool! My dad's
going to fight your dad.

319
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,375
I wonder who'll win?

320
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,000
[GOTEN] I'm pretty sure
that my dad will.

321
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,416
Are you kidding?!

322
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,000
My dad is stronger and
faster than your dad any day!

323
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,166
But my brother told me
that my dad

324
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,500
is the strongest fighter
in the universe.

325
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,000
Mighty Mask... It's your turn
now. Why don't you come on down

326
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,791
here and make your draw?

327
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,500
Sorry... Coming!

328
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,708
Now, draw a good number.

329
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,166
Sure.

330
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,583
[TRUNKS] Lucky number 13!

331
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,125
[TRUNKS wails]

332
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,125
[ANNOUNCER] He doesn't look like
he's been working out much.

333
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,250
Majunior is up next!

334
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,708
[PICCOLO growls]

335
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,958
You're number 4.

336
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,875
[PICCOLO] I am the first
to fight Shin...

337
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,458
The first to know the
true extent of his power.

338
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:36,291
And seeing as Mr. Satan will be
taking some relaxation time

339
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:41,708
between bouts, I will
go ahead and draw for him.

340
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,583
And our Champion
is number 10!

341
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,166
Yes! Look, 18, you get to
fight Mr. Satan!

342
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,791
Great... I'm jumping for joy.

343
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:58,375
I wouldn't take it so lightly...
My dad's a dangerous man!

344
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,958
[ANNOUNCER] Last
but not least is Yamu!

345
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,333
[ANNOUNCER]
Safe to say that's 15!

346
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:14,250
There! We have a
full board of fighters!

347
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:19,000
[ANNOUNCER] In the first match
we have Krillin fighting Pintar!

348
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,541
Second match is
Shin versus Majunior!

349
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,458
The third match is
Videl and Spopovich!

350
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,708
Fourth match is Kibito
and the Great Saiyaman!

351
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,750
[NARRATOR] Match five is
Number 18 and Mr. Satan!

352
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,625
[ANNOUNCER] The sixth match
is Goku versus Vegeta!

353
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,041
The seventh match is
Mighty Mask against Killa!

354
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,916
And the eighth match
is Yamu versus Jewl.

355
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,208
[ANNOUNCER] The fighting will
commence immediately.

356
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,291
I will quickly show you all
to the waiting room.

357
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,833
I'm sure you know
the fighting rules.

358
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,791
You are the loser if you
give up, if I count to 10,

359
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,958
if you fall out of the
ring, or if you...

360
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,416
unfortunately...
kill your competitor...

361
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,750
Each match has a
time limit of thirty minutes,

362
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,875
and not a second more.

363
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,083
If there is not a victor decided
within the allotted time,

364
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,291
then that decision will be
left up to the judges.

365
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,500
Ah...

366
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,500
Thirty minutes
isn't long enough.

367
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,750
[PINTAR laughs]

368
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,958
Thirty seconds is too long
for you, tough guy!

369
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,000
Will you shut up?

370
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,041
[MR. SATAN] I'm in the
fifth match, huh?

371
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,833
Who am I fighting against?

372
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,291
[FRIAR #6] I'm not
really sure of her name,

373
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,750
but she is blonde
and quite attractive.

374
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,958
[MR. SATAN] Oh. Yeah!

375
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:46,458
Hey... Ladies and
gentlemen, are you ready?!

376
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,708
[CROWD cheers]

377
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,958
[BULMA] Yaaay! Ho-ho!

378
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:55,000
[cheering continues]

379
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:05,375
[PINTAR grunts]

380
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,583
This is so exciting!

381
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm gonna totally cut loose!

382
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,166
Now...

383
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,625
Let the Martial Arts
Championship begin!

384
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,666
[CROWD cheers]

385
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,000
[NARRATOR]
With the lineup prepared

386
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,791
and the competitors ready
for their shot at glory,

387
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:49,291
the Martial Arts Championship
stage is set for battle

388
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:53,666
on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
