[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:19,083
Cell took to the airwaves to
announce his malicious plan.

3
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,833
[CELL] Exactly nine
days from today...

4
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,416
bring me your best fighters
and I will face them one-by-one.

If I am not defeated,
the Earth belongs to me!

[NARRATOR] Viewers worldwide
could do little more than stare

Today, on Dragon Ball Z!

11

fleeing in terror.

Chiotzu's right. From what
Cell said in his broadcast,

the entire planet is going to be
wiped out after the tournament!

35

I got it! We borrow
Bulma's ship, orbit the Earth

would never think

to look for us up
in outer space!

Only a heartless soul would run
and leave his friends behind.

I just had to destroy it...
That was so dumb!

It's all my fault
that this happened!

45
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,458
[KRILLIN] I let Cell take her...

46
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,250

Stop right there!

[ROSHI] You know
good and well

52

that you are no match
for him, Krillin...

And I, for one, shall forbid
you to go! Understand?!

But if you still insist,

and face him there.

[YAMCHA] Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself, Krillin.

57

[ROSHI] Before we do anything,

58
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,125
we should talk to
Goku and Gohan.

59
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,916
If anyone is going to stop Cell,
it'll be one of those two.

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,958
Let's just hope
they've advanced enough

in their Super Saiyan training.

[TRUNKS] How much longer
are Goku and Gohan

63
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,958
going to be in there?

64
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,750
They still have three hours
left to finish off their year.

65

[VEGETA] I'm sure they'll
stay longer than that!

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,500
They'll do anything
they can to surpass me!

67
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,458
They are training so they
can beat Cell, not you, Vegeta.

68
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:20,375
And there are nine days left,
so you can afford to be patient.

69

Why don't you rest, Vegeta.

What a waste of time.

72

You don't actually expect to

73
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,333

as a Saiyan, do you?

But I plan to take the
remaining eight days for myself.

I wouldn't count on that.

only spend two days inside?

inside for eternity.

Now where did I put my pliers?

162
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,458
Ahhh... here they--

163
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,375
No, that's not...
that's not the right set...

164
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,958
I don't understand...

165
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,458
If I would put these tools back,
I wouldn't have so much trouble

166
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,666
finding them...

167
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,291
Ahh... there.

168
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,083
[DR. BRIEF continues to mumble]

169
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,333
Look at this, Dad.

170
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,000
I downloaded the
memory of Android 16

171
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,708
and it's loaded
with Goku's data!

172
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,833
[DR. BRIEF] Interesting!

173
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,208
[BULMA] He's got everything!

174
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,541
Fighting records,
his common techniques,

175
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,333
even his home address!

176
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,375
How strange!

177
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,791
Yeah, the only conclusion
that makes sense

178
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,875
is that Android 16
was designed

179
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,583
for the sole purpose
of destroying Goku.

180
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,291
But it doesn't seem like
he's after Goku at all...

181
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,541
Or maybe the right opportunity

182
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,083
just hasn't
presented itself yet.

183
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,125
Huh...?

184
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,875
Well, his circuitry is
too complex to really say.

185
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,333
However, he doesn't
look too evil.

186
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,541
[DR. BRIEF] And as I understand,

187
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,083
the only aggressive move he's
made has been against Cell.

188
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,333
That's true.

189
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,541
[DR. BRIEF] It really raises
profound questions about

190
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,250
the nature of
artificial intelligence.

191
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,625
Despite all of
Dr. Gero's programming,

192
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,458
this android could
still make a choice.

193
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:27,041
Yeah... well, I'm glad
he chose to be on our side

194
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,250
at the tournament,

195
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,250
because once we get
finished fixing him up,

196
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,291
he'll be one of the
strongest players we've got!

197
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,708
[GOKU] Hmm... So that's it!

198
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:45,416
A tournament, huh? I gotta
say it sounds interesting.

199
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,833
What? Interesting?

200
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,958
Hey, Mr. Popo, do ya still
have the clothes I left here?

201
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,666
Sure, I do.

202
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,125
They're somewhere.

203
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,625
I even washed them for you.

204
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,416
Hey, thanks. I appreciate that.

205
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,333
I'm sure my mother would make
you some new Saiyan armor

206
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,500
if you asked her.

207
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:25,083
Nah, this'll do fine. I want
to fight as an Earthling.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Piccolo, can I have a new
outfit just like yours?

209
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,083
You were my first teacher.

210
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,625
Yeah, kid, it'll make
you look really sharp.

211
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,208
[PICCOLO yells]

212
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:01,833
[GOHAN laughs]

213
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,291
[GOHAN] Wow!

214
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,625
Thank you! It's awesome!

215
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,166
[GOKU] You look great, Gohan.

216
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,750
--Okay.
--Huh?

217
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:39,541
Kakarot, you think
you can beat Cell now?

218
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,416
Couldn't really tell ya.

219
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,791
I haven't seen him since he
absorbed 18 and transformed.

220
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,750
I'll have to go check him out.

221
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,458
Ahh, Goku.

222
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,541
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,625
Right here, is where the fate of
the universe will be determined.

224
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,875
So what do you think?

225
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,125
[GOKU] I don't know,
seems kind of puny

226
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,208
if it's supposed to
decide all that,

227
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,708
wouldn't you say?

228
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,625
[CELL chuckles]

229
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,083
[GOKU] You're not
the first person

230
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,416
to try and rule the universe
with a sword of injustice.

231
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,375
They all failed,
and so will you.

232
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:09,166
[thunder crashing]

233
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,041
[GOKU] I've spent months
preparing for the day

234
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,208
I'd face you in
your final form.

235
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,291
I've come a long way, Cell.

236
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,458
So have I.

237
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,208

What's going on out there?

241
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,208
Is... all that energy
I'm sensing from Cell?

242
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:01,666
No. There's someone with him,
someone almost as strong...

It must be him!

He's finished, guys!

249
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,666
He's finally out of the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber!

250
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,166
I'll be your first opponent.

251

So leave everyone out of this
until we meet in the ring.

You will pay for your crimes.

Huh?

00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,250
Well then, Goku.

You've just made my little
match even more interesting.

258

[TRUNKS] So, what did
you think, Goku?

259
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,041
To be honest, Trunks,

260
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,000
he's become a whole lot
stronger than I thought he'd be!

261
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,458
[GOHAN gasps]

262
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,666
[GOKU] Of course, I won't
really know how tough he is

263
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,541
until I see him fight, but...

264
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,791
Well, if I were
to fight him right now,

265
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,625
I'm pretty confident that
he'd beat me into the ground.

[TRUNKS] Oh, okay.
I get it, Goku.

269
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,875
I understand.

270
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,000
He can still can use

271
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,916
the Hyperbolic Time
Chamber once more.

272
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,500
There is still
plenty of time left

273
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,375
and we've decided
to go in first.

274
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,166
Then Vegeta,
who wants to go alone.

275
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,666
That's because I
don't want any of you to

276
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,791
interfere with my training.

277
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,666
Well, I... I've decided
not to go in because

278
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,500
I don't think I'd be
a worthy opponent.

279
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,833
Trunks will be next.

280
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,625
Followed by Goku and Gohan.
You two will be last.

281
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,625
[GOKU] Gohan and I
don't need a turn.

282
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,083
What?!

283
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,916
There's only nine days left,

284
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,875
so I think we'll just
train outside 'til then.

285
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,833
You're not serious?!

[NARRATOR] Goku wants
to train in the outer world.

287

But will it be enough for
the final battle against Cell?
