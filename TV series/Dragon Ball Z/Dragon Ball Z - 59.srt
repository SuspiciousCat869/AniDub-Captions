1
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,208
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,291
Having lost all
of his scouters,

3
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,958
as well as his
top lieutenants,

4
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,291
Frieza called for
reinforcements!

5
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,500
And within moments, the
diabolical band of mercenaries

6
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:29,583
known as the Ginyu Force was
rocketing off toward Namek!

7
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:33,166
Meanwhile, despite his
painful encounter with Vegeta,

8
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,083
Gohan managed to
keep the location

9
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,250
of the final
Dragon Ball a secret...

10
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,458
A fact that infuriated the
evil Saiyan to no end!

11
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,625
Where are you, boy?!
I want that Dragon Ball!

12
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,083
[NARRATOR] Fueled by
his rage, Vegeta carved

13
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,458
a path of destruction
across the planet's surface!

14
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,875
You are dead!

15
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,291
His only goal...

16
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:56,041
To seek out Gohan and his
friends, and destroy them.

17
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,416
[BULMA] Why would anyone look
for us in such a horrible place?

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,916
[NARRATOR] Faced
with this threat,

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,416
Krillin came through
with a daring plan!

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,458
To... To do what?

21
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,583
[NARRATOR] Now, he and Gohan
are on their way to ask Guru

22
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,708
to awaken Gohan's
hidden powers!

23
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,666
But will they
be enough?

24
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:54,833
[BULMA snoring softly]

25
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,666
[BULMA screams]

26
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,500
Krillin?! Gohan?!
Is that you?!

27
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:10,791
[VEGETA growling]

28
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:15,166
[VEGETA] You... I've
finally found you!

29
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,125
Ve... Ve... Ve...

30
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,750
[VEGETA] You're
going to learn...

31
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,125
No one makes a
fool out of Vegeta!

32
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,583
[BULMA whimpers]

33
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:32,291
[VEGETA growls]

34
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,750
Now! Where's
my Dragon Ball!

35
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:38,125
[BULMA whimpers]

36
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,958
I-It's over there...

37
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't toy with me!

38
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,208
[BULMA squeals]

39
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:51,166
I... I'm not...
It's right there.

40
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,916
I don't have time
for these lies!

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,458
[VEGETA yells]

42
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,750
[thinking] This... This can't
be happening! I-I told him!

43
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,416
Die!

44
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,583
Listen to me!
It's right behind you!

45
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,916
No! I'm too
pretty to die!

46
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,166
Wha--? A dream?

47
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,458
[VEGETA thinking]
Dammit... If Kakarot's son

48
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,583
truly has some sort of
Dragon Ball tracking device,

49
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,041
I can't afford to leave these
unguarded even for a second!

50
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,833
Not until I
know exactly

51
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,833
where he and his little
bald friend are hiding.

52
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,291
I have to focus...

53
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,458
Wait for them to make
their next move...

54
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,875
Sense them out...

55
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:05,083
[far-off rumbling]

56
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,541
[VEGETA] Hm?!

57
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,916
[thinking] It seems Frieza's
growing a bit restless.

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,416
I guess he's
not too happy

59
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,666
that I destroyed his
ship's main power core.

60
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,083
[thinking]
He's firing wildly.

61
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,166
He's blind without
his scouters.

62
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,958
Surely, he must have sent
for replacements by now.

63
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,333
But that will take time.
A few days at least.

64
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,708
I have to settle
this quickly.

65
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,750
If I can find the
last Dragon Ball,

66
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,083
I know I can
defeat Frieza.

67
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,666
But if he
gets those scouters

68
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,833
before I've made my
wish, it's over.

69
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:33,791
[HENCHMEN whimpering]

70
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,833
[thinking]
Curse you, Vegeta...

71
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:13,500
Man, it feels like the
entire planet's falling apart.

72
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:27,833
Ohh... just...
get... back here!

73
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,375
Don't make me come out
there after you...

74
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,000
Jeez! At this rate,
it's gonna take us forever

75
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,625
to get to
Guru's house!

76
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,791
But we can't risk putting
out any more power

77
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,000
to turn up
the speed,

78
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,958
or else Vegeta will
track us down for sure!

79
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,083
I don't know how, but
it's like he just keeps

80
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,333
gettin' stronger
by the minute!

81
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,583
As though he wasn't already
strong enough as it is.

82
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,125
So then... how can you
be sure that going

83
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,791
to see Guru
will even help?

84
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,375
I mean, you keep talking
about "hidden powers"...

85
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,625
Do you really
think I have any?

86
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,375
Hey, I didn't think
I had any either,

87
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,458
but Guru found 'em.
And you're a Saiyan!

88
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,958
And you're
Goku's son!

89
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,291
If anyone's got 'em,
I know you do.

90
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,250
Just trust me, okay?

91
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,333
Wait! No!

92
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:09,541
[BULMA grunting]

93
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,875
[BULMA giggles]

94
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,250
Come... on...!

95
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,666
[BULMA screams]

[BULMA whimpers]

97
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,791
Wait, I don't
need to get it.

98
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,208
It'll be safe
down there.

99
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,000
And when Krillin
and Gohan come back,

100
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,000
they can jump in
and pull it out!

101
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,500
Come to
think of it,

102
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,125
this is probably the best
thing that could've happened!

103
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,291
Oh well, then...

104
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,958
[radar beeping]

105
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:22,791
[BULMA] Huh?

106
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:27,833
[beeping continues]

107
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,291
Ah!

108
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,000
Huh...?

109
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,708
V-Ve... geta..?

110
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,708
[BULMA thinking] This is the
worst thing that could happen!

111
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,208
If Vegeta has
that ball,

112
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,916
he's going to wish
for eternal life!

113
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,791
And then we're all
as good as dead!

114
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,583
There's no way we'll
be able to stop him!

115
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,750
Even if Gohan does get
all those new powers

116
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,041
like Krillin
says he will.

117
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,250
Not only that...

118
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:06,166
we won't be able to wish
Yamcha back to life.

119
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,083
And I'll be stuck on this
stupid planet forever!

120
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,083
Well then...

121
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,250
I guess there's only
one thing to do...

122
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,333
If I'm going to
die in this place,

123
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,000
I might as well
go down fighting!

124
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,041
I'll show
that creep!

125
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,375
He just messed with
the wrong woman!

126
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,708
Let's see...

127
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,791
This one fires 
the torpedoes...

128

There you are!

Looks like I don't have
to fight Vegeta after all.

I can handle!

I guess there is
really such a thing

146
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,833
as training
too hard.

147
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,833
It won't do anyone any
good if I end up dead.

148

I've gotta be
more careful.

until I get to Namek!

163
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,000
Ahhh! This can't
be happening!

164
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,625
[BULMA] There it is!

165
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,083
[BULMA gasps]

166
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,250
What in the...
Tons of Dragon Balls!

167
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,541
Wait a second, those things
aren't Dragon Balls!

168
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,375
And they can't all
be giant pearls...

169
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,541
Well, whatever
they are,

170
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,875
I'd better just get
what I came for...

171
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,958
[BULMA screams]

172
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,375
[BULMA screaming]

173
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:12,708
[BULMA whimpering]

174
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,583
[BULMA] Capsule!
Escape pod capsule...

175
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,708
Oh no! It must have
fallen out of my pocket!

176
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,666
[BULMA] It's gotta
be in here somewhere!

177
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,875
Come on, come on!
Where are you!?

178
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,333
Found it!

179
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,958
You're gonna have
to do a lot better than that

180
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,583
to keep me down!

181
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,750
Come on! Gimme the
stupid Dragon Ball!

182
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,750
I mean, it's not like you're
gonna do anything with it!

183
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,416
[BULMA screams]

184
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,000
[BULMA screams]

185
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,708
Hm?

186
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,625
She was just
protecting her eggs!

187
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,000
[BULMA] Look out!

188
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,208
Well, what are you
waiting for? Get moving!

189
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,083
[BULMA] Come on!
Come on! Hurry up!

190
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,208
I'm not doing this for
my health you know!

191
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,875
[BULMA sighs]

192
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,250
Phew... Too much
excitement for one day.

193
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,791
[BULMA screams]

194
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,208
[whimpering]

195
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,791
[BLUEBERRY] Where are the
rest of the Dragon Balls?!

196
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,500
[BULMA wails]

197
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,500
[RASPBERRY] Where's Vegeta?!

198
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,458
[BULMA whimpers]

199
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,875
Okay. If you don't
want to talk to us,

200
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,416
you can talk to
Lord Frieza instead.

201
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,916
Fuh... F-Frieza?!

202
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,625
C'mere!

203
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,083
[BULMA squeals]

204
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,958
[NARRATOR] Now in the clutches
of Frieza's ruthless henchmen,

205
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,041
the situation looks
bleak for Bulma.

206
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,958
With Goku
still days away,

207
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,791
and Krillin and
Gohan still en route

208
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,541
to see Guru,
the Eldest Namek,

209
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,666
is there anyone who can save
her from the wrath of Frieza?

210
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,041
The tension mounts,
as the race

211
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,166
for the Dragon
Balls continues...

212
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,416
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
