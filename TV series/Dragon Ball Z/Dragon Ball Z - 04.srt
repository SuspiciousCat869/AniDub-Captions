00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,000
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,375
Tragedy struck, when Goku's
evil older brother, Raditz,

3
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,291
kidnapped Gohan!

4
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,250
Daddy! Help me!
Daddy!

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,416
[NARRATOR] Goku raced
after the sinister Saiyan

6
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,750
to take back his son.

7
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,250
But with little hope of
overpowering Raditz alone,

8
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,250
he had no choice but
to accept the help

9
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,208
of a most unlikely ally...

10
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,875
Goku has joined forces

11
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,916
with one of his most
dangerous enemies... Piccolo!

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,166
[RADITZ] Hm...

13
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,416
Well, well, well.

14
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,166
Look who's decided
to drop in.

15
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,625
It's little brother.

16
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,875
Oh, and he's brought
the green man with him.

17
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,750
I was wondering who that
second insignificant blip

18
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,291
on my scouter
might be...

19
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,458
[NARRATOR] Radtiz was
far from intimidated

20
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,250
when confronted by the Earth's
two greatest fighters.

21
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,583
In a flash, he gave
them a demonstration

22
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,083
of his own power that
proved, even together,

23
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,125
Goku and Piccolo had
little chance for victory.

24
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,708
Raditz's otherworldly
strength and speed

25
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,541
already make him the
most powerful opponent

26
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,708
Goku or Piccolo
has ever faced.

27
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,625
But this, it seems, is only
the tip of the iceberg.

28
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:20,375
If you think I'm strong now,
wait until I catch my stride.

29
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,750
The truth is, I'm just
getting warmed up.

30
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,625
[NARRATOR] Is there any hope
of defeating this deadly foe?

31
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,000
Find out, today!

32
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,625
[RADITZ]
I'll tell you what...

33
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,416
Seeing as how your power
levels are more or less equal,

34
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,083
why don't we make a
little game out of this?

35
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,333
We'll call it,

36
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,333
"Which of you can last
against me the longest."

37
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,625
The rules are simple.

38
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,625
I cause you both a
great deal of pain,

39
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,916
and you writhe
around in agony.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,958
The loser is the first
to beg for mercy.

41
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,916
That's it... I don't
care how strong he is.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,708
I'm not going to stand
here and listen to this.

43
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,250
I would
prefer to die!

44
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,666
[laughs]

45
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
Don't you worry
about it green man,

46
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,875
we'll get to that
in due time!

47
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,791
Hey, don't get
ahead of yourself.

48
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,875
You haven't
beaten us yet.

49
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,833
Trust me, Kakarot. I know
an easy win when I see one.

50
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,291
I'm a Saiyan!
It's what I do.

51
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,708
[PICCOLO] Come on, Goku.
Let's finish this guy!

52
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,041
We'll charge
him together!

53
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,750
Wait...
Not yet...

54
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,666
Not until he tells us what
he's done with Gohan...

55
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,291
Now, where is he?
Where have you hidden him?

56
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,833
Right...
Your little son...

57
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,666
You think you're
going to save him?

58
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,041
Who's getting ahead
of himself now?

59
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,875
This is the last time
I'm going ask you!

60
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,750
Where is my son?!

61
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,083
[RADITZ] Spare me the
fatherly dramatics.

62
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,125
You can have a last look
at him if you want.

63
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:08,000
He's locked inside my
space pod, behind you.

64
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,750
Ah!

65
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,333
[cries]

66
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,500
Gohan...

67
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,750
Daddy, help! Please, Daddy!

68
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,833
Get me out!

69
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,375
Be strong, Gohan!

70
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,416
I'll be down to help you
in a minute. Just hold on!

71
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,791
[RADITZ] Ha!
You'll be down all right...

72
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,750
But you won't be
helping anybody!

73
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,583
You should say
your goodbyes though!

74
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,916
You won't get
another chance.

75
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,875
No. I won't lose.

76
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,666
All right.
Let's do this!

77
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,625
[RADITZ chuckles]

78
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,375
[GOKU and PICCOLO yell]

79
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:26,916
[GOKU and PICCOLO yell]

80
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,083
Heh.

81
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,166
[chuckles]

82
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,750
[GOKU and PICCOLO yell]

83
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,208
Where did he go?!

84
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,500
Right here!

85
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,666
Heh!

86
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,208
[RADITZ chuckles]

87
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,500
[RADITZ] What's the
matter with you two?

88
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,500
You could at least try to make
better sport of it than this!

89
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,333
You don't want me to
get bored, do you?

90
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:22,958
[GOKU groans]

91
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,041
Piccolo, are you alright?

92
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,541
Ah!

93
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,583
[PICCOLO groans]

94
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,833
Don't worry about it.
It's not as bad as it looks...

95
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,416
I'm not out of
this fight yet.

96
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,916
[RADITZ laughs]

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,083
Oh, excuse me, has
anyone seen my arm?

98
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,041
[RADITZ laughs]

99
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,958
You can't miss it...
It's green!

100
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:56,333
[RADITZ laughs]

101
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:07,541
Uh... How we doin', Bulma?
We getting close?

102
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,791
[BULMA]
I think so.

103
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,833
But I'd need the Dragon
Radar to know for sure.

104
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,000
I just hope Goku's
doing all right.

105
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,000
I've got a terrible
feeling about all this.

106
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,666
Well, at least we know
that with Piccolo,

107
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,416
his chances are about
as good as they can get.

108
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,000
But the fact that
he's with Piccolo

109
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,166
is what worries
me the most!

110
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,833
I mean, he's one
of the bad guys!

111
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,000
For all we know, he's
already teamed up with

112
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,875
Raditz and blasted
Goku--Oh...

113
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,625
Goku can't beat
Raditz alone,

114
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,416
and I doubt any of us
could be much help...

115
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,916
So we might as well put
our faith in Piccolo.

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,375
If he can't help
Goku, or won't,

117
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,458
then there's no
one else who can.

118
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,916
[KRILLIN sighs]

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,833
[KRILLIN thinking]
Good luck, Goku.

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,083
Come on, now.

121
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,750
Surely that pathetic
excuse for an attack

122
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,541
wasn't the best
you could do.

123
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,583
Okay, Goku. If you have
any new techniques

124
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,708
you've been waiting
to use, now's the time.

125
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,916
Heh, heh... Sorry...
I wish I did!

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,833
Hmph! You slacker...

127
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,416
While you've been
taking it easy,

128
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,625
I've been developing
a new attack!

129
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,916
[RADITZ] Fools!
Haven't you figured it out yet?

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,250
All of your
planning is futile!

131
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,166
Whisper all you want, but
you're still going to die!

132
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,166
So you think this attack
of yours has enough power

133
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,333
to do some
damage, Piccolo?

134
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,416
Yes!

135
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,333
And can you do it
with only one arm?

136
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,041
[PICCOLO]
Yeah, that's no problem.

137
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,416
The problem is,

138
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,375
it takes me a while to
gather the energy for it.

139
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,250
[RADITZ chuckles]

140
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,916
So, you'll have to
last against him alone

141
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,750
for five minutes.
It's your decision.

142
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,791
All right... If you're sure
it'll work, I'll hold him off.

143
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,208
Well, the truth is
it's untested...

144
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,083
I've never tried it
against an opponent.

145
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,333
I was hoping to save it
for a special occasion.

146
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,291
It's the attack I planned
to use to defeat you.

147
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,375
[GOKU] I see, and now
you're using it to help me.

148
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,083
You must be terribly
disappointed.

149
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,958
[PICCOLO] No. This
will be a good test.

150
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,208
And if it works, I'll be
using it on you next.

151
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,625
Ha, ha. Figures.

152
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,750
You know, that wasn't actually
intended to be funny.

153
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,500
[RADITZ thinking]
What are they laughing at?

154
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,875
Planning something
clever, no doubt.

155
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,291
I guess I'll be sure to watch
out the next time we meet.

156
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,041
But for now,
wish me luck.

157
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,166
All right.
Do your best, Goku!

158
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,166
