1
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,541
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,583
[NARRATOR] The Androids have
picked themselves up a new van

3
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,500
and they're getting ready
to go for a little drive.

4
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,708
Their final destination:
Goku's house!

5
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,166
And if they have their way,

6
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,208
they'll see to it that Goku
is dead on their arrival!

7
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,666
[NARRATOR] However,
Piccolo might have something

8
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,875
to say about that.

9
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,208
He's returned to
Kami's Lookout in the hopes

10
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,000
of merging with the aging
Guardian of the Earth.

11
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,708
Once reunited,
these two powerful forces

12
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,875
will form a
single "Super Namek",

13
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,041
strong enough to stop
the Androids in their tracks!

14
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
Meanwhile, the gang
is moving Goku

15
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,750
to a safer location.

16
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,541
[YAMCHA] I think Goku
has packed on a few pounds.

17
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,833
[KRILLIN] Give him a break!

18
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,208
He hasn't been himself lately!

19
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,291
[NARRATOR] Can they keep
the ailing Goku hidden

20
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,541
from the Androids?

21
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,583
Find out today!

22
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,458
[ROSHI]
All right, Chiaotzu!

23
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,083
Let's see if
this soup of yours

24
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,541
passes the
"Master Roshi Taste Test"!

25
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,208
[OOLONG] Well it
smells good to me!

26
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,166
That's for sure!

27
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:30,583
[slurping]

28
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,625
[ROSHI] Not too bad...

29
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:37,625
[slurping]

30
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,833
[CHIAOTZU growls]

31
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,875
[slurping]

32
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,541
[CHIAOTZU]
Well, how is it?

33
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,750
Great!

34
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,416
[CHIAOTZU gasps]

35
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,375
[ROSHI] That was
delicious, Chiaotzu!

36
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,333
You really know how to
make a fine bowl of soup!

37
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,166
Thanks, Master Roshi!

38
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,666
[slurping]

39
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,875
[OOLONG] Mmm!

40
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,791
This might be the best
soup I've ever had!

41
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,500
Please tell me there's some
more where this came from!

42
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,500
I could go for a couple
helpings of seconds!

43
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,166
And maybe even
some thirds, too!

44
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,250
Where did you learn
to cook like that?

45
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,291
I used to cook for Tien
when he was training

46
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,000
and I came up with
a few of my own recipes...

47
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,250
Here's a thought!

48
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,750
Why don't you stay here
and train with us, Chiaotzu!

49
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,250
Huh?! Stay with you?

50
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,583
Sure, you could stay here
and train with all of us!

51
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,125
Train?! C'mon, admit it!

52
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,125
The only reason
you want him to stay

53
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,666
is so he'll cook for you!

54
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,875
[ROSHI] That's ridiculous!

55
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,625
I-I just thought it
would be nice if he--

56
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,958
[OOLONG] Nice if
he cooked for you!

57
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,416
[ROSHI] That's not true!

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,875
[OOLONG] Huh?

59
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,333
[CHIAOTZU] Tien!

60
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,500
[OOLONG] Oh... Hey there, Tien!

61
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,625
Chiaotzu... we're leaving.

62
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,916
Huh...?

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,083
[TIEN] We have to get
back to our training.

64
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,041
Hey, wait a minute!

65
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,708
Fill us in, at least!

66
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,666
Were you able to take
care of those Androids?

67
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,333
Well, what then?!

68
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,916
What happened?! Tell us!

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,208
Tien? Is everyone okay?

70
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,458
Everyone's fine...

71
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,541
You don't have
to worry about them...

72
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,083
Krillin is on his way
here now with Goku

73
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,666
and he'll
explain everything.

74
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,333
They'll be safe with you...

75
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,750
No, wait!

76
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,750
You can't go!

77
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,625
[CHIAOTZU] Hey, wait up Tien!

78
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,583
I'd say something terrible
has happened out there!

79
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,041
[ROSHI growls]

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,458
[KRILLIN] Look at it
this way, Gohan.

81
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,541
It's all just a game
to these Androids.

82
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,583
And until they've found
Goku and destroyed him,

83
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,625
the game's not over.

84
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,041
Are they really
that powerful, Krillin?

85
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,333
[KRILLIN] Afraid so, bro.

86
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,500
They're even more powerful

87
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,666
than the Androids
Trunks told us about!

88
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,333
Huh...?

89
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,166
[YAMCHA] But I thought
those were the Androids

90
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,250
Trunks told us about!

91
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,166
[TRUNKS]
No. They're different somehow.

92
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,125
[CHICHI screams]

93
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,291
[ALL gasp]

94
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,416
Oh no! What in the
world was I thinking?!

95
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,250
We don't have
a minute to waste!

96
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,416
We've got to hurry!
Before it's too late!

97
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,125
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,583
[CHICHI grunts]

99
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,166
Well, let's hit
those books, Gohan!

100
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:41,958
[GOHAN gasps]

101
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,416
I can't study now!

102
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,208
Don't you dare
talk back to me!

103
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,708
Now go to it!

104
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,041
Wow, Gohan!

105
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,583
And I thought I had it rough!

106
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,750
Hey! What do we do now?!

107
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:57,333
Beats me, Yamcha.
I'm all outta ideas...

108
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,666
Well, maybe there's
something I can do to help.

109
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,125
[CHICHI growls]

110
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,458
[TRUNKS] I could travel to
the past in my time machine

111
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,875
and destroy the Androids

112
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,250
before Dr. Gero has
a chance to activate them!

113
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,750
It shouldn't be that hard

114
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,791
now that I know
where his laboratory is!

115
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,083
Hey, yeah! That's a great idea!

116
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,291
Hold on...

117
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,291
I don't think I like
the idea of you going

118
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,166
after the Androids
by yourself...

119
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,041
No...

120
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,666
What if something goes wrong?

121
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,166
Besides, didn't you once
say that your time capsule

122
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,125
only had enough energy
to make one more trip?

123
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,291
I mean, how would
you make it back home?

124
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,041
You could be trapped
in the past forever!

125
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,666
Maybe...

126
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,125
Hey, if you go
back to the past

127
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,916
and destroy the Androids
before Dr. Gero wakes them up,

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,708
what happens to the Androids
that are here in this time?

129
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,666
They wouldn't just
vanish, would they?

130
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,958
Because if changing
the past makes them vanish,

131
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,041
what happens to the re--?

132
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,916
Gohan, that's none
of your business.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,708
You mind your studies!

134
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,333
No! He's right!

135
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,333
What was I thinking?!

136
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,625
Huh...?

137
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,916
If I go back in time
and destroy the Androids,

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,375
I can only save
the future of that world!

139
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,666
But I can't change anything
that they've already done

140
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,083
once they've been activated!

141
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,000
Which means there's really
no point in me going back!

142
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,333
Can you try that in English?

143
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,791
Ah, alright... let's see...

144
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,916
You know how Goku is alive now

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,833
because of the medicine that
I brought back from the future?

146
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,458
Well, in the future world
that the medicine came from,

147
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,333
Goku didn't make it!

148
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:28,375
That's because I can only
change one reality, not both...

149
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,208
Huh?

150
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,875
In other words, there are
two realities out there.

151
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,750
In one of them Goku survives,
in the other, well...

152
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,083
Let's just say
he wasn't so lucky.

153
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,208
Let me try to understand this.

154
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,541
[KRILLIN] You're saying
that even if Goku

155
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,458
beats the Androids
in our world,

156
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,500
they'd still be alive in
your world of the future?

157
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,583
Boy, that sounds
like some kind

158
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,208
of a parallel
universe or something!

159
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,958
[TRUNKS] Exactly!

160
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,000
So then, why'd
you bother to come

161
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,208
back in the

My mother...

165

You see, it was my mother's idea
to send me back to the past.

166
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,333
She didn't think
there was anything more

167
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,875
we could do to help
the people in our world...

168
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,666
But she knew there were
others we could help!

169

Maybe we can't change

170
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,625
what the Androids have
done to this world, Trunks,

171
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,875
but I think I know of a way
we can make a better world.

172
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,166
A peaceful world,
free of the Androids forever!

173
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,416
[TRUNKS] I agreed with my mother

174
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,916
that I should travel
back in time,

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,333
but I had my own reasons
for wanting to go.

176
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,750
I hoped that in the past,
with Goku's help,

177
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,625
I would find the Androids
had some weakness.

178
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,416
That way, I could
go back to the future,

179
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,250
and even though
I still wouldn't be able

180
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,166
to bring back all
those already gone,

181
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,916
I might be able to save
the people who are left!

except that
I didn't count on

there being such
major differences

I thought Goku's

would come much
earlier than they did.

would be two androids,

changes when you travel

To be brushed aside as easily as
a common housefly by an Android?

323
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,125
A true Super Saiyan
would not have fallen.

324
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,791
Maybe I'm not
who I think I am...

325
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,416
[VEGETA] Perhaps there are still
new plateaus for me to reach.

326
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,583
Far greater heights
to which I must ascend!

327
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,833
Yes!

328
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,041
I will ascend!

329
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,833
The universe will marvel to see

330
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:07,458
the ultimate Saiyan
potential once again realized!

331
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:13,333
And I will be... legendary!

332
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,541
And then Kakarot...

333
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,916
Then I will see you bow
before your prince...

334
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,666
[YAMCHA] It looks like we'll
be at Master Roshi's island

335
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,750
in no time.

336
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,333
Oh, and Krillin?

337
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,916
Don't you think we'd better
tell Bulma what we're up to?

338
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,500
Good idea...

339
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,000
Wait, are you saying
that I should call her?

340
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,333
No way!

341
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,166
C'mon Krillin,
I'm flying the plane here.

342
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,500
Thanks, buddy.

343
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,458
Alright...

344
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,666
No offense, man.

345
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,916
Your mom's just hard
to deal with sometimes.

346
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
[TRUNKS laughs]

347
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,208
Believe me,
I know what you mean!

348
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,458
[receiver rings]

349
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,541
[OPERATOR] Capsule Corp.

350
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,500
Oh, hello? This is
Krillin speaking.

351
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,166
I was wondering if I
could speak to Bulma.

352
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,750
[OPERATOR]
Bulma? Yes.

353
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,583
Please hold while
I transfer your call.

354
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,041
Thank you.

355
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:12,166
[receiver plays music]

356
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,291
[BULMA] Krillin?! What's wrong?!
Is everyone alright?!

357
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,750
Talk to me!

358
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,375
I've been so worried.
Where are you calling from?

359
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,583
I've tried calling Gohan at
his house and there's no answer.

360
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,375
It just rings and rings.

361
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,083
By the way,
is my son there?

362
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,583
I-I mean Trunks?

363
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,458
You know, the one
from the future...?

364
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,541
Huh?

365
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,500
Yeah, ah, he's sitting
right behind me.

366
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,625
He is?!

367
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,416
Well then, put him on the line!

368
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,000
He can hear you on the speaker

369
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,333
so go ahead and say whatever
you need to say, Bulma!

370
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,250
[BULMA] Well, tell him
we received a call today

371
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,333
from this guy who lives out
in the middle of the country,

372
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,166
somewhere to the
west of here.

373
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,208
He claims he found
some sort of weird,

374
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,833
old abandoned vehicle
and wants to keep it.

375
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,416
But he doesn't know
how to fly the thing

376
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,375
so he phoned us and
asked us if we knew.

377
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,333
Yeah, go on...

378
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,625
He tried to explain what
kind of vehicle it was,

379
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,166
but he didn't make any sense.

380
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,333
Well, we didn't know for sure

381
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,083
if it was one of our
products or not,

382
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,916
but he swore to me that it had
"Capsule Corporation"

383
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,416
written right across it.

384
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,708
So we asked him to
send us a picture of it.

385
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,291
I couldn't believe my
eyes when I saw it!

386
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,166
It was a picture of the time
machine Trunks came in,

387
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,208
and I've got some
bad news for you:

388
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,208
It was a wreck!

389
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,375
Huh?!

390
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,583
B-But that can't be true!

391
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,666
Here, look! I put it up!

392
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,708
I put it back into its
capsule when I landed!

393
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,250
He says the time
machine's right here!

394
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,666
Seriously?

395
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,291
But then... well, the time
capsule in the picture...

396
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,208
It's the same... but I guess

397
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,375
it does look like it's been
sitting there for a while.

398
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,041
It's almost completely
overgrown with moss and stuff.

399
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,333
So exactly how
many time machines

400
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,000
did we make in the future?

401
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,083
H-How many?

402
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,458
Well, we barely
managed to make one.

403
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,291
[BULMA] What? That's strange.

404
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,791
I'm sure this is a time
machine in the picture.

405
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,750
But I want to make sure.

406
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,625
Hang on. I'll just send
you a copy of the photo

407
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,875
through the fax.

408
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,083
Trunks, I want you to
take a good look at it.

409
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,416
Here. Check it out.

410
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,875
Huh?!

411
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,833
That's my capsule!

412
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,583
There's no mistaking it, guys!

413
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,041
That's the one
I came back in!

414
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,458
Wait a second...

415
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,708
What's going on here?!

416
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:40,291
[NARRATOR] Is this in fact the
time capsule Trunks arrived in?

417
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,916
Or is someone playing a
cruel joke on our heroes?

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,541
There's only one
way to find out:

419
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,833
Tune in next time for
another exciting episode

420
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,666
of Dragonball Z!
