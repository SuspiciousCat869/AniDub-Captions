00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,833
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,458
Captain Ginyu had used his
amazing "Metamorphosing" power

3
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,208
to switch bodies with Goku.

4
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,958
Meanwhile, Krillin and Gohan
uncovered all seven Dragon Balls

5
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,666
And with Vegeta lurking
in the shadows,

6
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,500
they began to call
the Namekian Dragon!

7
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,666
I command you now!

8
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,833
Hear my howl, to make
my wish come true!

9
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,416
[KRILLIN laughs]

10
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,541
[GOHAN laughs]

11
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,416
[NARRATOR] But their hopes
were dashed as they realized

12
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,458
they didn't possess
the necessary password.

13
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,333
[NARRATOR] To make
matters worse,

14
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:09,250
Jeice and the disguised Captain
Ginyu arrived at the scene.

15
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:21,041
[GINYU shouts]

16
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,750
[NARRATOR] And when
Captain Ginyu realized

17
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,791
Gohan and Krillin
weren't fooled,

18
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,916
he attempted to
take them out!

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,333
Will Goku's arrival
make a difference?

20
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,291
Find out today!

21
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:47,208
[GINYU shouting]

22
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,958
[BOTH whimpering]

23
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,583
[JEICE] Huh...?

24
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,041
[VEGETA gasps]

25
00:03:56,125 --> 00:04:02,000
[GINYU shouting]

26
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:06,708
[GOKU grunts]

27
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,750
[shouting continues]

28
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,708
[GINYU laughs]

29
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,291
Jeice!

30
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,916
Check out your scouter display
and give me a strength reading!

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,666
Right!

32
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,500
[GINYU shouts]

33
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,916
Huh...? Ah...

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,833
Now, Jeice!
Hurry up, would ya?!

35
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,250
Uh... You're at 23,000?

36
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,416
Jeice! Would you
please speak up!

37
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,916
Ah... Uhhh...
23,000 Captain!

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,583
Huh?

39
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,666
Uhh...

40
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,375
Yeah! Now...
you two... are toast!

41
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,333
Uhh...

42
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,625
You pint sized
pukes don't stand a

43
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,041
chance against ME!

44
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,625
Huh?! 23?!

45
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,416
And... getting weaker...

46
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,375
Huh?

47
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,541
Uhh...

48
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,250
[GINYU] It's not possible!
Maybe you should

49
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,541
check it again, Jeice...

50
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,666
[GOKU] You still don't
get it, do you Ginyu?!

51
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,041
Unless you know how
to use your mind

52
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,250
and your body
as one, together,

53
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,416
you'll only get
weaker and weaker!

54
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,166
Krillin! Gohan! Now's the
time to take him out!

55
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,583
[GINYU whimpers]

56
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,750
Hrrrgh...

57
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,458
Yaah!

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,166
You little...!

59
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,750
[GOHAN whimpers]

60
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,416
[KRILLIN] Maybe Goku's right!

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,583
Maybe we can beat that
Ginyu geek after all!

62
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,625
Now, Gohan!

63
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,458
Yeah, right!

64
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,416
[GINYU growls]

65
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,208
Get 'em, Gohan!

66
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,375
[GOHAN whimpers]

67
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,041
[GOHAN whimpers]

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,208
[whimpering continues]

69
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,583
What're you
waiting for?!

70
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,541
But... it's Daddy!

71
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,541
Raagh!

72
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,250
Gohan!

73
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,916
What's wrong, Gohan?!

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,833
I... just can't...

75
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:20,708
hit him, Krillin, because he
looks exactly like my father!

76
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,500
[GINYU growls]

77
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,041
I know what you mean,

78
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,958
it is hard to fight this guy
when he inside your dad's body.

79
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:31,041
But get it through your head,
Gohan, this is not your father!

80
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,125
Understand?

81
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,250
[GOHAN growls]

00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,500
'Kay. I think I'm ready.

84
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,083
Haah!

[BOTH grunt]

[GINYU] Jeice!

95
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,666
Huh?!

96
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,458
Don't just
stand there!

97
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,791
Maybe you could help
me a little bit here?!

98
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,166
Right! Coming!

99
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,666
[VEGETA] Hey, Snow White!

100
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,291
How 'bout you pick on
somebody your own size?

101
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,041
[VEGETA chuckles]

102
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,625
[thinking] Vegeta...

103
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:55,250
It-It-It's Vegeta. But
what would he be doing here?

104
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,375
[KRILLIN shouts]

105
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,166
Huh?!

Raah!

109
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,833
Yaah!

110
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,875
Hey, Captain Ginyu!
You can't fool me anymore!

111
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,416
What...
What's going on?!

112
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,583
I should have plenty of
strength in this body,

113
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,791
I-I just don't understand!

114
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,500
[KRILLIN] You really
don't get it, do you?

115
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,083
Didn't you hear
what Goku said?

116
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,208
You gotta use your
mind and your body!

117
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,041
Now that
you understand,

118
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,875
how about surrendering?

119
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,166
Sur... Surrender?

120
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,041
A captain in the Ginyu
Force surrender?!

121
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,166
Surrender THIS!

122
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,875
Yaah!

123
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,250
[blows landing,
yelling]

124
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,291
[GINYU] Eat knuckles!

125
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,583
[JEICE] Pretty stupid to
challenge me to a fight,

126
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,041
huh, tough guy?!

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,541
Look who's
chasing who, pal!

128
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,916
[blows landing]

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,416
So, Vegetable Breath,
where exactly were you hiding?

130
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,375
My scouter didn't
show you anywhere!

131
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,166
Well, I guess it goes to
show you how behind the times

132
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,708
your useless Ginyu
technology is!

133
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,375
[blows landing,
grunting]

134
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,083
Time to finish you off, punk!

135
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,333
I hope you realize
that up till now

136
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,666
I've only been
toying with you!

137
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,041
In your dreams, Vegeta!

138
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,208
That'll be the day a
wimpy Saiyan like you

139
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,000
can beat even the weakest
of the Ginyu Force!

140
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,416
And now, it's time to turn
out your lights, you loser!

141
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
[JEICE grunts]

142
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,625
[VEGETA laughs]

143
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,666
Huh?

144
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,250
[laughing continues]

145
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,208
[VEGETA] I hate to admit this,
but I must say I'm impressed!

146
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,541
You're a lot tougher
than I thought!

147
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,416
[VEGETA chuckles]

148
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,166
Take a look at
your scouter

149
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,541
and then you'll realize
what you're up against!

150
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,875
[JEICE] I am! And
that's what's so funny!

151
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,250
But just to humor you,

152
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,666
I'll check it again and see
if I even get a reading!

153
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,166
It's... impossible!

154
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,666
Nooo!

155
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,708
[VEGETA laughs]

156
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,916
[VEGETA] I think you broke it!

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,500
No kidding!

158
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,041
[VEGETA] You see, unlike the
Saiyan you've been fighting,

159
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,416
I get excited at the
prospect of finishing off

160
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,541
a warrior who's
weaker than I.

161
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,250
And you're much weaker.

162
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,000
So do you feel like
taking on a real Saiyan?

163
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,583
Well, do you punk?

164
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,583
Because if you do, come
and get a piece of me!

165
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,041
[VEGETA] Come on.

That's right, amigo,

I'm your worst nightmare,
live and in person

and ready to rumble!

So, if you think
you stand a chance

00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,958
against a Super Saiyan,
be my guest!

00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,958
this guy isn't so
tough after all!

I think we can take
him down, Krillin!

I hope you're both
wearing clean underwear

it's too late!

you in some other way I would,

don't leave, you will face

Well, I must
say, you Nameks

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,708
are really quite a
stubborn breed...

But I see your energy
is running low...
