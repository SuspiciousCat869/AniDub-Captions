00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,375
Goku and Pikkon fired up

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,500
as the final bout of the Other
World Tournament began.

4
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,666
[NARRATOR] The mighty warriors
cut right to the chase,

5
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,416
quickly tagging one another
with heat-seeking energy blasts!

6
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,416
[NARRATOR] And
narrowly escaped...

7
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,916
[NARRATOR] Back on the ground,

8
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,833
the two locked arms for an
electrifying test of strength.

9
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,708
[NARRATOR] And to
Pikkon's great surprise,

10
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,500
Goku was able to
take the lead

11
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,791
pushing Pikkon just
inches away from defeat.

12
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,375
[NARRATOR] But the true
struggle had not yet begun.

13
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,708
[PIKKON yells]

14
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,166
[GOKU yells]

15
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,666
[NARRATOR] Without a word,
Pikkon removed his outer robes,

16
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,250
revealing that he'd been wearing
weighted training clothes

17
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,416
all along. And with the
heavy burden now removed,

18
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,250
his strength would
dramatically increase.

19
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,708
[NARRATOR] But of course,

20
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,958
Goku had been doing a little
holding back of his own.

21
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:44,333
[GOKU yells]

22
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,166
[NARRATOR] The second
half is kicking off...

23
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,083
and Goku is a Super Saiyan!

a transformation...

Well! This is unexpected!

31
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,541
The rookie fighter Goku
has just changed

32
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,333
into some sort of
shining golden thing!

33
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,250
[SOUTH KAI] Buh...?

34
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,500
Shiny gold thing?

35
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:54,041
Maybe it's a disease!
He could be contagious!

36
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,916
[KING KAI giggles]

37
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,375
Oh, it's nothing.

38
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,625
He just transformed
into a Super Saiyan.

39
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,166
Super...?

40
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,583
What's that mean?

41
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,083
Not much.

42
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,291
Just that his speed,
strength and ability

43
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,916
have become several
times more sensational

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,541
than before!

45
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,458
There's... no way!

46
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,958
Oh, but I'm afraid
there is, West Kai!

47
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:27,291
And by our bet, your home
planet will soon be mine!

48
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,875
You just wait!

49
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:33,250
Because Pikkon hasn't used
his full power yet either!

keep up with him!

[PIKKON] Your power
is impressive...

But you'll need
more concentration

move a third time.

of the tournament,
and therefore...

262
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,458

been disqualified!

Yeah, that's right!

266
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,541
Goku, do you admit that you
and Pikkon touched the ceiling

267
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,416
of this here stadium
during the fight?

268
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,208
The ceiling?

269
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,666
Uhh...

270
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,291
Yeah, we did.

271
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:18,875
Well, according to Article 3,
Section 9, paragraph 1351

272
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,750
of the official rule book,
the stadium ceiling

273
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,000
is the same as the
stadium floor.

274
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,750
Because if you stand on your
head, the floor is the ceiling

275
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,250
and the ceiling is the floor!

276
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,416
Therefore, it's ring-out!.

277

Oh, but Grand Kai!

278

means that nobody wins!

282

You're right...

283
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,500
We broke the rules so we lose.

284
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,333
But, your fight rocked!

285
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,333
So as a bonus,
I'll allow both you and Pikkon

286
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:58,708
to take my private lessons

give me just enough time
