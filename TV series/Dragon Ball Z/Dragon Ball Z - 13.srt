1
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,583
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,958
Gohan kept on training

3
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,333
by putting a tail-less
T-Rex through its paces...

4
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,250
And Piccolo pulled off
an amazing feat...

5
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:27,875
Focusing his powers, he caused
the pyramids to levitate...

6
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,500
Not to be outdone, Tien pulled
off his own amazing stunt

7
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,666
by pushing a wall of water
back up the face of a cliff...

8
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,375
And what about Goku?

9
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,291
He found some time to take
a nap while hitching a ride

10
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,708
with a street cleaner
on Snake Way...

11
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,291
Too bad he didn't
hold on tight

12
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,750
when he hit that
bump in the road.

13
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,166
[GOKU yells]

14
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,041
[groans]

15
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,083
[GOKU]
Hey? Where am I?

16
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,875
I remember hitching
a ride on that truck,

17
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,500
but how did I end up
in a place like this?

18
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,500
Huh?

19
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,583
[sniffs]

20
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,625
Smells good!

21
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,666
[NARRATOR] Never one
to pass up a meal,

22
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,375
Goku found himself drawn to
a very delicious fruit tree...

23
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,375
That looks tasty!

24
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,291
[NARRATOR] Too bad that
juicy piece of fruit

25
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,750
is private property!

26
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,625
Oh, and wait till you find
out who it belongs too!

27
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,375
[NARRATOR] What is
this strange place?

28
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:40,166
It certainly isn't Earth and
it's nowhere near Snake Way...

29
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,208
Looks like Goku has
really gotten off

30
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,666
the beaten track
this time.

31
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,500
And he's taken quite
a beating for it too!

32
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,666
[groans]

33
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,750
[GOZ] Well, that's what
you get for trying

34
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,583
to steal King Yemma's fruit!

35
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,666
[GOKU] Uh, you mean I'm not
allowed to eat any of that?

36
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,625
You got that
right, buddy...

37
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:07,041
That tree there? It belongs
to the great King Yemma...

38
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,500
And only he can
eat the fruit!

39
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,500
Aw! C'mon!
Just one piece!

40
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,708
[MEZ] Don't listen
to him, Goz!

41
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,166
So you want to eat
King Yemma's fruit?

42
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,333
Just who do you
think you are?

43
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:24,208
Heh. Yeah, what makes
you so special?

44
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,750
I'm Goku!

45
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,208
I ran here so I could receive
some martial arts training!

46
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,208
Which one of
you is King Kai?

47
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,666
[both]
Hmmm... It's not me!

48
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,666
[GOKU] You mean neither of you
guys is the great King Kai?

49
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,166
You poor
little chump!

50
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,500
Don't you have any
idea where you are?

51
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,666
[GOKU] Huh?

52
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,916
[MEZ] This is the land
below the clouds!

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,833
The land of no return!

54
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,541
It's also
where we live.

55
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,416
Once somebody comes here
there's no going back!

56
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,708
What?! You're kidding...

57
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,583
That means I must have fallen
of Snake Way some how!

58
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,250
[MEZ] Then you've
automatically got

59
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,541
a free lifetime
membership down here!

60
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,416
[GOZ] Haha! Yeah!
A free membership!

61
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,041
[GOZ and MEZ laugh]

62
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,541
Oh that's great!

63
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:11,958
How am I supposed to climb
Korin Tower by myself? Sheez.

64
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,208
Hey Tien! Don't even think
about leaving me down here!

65
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,375
[thinking]
All right, Goku...

66
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,166
I'll show you that I can
do what ever you can...

67
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,000
Just you wait, I'll show
you how strong I am!

68
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,250
Tien... How long
till we see Kami?

69
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,208
I'm really,
really excited!

70
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:50,583
Be patient... We'll see
Kami soon enough, my friend.

71
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,041
But you have
to promise me

72
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,791
you'll be on your best
behavior from this point on!

73
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,875
Which means...
No more questions, okay?

74
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,666
Hm... All right...

75
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,375
[LAUNCH] No, that won't work!
Hey! What about this?

76
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,083
There's gotta be
something in this place

77
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,375
I can use to
climb with...

78
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:11,750
This? No, that?
Eh, forget it!

79
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,875
Darn! What a bunch
of useless junk!

80
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,250
Bah! There's nothing
in this place at all!

81
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,125
[clears throat]

82
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,125
[LAUNCH] Huh?

83
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,375
What are you doing
in my teepee?

84
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,416
[LAUNCH]
Isn't it obvious?

85
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,041
I need to find a
ladder or something

86
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,416
so I can climb
up Korin Tower!

87
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,625
I don't have anything
like that...

88
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,166
Now get out of
there right now!

89
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,916
I've got
lots of money!

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,333
I don't need
your money!

91
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,500
Sorry, pal, then I'll
take what I want!

92
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,458
[UPA]
What's going on father?

93
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,458
[LAUNCH] Huh?

94
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,916
Upa!

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,916
It's okay, son.
Stay back!

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,750
What do you think
you're doing, lady?

97
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,083
I'm no lady!

98
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,750
Aahh!

99
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,916
[LAUNCH grunts]

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,166
A-A-A-A-A-Chooo!

101
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,541
[BORA] Huh?

102
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,291
Whoopsie...

103
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,500
[LAUNCH giggles]

104
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,208
[GOKU] I gotta get
back on to Snake Way.

105
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,625
[GOKU yells]

106
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,666
[GOZ]
Wow! He sure can jump!

107
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,750
[MEZ]
Yeah, right!

108
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,916
[MEZ laughs]

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,791
Hey Goz, I bet we could
have a lot of fun

110
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,416
with that guy,
don't ya think?

111
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,833
Yeah, he sure
seems to have

112
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,083
an awful lot of
energy, doesn't he?

113
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,541
I could get some
real good exercise

114
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,416
messin' with him
for a while!

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,916
[GOZ snickers]

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,416
Hey what do
you mean, Goz?!

117
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,375
Why do I do all the paperwork
and you have all the fun?

118
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,916
Let's fight it out then!
The loser stays in the office!

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,333
[growling]

120
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,583
Are you ready?

121
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,083
Let's go!

122
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,416
One, two, three!

123
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,166
Scissors
cuts paper!

124
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,166
Heh, heh, heh. Try not
to get a paper-cut, Mez!

125
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,625
Hey, try and be a good sport
and save some for me!

126
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,750
[GOZ] Heh, heh, heh.
Sure, I'll try...

127
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,333
Not!

128
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,750
[MEZ grunts]

129
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,541
[MEZ]
Lucky ogre!

130
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,500
That's a long way up.

131
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,708
[GOZ]
Hey, buddy!

132
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,750
Would you like a little help?

133
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,458
Hm? Well, why not? Sure...

134
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,625
But, so far I haven't
even come close yet.

135
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,041
[GOZ laughs]

136
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,916
Just leave it
to the Goz-man!

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,666
I've got a knack
for these things.

138
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,583
[GOKU] Hey! Let go!
What are you doing?

139
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,416
[GOZ yells]

140
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,166
[GOKU yells]

141
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,500
[MEZ] Hm?

142
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,666
Oh, Goz's done it again!

143
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,750
Man! That big lug just can't
resist finishing them off

144
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,208
right away
every time! Darn!

145
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,250
I never get
to have any fun!

146
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,250
[GOZ chuckles]

147
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,458
[GOKU]
Wh-Wh-Whoa!

148
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,000
Huh?!

149
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,166
Hm? Ah!

150
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,833
Wow! That little guy
must be pretty strong!

151
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,458
I still couldn't
reach it...

152
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,458
I guess you're not
strong enough.

153
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,750
[grunts angrily]

154
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,541
Oh, yeah, we'll
see who's strong!

155
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,333
I challenge you to
a wrestling match!

156
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,166
[GOKU] Uh, sure, but I just hope
King Kai's stronger than you,

157
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,916
because I want him to train me!
It's really important!

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,166
[grunts angrily]

159
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,333
Okay, I'm gonna knock

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,666
[GOKU laughs]

321
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,125
Bummer! Missed him!
That was a good chance!

322
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:53,583
Wha...
Now that's fast! Man!

323
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:04,916
[SOULS talk indistinctly]

324
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,666
Ah! I'm pretty
sure I lost him.

325
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,875
It should be safe
to take a breather!

326
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,583
[GOKU laughs]

327
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,666
Huh?

328
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,333
Yikes! Busted!

329
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,416
Gotcha!

330
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,333
[SOULS laugh]

331
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,666
[SOULS yell]

332
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,875
[MECHANICAL OGRE]
Nice shot! Try again!

333
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,000
[MEZ chuckles]

334
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,083
[GOKU]
I saw that!

335
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,750
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
This is great!

336
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,041
I haven't had this
much fun in centuries!

337
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,541
We can play this
everyday for eternity!

338
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:00,041
Sorry, I've got
better things to do!

339
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,791
Heh, heh! You might
have better things to do,

340
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,583
but remember if you don't catch
me you're not going anywhere!

341
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,208
Yeah! We'll see about that!

342
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,333
Now!

343
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,250
Uhoh. I think he's
gaining on Mez.

344
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:22,166
Hey, hold on!
Wait a minute! Time out!

345
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,625
[panting]

346
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,625
There are no
time outs!

347
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,333
[GOKU] That's fine,
but whatd'ya say

348
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,958
we each have a piece of
that fruit for a snack?

349
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,208
Absolutely not!

350
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,166
King Yemma has us guard
that fruit for him

351
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,375
because it's
so special,

352
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,416
just one piece will
double a man's strength

353
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,375
and keep him full
for three months.

354
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,875
[GOKU] You mean if
you ate one piece

355
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,000
you really wouldn't get
hungry for three months?

356
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,875
Exactly! Y'see--
Hey, where'd you go?

357
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:54,500
No! Stop!
I could lose my job!

358
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,625
[GOKU laughs]

359
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,041
[MEZ] Don't even kid
around about this!

360
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,666
[MEZ yells]

361
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,708
Goodness gracious! This has
never happened to us before!

362
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,625
[GOKU laughs]

363
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,750
Gotcha!

364
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,541
Nitwit!

365
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,833
So, where is it?
The secret passage?

366
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:19,250
Uh, what secret passage?
What are you talking about?

367
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,583
You better
be careful!

368
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,708
If you lie, King Yemma
will be very unhappy!

369
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,125
Ah, it's right
over there!

370
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,208
[GOZ] Okay, this is it!
It's right through here!

371
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,666
Just take
the stairs up.

372
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,500
You can get back to
Snake Way from here.

373
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,833
[GOKU]
See ya later!

374
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,750
I certainly
hope not.

375
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,291
[GOKU] Oh, and thank you
very much for the fruit!

376
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,541
Huh?

377
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,291
Yeah, all that exercise
made me really hungry.

378
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,416
Heh, heh, heh!

379
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,166
Ahh!

380
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,333
Bye!

381
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,458
[MEZ]
You little sneak!

382
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,583
Goz, did you
see that? Darn!

383
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,208
Yeah, I saw it...

384
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,500
We got
totally burned!

385
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,541
Yeah, for the
first time!

386
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,791
That's
not bad!

387
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,333
Hey! We're still the
baddest ogres in the land!

388
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,833
No one can
beat us!

389
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,458
[MEZ] Whatta ya say we
keep this little incident

390
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,458
between the
two of us?

391
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,458
[GOZ] Duh!

392
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,458
[GOKU]
Man! What a wild stairway!

393
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,041
I feel like
I'm in a dream!

394
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:37,625
Huh? Wow, that must
be the road up there!

395
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,791
[GOZ] He should
be there by now!

396
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:45,291
[GOZ and MEZ
chuckle and laugh]

397
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,416
[grunting]

398
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,625
Man! This is heavy!

399
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,875
All right!
Made it!

400
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,583
Hmm... Goku, what are
you doing in my desk?

401
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:03,458
Yiiyye! Uhhh...
Hi, Great King Yemma!

402
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,583
I thought you were
on Snake Way.

403
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,750
[GOKU] Uh, I am!
I mean I was!

404
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,333
I mean, I'm should
get going! Bye, bye!

405
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,000
Goodness.
How strange.

406
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,125
Oh, man, It looks like
those crafty ogres

407
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,875
had the last
laugh after all!

408
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,500
Now I'm really going
to have to motor it

409
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,000
if I want to make it
back from King Kai's

410
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,708
in time to
save Earth!

411
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,875
Wow! I feel as
light as air!

412
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,166
I guess it's from
that fruit I ate!

413
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,625
[NARRATOR] So Goku is back
at the start of Snake Way

414
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,791
and that means he's still a long
way from training with King Kai.

415
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,041
Luckily that piece of fruit
will give him the strength

416
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,750
to keep going for awhile,
but will it last long enough?

417
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,041
There's still that
little problem

418
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,500
of the two Saiyans rapidly
approaching Earth...

419
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:46,666
Time is running out.

420
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,208
Can Goku pick up the pace

421
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,250
and get to the end of
Snake Way in time?

422
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,166
To find out make
sure you don't miss

423
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,708
the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
