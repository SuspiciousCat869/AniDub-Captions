[DENDE speaking Namek]

2
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,583
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:20,083
Gohan and Krillin used their
first wish to bring Piccolo back

4
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,166
from the dead.

5
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,416
Hey, cool! You're alive!

6
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,416
[NARRATOR] Piccolo
was back in action

7
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,000
and he asked Gohan
to use the second wish

8
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,166
to transport him to
the planet Namek!

9
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,541
This wish, too, was granted
by the great Dragon of Namek!

10
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,375
The one you call Piccolo
will be brought to Namek now!

11
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,083
[NARRATOR] Vegeta was
infuriated when he awoke

12
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,041
and thought he missed
his golden opportunity

13
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,000
to wish for eternal life.

14
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,333
[VEGETA] Well, you can
kiss each other goodbye!

15
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,750
[NARRATOR] But then he found
out there was one wish left

16
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:58,291
and it looked like eternal life
would be his for the taking.

17
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,250
Don't you get it?! I'm the
only one who can stop him!

18
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:11,500
[DENDE speaking in Namek]

19
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,208
[NARRATOR] But when
Guru passed away,

20
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,958
Porunga did too, and the
Dragon Balls turned to stone.

21
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,500
[DENDE screams]

22
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,416
[NARRATOR] And with
Frieza on the scene,

23
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,875
the situation could
not have been worse.

24
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,416
So, you are the ones?
Naughty!

25
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,791
[NARRATOR] The dreaded
moment had finally arrived!

26
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:48,166
An all-out battle with Frieza
today, on Dragon Ball Z!

27
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,916
[FRIEZA] Hmm...

28
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,333
There doesn't seem to
be any power readings

29
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,541
for the Ginyu Force...

30
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,291
So it is true!

31
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,375
[FRIEZA chuckles]

32
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,333
[FRIEZA] Somehow you wimps
have managed to destroy the

33
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,083
most elite fighting
team in the universe.

34
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,583
Ha, ha! What a farce!

35
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,041
I only wish that I could have
been there to see the look

36
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,416
on Ginyu's face!

37
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,583
[FRIEZA giggles]

38
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,041
[GINYU] Ribbit!

39
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,500
Whatd'ya say
we get started?

40
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,083
I know you are all anxious
to resolve this dispute

41
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,875
once and for all.

42
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,125
[FRIEZA] I always knew that
you would turn on me someday,

43
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,791
Vegeta, but I never knew when.

44
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,208
Now I see that you were just
waiting for the stakes

45
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:39,375
to get high enough before
you played your hand.

46
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,791
A valient effort, but in the
end, it just didn't work,

47
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,875
now did it?

48
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,333
I hope you've thoroughly
enjoyed your little rebellion,

49
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,916
because now it's over, my
restless little warriors!

50
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,500
[FRIEZA growls]

51
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,291
Now you die!

52
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,375
[FRIEZA] I should have done
this a long time ago!

53
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,208
You ruined everything,
you little scumbag!

54
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,458
How dare you stick your
nose in my affairs!

55
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,666
I could have been
immortal! I hate you!

56
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,708
Like I care if you
hate me. I quit.

57
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:24,041
I'm free now! To think I was
nice to you all those years!

58
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,458
Makes me wanna puke!

59
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,916
[FRIEZA chuckles forcibly]

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,291
That's right, get it all out!

61
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,166
Live boldly, even if it is
only for a few moments!

62
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,833
[FRIEZA chuckles]

63
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,333
Okay, time's up!

64
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,416
[FRIEZA growls]

65
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,833
[shouting]

66
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,208
[GOHAN whimpers]

67
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,458
Whoa, man! We're talking
serious power here!

68
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,541
Huh...?

69
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,416
[PICCOLO] Whoa! That's one
heck of a power increase!

70
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,291
[PICCOLO] Yeah, the
action is definitely

71
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,083
getting ready to start!

72
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:21,333
[PICCOLO] A dying power.
That better not be Gohan.

73
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:34,500
[NAIL groans]

74
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,208
He looks like me!
Could be worse, I guess.

75
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,916
[NAIL groans]

76
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,041
[PICCOLO] This guy's
definitely seen better days...

77
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,791
Yeah. You can say that
again. What a drag, huh?

78
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,750
Hey, it's you!

79
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:58,125
So the Earthlings got to make
their wishes. I love it.

80
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,750
I see. Well, if you know me,
than you know I'm out of time.

81
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,791
I'm quite sure we've
never meet before,

82
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,291
but I'm glad your
beating sure hasn't

83
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,666
made you lose
your sense of humor.

84
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,666
[NAIL chuckles]

85
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,958
You take good care
of yourself, my friend.

86
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,041
Wait a sec...

87
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:15,916
[PICCOLO] Hmm?

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,208
I can sense your great power.

89
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,250
But I just don't think
it's going to be enough.

90
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,583
[PICCOLO] We'll see!

91
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:27,000
If only you had come back
as your original self...

92
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:31,625
You could have beaten
Frieza for sure...

93
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,791
[PICCOLO] What?!

94
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:37,166
I fought him. I know
how strong he is...

95
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,666
So, if I united with Kami,
I'd have what I need right now.

96
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,083
How ironic!

97
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,000
He's probably laughing so hard
that we could hear him

98
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,416
all the way from Earth!

99
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,208
[NAIL groans]

100
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,791
No, you're wrong! Nobody wants
you to win as much as Kami does.

101
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,416
His very survival depends on it.

102
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,166
[PICCOLO] Kami!

103
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,541
[KAMI] Piccolo, we are one!

104
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,208
Hm... Well it's too late
now at any rate.

105
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,250
And I think I would
rather die than unite

106
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:12,041
with that old geezer anyhow.

107
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,291
Well, unite with me then...

108
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,333
Hmm?

109
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:21,583
It's the only help we
can give, sad but true...

110
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,833
I'm the last warrior
left on Namek.

111
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,166
You are? That's just great!

112
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,041
[NAIL] I know. But if we unite,

113
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,916
you'll be much stronger
than you are right now.

114
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,000
I appreciate the offer, I guess,

115
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:40,083
but there's just not enough room
inside me for the both of us.

116
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,125
Oh, your ego's too big, huh?

117
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,750
[FRIEZA laughs]

118
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,166
[DENDE whimpers]

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,083
[GOKU] What a horrible power!
I've gotta get better...

120
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,375
[PICCOLO] I'd better be going
now. Sorry I can't help.

121
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,875
Not by yourself,
but with me you can.

122
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,250
I'm not trying to
trick you, brother!

123
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,000
Please! I'm just
trying to help you out.

124
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,625
You are one of us.
We have to work together.

125
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,500
Frieza is just too strong.

126
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,708
If we don't use every scrap
of what we have to fight him,

127
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,083
then we're done for.

128
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,041
Will I still be "me"?

129
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,625
[NAIL] For the most part, yes.

130
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,583
Sure, you'll notice
a difference at first,

131
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,708
but who knows, you might
find it to your liking.

132
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,625
[PICCOLO growls]

133
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:32,541
[FRIEZA laughs]

134
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,875
Why not? Alright.

135
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,208
You're on! But if I don't like
it, you're out! Understand me?

136
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,500
Man, you're too much.

137
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:51,208
Just wait! You'll be
begging to keep me around.

138
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,625
[PICCOLO] Yeah, right.
I doubt that.

139
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,833
Now, tell me what to do, quick.

140
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:01,166
Right! Just keep your
hand right there...

141
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,750
You can stay, until
we beat Frieza.

142
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:08,958
After that, I'm gonna charge
you rent! You got that?

143
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,416
[NAIL chuckles weakly]

144
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,125
[PICCOLO grunts]

145
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,833
[PICCOLO grunts]

146
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,750
Wow. Unreal. My gosh...

147
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,375
This is amazing!
I feel incredible!

148
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:02,958
Yes, yes, yes, yes! I can win!
I feel great! I can do this!

149
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:13,458
[PICCOLO] Yes! I'm home! I'm
alive! This is all a miracle!

150
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,416
I'm awake! I'm wide awake!

151
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,791
[PICCOLO laughs]

152
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,000
[PICCOLO] Hang on,
Gohan! Here I come!

153
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:47,375
[FRIEZA laughs]

154
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,125
[FRIEZA] Now look at me, Vegeta!

155
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,458
You fool! How dare
you challenge me!

156
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,250
Have you forgotten
what I really am?!

157
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,750
[FRIEZA chuckles]

158
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,416
[FRIEZA] You'd better get that
smirk off your face, Vegeta!

159
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,916
Huh?

160
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,166
Hmph.

161
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,625
[FRIEZA] Haaaa!

162
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,333
--[KRILLIN] Come on!
--[GOHAN] Right behind you!

163
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,916
[FRIEZA] Ha, ha!

164
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,166
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN coughin]

165
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,666
Gohan! Look, we've got to attack
him while he's distracted, okay?

166
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,958
It might be the
only chance we get!

167
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:48,875
Right!

168
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,333
[KRILLIN] Let's do it!

169
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,125
--Haaah!
--Raaah!

170
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,791
[BOTH screaming]

171
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,333
[DENDE] Krillin! Gohan!

172
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,291
[ALL scream]

173
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,916
[VEGETA] Raaagh!

174
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,208
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN whimper]

175
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,291
He-He's too strong!
I-I don't think we can win!

176
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,083
[GOHAN] What are we going to do?

177
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,250
[KRILLIN] I-I don't know!

178
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:58,833
Well, I do! You are all going to
perish, and it won't be pretty.

179
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,041
[KRILLIN whimpers]

180
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,041
[GOHAN whimpers]

181
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,166
Nonsense.

182
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,166
Hmph.

183
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,583
That's right!

184
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,166
Our chances of winning are
just as good as yours are!

185
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,416
[BOTH] Huh?!

186
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,708
That's absurd! You're finished!

187
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,166
No way!

188
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,625
[FRIEZA laughs]

189
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,083
Oh, no? So what's your plan?

190
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,708
You're so blind!
Haven't you noticed yet?

191
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,208
Their fighting power is
increasing with every attack!

192
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,166
Hmph.

193
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,333
Oh, yes, especially
the little guy.

194
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,500
His power is enormous, but
he doesn't even know it yet.

195
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,875
Huh?

196
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,291
And that's not all! Soon,
I'll be a Super Saiyan!

197
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,000
Your worst nightmare!

198
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,583
Hmmm...

199
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,791
[VEGETA chuckles]

200
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,208
A Super Saiyan, huh?

201
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,625
Well, we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it!

202
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,750
[FRIEZA giggles]

203
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,500
That is if we ever
come to it, fool!

204
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,916
[FRIEZA yells]

205
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:18,208
[FRIEZA growls]

206
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,000
[VEGETA grunts]

207
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,750
[BOTH grunting]

208
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,958
[FRIEZA} You low-life
Saiyan! How dare you!

209
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,291
[ALL gasp]

210
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:01,458
[BOTH growling]

211
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,125
[scouter beeping]

212
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,625
[FRIEZA] What?!

213
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,500
[BOTH growling]

214
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,500
Not bad. You've definitely
improved, Vegeta, I commend you.

215
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:35,208
Perhaps you are close
to becoming a Super Saiyan!

216
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,583
[GOHAN] Wow. Maybe
Vegeta's right.

217
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,916
Maybe we can beat
Frieza if we work together!

218
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,166
We are all getting stronger.
And we do have him outnumbered.

219
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,625
[KRILLIN] I'm getting a
bad feeling about this.

220
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,458
Vegeta's definitely
a lot stronger,

221
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,125
but Frieza doesn't
seem to care.

222
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,583
He's so calm.

223
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,208
Why don't you transform, Frieza?

224
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,916
Hmmm?

225
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,208
Say what?

226
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:14,333
Transform! Oh, man...
That doesn't sound good.

227
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,833
Well, how about it, Frieza?

228
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,541
Why don't you stop playing
around and show us the real you?

229
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:22,000
So, you've found out
my little secret.

230
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:26,166
That's right! Your loving
minion Zarbon blurted it out.

231
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,291
Huh?

232
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,875
What are you talking about?!

233
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,250
The form of Frieza you see
standing before you

234
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,208
is not what he really is; it's
just a clever camouflage!

235
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,708
A simple mask!

236
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,666
He can transform to his
real self at any time,

237
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,708
he just uses this form
to conserve energy.

238
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,458
You rude, little
ruffian! Please!

239
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,500
I don't choose my real form

240
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,166
because my power is too
radical to control!

241
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,375
[FRIEZA giggles]

242
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,250
That's just great!

243
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,833
[VEGETA] Don't listen to him!

244
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,625
He's just saying that
to intimidate you!

245
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,291
His power won't
increase that much.

246
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,041
Is that so?

247
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,791
[VEGETA] Why don't
you show us, then?

248
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,291
[KRILLIN whimpers]

249
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:11,333
Oh, alright! I'll give
you what you're asking for!

250
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,291
Strap yourselves in, boys!

251
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,333
You're in for one
heck of a ride!

252
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,166
Oh, and Vegeta,
I want you to know

253
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,791
that any remote chance of
winning you may have had

254
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:29,208
is about to go
flying out the window!

255
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,833
Hold on. I almost forgot!

256
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,833
I never transform unless
somebody gives me a countdown.

257
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,458
Oh, come on! That's...
That's ridiculous.

258
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,541
You've got to be joking.

259
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,791
[FRIEZA] I'm waiting...

260
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,333
[VEGETA] Oh, fine!

261
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,208
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

262
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,291
You happy?

263
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:52,166
Elated. You're too kind.
Here it goes!

264
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,250
[GOKU] Gohan... Krillin...

265
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,750
[FRIEZA yells]

266
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,541
[GOHAN whimpers]

267
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,250
[KRILLIN whimpers]

268
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,125
[NARRATOR] Frieza
has finally begun

269
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,625
his horrible transformation.

270
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,958
Can Vegeta manage to stave
off this evil super power

271
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:38,041
until help arrives?

272
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,500
Does Piccolo have the
power to save the day

273
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:44,000
now that he has fused with Nail?

274
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,666
And can Goku, the
Saiyan from Earth,

275
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,958
heal in time to
make a difference?

276
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:53,166
On the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
