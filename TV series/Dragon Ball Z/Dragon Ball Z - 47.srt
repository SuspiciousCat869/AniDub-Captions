1
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,875
A gift from Korin...
One bag of Senzu Beans.

2
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,541
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,708
No more hospital
food for Goku!

4
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,708
Thanks to a
magic Senzu Bean,

5
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,708
our hero was finally able
to cast off his casts.

6
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,708
All you have to do is push
the button, and you're off!

7
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,125
That's great!

8
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll definitely get there
in time to help them out!

9
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,958
[NARRATOR] And after
months of lying in bed,

10
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,083
Goku was all too eager to start
his next great adventure!

11
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,958
Within moments, he was
rocketing through outer space

12
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,666
on his way
to Planet Namek,

13
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,583
where his friends had
already begun their search

14
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,458
for the
Dragon Balls.

15
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,625
Meanwhile, Gohan and Krillin
were quickly realizing

16
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,458
they weren't the only
interested party!

17
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,791
[KRILLIN]
Check it out!

18
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,875
Look what those guys have
tucked under their arms!

19
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,666
It's the Dragon Balls!

20
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,708
[NARRATOR] Who are these
mysterious invaders?

21
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,458
And what does their
presence bode

22
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,250
for the kindly
citizens of Namek?

23
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,208
There's only one
way to find out...

24
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,833
Stay tuned for
more Dragon Ball Z!

25
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,333
[HENCHMAN 2] Look, Namek.

26
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,125
I'm about ready to put
one between your eyes

27
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,458
and drag you
out myself.

28
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,083
Got it?
Now move your feet!

29
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:34,583
[HENCHMEN laughing cruelly]

30
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,541
Aww, you scared?
You should be!

31
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,666
[KRILLIN] Those jerks!
He'd better lay off that kid.

32
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,416
[GOHAN] Who are these
guys, Krillin?

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,458
I mean, they're all
dressed like Vegeta!

34
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,166
Good question. They
wear the same uniforms,

35
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,833
but they're not
Saiyans... Who knows?

36
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,041
Maybe Vegeta really
is the only one left.

37
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,833
Well, that is except
for you and Goku.

38
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,750
But then, who?

39
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,583
Remember what
Goku's brother Raditz

40
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,333
told us when he
came to Earth?

41
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,916
We scour space
for planets

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,333
that will bring a high
price on the galactic market.

43
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,500
Once we find them, we
send our warriors there

44
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,166
to purge them of any life
and make them ready for sale.

45
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,750
My guess is, they're more
members of the planet trade.

46
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22,708
Although, I don't see
Vegeta around anywhere.

47
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,041
Maybe these guys are like,
the competition or something.

48
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,791
[FRIEZA] I doubt I
need an introduction,

49
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,750
but just in case,
I am the mighty Frieza,

50
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:44,166
and yes, all the horrible
stories you've heard are true.

51
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,833
Now, then,
let's get right to it.

52
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,083
We know there were others
here with you earlier.

53
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,458
At least five.

54
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,541
And since my men and I have
much better things to do

55
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,458
than hunt down a
bunch of Nameks,

56
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:58,541
I wonder if you'd be so kind as
to tell us where they are.

57
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,083
I'm sorry.
Where are my manners?

58
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,375
I didn't
say "please".

59
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,375
[FRIEZA giggling]

60
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,166
[GOKU] 6,996... Whew!

61
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,458
This 20-times
gravity is intense!

62
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:32,000
6,997... 6,998... 6,999...

63
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,708
7,000!

64
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,708
Only 3,000 more!

65
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,250
7,001...

66
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,750
Come on, Goku...

67
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,250
7,00--

68
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,583
[FRIEZA] If you still
have any misgivings

69
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,083
about cooperating
with us,

70
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,666
I would strongly urge
you to give them up.

71
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,083
You see, we can do
this one of two ways.

72
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,583
Either you can tell
us what we want to know,

73
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:03,333
Or, we can force you to
tell us what we want to know.

74
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,083
And believe me,
you don't want the latter.

75
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,583
So, now that we
understand each other,

76
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,750
I think it's time
you started talking.

77
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,791
[DODORIA chuckles]

78
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,916
Nawainita hanita
emao moteleki koeto.

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,416
Hmph. Clever old fool,
don't think you can trick us

80
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,333
by pretending to
speak only Namek.

81
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,000
I know you are fluent
in the common tongue.

82
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,791
The elders stay in the
village with the children,

83
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:44,041
while the men go out to work
in the fields. Will that do?

84
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,416
[FRIEZA] That's better.

85
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,791
See how well we do
when you cooperate?

86
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,125
Now, on to the
next question.

87
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,125
I understand
that you have something

88
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,375
here in your possession

89
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,666
that I would very much
like to have in mine.

90
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,250
The Six-Star
Dragon Ball.

91
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,875
[GOHAN and KRILLIN gasp]

92
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,916
[FRIEZA] I'll give you one
chance to tell me where it is.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,708
I... don't know what
you're talking about.

94
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,458
[FRIEZA giggles]

95
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,041
Dodoria...

96
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,625
Yes?

97
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,541
[FRIEZA] Do you remember that
first Namek elder we visited?

98
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:16,000
Doesn't our new friend here
remind you of him in some way?

99
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, he thought he
could play dumb, too.

100
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,833
He said he had no idea
what the Dragon Balls were.

101
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,166
[DODORIA laughs]

102
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,541
Oh, yes, he was quite
the stubborn one at first,

103
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:29,333
but it wasn't too long
before he was willing to talk.

104
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,041
We simply had to start killing
his friends, one by one.

105
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,916
What?!

106
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,458
[FRIEZA] After that,
he was a regular wellspring

107
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,250
of useful
information.

108
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,000
For example, he explained
to us how long ago,

109
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,041
the oldest and
wisest of the Nameks

110
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,041
created seven
Dragon Balls.

111
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,875
How he placed them at different
locations all over the planet,

112
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,708
entrusting each one to the
care of a Namek elder.

113
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,416
And how, if all
seven are collected,

114
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,375
the Eternal
Dragon appears,

115
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,166
able to grant any wish
a heart may desire.

116
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,708
He also told us that anyone
seeking a Dragon Ball

117
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,750
must pass tests of
bravery and intelligence

118
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,125
before an elder
will turn it over.

119
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,666
I offered to take
these tests, of course,

120
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,083
but he refused to give me
the Dragon Ball at any cost.

121
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:17,750
So I had no choice but to
take it... along with his life.

122
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,958
You cold-blooded
murderer!

123
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,125
[FRIEZA] At any rate,
after our difficulties

124
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,583
with the
first elder,

125
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,375
we found the next three
to be quite agreeable.

126
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,416
By the time we arrived,
they were all too willing

127
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,708
to hand over
their Dragon Balls.

128
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,083
Good, Frieza.

129
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,000
But after I beat you
to the next Dragon Ball,

130
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,208
you won't deal
with me so easily.

131
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,291
They did not
hand them over.

132
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,500
Our brothers would never
willingly give a Dragon Ball

133
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,125
to the likes of you.
Not in a million years!

134
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,750
Don't be so sure.

135
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,041
You underestimate our
powers of persuasion.

136
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,666
Zarbon, why don't
you show them?

137
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,250
Gladly.

138
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,333
[BOTH gasp]

139
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,083
Huuh...?!

140
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,458
[NAMEKS gasp]

141
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,125
Raagh!

142
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,583
No!

143
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
Raah!

144
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,583
[HENCHMAN 2 screaming]

[ZARBON] Hmph.

152
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,666
[KRILLIN] Oh, man!
They killed him!

153
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,208
No...

154
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,291
[GOHAN growling]

155
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,291
[KRILLIN] Gohan, you gotta keep
your power level down.

156
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,333
They'll notice.

157
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,416
I'm just too angry.

158
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,791
I know it's hard.

But there was nothing either
of us could have done.

160

We can't beat these guys
fighting them head-on.

161
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,333
We're gonna
have to be smart

162
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,875
if we want to get
the Dragon Balls

163
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,250
and wish Piccolo and
the others back to life.

[GOHAN growling]

Do you think you're ready to
start cooperating with us yet?

[HENCHMEN laughing]

172
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,000
What do you want with
the Dragon Balls anyway?

173
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,083
Oh, just a
tiny little wish.

174
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,333
For the one thing I
don't already have:

175
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,333
The power of
eternal life.

176
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,250
Eternal life?

177
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,166
Well, that figures.

178
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,041
It's the same thing
Vegeta wants to wish for.

179
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,333
So I guess they really
are Vegeta's competition!

180
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,625
And they're winning.

Do whatever you
will with me,

00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,333
but I'm still not going to
give you a Dragon Ball!

Of course not... Please,
you stubborn Namek...

You think
you're so noble...

Even under
threat of pain,

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,833
you refuse to surrender
your precious Dragon Ball.

187
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,833
Well, we'll see
how noble you are

are at stake.

[DODORIA]
Up there.

199
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,416
It came from just
over that ridge.

I think someone's
been watching us.

have the situation

00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,416
perhaps I should
go check it out.

from over there!

Uh?! More Nameks.

it'll help?

got here late.

done to your elders...

00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,083
Is that it?
Stupid old Namek.

321
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,666
I've had worse
insect bites.

322
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,250
That's right!
Run away!

323
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,708
[ELDER NAMEK] Rrrgh...

324
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,458
What are
you doing?!

325
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,583
Rrgh!

326
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,125
[laughing]

327
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,916
The scouters!
I should have known.

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,250
That's what he's
aiming for!

329
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,250
[KRILLIN] That
crafty old dog.

330
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,875
[GOHAN] W-Wait a second.

331
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:27,250
Why is he just destroying
the scouters?

332
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,416
Think about it.
Without the scouters,

333
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,708
Frieza and his men won't be
able to find the Nameks

334
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,125
or the Dragon Balls!

335
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,375
Even if Frieza gets the Dragon
Ball he's looking for here,

336
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,958
he's gonna have a
heck of a time

337
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,416
tracking down
the next one.

338
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,833
You gotta admire him.

339
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,583
He's risking everything
to protect his people!

340
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,000
[DODORIA growling]

341
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,708
[DODORIA] You think you're
pretty smart, don't you?!

342
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,333
But you're not... Destroying
the scouters won't save you!

343
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,708
I'll have no mercy.

344
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:03,083
[GOHAN and KRILLIN growling]

345
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,083
[DODORIA]
Do you hear me?!

346
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:11,583
I'll kill all
you Nameks!

347
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:15,625
And I'm gonna
start with you!

348
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,041
Get out!

349
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,416
[DODORIA]
Ready to die?!

350
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,791
[NAMEKS gasping]

351
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,875
[NAMEKIAN CHILDREN whimpering]

352
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,083
Rraaugh!

353
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,375
[DODODRIA yelling]

354
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:39,708
[frightened gasping]

355
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,250
[NARRATOR] It seems the forces
of evil are about to claim

356
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,500
yet another victim.

357
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,791
Is there nothing Gohan
and Krillin can do

358
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,791
to save the Nameks from Frieza
and his powerful minions?

359
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,416
Only one thing
is certain...

360
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,666
The showdown with this
deadly foe continues,

361
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,458
next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
