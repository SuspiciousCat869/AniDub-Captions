1
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,291
Supremely confident
in his power,

3
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,833
Frieza vowed to defeat Goku
without using his hands!

4
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,416
But, in issuing
himself this challenge,

5
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,541
it soon became clear that
Frieza had bitten off more

6
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,083
than he could chew!

7
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,541
[NARRATOR] Goku continued
to surprise the evil tyrant

8
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,541
with his incredible
strength and blinding speed...

9
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,000
until finally, hard-pressed by
the Saiyan's flurry of attacks,

10
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,375
Frieza was left
with one recourse...

11
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,833
So, I guess you had to
use your hands after all.

12
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:57,875
[FRIEZA growls]

13
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,958
[GOKU chuckles]

14
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,083
[FRIEZA giggles]

15
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,625
Okay, from now on,
the deal's off.

16
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,583
[GOKU] Yeah, well, I sort of
gathered that much already!

17
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,875
[FRIEZA] Oh, my! I'm so sorry.

18
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,833
Yeah, I'll bet! Well, don't
go losing any sleep over it.

19
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:18,000
Shoot! I'm sure that
it was an honest mistake!

20
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,375
Thanks, but no thanks.

21
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,458
[NARRATOR] Now, the time
for games at an end,

22
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,208
the two mighty
warriors square off,

23
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,416
ready to begin the battle anew!

24
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500
The epic struggle for the fate
of the universe continues today,

25
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,458
on Dragon Ball Z!

26
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
[FRIEZA] I really hate
to break this to you,

27
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,625
but I've been holding
back the lion's share

28
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,375
of my power for the
sake of amusement.

29
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,541
But now I'm going
to end this fight.

30
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:07,250
But before I do, I'd
like to make you an offer:

31
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,458
[GOKU] I'm listening.

32
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,958
[FRIEZA] Join me.

33
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,458
You have so much potential,
it would be a pity

34
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,291
to see it snuffed out
and gone to waste.

35
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,208
What d'ya say?

36
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,291
I can't do it, sorry.

37
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,708
See, I have this nasty
habit of following my heart.

38
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,833
And what does
that get you?

39
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,125
With me you would
live like a god.

40
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,791
Yes, you could have anything.

41
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,625
Or not. You could
choose to suffer and die.

42
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,166
Your call...

43
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,500
No way.

44
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,458
I have everything
that a man could want.

45
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,083
[FRIEZA] Oh-ho-ho, my!

46
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,000
You are so naive.

47
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,666
You know nothing of the
pleasures of this Universe!

48
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,833
Any desire that you have
could be instantly fulfilled!

49
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,500
But have it your way.

50
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,791
Die if you must.

51
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,083
But allow me to let you
in on a little secret.

52
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,875
Hm? What's that?

53
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,250
Well... I haven't even begun
to use my real power yet.

54
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,583
[GOKU] Yeah, well I have
some reserves myself!

55
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,958
Yes, I know.

56
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,333
Five.

57
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,916
Five times what
you've displayed.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,375
Ten at the very most.

59
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,666
But I... I've only used
one percent of my power.

60
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,666
Huh? What? No way!

61
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,291
You're bluffing!

62
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,250
It's just not possible!

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,333
Don't be glum.

64
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,791
You should actually
be flattered.

65
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,250
I've never had to summon
this much of my power

66
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,291
to defeat someone.

67
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,916
Fifty percent
of my maximum.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,791
That's all that's
required for this.

69
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,708
[FRIEZA giggles]

70
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,375
[GOKU growls]

71
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,625
I guess when you
realize this could be

72
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,000
your last fight, there's
no hurry to start.

73
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:13,916
[GOHAN gasps]

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,125
[PICCOLO] No kidding.

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,791
We've all experienced
that feeling before.

76
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,208
It's not easy.

77
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,458
But Goku seems to have
a knack for handling

78
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,458
this type of situation.

79
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,541
Do you think my Dad
can pull this one off?

80
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,000
It's hard
to tell, Gohan.

81
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,125
At this point,
both their powers

82
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:41,000
have gone beyond
our imagination!

83
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,458
That is true...

84
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:54,750
[GINYU laughing]

85
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,791
[GINYU] Love it!

86
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,708
[laughing continues]

87
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,250
[GINYU grunts]

88
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,666
[GINYU laughs]

89
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,291
[BULMA] Ribbit... Ribbit...

90
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,041
[BULMA thinking]
Who is this monster?!

91
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,166
How could he do this to me?!

92
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,625
I'm going to get him back
if it's the last thing I do!

93
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,333
[GINYU] Well, look
what we have here!

94
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,958
A stow-away, huh?!

95
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,208
Hmm...

96
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:22,250
This oughta take care
of the toad problem!

97
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,250
[GINYU laughing]

98
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,500
[BULMA screaming]

99
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,208
[GINYU laughing]

100
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,083
[thinking] I hate her!
She's obnoxious!

101
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,583
Wicked body-snatcher!

102
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,666
What did I do to deserve this?!

103
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,916
[BULMA sobs]

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,750
[BULMA screams]

105
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,208
[GINYU] Whoo-hooo!

106
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,791
[GINYU laughs]

107
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,500
[BULMA thinking] That does it!

108
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,583
Forget this! I can't
take it anymore!

109
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,458
Geronimooo!

110
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,000
[GINYU laughing]

111
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,000
Huh?! Wait-- What're you doing?!

112
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,541
Are you crazy?! I can't see!

113
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,083
[GINYU] Let go of me!

114
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,583
I hate frogs!

115
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,208
What are you doing?!

116
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,125
[PICCOLO] What th--?!

117
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:13,833
[GINYU screams]

118
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,708
[GINYU] Get off of me!

119
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,375
Whoaaa! I'm too young to die!

120
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,625
[GINYU] Let go of me!
I'm going to kill you!

121
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,083
[PICCOLO] Look out!

122
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,875
[BULMA grunts]

123
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,541
I still got it!

124
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,625
She's still got what?

125
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,208
[KRILLIN] Uhh, hey, Bulma!

126
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,791
What's going on?

127
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,291
I know you're mad at us for
leaving you by yourself,

128
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,416
but it's really not safe
for you to be here.

129
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,708
[GINYU chuckles]

130
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,500
Bulma...?

131
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,208
Are you okay...?

132
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,041
Did you get hit on
the head or something?

133
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,791
[high-pitched GINYU]
Hey, what's that?

134
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,625
That's where Goku and
Frieza are fighting...

135
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,791
[high-pitched GINYU]
Really?! Wow! There they are!

136
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,666
[KRILLIN] Hey! Bulma, no! Wait!

137
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,833
[high-pitched GINYU] Oh, my!
This is fantastic!

138
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,291
[GINYU giggles]

139
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,916
Ooh, yes.
Now I'm stoked.

140
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,000
You're choosing
to die

141
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,250
instead of joining me?

142
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,500
It's a real shame.

143
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,708
[FRIEZA giggles]

144
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,541
Huh?

145
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,125
[FRIEZA] You Saiyans are
really something else.

146
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,458
So proud.

147
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,333
So obstinate.

148
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,750
You're just like Vegeta
and Vegeta's father.

149
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,625
And that radical, Bardock.

150
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,708
You're all alike.

151
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,666
Too stubborn to
recognize a good deal.

152
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,000
Just like moths, rushing
into a flame to die.

153
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,625
But what can I do?

154
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,750
You leave me no other choice.

155
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,500
[FRIEZA] We could have
been so good together...

156
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,250
[high-pitched GINYU] Oh, yeah!

157
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:05,000
This is going to be one
fabulous show! This is awesome!

158
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,708
[GINYU thinking]
This is strange!

159
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,458
In this body, I can clearly
sense the intensity level

160
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,833
of each of their powers!

161
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,666
Vegeta learned how to
read power levels like this!

162
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,166
[GINYU giggles]

00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:17,500
[KING KAI] Well, Chiaotzu...
It's not looking too good.

325
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,666
I can tell you that.

326
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,333
[BOTH whimper]

327
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,333
[GOKU growls]

328
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,416
Huh?

329
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,875
Huh?!

330
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,500
Goku...

331
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:45,250
[TIEN] I wouldn't worry too
much about Goku yet, Chiaotzu!

332
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,500
No sweat...

333
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,875
He's gonna be fine.

334
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,416
[YAMCHA] What?

335
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,958
[TIEN] Don't forget, Goku
still has an ace up his sleeve.

336
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,333
Thanks to you.

337
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,166
Goku hasn't used the
Kaio-Ken Attack yet!

338
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,375
He'll set Frieza
straight when he does!

339
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,958
Right on!

340
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:01,916
[YAMCHA laughs]

341
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,291
[TIEN] He can still win!

342
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,333
[CHIAOTZU laughs]

343
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,166
[KING KAI] Knock it off!

344
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,208
You're all
being foolish!

345
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,083
[KING KAI] You don't know
what you're talking about!

346
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:19,875
Goku has been using the Kaio-Ken
Attack the entire time!

347
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,083
But now Frieza is
picking him apart,

348
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,333
even when he's fully
energized by the attack!

349
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,625
I don't know how
long he can last...

350
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,750
We may have to step in,
so stay on your toes!

351
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,291
Come on, Dad!

352
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,333
[high-pitched GINYU giggles]

353
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,416
[high-pitched GINYU]
This is great!

354
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
[ALL] Huh?

355
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,083
She's lost it.

356
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,125
[high-pitched GINYU] It looks
like Frieza's going to win

357
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,166
after all!

358
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,666
[high-pitched GINYU giggles]

359
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,083
I should have known!

360
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,166
[PICCOLO] Look!

361
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,750
Shut up or leave!
And that's final!

362
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,958
[high-pitched GINYU] Oh!

363
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,083
[KRILLIN] Are you sure
you're okay, Bulma?

364
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,583
[high-pitched GINYU] Yes!

365
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,958
I guess I got carried
away for a second there...

366
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,458
Sorry, guys!

367
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,666
[BULMA whines]

368
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,041
[KRILLIN &amp; GOHAN] Huh?

369
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,750
Hey!

370
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,583
[high-pitched GINYU]
What's the matter, guys...?

371
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,750
Why are you looking
at me so funny?

372
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:19,833
You wouldn't hurt a lady,
would you? Hmmmm?!

373
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,666
[GINYU laughs]

374
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,875
Hey! Look out!

375
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,583
It's Ginyu!

376
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,291
[NARRATOR] the situation has
become desperate for Goku!

377
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,416
With the Kaio-Ken Attack

378
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,666
rendered useless by
Frieza, where does

379
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,250
the mighty Saiyan from
Earth go from here?!

380
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,166
it seems that only
a miracle can save him!

381
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,041
And what does the
shameless body-snatcher

382
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,208
Captain Ginyu have in store
for Piccolo and the others?

383
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,541
Find out next time
on Dragonball Z!
