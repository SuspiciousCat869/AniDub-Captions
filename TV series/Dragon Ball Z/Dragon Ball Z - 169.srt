[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,916
Goku and Gohan finally returned
from their year of training,

3
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,666
and Goku traveled to the
tournament grounds to size up

4
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,083
his competition...

5
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,375
It was a tense moment
on the soon-to-be battlefield,

6
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,208
as the two super-powers
butted heads...

7
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,958
[GOKU] So leave everyone
else out of this

8
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,666
until we meet in the ring...

9
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,125
Agreed?

10
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,000
[NARRATOR] And that fight
is just nine days away!

11
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,625
[CELL] Well then, Goku...

12
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:46,166
You've just made my little
match even more interesting.

13
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,708
Well, if I were to
fight him right now,

14
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:55,375
I'm pretty confident that he
would beat me into the ground.

15
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,666
He still can use the Hyperbolic
Time Chamber once more.

16
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,250
[GOKU] Gohan and I
don't need a turn.

17
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,208
What?!

18
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,083
There's still
nine days left

19
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,708
so I think we'll just
train outside 'til then.

20
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,166
You're not serious?!

21
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,750
[NARRATOR]Goku means business,
but with just nine days left

22
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,416
until the
tournament begins,

23
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,083
he had better be ready
to take on Cell.

24
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,666
What could be the secret
to his confidence?

25
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,625
Find out today!

26
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,333
[PICCOLO] What do you mean
you're not going back in?

27
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,750
You mean you don't need to go?

28
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,041
[GOKU] Nope! There's no point!

29
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,958
But why?

30
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:52,000
You do realize you can still
spend another day in there.

31
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,916
I understand,
but I'd rather not go in.

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,083
It really won't help any.

[GOHAN gasps]

34
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:02,416
Training there takes
way too much out of me!

35
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,208
Hmph! I get it!

36
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:09,166
Little Kakarot finally admits
that he's too weak to continue!

37
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,666
Yeah right...

38
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,583
If you thinking torturing
your body training in there

39
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,458
is the same as training,
then go for it!

40
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,833
I wish you'd take
my advice, Vegeta.

41
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,791
Uh?

42
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,458
But... I know how
important it is to you

43
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,250
that you keep up with
my strength level.

44
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,791
So you'll be needing all
the time you can get.

Oh, really...?

Call me crazy...

48

but you make it sound as if

49
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,958
you've become a great deal
stronger than I am.

Sure! I'm far above you.

going to help you fight

then you can just forget it!

[GOKU] Thanks, Yajirobe,
but I wasn't going to ask you.

69
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,166
Like... I believe that!

Next, you'll tell me that you
just stopped by to say "hello"!

over good this time, huh?
What's your take on it?

76
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,458
Well... I was just
down there, Korin...

77
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,541
and I met with Cell
who I gotta say

78
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,166
looks pretty much
indestructible.

79
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,416
Then how come you
look so calm, Goku?

80
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,583
Spit it out! Did you discover
some great new secret

81
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,375
in the Hyperbolic
Time Chamber?

[GOKU laughs]

00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,916
Actually, yes!

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,041
[thinking] What?
When did he do that?!

85
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,041
I was with him
the whole time!

86
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,750
[GOKU] Korin, the reason
I came here was to ask you

87
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,291
if you knew how strong
Cell really is.

88
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:02,041
[KORIN] Hmm... Up to now he
hasn't shown his full potential,

89
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,291
but, yes, I can
tell you, more or less.

90
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,625
Then, can you tell me
where I stand?

91
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,333
Here, Korin, I'm gonna
channel my power for you!

92
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,583
[TIEN] Okay, when Goku and
Gohan came out of the chamber

93
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,000
they were Super Saiyan right?

94
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,625
And yet, they seemed
so... so different!

95
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,333
Don't you think so, Piccolo?

96
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:30,666
From what I've seen, I think
they're still Super Saiyans.

97
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,041
But it appears they've learned
how to stay powered up

98
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,500
in their daily lives,

99
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,375
without creating a strain
on their energy supply.

100
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,666
That means...

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,083
they can transform
into a more powerful body

102
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,500
when they fight!

103
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,916
You're missing the point!

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,250
Huh?!

105
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,583
It's not about powering up.

106
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,791
The point is that they won't
have to power up

107
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,250
when they fight.

108
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,333
They can use all the energy
it would take to transform

109
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,833
to increase their stamina,

110
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,791
and then only go
higher if they need to.

111

[thinking] How come
I didn't see that?!

113
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,333
I wasted all my energy because
I transformed too early

114
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,458
into a higher power level!

115
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:18,375
And that's the reason why
I wasn't able to beat Cell!

Ah, sorry to bother you...

162
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,041
That Goku!

163
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,916
Who does he think he is anyway?!

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,750
[KORIN thinking] Yes. That's
exactly what I'm wondering...

165
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,958
If Goku knows that
he's inferior to Cell,

166
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,375
how do you explain the fact
that he's being so calm?

167
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,708
I don't understand it! Something
about this whole situation

168
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,291
smells awfully fishy to me!

169
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,750
[KORIN sniffs]

170
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,583
Wow. That was intense.

171
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,625
Yes, Tien. Yes it was.

172
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:16,458
But imagine if he had exerted
all of his energy at once!

173
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,166
I doubt any of us would
still be standing here now.

174
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,625
Good! That just means that
we'll have a better chance!

175
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,250
[VEGETA thinking]
Curse you, Kararot!

176
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,500
Always one step ahead of me!

177
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:32,708
No matter how much I progress,
you always seem to surpass me!

178
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,750
And now you've done it again!

179
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,833
You're always there,
laughing in my face!

180
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,125
Why won't you leave me alone?!

181
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,750
Piccolo!

182
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,583
Get inside the stupid
time chamber now!

183
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,500
Quit wasting time!

184
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,875
Let's get your Mom
and go on home.

185
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,250
We'll have some
time to relax there.

186
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,916
I figure we'll have
three days of rest,

187
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,541
plus three days
for some training,

188
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,250
and then three more days of
rest before the tournament.

189
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,750
[GOHAN] Hey Dad!
Can I ask you something?

190
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,000
Well, I've just been
wanting to know...

191
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,666
Do you think we have
a chance to beat Cell?

192
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,916
[GOKU chuckles]

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,041
[GOKU] Hey, let's not worry
about all that right now!

194
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,708
We've got nine days!

195
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,500
Let's kick back for a while!

196
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,250
[ROSHI] Hmm?

197
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,333
Hiya!

198
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,875
[ALL] Huh?!

199
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:39,916
[GOKU laughs]

200
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,333
Hey, everybody, you surprised?

201
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,916
I-It's Goku...

202
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,375
Yeah.

203
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,416
Are you really Goku?

204
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,666
Of course I am.

205
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,625
Who else were you expecting?

206
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,833
Then you must be Gohan.

207
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,875
But you've buffed up!

208
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,583
No kidding!

209
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,083
Aw, you think?

210
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,250
Goku. Has anyone told you about

211
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,291
the tournament
Cell's having yet?

212
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,166
Mm-hmm. Trunks told me about it.

213
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,458
And I just came back from
checking out Cell's new body!

214
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,291
Huh? You what??!

215
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,458
[KRILLIN] So?!

216
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,375
You can take him
no problem, right, Goku?!

217
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,916
I... dunno...

218
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,833
From what I saw of him,
he looks pretty tough.

219
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,541
He'd probably lick me!

220
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,208
[GOKU laughs]

221
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,666
[ALL] Huh?!

222
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,500
[YAMCHA laughs]

223
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,916
Okay, quit fooling
around, Goku.

224
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're kidding, right?!

225
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,916
No, not at all.
I'm dead serious.

226
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,166
[YAMCHA gasps]

227
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,208
So how come you're
in such a good mood?!

228
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,833
You're hiding
something, aren't you?

229
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,458
[GOKU chuckles]

230
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,541
That's for me to know.

231
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,125
Where's ChiChi?

232
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,958
We've actually come
to take her home with us.

233
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,083
I think I heard her
upstairs somewhere.

234
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,625
Hey! Hey ChiChi!

235
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,041
[CHICHI] Goku?!
Is that really you?!

236
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,916
I was so worried about you,
I was just abo--

237
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,375
[CHICHI gasps]

238
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,416
Hi, honey! it's time
to take you home.

239
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,708
[CHICHI yelps]

240
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,208
Yeah, Mom. Let's go!

241
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:18,041
But what happened? Where is
my sweet, little Gohan?

242
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,125
I'm right here, Mom.

243
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,125
[GOKU laughs

244
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,500
Ah, babe, you crack me up!

245
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,250
Calm down... Calm down...

246
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,833

[ALL grunt]

249
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,458
What happened to your
beautiful black hair?!

250
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,666
Who gave you
permission to dye it?!

251
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,166
[GOHAN grunts]

252
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,083
It's not dyed, it's just--

00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,125
[CHICHI wails]

254
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,541
My sweet, little Gohan
has become a punker!

[sobbing]

256
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,750
No, it's not like that!

257
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, now. It's time for
my warm-up exercises.

258
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,250
[thinking] It's rare that I get
to make use of Frieza

259
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,416
and his father's
wonderful genes.

260

[CELL chuckles]

261

[CELL chuckles]

262
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,583
[CELL] Perhaps those
miserable humans

263
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,000
would appreciate
a little light show.

264
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,083
Huh...? Wow, pretty!

265
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,791
[WOMAN] What's going on ?!

266
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,291
[MAN] Asteroids!
Run for your lives!

00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,291
Goku!

268
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,583
[CHICHI] Goku?

269
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,500
[CHICHI] Gohan! Gohan!

270
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,208
Now... where did
they disappear to?

271
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,833
[GOHAN] This is nice, Dad.

272
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,291
[GOKU] Yeah...

273
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,500
Dad, you know what?

274
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,333
I'm so happy.

275
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,125
[GOKU] I'm glad you think so.

276
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,833
A long time ago,
you promised me

277
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,291
that we'd go fishing.

278
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,291
[GOKU] Hmm, really?
When did I promise that?

279
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,250
[GOHAN] C'mon! You mean,
you don't remember?

280
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,125
No, I don't.

281
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,416
Hey. I remember.

282
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,000
[GOKU] Krillin?

283
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,875
Let me jog your memory.

284
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,125
[KRILLIN] I was standing just
like this, and I said...

285
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,458
[PAST GOKU] Huh?

286
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,041
Hey, buddy.

287
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:47,041
I feel bad that you always have
to take off and defend us, but,

288
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,833
promise me you'll
come back in one piece?

289
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,208
Promise!

290
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,208
What about me?!

291
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,291
[GOKU] Hey, Gohan.

292
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,916
I promise that
when I get back,

293
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,958
we'll head out and go fishing!

294
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,791
Ohhh.

295
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,125
Well... Huh?

296
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,500
Yeah, right, I remember!

297
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,708
In a lot of ways, that
seems so long ago...

298
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,375
But at the same time,
it's like nothing's changed!

299
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,916
[GOKU] Those memories
keep us close.

300
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,500
You'll never forget them, right?

301
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,041
[GOHAN] Never.

302
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:25,541
Goku... I, ahh... got a bit
of a confession to make...

303
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,041
Like what?

304
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,875
I let Cell morph into
his ultimate form!

305
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,958
It's my fault because I
destroyed 18's controller!

306
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,416
Hey, don't sweat it, Krillin.

307
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,625
I know you wouldn't have
broken that controller

308
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,375
unless you had a good reason!

309
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:45,416
There was a reason... But I
feel like I let you down...

310
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,750
Don't be silly.
We're best friends, remember?

311
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,083
Yeah, me too!

312
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,708
I don't know what we'd
do without you, Krillin!

313
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,500
[KRILLIN] Ahh,
you're just saying that.

314
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,083
You two are way stronger
than I'll ever be,

315
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,833
so I wouldn't be
surprised if one day,

316
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,166
you just both moved on...

317
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,208
[GOKU] That has
nothing to do with it!

318
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,458
Have you forgotten all the time
we spent together

319
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,125
back at Master Roshi's?

320
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,458
Now look who's
losing his memory!

321
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,750
Hold on... Maybe if I
just... concentrate...

322
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,916
[GOKU laughs]

323
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,916
Knock it off!

324
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,375
[KRILLIN wails]

325
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,500
Help... Goku... Help... me...

326
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,708
Grab my hand! C'mon!

327
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,583
[KRILLIN chuckles]

328
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,041
[GOKU yells]

329
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,791
[KRILLIN laughs]

330
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,875
I got you good, sucker!

331
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,125
I should win an award for that!

332
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, you're real funny...

333
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,291
[GOHAN laughs]

334
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,958
Ahh... I love it!

335
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,625
[thinking] I suppose Goku really
hasn't changed that much.

336
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,375
At least on the inside...

337
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,791
[thinking] Look at them!

338
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,208
Super Saiyan even
when they sleep!

339
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,166
This must be part of
Goku's secret training!

340
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,791
[KRILLIN chuckles]

341
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,625
[thinking] I bet he
can sense everything

342
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,750
that's going on for miles!

343
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,791
[KRILLIN thinking] Which means
if I chucked this rock at him,

344
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,000
he'll just zap it
into a million pieces

345
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,958
without even opening his eyes.

346
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,708
[KRILLIN chuckles]

347
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,958
[thinking] This is
going to be so cool!

348
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,041
[GOKU screams]

349
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,833
What'd ya do that for?!

350
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,833
I... didn't... mean...

351
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,083
Darn it! If that's your
idea of a joke,

352
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,916
then you've lost your mind!

353
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,416
[KRILLIN whimpers]

354
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,916
Ahhh... That was good!

355
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,416
Gohan, time to do your homework.

356
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,375
'Kay!

357
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,875
Huh?!

358
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,291
[thinking] Man, if this is what
Goku meant by training

359
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:26,333
in the outside world,
we're in a whole lotta trouble!

360
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,583
Ahh... I'm full now...

361
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,583
[NARRATOR] Krillin's
may be on to something!

362
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,916
This doesn't look anything like
a training schedule

363
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,958
for the hopeful-savior
of the planet.

364
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,416
And with only nine days left
before the Cell Games begin,

365
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,333
there isn't much room for error.

366
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:54,166
The day is fast approaching,
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
