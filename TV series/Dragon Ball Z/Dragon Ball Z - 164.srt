00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,625
Trunks jumped into a
one-on-one brawl against Cell.

3
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,583
With Vegeta beaten
and Goku still in training,

4
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:24,250
it was clear that Trunks
was the planet's last hope.

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,916
[KRILLIN] Hang in there,
Trunks... You have to beat Cell!

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,125
You're the only
one who can do it now!

7
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,875
[NARRATOR] Kicking
into second gear,

8
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,250
Trunks struggled to keep
Cell at bay long enough

9
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,041
for Vegeta to be rescued.

10
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,041
Now, alone on the battlefield,

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,250
Trunks is pushing his
powers as far as he can.

12
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,250
[TRUNKS] ...Come and get me!

13
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:47,625
I will, but show me some of that
wonderful power of yours first.

14
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,625
[NARRATOR] Cell,
loaded with confidence

15
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,208
after pummeling Vegeta,

16
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,000
is actually encouraging Trunks
to unleash his maximum power.

17
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,666
The evil android is
anxious for a good fight,

18
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,041
and by the looks of it, that's
exactly what he's going to get.

19
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,958
[NARRATOR] Get ready, it's
time for these two titans

20
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,916
to engage in the
fight for the future!

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,833
Today, on Dragon Ball Z!

why the boy was not scared.

[TRUNKS yelling in distance]

30
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,625
Huh?

31
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,375
What's happening back there?

32
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,291
Hey, that's not a storm
cloud... that's Trunks!

33
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,583
How can I feel his energy
from this far away?

34
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,875
Yikes! I'm glad I'm
not a lightning rod.

35
00:04:55,916 --> 00:05:00,875
[TRUNKS yells]

36
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,958
[ROSHI] Earthquake!
Run for your lives!

[YAMCHA whimpers]

38
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,375
That's no earthquake.

[ROSHI yelps]

40
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,291
[ROSHI] Hmm...?

41
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,833
That's quite a view!

42
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,375
[CHICHI gasps]

43
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,791
Watch the hands, old man!

44
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,125
[ROSHI] D'oh!

45
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:26,166
[TRUNKS yells]

46
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,583
[BABY TRUNKS babbles]

47
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,916
I've never felt energy
that strong before.

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,208
It can't be possible!

49
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,333
That's Trunks' energy.

50
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:49,916
He passed Vegeta? How can that
be? He'll beat Cell for sure!

51
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:56,833
[TRUNKS yells]

52
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,208
Nice light show, Trunks.

53
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,458
It's such a shame
Vegeta isn't here to see

54
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,791
that you have
surpassed his power.

55
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,458
As long as I have the
power to destroy you, Cell,

56
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,250
that's all that matters to me.

57
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,208
Your kind ruined my future,

58
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,625
and I'll sacrifice
everything to change it!

59

[WOMAN A shrieking]

60
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,416
[TRUNKS] The world
I grew up in

61
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,416
was devastated by
Dr. Gero's androids.

62
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,416
They took control of the planet
and terrorized the population.

63
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,416
Here they come again! Those
monsters are going to attack us!

64
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,958
What can we do?
There's no escape!

00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,583
I do enjoy destroying these
cities, and how about you?

68
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,583
Isn't it wonderful
that these humans

69
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,833
have so many buildings
for us to annihilate?

70
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,833
Yeah, but I think we
need to spice things up.

71
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,416
Mass destruction just
isn't fun anymore.

72
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,208
[TRUNKS] The androids
continued their path of terror,

73
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,208
and finally found the
excitement they were looking for

74
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,750
when they slaughtered my father!

[VEGETA screams]

[TRUNKS] Thrilled by
the new challenge,

80
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,208
the androids tracked
down all of the Z Fighters.

81
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,458
Even Piccolo was
quickly overwhelmed.

[TRUNKS] Tien was
taken out next.

86
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,208
[TRUNKS] Then the Androids
went after Yamcha!

Poor Yajirobe never even
saw them coming...

[TRUNKS] One-by-one they
destroyed the greatest fighters

on the planet...

90
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,375
...until there was no one
left to challenge them.

91
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,583
No one except Gohan and me.

92
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,375
We were the last
fighters to survive.

Oh, look... it's Gohan.

said the same thing...

right before we destroyed them?

Let's just bomb the whole area.

That will draw those

What should we do?

thought you were invincible.

What should we do?

but he was too
overwhelmed by their power.

find a way to break the grip

I helped my mother build a time
machine and traveled to the past

to alter the events that had
led to this disastrous future.

00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,958
And though that
saddens me greatly...

162
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:29,375
I know that my revenge will
be realized through you.

163
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,791
Nothing will stand in your way!

164
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,333
[COMPUTER] Warning!
Chamber breach imminent!

165
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:42,541
Warning! System
malfunction! Warning!

166
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,958
Warning! Warning!

167
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,875
[DR. GERO] Cell,
you will need to absorb

168
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,958
the bio extract of the living

169
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,791
to move into your next
stage of development.

170
00:13:54,875 --> 00:14:00,750
You must feed to grow, but your
hunger will never be satisfied.

171
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,625
That is the beauty
of your design.

172
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:08,500
You will always have an
insatiable appetite for power,

173
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,000
much like my own.

174
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,375
My enemies will become yours.

175
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:18,750
Seek them out and
destroy all of them!

176
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:23,750
But never forget that your main
objective is to become complete.

177
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:28,250
The only way to do that is
to find the other androids

178
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,750
and absorb them.

179
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:35,500
Only then will you evolve
into your perfect form.

180
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,333
[CELL] And so it began.

181
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,583
My reign over this planet
was swift and relentless.

182
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,291
I set out to find
Android 17 and 18

183
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,375
by following the
trail of devastation

184
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,791
they left in their wake.

185
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:13,208
Along the way I absorbed
as much bio extract as I could.

186
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,333
At first there was resistance,

187
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,250
but I consumed all
who challenged me

188
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,333
and the rest fell in line.

189
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:23,041
There really is nothing better
than the cold taste of fear.

190
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,541
[WOMAN B screams]

191
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,125
[MAN C] The monster...
he's coming this way!

192
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,791
Don't be afraid...
stay together!

193
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,708
[MAN D] Let's get 'im!

194
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,166
[MAN D yells]

195
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,333
[MAN D squeals]

196
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,791
[MAN D screams]

197
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,250
Let's blast him!
Come on... FIRE!

198
00:15:56,333 --> 00:16:01,333
[GROUP yelling]

199
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,291
[GROUP gasping]

200
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:19,333
[screaming]

201
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,916
Retreat!

202
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,958
[screaming]

203
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:36,791
[MAN F] Oh, please, no!

204
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:37,750
[MAN F grunts]

205
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,958
[screaming continues]

206
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,583
[MAN C rasps]

207
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,291
[MAN G groans]

208
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:51,125
[screaming]

209
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,166
[CELL chuckles]

210
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,916
[CELL] Dr. Gero was right.

211
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,458
No one stood in my way.

212
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,333
Every victim
gave me more strength.

213
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:06,000
I could feel the cells
in my body transforming.

214
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,000
As my power grew,
so did my hunger,

215
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,291
and I yearned to
become complete.

216
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:16,000
To do that, I needed to
absorb Androids 17 and 18,

217
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,166
but no matter how
fast I searched,

218
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,333
it seemed I was always
one step behind.

219
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:26,375
Finally, I learned why. The
androids had been deactivated.

220
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,958
I believe I have you
to thank for that, Trunks.

221
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:34,250
And really, I do thank you. For
it proved to work out perfectly.

222
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,000
By stealing your time machine...

223
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,500
I was able to absorb
the androids here

224
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,000
and become complete.

225
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,708
And now that I'm ready,

226
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,875
I have a world not yet
touched by the androids.

227
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,250
Which means, all the
more for me to devour.

228
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,875
I have achieved my perfect form.

229
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,166
Dr. Gero will have his revenge

230
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,541
and this pathetic
planet will be destroyed.

231
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,416
And you're responsible
for all of it!

232
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,875
[CELL giggles]

233
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,166
[CELL chuckles]

234
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,833
By traveling back in time,

235
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,708
you thought you could
change the events

236
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,166
of the future, didn't you?

237
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,708
Well, let me assure you
that you were successful,

238
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,000
though not quite
in the way you planned!

239
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,458
[TRUNKS growls]

240
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,291
[CELL] Rather than prevent
the world's destruction--

241
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,166
[CELL laughs]

242
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,625
[CELL] You've guaranteed it!

243
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:47,416
[CELL growls]

244
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,416
[CELL] Let me show you my
complete power.

245
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,125
Observe, my little friend.

246
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,291
[TRUNKS] Go on!
Show me what you've got!

247
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,125
And you'll be
the first to see the

248
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,500
true power of the Saiyan race!

249
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:10,000

[TRUNKS shouts]

[TRUNKS] Give it up, Cell!
It's over!

254
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:06,041
What?! He's gone! I know he
can withstand more than that!

260
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,375
You cannot win, Cell!

261
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:38,250
I'm going to make sure that
all androids are gone for good!

262
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,125

Huh?!

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,375
Huh?

[CELL chuckles]

271
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:59,208
Impressive... I must admit
you have exceeded me, Trunks.

272
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,916
At least in the area
of brute strength.

273
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:12,416
And yet, you have absolutely
no chance of defeating me!

274
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,625
[TRUNKS growls]

275
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,041
[TRUNKS] Listen to yourself!
What kind of logic is that?!

276
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,750
Oh, you'll see.

Trunks and Cell is
well underway.

00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,208
And after a
bone-breaking first round,

281
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,708
the young Saiyan seems
to have a slight upperhand.

282
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:50,000
But what secret does Cell know?
Why is he so relaxed?
