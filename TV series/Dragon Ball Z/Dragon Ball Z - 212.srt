[ANNOUNCER] Heyyyyyy!
All you crazy fans!

2
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,708
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,333
It was time at last for the

4
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,666
World Martial Arts
Tournament to begin.

5
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,291
And who better to lead off the
opening ceremonies

6
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,916
than the reigning
champ himself, Mr. Satan?

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,208
The big day kicked-off
with the Junior Competition.

8
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,416
The event started in
promising fashion,

9
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,875
but all the fans
cheering for action

10
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,791
were soon struck speechless as
these young warriors

11
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,250
showcased their rather
unconventional techniques.

12

[screaming]

14
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,333
[NARRATOR] Yes--despite
some heavy competition,

15
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,375
the tournament was
quickly shaping up

16
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,666
to be more farce than fight.

17
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,833
--[KORI-YU grunting]
--[ANNOUNCER yells]

18
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:08,125
[NARRATOR] That is, until
Trunks entered the arena!

19
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,166
[IDASA] Come on! Fight!

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,375
Don't you worry...

21
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,083
You'll feel it soon
enough, big-mouth.

22
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,333
[NARRATOR] The contest took a
serious turn as the young Saiyan

23
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,416
expertly defeated his
opponent with a single kick!

24
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,833
[IDASA'S MOM screams]

25
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,416
[IDASA grunts]

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,916
[NARRATOR] Trunks easily set the
standard for the competition,

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,375
but there was one other
fighter who could match it.

28
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,083
In a brilliant display of skill
and determination,

29
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,708
Goten rapidly advanced through
the ranks of the tournament.

30
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,833
[GOKU] Alright, Goten!
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

31
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:41,125
Aww! What a little guy, huh?
And handsome, too! 

32
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,291
[NARRATOR] It was a proud
moment indeed for Goku,

33
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,791
who watched from the stands as
his son took center stage.

34
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,250
[ANNOUNCER] Allright!
Fighters, are you ready?!

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,958
Let's do it!

36

[IKOSE yelling]

38
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,875
Gosh... This is it?
This isn't any fun...

39
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,208
[NARRATOR] The competition
tried, but fell by the wayside,

40
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,750
until only the final
two fighters remained.

41
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,875
[TRUNKS] Just to let you know
I am going to win. Understood?

42
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,625
Yeah! I'm going
for the win, too.

[thinking] I can't believe it!

56
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,833
This is the match I've been
waiting for all of these years!

57
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,833
Just when I was starting to
give up hope, it came!

58
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,208
This is too good to be true!

59
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,458
And this is only
the Junior Division!

60
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,541
[KRILLIN] Check those
two out, would ya?

61
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,875
Staring each other down
in classic stance!

62
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,166
I love it!

63
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,250
They're really doing
well! That's for sure!

64
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,500
[KRILLIN] Awesome!
Way better than I expected!

65
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,791
This match could get
really interesting!

66
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,375
[CHICHI] Come on, Goten!
You can do it, Son!

67
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,583
Yaye, Trunks!
You're doing great, Son!

68
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,416
Pretty impressive. Somehow
you've managed to get

69
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,291
a lot stronger than the
last time we faught.

70
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,541
Ha, ha! Gee, thanks, Trunks!
I owe it all to Gohan though!

71
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,291
He's the one that's been
training me all this time.

72
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,750
[TRUNKS] Well, he did good.

73
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,041
But... not good
enough! Try this!

74
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,916
Huh?

Oh no!

77
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,875
This place is way too crowded
to be firing energy blasts!

78
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,833
He... could really
hurt someone!

79
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,791
We can't let him do it!

80

Ahh, it'll be okay!

81

[KRILLIN] Huh?

like some kind of rocket!

fire against the rules?!

--[CROWD roars]

320
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,791
Yaye! Way to go!
Alright, Trunks!

321
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:12,125
Poor Goten...
He tried so hard...

322
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,375
--[BULMA cheers]
--[ROSHI] Well...

323
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,166
Both those boys
did their best!

324
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,833
And it looks like I'm
not doing so bad myself!

325
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,041
[ROSHI chuckles]

326
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,500
[ROSHI grunts]

327
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,916
[VIDEL whimpers]

328
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,541
Trunks too?

329
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,708
You mean they're
both Super Saiyans?

330
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,208
Wow! What's up with
this generation?!

331
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,666
[VEGETA laughs]

332
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,083
[VEGETA] Cheer up, Kakarot!
There's always next year!

333
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,833
Your son put up a good fight!

334
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,000
But there can only
be one champion!

335
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,500
[ANNOUNCER] Let's hear it for
these two young warriors, folks!

336
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,458
Trunks and Goten!

337
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,708
What happened?!

338
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,791
I don't know! They moved
too fast for me to tell!

339
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,875
[ANNOUNCER] Remember those
two names, people!

340
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm sure we'll be hearing them
for a long time to come

341
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,333
at future Championships!

342
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,291
[GOTEN growls]

343
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,583
So what's the big idea, Trunks?!

344
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,666
That wasn't fair
at all! You lied!

345
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,625
You said you wouldn't
use your left hand

346
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,875
OR transform into
a Super Saiyan!

347
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,083
But you did both, you jerk!

348
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:17,541
Hey! It's just a game, right?!
Besides, you transformed once

349
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,125
so, that makes us
even-steven! One time each!

350
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,041
As far as using the
left hand goes,

351
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,666
I did slip up a little bit,

352
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,291
but I still didn't use
it to punch you! Right?!

353
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,833
Come on! Don't be mad at me!

354
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,791
I'll tell you what!

355
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,875
You can have
three of my toys!

356
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,083
You pick 'em!

357
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,666
What?! Really?! Cool!

358
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,416
I get to pick! Wow!
I know which ones too!

359
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Thank you, Trunks!

360
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,958
[GOTEN laughs]

361
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,458
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and Gentlemen,

362
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,333
before get started with
the adult competition...

363
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,500
we're going to have
our special exhibition match

364
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,000
between the new Junior
World Champion, Trunks,

365
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:58,166
and Mr. Satan, the reigning
World Martial Arts Champion!

366
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:04,250
--[CROWD cheers]
--[MR. SATAN whimpers]

367
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:08,375
[ANNOUNCER]
That's right! Mr. Satan!

368
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:13,541
The most renowned Martial
Artist in the world!

369
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,333
The hero who saved
the world from Cell!

370
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,083
What a treat, to see this
veteran Master of the arts

371
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:25,833
in a friendly match with Trunks,
the rising, new rookie star!

372
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,333
Ha! This isn't going to be
much of a fight, you know?

373
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,875
Right! You better not
blink, or you'll miss it!

374
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,125
[KRILLIN laughs]

375
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,083
[VEGETA chuckles]

376
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,875
Trunks is going to
pulverise this noisy fool.

377
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,041
World Champion? I've known
stronger house-plants.

378
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,458
Oh, yeah right, Vegeta!

379
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,916
[GOHAN laughs]

380
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,708
Come on, Jokester!

381
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:47,791
Uh-huh...?

382
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,166
[GOHAN] What a crazy,
funny guy, huh?!

383
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,583
[GOHAN laughs]

384
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,416
[GOHAN] Oh, man!
That's a good one!

385
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,208
Vegeta! He should be a comedian!
He's got a million of 'em!

386
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,166
[ANNOUNCER] Alright, folks!

387
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,916
The reigning World Champion

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,875
should be coming out
any minute now!

389
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:06,791
[GOTEN laughs]

390
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,583
Wow, cool! I wish I was champ!

391
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,375
[GOTEN laughs]

392
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,416
[ANNOUNCER] I know he's
around here somewhere, folks!

393
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,958
How about a big cheer
to lure him out?!

394
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,708
--Give it up for Mr. Satan!
--[CROWD cheers]

395
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,541
[ANNOUNCER] Alright! Now that's
what I call a hero's welcome!

396
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,750
[cheering continues]

397
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,541
[ANNOUNCER]
Unbelievable! It didn't work!

398
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,750
--Can we get it a little louder?
--[cheering grows louder]

399
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,916
[ANNOUNCER] Come on!
You can get louder than that!

400
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,291
One more time! Give
it everything you've got!

401
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:41,375
Ready! One, two, three... Go!

402

[CROWD roars]

403
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,750
[ANNOUNCER] Alright! Alright!

404
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,458
Nobody can resist
a welcome like that!

405
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,666
Where are you, Mr. Satan?!

406
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,416
--Come on out!
