00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,291
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,166
the two terrifying
Saiyan warriors

3
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,291
continued their
journey through space.

4
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,291
Every passing minute they
get closer and closer

5
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,500
to planet Earth!

6
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,541
Meanwhile, Goku is still
in the other world

7
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,458
jogging along
Snake Way,

8
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,000
in search of the
legendary King Kai.

9
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,708
His goal, to get some special
martial arts training

10
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:34,583
from the King,
if he can find him.

11
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,625
But what about
poor Gohan?

12
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,666
Has he been left
all alone on Earth

13
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,708
to become a bite-sized
snack for a hungry T-Rex?

14
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,750
I don't think so!

15
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,125
The pint-sized powerhouse
is busy training

16
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,250
and he's already learned his
first lesson in survival.

17
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,500
It's not how big you
are that matters,

18
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,500
it's how big you slice
your T-Rex tail steak!

19
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,125
Though Gohan can
hold his own,

20
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:02,000
he remains under the
watchful eye of Piccolo.

21
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,416
So, he's starting to
master the training.

22
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,166
[chuckles]

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,208
[NARRATOR]
After a hard day's training,

24
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,875
Gohan has decided to turn in
for some much deserved rest.

25
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,166
On this cool night,
underneath the starry sky,

26
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,583
the whole world seems
to be at peace.

27
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:33,208
But, Gohan has more than
pleasant dreams on his mind.

28
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:38,958
[chattering]

29
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,708
[GOHAN dreaming]
Daddy... Daddy...

30
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,666
Let's go... Daddy...

31
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:51,500
[GOHAN growls]

32
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,833
Aaahhh!

33
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:02,208
[RADITZ groans]

34
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:08,000
Run! Gohan! Go now!
Get out of here!

35
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,750
[GOHAN]
Daddy... No...

36
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,750
[birds chirp]

37
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,166
[GOHAN laughs]

38
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,625
[GOHAN] Hello mister sun!
Thanks for the beautiful day!

39
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,083
[laughs]

40
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:40,083
My hands are dry! Now it's
time to get something to eat!

41
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,000
[GOHAN laughs]

42
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,666
[GOKU breathes heavily]

43
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,166
[GOKU thinking]
I gotta be getting close

44
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,416
to King Kai's place by now!

45
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,750
Gotta find King Kai...
Gotta find King Kai...

46
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,000
Gotta find King Kai...

47
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,208
Gotta find King Kai...
Gotta find King Kai...

48
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,250
Gotta find King Kai...

49
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,041
[ROSHI] Hmm?
It seems as if Goku's

50
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,791
been gone
a long time,

51
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,125
I wonder if he's met up with
King Kai and begun training?

52
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,541
[TURTLE] Remember
what Baba told us,

53
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,875
don't let Goku come back
to life for a year,

54
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,291
even if we collect
all the Dragon Balls.

55
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,541
Yes. But a
whole year?

56
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,125
That's not very good for
us because by that time,

57
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,875
the Saiyans will
already be on Earth!

58
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,958
Yeah, but do you
think there's any chance

59
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,416
that we could protect the Earth
from the Saiyans on our own?

60
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,708
[ROSHI groans]

61
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,625
[TURTLE sighs]

62
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,375
[TURTLE] Oh, well it's
been nice knowing ya.

63
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,750
[KRILLIN] Are we
almost there, Bulma?

64
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,208
[BULMA] Relax, would ya?!
We're going to get there!

65
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,208
I promise it won't
be too much longer!

66
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,791
I hope not 'cause we gotta
find Tien and Chiaotzu

67
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,916
and climb Korin Tower!

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,416
Look, I just
want to be ready

69
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,291
when those
Saiyans arrive!

70
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,208
You're right. The fate of
the Earth is at stake.

71
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,875
[engine accelerates]

72
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,708
[CHIAOTZU] Hm?

73
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,166
Oh!

74
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,916
[TIEN grunts]

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,500

Aaahhhh!

[gunfire]

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,333
Hey! Come on,
it's lunch time!

81
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,375
You better come get it while
it's hot! I don't deliver!

82
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,583
Let's go you two!
Get in gear!

83
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,541
Ooohh!

84
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,333
Whoa, Tien...
look!

85
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,000
You made all
this yourself?

86
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,208
[LAUNCH]
What are you crazy?

87
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,791
I hired a bunch of cooks
to do all the work!

88
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,583
These guys are the
best in the business

89
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,583
and they only use the
freshest ingredients...

90
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,583
Right?!

91
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,875
All this food must
have cost a lot.

92
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,416
Don't worry about it.

93
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,666
I just happened to have come
into a lot of dough lately...

94
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,333
Here you go, Tien.

95
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,333
How long are you going to
keep training for anyway?

96
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,291
He won't stop training until
he knows he can beat Goku.

97
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah right...
Like that's gonna happen!

98
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,458
These are peaceful times.

99
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,291
There's no need to pump
yourself up so much

100
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,250
if you don't really
have to fight.

101
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,125
Besides you're
strong enough, Tien.

102
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,625
[TIEN] I'm not
strong enough.

103
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,500
[LAUNCH] Hm?

104
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:18,250
I know if I train hard
I will beat Goku someday...

105
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,750
But this world is small
and full of many people.

106
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,541
Each one might
try to challenge me.

107
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,291
And that is why
I must train.

108
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,333
Hmph. Good for you, Tien.

109
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,125
But why don't you put
your strength to good use

110
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,166
and come to work with me?
You'd get rich.

111
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,166
Just think, with your
brawn and my brains,

112
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,208
we could pull off some
major bank heists.

113
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,541
It would be so easy,

114
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,000
in no time we'd be living
like royalty for sure.

115
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,208
'Cause money does
buy happiness!

116
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,416
You with me?

117
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,791
[CHIAOTZU] Tien, let's
eat. I'm starving!

118
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,791
Now that's a good boy.
You go ahead and start eating.

119
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,458
You gotta keep
your strength up!

120
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,916
[CHIAOTZU]
Thank you!

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,500
[LAUNCH] Look, Tien, robbing
banks is the way to go!

122
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,916
It's so exciting when
you take control.

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,333
You fire one
shot in the air

124
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,416
and everybody
scatters like mice!

125
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,625
So, come on...

126
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,000
Whatta ya say you and
I give it a shot?

127
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,458
We could be great!

128
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,833
Huh?

00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,250

How come?

Doesn't he know it's an
offer he can't refuse?

132
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,666
Thanks for the food.
It was delicious!

133
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,833
[LAUNCH] Oh no! You can't
leave without your dessert!

Aaahh!

135
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,625
Why don't you take a
bite of this, baldy?

training is going well...

You're going
to need it.

[GOKU breathes heavily]

141
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,583
Huh?

142
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,458
Hi! What are you doing
all the way out here?

143
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,125
What does it look like I'm
doing? I'm sweeping Snake Way!

144
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,458
King Yemma asked
me to do it

145

'cause he likes to keep
it nice and clean!

146
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,750
Hm? No kidding? I'm on my
way to King Kai's place!

147
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,666
What? You're running all
the way to King Kai's place?

Well for your feet's sake

I hope you brought an extra
pair of shoes with you.

Why is it a long
way away from here?

151
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,208
Now, that all depends on what
you consider a long way,

152
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,500
but from here
I would say

153
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,583
that you're about a
quarter of the way there!

What?! No way! I'm only a
quarter of the way there?

[GOKU] Sure, I've just
got to rest a bit!

160
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,291
Right.

Hey! If you want me to,

163
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,208
I can give you a ride
half of the way there.

164
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,833
Come on,
hop on the back!

165
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,375
[GOKU] Really?
All right! Hahaha!

166
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,166
Great! Thanks! Let's go!

Mm!

It worked,
Tien!

No, it didn't. It's still
not good enough, my friend.

in control of my powers soon,

it could be
disastrous...

for this right now!

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,500
[CHIAOTZU] Huh?

229
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,500
What happened?

Oh no! I must have
sneezed again!

[BULMA] Tien is somewhere
in these mountain ranges...

00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,791
[KRILLIN] Heh. That figures.
It's just the kind of place

233
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,625
he'd want to
do his training.

234

[LAUNCH] Tien, I'm sorry for
all the trouble I've caused you.

235
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,791
I think it's time for me to go
back to the Turtle House now.

236
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,250
[TIEN] That's a good idea. Give
my regards to Master Roshi.

237
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,500
Tell him I'm
still training

238
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,916
and I'll come visit as
soon as I'm finished.

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,916
[LAUNCH] Okay, I will!
See you two later!

Now I can finally
concentrate on my training.

You know I've been
looking for you!

You won't get
away from me!

257
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,291
[CHIAOTZU] Huh?

258
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,708
Now I want you two
to quit goofing around

259
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,375
and get over
here right now!

[BULMA and KRILLIN yell]

[TIEN] What?
No, that can't be...

266
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,125
Goku's dead?

267
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,541
[KRILLIN] Yeah, he's
training with King Kai

268
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,666
in the other world.

269
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,208
We don't know how
long he'll be gone,

270
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,708
so we'll have to prepare for
the Saiyan's arrival on our own.

271
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,833
[BULMA]
That's right.

272
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,083
And Kami is going to
help us get ready!

Kami!

274

I'll help if you need me!
Let's get going!

275
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,208
[CHIAOTZU] But Tien,
we can't leave here...

00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,333

277
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,708
Quiet little man!

[LAUNCH]
Oh, Tien....

281
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,875
Don't even think about
trying to forget me!

282
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,666
I'm going to follow
you wherever you go

283
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,625
and I don't care if you go
all the way to Kami's place!

284
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,291
Hm!

285
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,000
[thinking] All right...

286
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,125
I'll train as hard
as I can with Kami...

287
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,041
We'll defeat the Saiyans and
I'll defeat Goku as well!

288
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,291
[snoring] Hi ya, King Kai.
My name's Goku.

289
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,000
It's a real honor to meet ya.
Sorry, I'm late! Um...

00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,375
Aahh!

291
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,583
Ouch! Boy, when you
start training

292
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,333
you don't mess around,
do you King Kai?

293
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,125

[GOKU]
Hey? Where am I?

296
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,041
I remember hitching
a ride on that truck

297
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,791
but how did I end up
in a place like this?

298
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:00,666
Huh?

299
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,750
[sniffs]

300
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,833
Smells good!

301
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,958
Well... As long
as I'm here,

302
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,500
I might as well get
something to eat!

303
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,666
I've still got a long
journey ahead of me.

304
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,958
Those look tasty!

[thwack]
[groans]

306
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:38,083
[NARRATOR] Goku goes off the
beaten path and gets beaten...

307
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,291
But by who?

308
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,000
And, there are more
urgent matters at hand.

309
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,250
The Saiyans are still
on course for Earth,

310
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,583
and if Goku doesn't get some
training from King Kai soon,

311
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,833
the planet won't have
a chance of surviving!

312
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,166
Don't miss the next
exciting episode

313
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,750
of Dragon Ball Z!
