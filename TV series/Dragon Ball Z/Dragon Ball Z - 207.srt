00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,875
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,000
Gohan trained with
his little brother

3
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,791
for the World Martial
Arts Tournament,

4
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,750
which begins in one month.

5
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,875
And a strong arm proved to be
the least of Goten's talents!

6
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,750
[GOTEN] Since... Mom's not here,
is it okay if I be like you?

7
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,833
You know, a Super Saiyan?

8
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,625
[NARRATOR] Those green eyes and
gold spikes of hair

9
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,458
can only mean one thing:

10
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,583
Somehow, Goten
has already mastered

11
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,333
the switch to Super Saiyan!

12
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,500
An amazing jump indeed for the
half-Saiyan half-pint,

13
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,500
considering he doesn't
even know how to fly.

14
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,125
[GOTEN] Funny?! Well, you
better teach me how to fly,

15
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,958
because I don't like
being laughed at!

16
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,041
You hear me?!

17
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,541
[GOHAN] Whoa, whoa,
easy there...

18
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,166
[NARRATOR] And from there,
the next step was a shoe-in.

19
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,166
Gohan would have to hold
some flying lessons.

20
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,166
[GOTEN] Wow! You will?!

21
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,458
[NARRATOR] But Goten
wasn't the only student

22
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,875
enrolling in Gohan's course!

23
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,625
[VIDEL] Well,
I've got news for you,

24
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,291
you're going to teach me to fly!

25
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,625
That's fine!

26
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,166
I gave you my word and
that's all there is to it!

27
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,625
[NARRATOR] Flying class begins,
today on Dragon Ball Z!

28
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,666
[GOTEN laughs]

29
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,625
I've... never done
this before...

30
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:40,625
Ah... Uh... But teaching
can't be that hard right?!

31
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,041
Right... anyway...

32
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,916
So to fly, you basically take
control of your energy.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,833
Then you sort of
put it underneath you,

34
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,208
and your energy holds you up!

35
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,416
Really, a toddler could do it!

36
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,041
[VIDEL growls]

37
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,583
I, mean an extremely
talented toddler

38
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,541
who's put years of hard
work into it, of course.

39
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,791
This energy business...

40
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,791
What are you talking about?

41
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,791
Well... It's uh...

42
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,333
Guess... they call it something
different where you're from...

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,708
Well, it's like that power you
can feel inside of your body,

44
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,875
--and--
--What?!

45
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,791
Who are YOU to be talking
about MY body?!

46
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,500
[GOTEN laughs]

47
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,000
[GOHAN groans]

48
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,916
I don't think I'll ever find
the right words for this...

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,625
[VIDEL growls]

50
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,125
It's like this!

51
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,750
Yeah... It's... like that!

52
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,250
I see...

53
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,125
So if you guys don't
call that energy,

54
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,125
what do you call it, Videl?

55
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,333
[VIDEL] Huh...?

56
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,291
Well, it's a trick.

57
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,958
No, that can't be right.

58
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,333
It's all real!

59
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,833
We're not trying to
trick anybody!

60
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,291
Well, if it's not a trick,

61
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,041
then I've never seen it
in my whole life, okay?!

62
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,416
Okay... I hear you.

63
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,166
This is... gonna be
harder than I thought...

64
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,791
[VIDEL] So... I can't fly
if I don't have the energy?

65
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,791
Don't worry! Every living
person has it inside them!

66
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,583
You just... have to find it!

67
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,250
I will.

68
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,708
Alright then.

69
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,000
Goten, can you
hang tight for a while?

70
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,000
Before we move
any farther along,

71
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,541
I need to show Videl
how to use her energy.

72
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,041
Alright... But...

73
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,750
If you ask me,
it's a waste of time!

74
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,666
Hey! I'll learn it!

75
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,333
Ahhh... Go on, Goten!
Go play somewhere else.

76
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,125
[GOTEN] Okay! I'll go play!

77
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,333
But I'll be back!
And you better be ready!

78
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,416
[GOHAN] Alright, Goten!
We will be!

79
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,708
[GOTEN laughs]

80
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,833
[GOHAN] I'll do it slowly...

81
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:58,875
That way...

82
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,750
You can watch me better.

83
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,666
The first thing
that you have to do

84
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,333
is make yourself
completely calm.

85
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,541
Then you listen...

86
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,833
Listen to the center
of your body...

87
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,041
Until you start to feel a pull.

88
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,541
Then...

89
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,791
[VIDEL gasps]

90
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,875
[GOHAN] You just bring it out!

91
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,208
There! You see?

92
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,625
Cool isn't it?

93
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,541
Uhhh... Videl?

94
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,833
[GOHAN laughs]

95
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,375
Right. Now you try!

96
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,041
[VIDEL] Huh...?

97
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,833
Remember: From the center!

98
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,291
Uhh...

99
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,875
[VIDEL] Okay...

100
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:16,000
[VIDEL grunting softly]

101
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,500
Ah?

102
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,916
[VIDEL grunting softly]

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,791
You've got to relax
your muscles!

104
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,541
You're never going
to bring it out

105
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,083
if you're all tensed
up like that, Videl.

106
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,291
[GOHAN gasps]

107
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,916
[VIDEL] I have to
make this work...

108
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,666
[GOHAN] Food looks great, Mom!

109
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,125
[GOTEN] Ooh! Yummie!

110
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,208
[VIDEL] Thank you very much
for lunch, ChiChi.

111
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,625
[CHICHI] You're welcome.

112
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,916
I'm just glad Gohan's
making some nice lady friends.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,708
You know, it's never
too early to settle down...

114
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,041
[GOHAN] Mom!

115
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:05,458
Delicious! I should give
this recipe to our cook!

116
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,875
What? Your cook?

117
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,375
Is your family in the
restaurant business?

118
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,750
[VIDEL] Oh no. I meant the
cook we have at our house.

119
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,541
You have your own cook?!

120
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,500
Your family must be
pretty loaded!

121
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,083
About how many rooms do
you have in your house?

122
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,375
Ten? Twenty?!

123
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,833
[VIDEL] Mmm...

124
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,750
That's a good question...

125
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,666
I guess about fifty?

126
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,166
Fifty?! That's like
a small village!

127
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,458
I can hardly imagine it!

128
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,916
[CHICHI screams]

129
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,583
This is SO good!

130
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,250
And you're planning
to marry this girl?!

131
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,958
[GOTEN] Hey... Hey!

132
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,125
[GOHAN whimpers]

133
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,041
So, does this mean Videl's
gonna be my new sister?!

134
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,541
I have no idea what you
guys are talking about!

135
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,291
[GOTEN] I got you now, mister!

136
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,750
[GOTEN grunts]

137
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,625
Aah--!

138
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,708
[GOTEN] Ha-ha!
Come back, you villain!

139
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:28,708
[VIDEL growls softly]

140
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,375
You're close! I can feel it!

141
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,458
Ah, yeah! You got it!

142
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,875
I guess since you've been doing
martial arts all your life,

143
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,416
it was easier to tap into
your power! Very good!

144
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,416
Ahh?

145
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,125
[VIDEL laughs]

146
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,708
So! Do you think
I can fly now, Gohan?

147
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,541
Whoa! Slow down there!

148
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,750
Didn't I mention you
have to learn to control

149
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,083
that energy first?

150
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,750
--[VIDEL growls]
--[GOHAN laughs]

151
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,291
[VIDEL] Then don't
just sit there!

152
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,125
Let's learn this thing!

153
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,375
[GOKU grunting]

154
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,375
[KING KAI laughs]

155
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,375
[SOUTH KAI] Sort of an outdated
way to train, don't you think?

156
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,583
[KING KAI] South Kai!

157
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,041
Thought you were still
hiding under a rock.

158
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,875
Please, it's been years
since I lost that tournament

159
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,500
and you'll find that many
things have changed.

160
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,916
You thought you were so swift
with your little new-boy.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,833
Well, now I've got
one of my own!

162
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,708
Fresh from the living world!

163
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,583
Ooh, how exciting!
Hey, let's throw a party.

164
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,041
Hmph.

165
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,416
[GOKU grunting]

166
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,708
[SOUTH KAI] So, how much
weight does he put on?

167
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,833
It's nothing, really.
Just two tons a piece.

168
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,875
Two... tons?!

169
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,708
That wasn't surprise
in your voice, was it?

170
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,250
Uhh... No, of course it wasn't.

171
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,625
Why would I be surprised?
I have my own fighter!

172
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,125
His name's Papoy,

173
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,416
and he saved the South Quadrant
from something very nasty!

174
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,125
[KING KAI] What, like boredom?

175
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,541
[SOUTH KAI] Joke all you want,
but the fact remains

176
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,583
that my fighter is much
stronger than Goku!

177
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,958
I only wish he could have been
there to win that tournament!

178
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,666
Really? Well, it just so happens
that another championship

179
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,250
is being held
on planet Earth!

180
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,250
Goku's going to
be fighting in it,

181
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:59,291
so why don't you have
your Papoy fight in it too?

182
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,750
What d'ya say, huh?

183
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,166
[PAPOY grunts]

184
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,166
Well, you heard him folks!

185
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,625
Papoy's in!

186
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,250
Hey, Goku!

187
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,791
Why don't you try using
some heavier weights?

188
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,291
[GOKU] Hmmm?

189
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,708
Alright... How much do you think
I should put on, King Kai?

190
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,375
Let's say... Eight
more tons! On each one.

191
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,083
Oh, don't be foolish!
That would be...

192
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,041
Ten tons a piece!

193
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,833
Ten tons?! Uuhh...

194
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,750
Don't you think
that's a little much?

195
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,000
I won't be able to move!

196
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,750
[SOUTH KAI laughs]

197
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,541
Just as I thought! North
Kai's attempt to show off

198
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,416
was just another one
of his pathetic jokes!

199
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,583
[SOUTH KAI laughs]

200
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,500
[PAPOY guffaws]

201
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,666
Goku! Just make yourself
a Super Saiyan!

202
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,083
[SOUTH KAI] Huh?

203
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,583
[GOKU] Oh, okay! But that
almost makes it too easy!

204
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,916
Huuh?!

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,833
Hey! Since you're here...

206
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,583
You think you might
want to do the honors

207
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,083
and change his weights?

208
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,916
Why, I'd love to.

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Now you do realize that

210
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,583
ten tons each is forty
tons in all, right?!

211
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,875
Uh-huh!

212
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,333
[SOUTH KAI] Huh?

213
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,583
[GOKU laughs]

214
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,833
Are you sure you
understand?!

215
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,458
Just change it!

216
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,958
Now don't blame me
when you get hurt!

217

[SOUTH KAI &amp; PAPOY whimpering]

228
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,833
The Tournament will take place
in 28 Earth days from now.

00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,458
I bet Papoy can't wait
to fight Goku there!

[PAPOY grunts]

Actually, I just remembered
Papoy has other plans!

232
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,041
Dinner dates, yeah!

233
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,125
And we all know you
can't break dinner dates, so...

234
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,750
Besides, it'll probably be
a boring tournament anyways.

235
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,125
Maybe next time, North Kai!
Thanks for the invite!

try our first flight!

should have listened to me!

But when can we have
our real training?

Shhh! Just as soon
as Videl leaves.

extra hard after that, okay?

It's getting late
in the afternoon.

go call your dad

and tell him where you are?

unless it's through the air!

[GOHAN] Okay. Fair enough...

Then let's start
from the beginning.

from your stomach,

That's the energy!
Now push it up!

Look! You're floating!

288

to concentrate!

That's incredible, Videl!

No one learns how to fly
on their first day!

Is that a fact?

birdie! A birdie!

Of course, Goten
is an exception!

298
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,875
He's been controlling his
energy for a long time, you see,

299
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,708
and besides it's in his blood,
and well, what can I say?

I'll be back tomorrow.

00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,833
What?! But I already
taught you how to fly!

305
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,583
All you really need now is a
little bit of private practice!

306
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,166
I wanna learn
more about this.

307
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,750
Or is my presence
a burden on you?!

308
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,291
[GOHAN] No! No! No-no!
Of course not!

309
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,750
I just didn't think--

310
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,750
Good. It's settled.

311
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,416
[VIDEL] See you tomorrow!

Yes?

315
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,833
I... was thinking...

316
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,208
about your hair...

317
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,583
Huh?

318
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,833
It might...

319
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,916
be... better short!

320
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,125
So, you mean you
like short hair...

321
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,958
on girls, Gohan?

322
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,333
Uuh?! I've never
really thought about it!

323
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,583
I just meant that
if you get it cut

324
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,500
it won't get in your eyes
when you're fighting.

325
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,416
And, plus, your opponents won't
be able to grab it

326
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,916
--during a match!

--[VIDEL growls]

Why don't you just stay
out of my hair

329
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,250
and leave me alone,
you big jerk!

[GOTEN] What was
she all upset about?

333
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,833
I... don't... know!

Perhaps you should
rest, Son.

341
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,750
One hundred and
fifty times gravity

342
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,541
is a man's training level.
You're clearly still a child...

[TRUNKS grunts]

Goten called me last night.

345
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,833
He said he's going to
be in the tournament...

346
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,416
Now I... want to...

347
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
[VEGETA grunts]

348
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,916
So, what are you going
to do about it?

349
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,041
[TRUNKS pants]

350
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,208
Guess I'll go...

351
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:08,875
Super!

352
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,791
Huh?!

353
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,250

Did... I miss something?!

[TRUNKS grunts]

359
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,083
When was it that the
transformation

360
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,583
to the legendary warrior
of the Saiyan race

361
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,916
was reduced to a
child's plaything?!

362
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,958
[TRUNKS grunts]

363
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,125
Come here, Son.

364
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,458
Huh?

365
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,208
Can the youngest
child of Kakarot

366
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,541
also become a Super Saiyan?

367
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,916
[TRUNKS] Yes.

368
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,916
Yes, naturally! It's a
Super Saiyan bargain sale...

369
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,291
Uhh... Uh-huh?

370
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,583
Try to hit me!

371
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,083
Uhh...?

372
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,583
Why would I do that, Dad?!
You know I'm not strong enough!

373
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,875
You want to play like that?

374
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,500
Fine! Let's deal!

375
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,416
If you can land a
punch in my face

376
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,625
then I'll take you to
the park for an hour!

377
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,541
Wow! You mean it?!

378
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,583
Okay!

379
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,750
[TRUNKS growls]

380
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,125
Now, let's just see
what you can do!

381
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,291
Here comes!

382
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,083

00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,000
You didn't say
you'd hit back, Dad!

388
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,416
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't
hit you, now did I, Trunks?!

389
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,666
No, but...!

390
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,958
[TRUNKS whimpers]

391
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,125
Dry your tears!
We're going to the park now!

00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,583
[TRUNKS laughs]

393
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,625
But before you go, you must
tell me who is stronger!

394
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,500
You or Kakarot's boy?

395
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,166
I'm a little bit
stronger than him,

396
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,583
because Goten's a
year younger than I am

397
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,875
and he hasn't
learned to fly yet.

398
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,541
Only a bit, eh?

399
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,291
Well, we'll have to do
something about that...

400
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,916
[GOHAN] So, is this the kind of
training you wanted, Goten?

401
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,791
Just the two of us?

402
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,250
[GOTEN] Ha-ha! Yeah!

403
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,166
[BOTH yell]

404
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,208
[GOHAN] Guess...
our time's up...

405
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,958
Hey, Gohan. Who's the new girl?

406
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,916
It's time to continue
my lessons.

407
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,958
Oh, I give up.

408
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,125
This girl business
is so complicated.

409
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,166
[NARRATOR] As fighters across
the globe struggle to train,

410
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,708
it looks like Gohan
has some different kind

411
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,083
of lessons to learn!

412
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,625
But he better do it fast,

413
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,333
because The World Martial Arts
Tournament is drawing near!

414
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,291
Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
