00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,000
the fearsome duo of Babidi
and Majin Buu took off,

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,500
seeking revenge for
Piccolo's failed attempt

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,583
to end the dark wizard's life!

5
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,125
Buu's penchant for annihilation

6
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,000
caught even his
master off guard!

7
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,125
Yet, the reckless destruction
left in their wake

8
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,208
is merely a sample
of what the evil twosome

9
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,416
has in store
for the Z Fighters,

10
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,916
whose defenses have
been severely thinned!

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,916
With Vegeta dead and
Gohan missing in action,

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,916
it seemed the world's
only hope for survival

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,375
would be Piccolo and Krillin--

14
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,125
at least until Goten
and Trunks recover.

15
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,916
[NARRATOR] But then Goku, after
being knocked out by Vegeta,

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,416
finally arose, along with the
Z Fighters' chances for victory.

17
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,791
Unaware of recent events,

18
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,666
Goku attempted to intuit the
status of his teammates.

19
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,416
[GOKU]
I can still sense Buu,

20
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,291
but I can't sense Vegeta or
Gohan either! This isn't good!

21
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,875
How long was I out
for? Too long...

22
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,250
Something's happened,
something terrible!

23
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,958
It feels like Piccolo and
Krillin are back in action!

24
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,916
They probably know
what's been going on.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,916
Gohan... I'm sorry I
wasn't here for you.

26
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,458
[NARRATOR] Goku returned to the
Lookout in search of answers,

27
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,208
much to the surprise of
Piccolo and Krillin,

28
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,250
who had all but
given up hope of ever

29
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,750
seeing their friend again.

30
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,666
Reunited, they must
now find some way

31
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,500
to overpower the evil forces
of Babidi and Majin Buu!

32
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,625
[GOKU]
Hi!

33
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,708
He's real! He talks
and everything!

34
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,250
[laughs]

35
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,666
[PICCOLO] We're unaware of the
Supreme Kai's whereabouts,

36
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,125
though we faintly
detect he's alive.

37
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,208
We'd just brought the little
ones back here to recuperate,

38
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,875
when you showed up.

39
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:02,041
[GOKU] Gohan, Supreme Kai,
even Vegeta, all gone...

40
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,125
What kind of monster
are we dealing with?!

41
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,125
Majin Buu's power level
continues to increase at a rate

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,750
unlike any enemy
we've encountered before.

43
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,416
If we can't stop him from
destroying this world,

44
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,541
there will be nothing to
prevent him from wiping out

45
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,333
every last trace of
life in the universe.

46
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,166
Don't be such a downer, Piccolo,

47
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,750
of course we can stop Buu
now that Goku's alive.

48
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,583
Sorry! The halo! What I meant to
say is that you may be "dead",

49
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,125
but at least
you're not dead-dead,

50
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,791
like Vegeta and Gohan.

51
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,583
Oh! Stupid, Krillin,
think before you speak!

52
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,958
Goku, you're the only one left
who can take on Majin Buu.

53
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,125
So what are you waiting for?
Him to shove his pudgy,

54
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,333
pink face up in yours?

55
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,125
Come on, show that creep
a little of the ol'

56
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,166
--Ka-me-ha-me-haaa!
--Krillin.

57
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,666
It's impossible, I just
can't beat him alone.

58
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,791
Huh?! But why not?

59
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,041
He's simply too
powerful an opponent.

60
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,000
E-Even for you? 

61
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,833
Look, when Vegeta
and I were fighting,

62
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,916
the two of us were
evenly matched.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,791
He gave it everything he had,

64
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,708
even his life, and he still
couldn't beat that thing.

65
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,000
So what chance do
I have against him?

66
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,041
[ALL gasp]

67
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:16,000
If you can't, what hope
do we have? Goku...

68
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,708
[GOKU] If only Vegeta
hadn't been so arrogant!

69
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,708
Thinking he could
take on Buu alone...

70
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,916
He'd still be alive and
we could work together!

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,083
No. Don't punish
yourself like this!

72
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,208
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

73
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,666
Not even an army of
Super Saiyans could have--

74
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,916
[GOKU]
I was going to say that if

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,666
Vegeta or Gohan
were still alive,

76
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,041
we could've done a fusion!

77
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,916
Uh? Fuchsia? Like the
color of my shirt, sort of?

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,125
No, fusion.

79
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:43,625
[gasps] Fusion?
You mean a merger?!

80
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,541
Yeah, that's it, Dende!

81
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,250
Oh, I've heard of such a
skill, back on Namek.

82
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,750
A man from Metamor
once told me about it.

83
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,500
Their people are quite
proficient at the technique.

84
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,083
That's true! The Metamorese
I met in Other World

85
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,333
are the ones that
showed me how to do it!

86
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,041
So what is it, already?!

87
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,708
It's an ancient merger art
that can be performed between

88
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,125
two people of similar size
and physical ability.

89
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,958
You wanna try that again?

90
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,458
It's when two people combine
to form an entirely new being

91
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,708
that's able to do things
neither could do alone.

92
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,083
Like stopping an evil creature

93
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,625
that's out to destroy the world
and everyone in it.

94
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,541
[gasps]

95
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,041
Now that I think about it,

96
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,041
you and Nail were a sort of
fusion, too, weren't you?

97
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,416
[PICCOLO]
Mm-hmm. Yes, we were, of a sort.

98
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,416
[PICCOLo] Nail had been
badly wounded by Frieza

99
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,541
when I found him.

100
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,958
He was dying.
And as his final act,

101
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,333
he wished to impart
his powers to me.

102
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,583
I was reluctant to
join with him at first,

103
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,250
but his promise of
greater power proved...

104
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,708
quite persuasive.

105
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,083
[PICCOLO grunts]

106
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,875
[PICCOLO] When it was over,
Nail's body had vanished,

107
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,083
though I could still sense
his presence in me.

108
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,125
I felt his strength
and his wisdom,

109
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,125
so fresh and invigorating,

110
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:02,333
yet familiar, as though it had
been at my fingertips all along.

111
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,958
I stood up, reborn, knowing
that I was fully capable

112
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,208
of avenging Nail
by taking on Frieza,

113
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,208
or any other villain that
dared to cross my path.

114
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:15,750
Wow. Unreal. My gosh.

115
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,125
This is amazing!
I feel incredible!

116
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:26,083
Yes! Yes! Yes! I can win! I
feel great! I can do this! Yes!

117
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:33,541
[PICCOLO] Yes! I'm home! I'm
alive! This is all a miracle!

118
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,500
I'm awake! I'm wide awake!

119
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,375
[PICCOLO laughs]

120
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,125
[GOKU] The Namekian fusion
that you experienced, Piccolo,

121
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,500
is actually quite different
from the Metamorese variety,

122
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,333
Which is the process
I learned in Other World.

123
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,916
The way I know is
only temporary,

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,625
and instead of one body playing
host, a new hybrid is formed,

125
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,750
made up of characteristics
from both people.

126
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,958
They transform into
a single warrior,

127
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,208
capable of incredible
power and strength!

128
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,958
Yes, that is different.

129
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,000
But it seems the
end result is the same.

130
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,208
I know when I fused with Nail,

131
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,458
my power increased
exponentially.

132
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,458
So if Gohan or Vegeta
were still alive,

133
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,083
you could perform one of those
temporary fusions with them,

134
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,416
couldn't you?

135
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,208
And then in your new form,

136
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,791
you would have been able
to defeat Majin Buu.

137
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,708
Nah, it probably wouldn't
have worked out so nicely

138
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,916
even if Gohan or
Vegeta were alive.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,500
It would take about a week to
show them what to do,

140
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,708
but I'm only here on
Earth for this one day,

141
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,666
not to mention that
even though I know how

142
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,000
these fusions work in theory,

143
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,375
I've never taught
somebody else how to do it.

144
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,958
And believe it or not,

145
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,333
I've never actually been able to
try out a fusion in practice.

146
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:42,208
No one in Other World is similar
enough to me to be compatible.

147
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,250
[groans]

148
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,375
[DENDE sighs]

149
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,791
[growls]

150
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,625
So yeah, so much for that!
It was just a crazy idea!

151
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,333
[KRILLIN]
Wait, Goku! No it's not!

152
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,416
[GOKU] What are you
thinking about, Krillin?

153
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,125
You said you're about to go
back to the Other World, right?

154
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,958
And if Gohan and Vegeta
are really dead,

155
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,958
then that's where they
must be too, correct?!

156
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,125
So you can do a fusion with
them when you get back there!

157
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,666
Oh, right!
Now that's a great idea!

158
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,666
Impossible. Once Goku
leaves this world

159
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,500
he won't be able to return.

160
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,958
The fusion would
still do us no good.

161
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,416
[BOTH sigh]

162
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,166
The young ones, sleeping.

163
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,583
Goten and Trunks
are almost exactly

164
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:30,041
the same size, aren't they?
Could they do a fusion?

165
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,416
Is that possible?

166
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,625
Yeah!

167
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,166
Thank you, Mr. Popo!
You know, that just might work!

168
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:40,791
[gasps]

169
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,958
Really, Goku?!

170
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,583
Mr. Popo, I love you!
You're a genius!

171
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,333
Let's all give it up for
Mr. Popo, the genius!

172
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,666
But Goku, do you think there's
enough time to teach them?

173
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,916
No. I'll work with them
as long as I can,

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,583
but they're gonna need
more time than I've got.

175
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,500
Someone else will have
to pick up the slack.

176
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,958
Piccolo, do you think
you'll be able to finish

177
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,208
instructing the boys
after I've gone?

178
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,500
I'll try.

179
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,750
Woo-hoo-hoo!

180
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,416
Goten and Trunks will
show Majin Buu who's boss!

181
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,458
He won't even know what hit him!

182
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,291
[PICCOLO]
Not so fast, Krillin.

183
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,458
Huh?

184
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,125
According to Goku,
it will take some time

185
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,500
before they've mastered
the art of fusion

186
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,375
and are ready to
make their attack.

187
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,083
Meanwhile,
many innocent people

188
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,583
will be lost in the wake of
Majin Buu's destruction.

189
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,916
I'm talking about
total annihilation.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,250
Everything and everyone
on this planet, wiped out.

191
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,875
It's a gamble.

192
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,541
So we must prepare ourselves for
anything that comes our way

193
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,541
until the boys have mastered
fusion and are ready to go.

194
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,458
You're right,

195
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,125
but I'm confident these two
can learn how to do this.

196
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,875
And we can always use
the Dragon Balls

197
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,833
to clean up the
damage at the end.

198
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,458
[KRILLIN] You think we
still have a chance?

199
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,416
We can't ever give up
hope, you guys.

200
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,625
And right now,

201
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,875
Trunks and Goten are
the world's best hope.

202
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,583
We should know by now not to
underestimate the young--

203
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:03,291
especially when they're
a couple of Super Saiyans.

204
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,833
[BABIDI] Ah, Buu! So many places
to blow, people to scream!

[BABIDI]
Buu?

00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,083
[thinking]
He's a smooth flyer,

208
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,250
but as a conversationalist,
he's sort of a bum.

[BABIDI]
Hel-lo.

Buu?

[BABIDI] Ah yes, this location
is full of potential!

212
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,041
Or should I say,
"was" full of potential.

We're not here
for your amusement!

218

We're here for mine! Stop!

a safety belt! [screams]

If you don't save me fast,

the next ice age passes over!

me are highly breakable!

Bulma, why don't you just get it
over with and summon the dragon?

235
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,000
Does he just pop
up out of them?

pretty enough face,

but her skull sure is thick!

Mind your
manners, Oolong.

Not everyone is as
worldly as you.

eyes on the balls.

I'm not so naive, you know.

I've just never seen
a magical dragon before.

243

Okay, now do you remember
the spell to release him?

You know all the words?

I'm not gonna pull a Frieza
and screw it up, Yamcha!

too many clothes!

involved, huh?

would make sense.

But she can't know about
everything that's happened.

So why call the Dragon now?

00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,333
[gasps, growls

312
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,458
And where is Gohan?
And Goten?!

313
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,500
ChiChi, there's
no time to explain.

314
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:53,000
Please trust me.
Dende, can you hear me?

315
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:53,666
[DENDE using telepathy]
Yes!

316
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,000
I arrived too late.

317
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,416
The dragon has already
fulfilled their first wish

318
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
and now he wants to know
what their second one is.

319
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,041
What should I do?

320
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,666
Then there is still hope.

321
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,041
Tell Shenron
that you want to save

322
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,666
the other wish for another time.

323
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,125
If only one has been granted,

324
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,250
then we can
use that wish again

325
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,083
when only four
months have passed.

326
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,791
[GOKU using telepathy] All
right, I'll take care of that.

327
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,666
Oh, and you guys. I can't
believe I almost forgot.

328
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,333
I'm bringing you
all back with me,

329
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,083
once I'm finished with my
business here. So get ready.

330
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,833
[DENDE using telepathy] We'll
prepare for your return, Goku.

331
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,833
Thanks. Shenron!

332
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,166
You don't have to grant any more
wishes today. Thank you!

333
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,166
We'll call you again sometime!

334
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,000
As you wish. Farewell.

335
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,250
You wanna tell me what's
gotten into you Goku?

336
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,833
We still had a
perfectly good wish

337
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,625
we could have used to help!

338
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,291
[KIBITO thinking]
I don't understand.

339
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,083
My body appears to be in
perfect physical condition.

340
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,791
And this place,
something's wrong.

341
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,541
I shouldn't be here! Wait...

342
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,833
I remember now.
I was attacked by Dabura.

343
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,666
Now, let's begin.

344
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,333
[gasps]

345
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,375
Haaa...!

346
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,000
[KIBITO screams]

347
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:47,000
Have I been brought
back to life? A miracle!

348
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,458
[gasps]

349
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,833
[KIBITO] The Supreme Kai!
I must find and protect him!

350
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,583
Where could he possible be?!

351
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,375
Master!

352
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,166
[thinking] I must seek out
help to prevent Majin Buu

353
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,666
from wreaking any more havoc.
My only hope is...

354
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,291
As long as there's the slightest
possibility that he's alive,

355
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,458
I still have a chance.

356
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,083
[SUPREME KAI thinking] Wherever
you are, Gohan,

357
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,500
I hope to find you. And I
hope to find you breathing.

358
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,291
For your sake, and for my own.

359
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,916
You are my last hope!

360
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,750
And that makes you, perhaps,
the last hope of the universe.

361
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,000
[GOKU]
So, there you go.

362
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,083
Now, if you'll all come back
with me to the Lookout,

363
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,791
we can start
making preparations.

364
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,125
That's fine,

365
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,583
I'll just have to
track down seven Dragon Balls

366
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,125
again in four months, which
shouldn't be any problem!

367
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,583
That's the spirit!

368
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,041
Now, everyone.

369
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,416
As long as you're
connected to me,

370
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,416
we can all travel by
"Instant Transmission!"

371
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,791
[VIDEL thinking]
This is like some wonderful

372
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,250
fantasy land where,
just when I think

373
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,916
it can't possibly get
any weirder, it does!

374
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
[GOKU] Please remain standing
in an upright position,

375
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,375
fastened to the
person next to you.

376
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,458
[BULMA] Mom, Dad,
what are you waiting for?

377
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,666
Hold onto my hand, quickly,
or you'll be left behind!

378
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,833
Your mother and I just
can't bring ourselves

379
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,750
to leave the little ones.

380
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,208
We'll wait here
for your return.

381
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,541
[gasps]

382
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,875
Will you two stop being
naive and open your eyes?!

383
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,750
Is it really worth
risking both your lives

384
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,250
just to stay here
and feed and clean

385
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,875
your stinking
precious pets?!

386
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,416
Remember, even if we meet our
horrible, tragic,

387
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,958
gruesome and grotesque end
at the hands of this Majin Buu,

388
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,958
you can always bring us back to
life with the Dragon Balls!

389
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,625
Don't try to argue,
we've made up our minds.

390
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,666
But, Mom!

391
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,041
Goku! Say something!

392
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,583
Bulma, you're pretty good
at finding Dragon Balls

393
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,916
when you really need to,
so don't worry!

394
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, you don't want to
transport with us, Videl?

395
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,875
Oh no, oh no, oh no! I'm
going, I'm going, I'm going!

396
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,541
We're ready for liftoff!

397
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,875
[MRS. BRIEF] Shall we feed all
of our little darlings now,

398
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,250
before it gets too late?

399
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,208
[DR. BRIEF]
But, I'm hungry.

400
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,208
How very peculiar, Buu.

401
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,208
First it's day,
then suddenly it's night,

402
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,625
then it's back to day again.

403
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,875
Hmm... [giggles]

404
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,291
Doesn't make much
difference to me anyway.

405
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:34,375
Soon, my pet, there will be
only permanent nightfall.

406
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,458
[giggles]

407
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,166
[NARRATOR] Dark skies loom ahead
for the people of the world,

408
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,708
as long as the evil Babidi

409
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,541
and Majin Buu
float among them.

410
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,250
Can anyone put a stop to
their mission of terror?

411
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,583
Right now, the Earth's best
chances for survival

412
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,958
lie resting in bed.
When they awaken,

413
00:22:50,041 --> 00:23:00,041
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

414
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:10,041
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

415
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:20,041
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

416
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:30,041
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

417
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:40,083
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

418
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:50,083
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

419
00:23:50,166 --> 00:24:00,083
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

420
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:10,083
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

421
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:20,125
will they be up to the
challenge before them?

422
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:32,541
will they be up to the
challenge before them?
