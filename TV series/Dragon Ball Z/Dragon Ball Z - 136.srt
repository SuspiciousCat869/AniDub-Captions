[NARRATOR]
Last time on DragonBall Z...

2
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,916
The deranged Dr. Gero,
driven by his desire

3
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,250
to destroy Goku, created
three killer androids

4
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,833
to carry out his vengeful plan.

5
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,375
Activated first was Android 17.

6
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,416
A real microchip off the
old block, whose own

7
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,833
passion for power lead to the
demented doctor's demise.

8
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,625
Android 17 was joined
by his synthetic sister,

9
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:41,500
Android 18, batteries and
bad attitude included.

10
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:45,291
The two conspired and pulled the
plug on the diabolical doctor

11
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,916
and took control of
his evil operation.

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,166
Then they awoke the
mechanized monster,

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,625
Android 16, a bionic
behemoth whose few

14
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,916
words spoken revealed
that he was programmed

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,208
to pursue Goku
and pulverize him.

16
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,875
Bedridden battling
a mysterious virus,

17
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,291
Goku makes an easy target
for these hi-tech horrors.

18
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,458
Vegita, ignoring Trunks', the
boy from the future's warning,

19
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,583
decided to face
the androids alone.

20
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,166
[ANDROID 17]
Good.

21
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,541
[NARRATOR] What ensued was
an earth shaking showdown

22
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,916
between Android and Saiyan!
Vegita's over inflated ego

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,333
and newly acquired Super Saiyan
powers served him well,

24
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:26,375
but it was obvious that Android
18 was the superior fighter.

25
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,208
[NARRATOR] It looked as
though Vegita would be down

26
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,666
for the count but that's
when the good guys arrived

27
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,583
to offer their support. But once
again Vegita's foolish pride

28
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,250
got the best of him and
he refused their help.

29
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,541
[TRUNKS]
Hey, are you okay?

30
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,666
Of course I am!

31
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,041
I told you I don't
need your help,

32
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,083
and I don't want it either!

33
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,041
[NARRATOR]
It was then that Android 17

34
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,583
made a deal with Vegeta.

35
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,458
[ANDROID 17] I'm willing to
stand aside and let you fight,

36

But if any one of these

37
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,250

to assist you in any way...

38
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll be forced to step in.

39
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,333

[NARRATOR] Vegeta and Android 18
traded blow for blow,

43
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,791
but as the Saiyan
avoided a move by 18,

44
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,041
she struck him with
a bone-crushing kick.
