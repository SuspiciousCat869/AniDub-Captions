[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,000
Having completed their
year-long journey to Earth,

4
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,875
the two sinister Saiyans
made their presence known

5
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,833
with explosive style!

6
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,833
The Earth's fighters
could only look on

7
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,041
in horror as the
destruction began,

8
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,250
for they had little hope
of defeating the Saiyans

9
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,083
without the help of their
greatest champion, Goku,

10
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,416
who was racing down Snake
Way to join the battle.

11
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,166
Unfortunately, the Saiyans
weren't willing to wait

12
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,583
for the hero's return.

13
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,125
They sought out their targets
with cruel precision,

14
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:45,166
hoping to learn the secrets
of the seven Dragon Balls.

15
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,125
Now Krillin, Piccolo, and
Gohan stand face to face

16
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,791
with these
Saiyan monsters,

17
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,458

they've brought with them.

hold their ground long enough

22

to arrive?

No! They're all good!

These are the same
ones that survived

that crazy
battle on Tratak!

He should have won!

As Raditz.

Now do you
see my point?

Well, I think so.

[VEGETA] He wasn't of
any use to us any more.

I-I don't understand...

200
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,666
[VEGETA] It would
have been pointless

201
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,458
to let him continue,
Nappa. He was losing.

202
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:38,166
Which leads me to believe
he wasn't trying his hardest.

203
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,041
I specifically told him
not to hold anything back.

[thinking] No mercy.
Even for his allies...

He won't be taking prisoners.
We're fighting for our lives.

This is just crazy! I've never

with the Dragon Balls
once. I haven't.

So if anything happens,

at least we know that
I can be revived...

for me, Krillin...

you mean?

Oh, don't mind

than your little
green goon squad!

317
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,750
You cocky...

318
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,416
Nappa! Relax.

319
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,375
Now then, whadda you
say I just take on

320
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,166
the other four
by myself?

321
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,500
[KRILLIN] Yamcha!
Are you nuts?

322
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,750
[VEGETA] Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Now that, I'd like to see.

323
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,458
Too bad I won't
get the chance...

324
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,541
[YAMCHA] Oh yeah?
Bring 'em on!

325
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,958
[GOHAN gasps]

326
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,166
[gasps]

327
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,291
Let go!

328
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:17,333
[YAMCHA grunts]

329
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:29,333
[grunting continues]

330
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,625
[SAIBAMAN 2 snarls]

331
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,833
It's over...

332
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,333
Ah! Oh no...

333
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,583
[SAIBAMAN 2 yells]

334
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,708
[yelling]

335
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,291
Yamcha...

336
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,916
Well... I guess
it's a draw.

337
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,250
Kamikaze...
No way to defend...

338
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,125
Ah! Is he...

339
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:18,583
[KRILLIN quavering]

340
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,583
No... He's dead...

341
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,083
[VEGETA laughs]

342
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,666
Hey, what happened,
you guys?

343
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,708
It looked like he...
was going to win...

344
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,833
I don't exactley know, Bulma...
But it doesn't look good.

345
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,833
[ROSHI] I'm sorry, everyone...
I'm afraid we've lost him.

346
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,458
[PUAR gasps and sobs]

347
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:48,041
No! Yamcha!
Please! Don't go!

348
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,583
No, no, no, no!

349
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:56,625
[PUAR cries]

350
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,000
[BULMA whimpers]

351
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:06,291
[PUAR cries and BULMA whimpers]

352
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,541
[ROSHI] Bulma, it's
okay to let it out...

353
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,666
But...

354
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,625
[BULMA sobs]

355
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,250
Oh, Master Roshi!

356
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,125
[ROSHI] That's it.
Let it all out.

357
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,750
Everything's going
to be all right.

358
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:30,583
[BULMA] But why did it
have to be Yamcha? Why?

359
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,958
Now why'd you have to
go and be the hero,

360
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,958
you big,
stupid, jerk...

361
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,875
It was my
turn to fight.

362
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,416
It shoulda' been
me in there...

363
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,000
You hear me, Yamcha?
You can't die!

364
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,208
It should've been me!
It should have been me!

365
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,250
Oh, shut up! It doesn't
make any difference

366
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,041
who goes
down first!

367
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,833
Don't you get it? You're
all going to die in the end!

368
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,458
[VEGETA]
Calm down, Nappa.

369
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:03,291
Give them a moment to clear
this trash off the battlefield.

370
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,541
How dare you!

371
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,208
You guys stay
out of this!

372
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,708
This is between
me and them now!

373
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,833
'Kay buddy...
This one's for you.

374
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,291
I won't let you
down again...

375
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,791
All right, come
on! I'm ready!

376
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,166
[KRILLIN] I'll take on all
four of those goons at once!

377
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,083
[KRILLIN] Just like
Yamcha was going to do!

378
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,666
[KRILLIN grunts]

379
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,083
[NARRATOR] The demented Saibamen
have claimed their first victim

380
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,958
on the battlefield...

381
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,166
Now, fueled by rage,

382
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,875
Krillin intends to ensure
they do not claim a second.

383
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,083
Can Krillin avenge
his fallen friend,

384
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,875
and put an end to the
Saiyans' twisted game?

385
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,666
Don't miss the action
when Krillin strikes!

386
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,541
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z!
