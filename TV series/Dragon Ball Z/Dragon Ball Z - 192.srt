00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,541
[NARRATOR]
On the last Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,083
Gohan and Cell threw
all their remaining power

3
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,208
into a titanic showdown!

4
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,333
Both fighters struggled,
unable to secure the upper hand.

5
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,291
But in a most unexpected move,

6
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,166
Vegeta jumped to the
young warrior's aide,

7
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,625
distracting Cell
long enough for Gohan

8
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:32,000
to unleash his
deepest, final power.

9
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,791
[NARRATOR]
A power that eradicated

10
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,458
every trace of the genetically

11
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,958
engineered monster,
down to his wicked core!

12
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,625
Dr. Gero's hateful creation,
after crossing through

13
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,291
space and time
to torment the planet,

14
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,000
has finally been destroyed,

15
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,458
but the cost of
victory was high.

16
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,500
Now, can our heroes
clean up the damage

17
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,166
Cell has left in his wake?

18
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,166
Find out today,
on Dragon Ball Z!

19
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,166
[PICCOLO]
Heh. Look at him.

20
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,500
Guess saving the world
can take it's toll on you.

21
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,833
[KRILLIN] Hey, Gohan.
Let me ask you something.

22
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,916
Were you holding back
your power all that time

23
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,750
just to scare us?
'Cause, boy, it worked.

24
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,083
[GOHAN laughs]

25
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,916
[YAMCHA] Gosh, you guys! I can't
believe we survived that!

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,375
[TIEN]
I know.

27
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,625
[KRILLIN] And don't worry
about those bruises, Gohan!

28
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,250
We'll get Dende
to fix you right up!

29
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,958
You'll feel like
a zillion bucks!

30
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,458
[GOHAN laughs]

31
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,916
I gotcha, big guy.

32
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,458
Sorry for the mess.

33
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,541
Gohan!

34
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,333
Don't worry, Krillin.
He's just exhausted, that's all.

35
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:34,125
What about you, Yamcha? You have
a lot of wounds yourself.

36
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,291
You sure you can fly
as far as the Lookout?

37
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:41,708
Sure. Compared to Gohan's,
these are nothing but scrapes.

38
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,000
All right, then.
I'll carry Trunks

39
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,291
and follow you, just to
be safe. See ya there.

40
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,208
[KRILLIN] Great!
And, uh, I'll just grab 18!

41
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,291
Well, she is
a victim of Cell,

42
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,458
and, uh, we might as
well bring her along.

43
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,333
[YAMCHA]
Let's hit the sky, Piccolo!

44
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,833
[PICCOLO]
You guys go on.

45
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:18,958
[YAMCHA]
Oh, right.

46
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,083
That was brave, what you did.

47
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,250
You can save your applause.

48
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,166
Now, go on.

49
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,541
I don't need anybody's help.

50
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,250
Your call.

51
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,250
[VEGETA]
He has beaten me completely.

52
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,500
First, by his own actions.

53
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:06,416
And then, through his son's. And
what has he left for me here?

54
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,166
How? How could you die
like that? How, Kakarot?

55
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,708
I'll... never...
have the chance...

56
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,916
...to prove my
strength against you!

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,458
You died without fear.
What does that make of me?

58
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:39,000
[VEGETA] I am no warrior,
and I will never fight again.

59
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,625
[MR. SATAN screams]

60
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,416
Where did that canyon come from?

61
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,875
[ANNOUNCER groans]

62
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,250
[MR. SATAN gasps]

63
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,250
It's, so quiet.

64
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:18,333
[ANNOUNCER] Mr. Satan! What on
this crazy Earth just happened?

65
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,458
What? Well, I, uh...

66
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,791
I do remember Cell
and that little boy

67
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,750
shooting strange
light at each other

68
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,000
and later the ground
started shaking.

69
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,416
I was pretty sure the whole
world had ended after that.

70
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,958
That's funny.
It didn't phase me!

71
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,333
[ANNOUNCER] So where's Cell? Did
you see what happened to him?

72
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:47,333
Uh, oh. well...
what if I said that...

73
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,958
...I defeated Cell
single-handedly?!

74
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,250
You believe me?

75
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,416
[CAMERAMAN] Hey, some of the
equipment's still running!

76
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,333
[PIIZA] Wow, Hercule! You really
are a great, great man!

77
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,916
You hid your strength
right until the end.

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,125
You sure know how to give
people a good show!

79
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,833
So is it true
you really beat him?

80
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,083
Sure, why wouldn't it be?

81
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,083
But, just how did you do it?

82
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, piece of cake, really!

83
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,375
I just got so irritated
with the light shows

84
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,125
and the tricks I shouted:

85
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,333
"Hey! I've had enough of your
light shows and tricks!"

86
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,875
And I just walked over there to
Cell and I gave him a good chop!

87
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,125
Chop, yeah!

88
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,791
Oh, Hercule!

89
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,541
But, then what h-happened
to the little boy

90
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,750
and all of his
friends on the cliff?!

91
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,458
Chop! Yeah.

92
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,333
Well, they all thanked me kindly
and went home, of course!

93
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,041
[CAMERAMAN] Hey, guys,
the radio in the relay car

94
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,833
is still working!

95
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,916
Great, now are you
absolutely positive

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,541
everything you said is true?

97
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,875
What do you mean, is it true?
Have you totally forgotten

98
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,750
that I am the greatest Martial
Arts Champion of the World?

99
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,916
[ANNOUNCER]
So much to do! So much to do!

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,458
[PIIZA]
That's right!

101
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,875
We should be thanking him and
loving him for what he did!

102
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:09,666
Got it?!

103
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,333
[MR. SATAN laughs]

104
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,916
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies and
gentlemen across the globe!

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,250
We apologize for the
break in communication,

106
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,750
but we are now back on line
and with incredible news!

107
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,958
Cell has been defeated!

108
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,750
Yes, the monster has fallen at
the hands of Mr. Satan himself!

109
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,166
All thanks to our
hero, Hercule Satan!

110
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,291
Mr. Satan's the coolest!

111
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,208
Hey, we're alive!

112
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,125
I don't believe
that for a second.

113
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:49,291
A real hero must have come
to save us again, like Goku.

114
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,625
[CHICHI] It's not fair! They
deserve to know what Gohan did!

115
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,458
I know.

116
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,791
[KING KAI] Guess the Earth
should be happy for a while.

117
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,416
[GOKU]
Yeah! And you helped a lot,

118
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,625
even if it wasn't
your own choice!

119
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:09,833
[stomach growls]

120
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,166
[GOKU laughs]

121
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,958
Now that I've stopped
worrying, I'm really hungry!

122
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,000
Hey, King Kai, you wouldn't
happen to have any food?

123
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,416
Are you crazy?!

124
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,625
You destroyed my house,
my car, and my entire planet!

125
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,916
How could I possibly have food?!

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,166
Oh yeah. But, I have to eat!
I'm starving to death!

127
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,041
But you're already dead.

128
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,333
[GOKU] Well,
that makes it twice as bad!

129
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,875
I guess I could eat these.

130
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,708
[KING KAI] You know, I've
heard of light tasting food,

131
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,375
but this is ridiculous!

132
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,916
[GOKU]
Mm! Fluffy!

133
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,375
Are they here?

134
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,000
[KORIN]
Mm-hm.

135
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,166
Yeah! Way to win
one for the team!

136
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,750
[KRILLIN]
Yarjirobe?

137
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,375
[YAJIROBI] Yeah, I was on
my way to meet you guys,

138
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,750
but my plane broke down.
I really wanted to help!

139
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,166
[YAMCHA]
Ah, such bad luck.

140
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,291
Funny, it always happens to you.

141
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,000
[DENDE]
Gohan!

142
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,375
[YAMCHA] Hey, little guy.
You must be Dende.

143
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,791
[DENDE] Yes, please set
him down right here.

144
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,833
[YAMCHA]
You bet.

145
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,708
Gohan! Hey!

146
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,000
--[GOHAN] Dende!
--Alright!

147
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,083
I mean, I'm really sorry
about your father, Gohan.

148
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,083
[GOHAN]
Don't be sad. He's not.

149
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,166
He told me himself!
When I talked to him!

150
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,500
I felt his energy
all around me

151
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,166
and I swear, for a moment
I could've touched him!

152
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,958
He was right there
with me, by my side,

153
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,291
giving me advice,
and rooting me on!

154
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,416
That's how I was
able to beat Cell!

155
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,416
My dad helped me!

156
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,500
[PICCOLO]
Well, Gohan.

157
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,875
Whatever it was,
you made us all proud.

158
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,541
You sure have
gotten strong, kid.

159
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,125
Awake at last.

160
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,166
[YAMCHA]
Dende! Get away from her, quick!

161
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,875
She'll punch a hole
right through you!

162
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,041
[KRILLIN]
Nobody's gonna kill anybody!

163
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,708
Hey! We can put the past
behind us, can't we?

164
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,958
Now that Gohan's beat Cell,
we can all be friends!

165
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,125
Gohan did?

166
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,333
[YAMCHA]
You bet he did!

167
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,958
Gohan's incredibly strong!

168
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,083
So you can forget about
punching holes in anyone!

169
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,166
[TIEN] Why don't you
come a little closer?

170
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,750
You should thank Krillin, 18.

171
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:33,166
He stayed at your side the whole
time after Cell spat you out.

172
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,750
Uh well, it was nothing really,
I-I mean I enjoyed it, I mean!

173
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,125
I couldn't leave you there.

174
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,458
I got it!

175
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,875
Krillin, you have a crush
on Android 18, don't you?

176
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,916
Thanks, Mr. Smooth.

177
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,083
What? How could you?

178
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,291
Krillin she's a...

179
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,250
You know she's an
android, right, pal?

180
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,958
Expect me to fall
at your feet now?

181
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,750
Big strong boy rescues me,
so I'm his forever, right?

182
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,250
Not that easy!

183
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,666
I was wrong about you, Krillin.

184
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,541
But... I...

185
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,166
That ungrateful--!

186
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,541
I can't stand that android!

187
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,333
I'm gonna show her!

188
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:30,208
I'm not so sure
you could do that.

189
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,583
We've wasted enough time here.

190
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,500
Let's hurry up and summon
the dragon so we can start

191
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,666
undoing all the damage
that Cell has done.

192
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,333
Yes, of course.

193
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:44,125
Yeah! That means Trunks'll
come back! And Dende and me.

194
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,791
You'll have plenty
of friends here,

195
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,958
so you won't
even need a girl!

196
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,875
Leave me alone.

197
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,125
Eternal Dragon, by your
name I summon you forth.

198
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,666
Shenron!

199
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,083
Amazing! What the heck is that?

200
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,583
[YAMCHA] I'll never get
tired of seeing him.

201
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,291
[TIEN]
Tell me about it.

202
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,750
Fabulous work, Dende!

203
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,541
The new Dragon you've
made looks flawless!

204
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,166
Thanks, Mr. Popo!

205
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,833
Choose your words
carefully as you speak.

206
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,666
I will make two
of your wishes true.

207
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,625
Oh wow! It worked!

208
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,458
Dende made it so that the Earth
Dragon will grant us two wishes!

209
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,666
[YAMCHA]
Shenron!

210
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,750
Please revive all those on
Earth who were killed by Cell!

211
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,875
Your wish will be granted.

212
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,875
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah! Yeah!

213
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,750
Hey! Hey, I think you're
gonna wanna here this.

214
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,625
What? For real?

215
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,291
Hey, folks! We've got news!

216
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,208
It seems all the people Cell
killed are somehow waking up!

217
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,708
A miracle!

218
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,791
It's because
Mr. Satan beat Cell!

219
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,750
He's saved us all!

220
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,666
Who loves me? Yeah!

221
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,250
[ANDROID 18]
Is this really happening?

222
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,791
As I feared.

223
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,458
Since Dende created
a new Earth dragon

224
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,958
I was hoping Goku
could be revived.

225
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,833
But this dragon was made from
the same model as the old one,

226
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,958
so their powers must be linked.

227
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,333
I don't sense Goku's energy.

228
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,083
It's a shame.

229
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,958
[DRAGON]
What is your second wish?

230
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,083
I am waiting for it.

231
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,916
Listen! Can't you use our whole
second wish to revive Goku?

232
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,916
All of us really
want him to come back.

233
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,833
How badly you want it
makes no difference to me.

234
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:59,083
Goku has been revived before
and so it is impossible.

235
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,291
[YAMCHA]
It looks pretty hopeless.

236
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,833
[TIEN] No! There has to
be a way! Just think!

237
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,833
What if we ask him
to turn back time

238
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,750
to just before Goku died?

239
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,750
Then we could prevent
it from happening!

240
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,833
[YAMCHA]
Great idea! Let's do it!

241
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,541
[PICCOLO]
Would you think for a minute?

242
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,541
That would make Cell alive, too!

243
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,250
It would be an endless cycle!

244
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,541
[DENDE]
I have an idea!

245
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:26,166
All we have to do is ask
Porunga back on Namek!

246
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,541
Dende's right. Because Porunga
is the original dragon,

247
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,125
he can revive a person as
many times as he sees fit.

248
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,625
Oh, of course! That's how
Krillin and Chiaotzu

249
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,958
came back to life!

250
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,333
All we have to do now
is get ourselves to Namek!

251
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:45,166
Then we all agree, right?
That'll be our second wish!

252
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,833
[GOKU] Hey, don't I
get a say in this?

253
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,250
[GOKU]
Hi, everybody! It's me!

254
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,166
[KRILLIN]
G-Goku?

255
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,750
[GOHAN]
See! I told you guys!

256
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,541
[GOKU] King Kai's letting
me talk to you

257
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,333
from here in the
Other World, so listen up!

258
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,791
Lately I've been thinking about

259
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,458
why the Earth is
always in danger,

260
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,625
and I realized that
most of the guys

261
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,958
who attacked it were after me!

262
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,875
Think about it!
Frieza, Cell, the androids.

263
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,000
[TIEN]
It's an interesting point.

264
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,166
I guess, but where
is he going with this?

265
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,166
[GOKU] Well, I think
it would be better

266
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,958
for the Earth if I didn't
come back this time.

267
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,041
King Kai agrees with me.

268
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,541
Sort of.

269
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,916
As a Saiyan baby I was sent
to Earth to destroy it.

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,958
And though all my life,
I've tried to do the opposite,

271
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,291
it's kinda like I've been ful-
filling that mission all along.

272
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,958
So yeah, I'm gonna
stay here now.

273
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,958
I really don't mind.
King Kai says I can get

274
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,958
special treatment 'cause
I saved the Earth and all.

275
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,958
I'll be able to keep my body,
and from what I hear,

276
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,750
there's lots of
interesting people to meet!

277
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,250
It'll be a fun!

278
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,541
Another adventure.

279
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,750
[GOKU] King Kai could ask one
of the Dragons to revive him,

280
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,458
but he's agreed to
show me around here

281
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,541
for a while and keep me company.

282
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,958
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

283
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,541
I really appreciate your
feelings towards me,

284
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,166
but you'll have to find
something else to wish for.

285
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,875
This is my home now.

286
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,000
Gohan's so strong now--
I've nothing left to teach him!

287
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,166
But that doesn't mean
I don't need you!

288
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,625
[GOKU] You all better take
notes of everything

289
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,166
that happens in your life.

290
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,166
'Cause when they're through,
I'll wanna hear all about them!

291
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,875
Until then, bye!

292
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,458
Goku...

293
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,333
Y'know, even though
he was saying goodbye,

294
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,666
it didn't make me too sad

295
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,166
because he was so
cheery about it.

296
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,250
Yeah, well Goku's been that
way ever since he was little.

297
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,750
[YAMCHA] It's like
nothing ever got to him.

298
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,291
He's always had that
goofy smile on his face.

299
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,083
Guess that's just him.

300
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,291
Yeah, you're right.

301
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,875
And with each new adventure,
we're always left behind.

302
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,125
[PICCOLO] Goku has and
always will be Goku.

303
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:34,125
He gave me a Senzu Bean when
I was trying to kill him.

304
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:38,166
Even with a villain like me,
he always assumed the best.

305
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,458
Nothing can take
that from him.

306
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,333
Dad, I know what I'll
remember about you.

307
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,041
I'll remember when we
were up against Frieza

308
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,750
and knew we couldn't win, how
you just walked right up to him.

309
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,333
And whenever things
seem tough for me,

310
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,541
I think of you walking
forward like that,

311
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,250
and it makes me strong.

[GOHAN]
You've given us so much, Dad.

313
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,500
Thank you for it all.

314
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,250
Excuse me.

315
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:34,000
[NARRATOR] So Goku has decided
to remain in the Other World.

316
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,833
But he will stay
alive in the hearts

317
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,958
of Gohan and of us all.

318
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:49,083
Listen, you have one more
wish for me to grant.

319
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,875
I'm waiting...
