Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,250
Piccolo was K.O.'d by Cell

4
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,333
after bravely trying
to prevent the monster

5
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:27,291
from absorbing Androids
17 and 18 into his being.

6
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,791
Knowing that his friends would
have little hope against Cell

7
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,875
if his deadly
evolution was completed,

8
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,291
Piccolo sacrificed
everything he had

9
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,958
in a daring bid to stop him.

In the face of great adversity,

noble men must
often do noble deeds.

16
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,416
And so it was with
the mighty Piccolo,

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,916
who gave everything he had
for the Earth and its people.

not being able
to help Piccolo

we spent together.

160
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,583
You guys are "cool!"

161
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,416
[TIEN] Wow! It looks
like the big guy

162
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,583
is walking right into it!

163
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:26,500
He's either extremely strong
or that guy's just plain crazy!

164
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,583
[ANDROID 17 whimpers]

165
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,791
[ANDROID 17 yells]

166
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,083
[ANDROID 17 growls]

167
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:56,208
Yes, I'd have to say that you're
ripe for the picking, 17.

168
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,750
Unless you have any more
objections, it's dinner time.

169
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:07,083
Enough of this.
You are mine now. Come.

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,916
You... You monster!
You disgust me!

171
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,541
Nothing could be more detestable
than becoming part of you!

172
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,875
Ah! Your words hurt me.
But that's okay!

173
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,958
All that you fail to understand
will now be made clear to you.

174
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,791
[ANDROID 17] It's perfectly
clear what you are,

175
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,208
you insect-looking freak!
Let go of me-- Ahh!

176
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,791
[CELL laughs]

177
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:48,708
[ANDROID 17 wails]

178
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,916
Welcome home!

179
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,708
[ANDROID 17 yells]

180

[CELL laughs]

182
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,000
I won't... let you... do this!

183
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:06,791
[laughing continues]

184
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,125
[ANDROID 17] Nooo!

185
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,041
[CELL] Hmm?

186
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,208
[CELL] So, the big one is
more powerful than I thought!

187
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,666
Interesting...

188
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,125
Huh?

189
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,583
16! It's you!

190
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,083
I don't believe it!

191
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,208
How did you manage to
get him off of me?

192
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,541
[ANDROID 16]
I used one of my hard punches.

193
00:15:55,458 --> 00:16:00,375
I find this disturbance
to be refreshing! Oh yes!

194
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,833
Hey, thanks for the help, 16.

195
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,333
But I think you just
made him angry!

196
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,458
I am going to destroy him.

197
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,708
Sure! May I ask how?

198
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,750
According to my calculations,
I am just as strong as Cell.

199
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,208
Huh?!

200
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,791
[ANDROID 16]
Cell, I recommend surrender!

201
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,416
[CELL] What? To a piece
of junk like you?!

202
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,791
[CELL chuckles]

203
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,541
[ANDROID 16 yells]

204
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:05,125
Wow! The big guy's
holding his own!

205
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,333
[TIEN thinking]
Amazing!

206
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,333
This android could be the
solution to all of our problems!

207
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,583
At least I hope...

208
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:52,166
[CELL growls]

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,625
[ANDROID 17 gasps]

00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,291
[TIEN gasps]

212

[CELL laughs]

213
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:33,833
Yes, good boy! Sleep,
this won't take long!

214
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:40,250
[CELL roars]

215
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,916
Now! You die!

216
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,375
[ANDROID 16 chuckles]

217
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,958
[CELL] What?! Impossible!
You should be immobilized!

218
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,458
I pierced your neck! That's
where your neural link is!

219
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,291
[ANDROID 16]
Not in my design!

220
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,541
So! Dr. Gero made
some improvements!

221
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,875
[ANDROID 16] Hmmm.

222
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,833

[ANDROID 16 yells]

225
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,375
Huh?

226
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:40,000
So! You're fast, too. Well then.

227
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,208
This is where I cut out!

228
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,375
[ANDROID 16 grunts]

229
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,083
Now I've got you.

230
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:14,000
This little altercation has
been stimulating. Thank you.

231
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,083
[BOTH growling]

238
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,500
[TIEN] Unbelievable!

239
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:16,541
[CELL wails]

240
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:25,166
That should put a stop to
your absorbing capabilities.

241
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,083
Now you are like a bee
without a stinger.

242
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,041
[TIEN laughs]

243
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,166
That guy did it! Awesome!

244
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:47,083
Not exactly!
Your analogy of the bee...

245
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,208
It's not quite accurate.

246
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,083
When bees lose their stingers,
they're gone for good.

247
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,041
The bee dies.

248

[CELL yells]

249
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,666
[CELl] But when
Cell loses his tail,

250
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,791
well, he just grows
another one!

251
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,208
Since some of Piccolo's cells
comprise my cellular structure,

252
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:21,208
I, too, have the ability
to regenerate my body!

253
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:25,000
I love the Nameks.
An amazing race.

254
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,333
I am the best
of every race

255
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,750
all neatly rolled
into one super being!

256
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:36,083
[CELL cackles]

257
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,291
[NARRATOR] The ominously
confident Cell continues

258
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:42,041
his bid to assimilate Androids
17 and 18 into his being.

259
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,416
Can the strong,
silent Android 16

260
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,958
rescue his comrades
from this ugly fate?

261
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,291
And what about Tien?

262
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,666
With all three eyes glued
to the battlefield,

263
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,833
does he have a
special plan in mind?!
