00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,875
it was the war between the Buus

3
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,791
as Majin Buu had to battle
his evil counterpart

4
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,750
whom he had expelled
from his very being!

5
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,208
Buu make you chocolate!

6
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,541
[NARRATOR] Lacking the
brute force needed to win,

7
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,000
Buu tried an
unconventional attack,

8
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,833
only to have it
backfire on him!

9
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:43,125
[NARRATOR] Buu had turned good,
but now he was good to eat!

10
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,125
And in the end,
he became a tasty treat.

11
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,625
But this was no
ordinary candy bar!

12
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,875
After eating it,

13
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:53,458
the bad Buu had a
violent change to undergo!

14
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,916
[NARRATOR]
To Mr. Satan's dismay,

15
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,458
the friend that he had
come to know was gone,

16
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,416
and a new Majin Buu was born!

17
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,208
I don't believe it!
Look at him!

18
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,708
He's even meaner
looking than the last one!

19
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,708
[screams]

20
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,958
[NARRATOR] With the newfound
ability to sense energy signals,

21
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,416
Majin Buu headed
directly for the Lookout!

22
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,458
He's here!

23
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,000
[gasping]

24
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,625
Look! Don't attack unless he
attacks one of us first! Got it?

25
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,125
Huh?

26
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,416
[NARRATOR]
Look out, everyone!

27
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,791
Majin Buu is
crashing the party!

28
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,916
[NARRATOR] And with Goten
and Trunks sound asleep,

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,916
and Gohan tied up in
the power raising ceremony,

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,833
it looks like the new Buu
is going to have his way

31
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,041
with the people of the Earth!

32
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:52,208
What demented plans does he
have in mind? Stay tuned!

33
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:21,333
[laughs]

34
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,458
I liked the first one better!
What happened?

35
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,875
Well he transformed! Obviously!

36
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:37,291
I found you, finally.

37
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,958
Incredible!

38
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,791
[PICCOLO]
Dude, don't encourage him.

39
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,291
Please.

40
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,333
Produce!

41
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:14,416
PRODUCE!!!

42
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,958
[YAMCHA] What's he talking
about? Produce? Produce what?

43
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,250
[KRILLIN]
I don't know! Ask him!

44
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,375
[YAMCHA]
Are you crazy? You ask him!

45
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,000
[KRILLIN] You're the
one that wants to know!

46
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,041
Hmm?

47
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,375
What?! What is it?

48
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,583
What is it that you
want us to produce? Tell us!

49
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,791
I was promised a good fight!
Produce the challenger!

50
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,208
Which one of you is it?

51
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:51,625
Don't be shy! Come forward!
The time has arrived!

52
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,500
Are you the one?

53
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,666
Me? No way! I would have
remembered a promise like that!

54
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,416
Yamcha! Was it you?

55
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,958
[YAMCHA]
Me? Are you nuts?!

56
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,375
[BULMA]
What's going on?

57
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,416
[CHICHI]
Where are they?

58
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,625
And what's all
the commotion about?

59
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,041
Oh, no!
He's here! He found us!

60
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,750
The one who made the promise.

61
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:27,791
He isn't here right now.
Where is he? The liar!

62
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,625
And I promise...

63
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,541
Give them two days
and they'll be ready.

64
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,666
There's no need for you
to destroy West City

65
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,041
or anything else.

66
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,375
I'm asking, have some patience.
They'll come to you.

67
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,708
They want to fight you.

68
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,583
[BUU]
Hmm... Are they really strong?

69
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,958
They are... unbelievably
strong! Wait and see.

70
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,875
[laughs]

71
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,208
Produce!

72
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,875
He's not here!

73
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:17,291
All right! He's here but
he can't fight right now!

74
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,625
Please! He's taking a nap!

75
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,958
Oh, well, wake him up!

76
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,458
But he just went to sleep!

77
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:28,000
Let him rest a little more!
I beg you!

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,333
Look! Buu!

79
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,125
He could fight you, but
wouldn't you rather fight him

80
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,958
when he's at his maximum power?

81
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,708
You want a real
challenge, don't you?

82
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:51,041
Waiting's no fun!
I hate to wait!

83
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,500
[PICCOLO] But the promise
made was for two days!

84
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,250
We still have one!

85
00:07:55,333 --> 00:08:02,791
Well, that's true!
But I'm here now! Produce!

86
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,666
[BULMA]
He's here to fight Gotenks!

87
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,875
Gosh! I don't know if we
should let the boys

88
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,375
fight a monster like that!

89
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,000
[CHICHI] Uh, unh! No way!
He's not touching my son!

90
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,250
I'll fight him myself! Ha!

91
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,458
I'm not afraid
of that big bully!

92
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,250
ChiChi, darling,
I can't let you do this!

93
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,541
Let Piccolo handle it, okay?

94
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,791
Let go of me, Dad!
Right now! Let go!

95
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not scared of that fiend!
Let me go right now!

96
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,083
If he wants a fight,
I'll give him a fight!

97
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,416
Do it now! Produce!

98
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,958
[PICCOLO thinking] Trunks and
Goten--no, they're not ready!

99
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:53,666
I have to buy more time--at
any cost! It's our only chance!

100
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,083
Last time! Produce!

101
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,875
Please! Just one more day!

102
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,750
He'll be at his best tomorrow!
I promise!

103
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,125
Think about it!

104
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,000
This might be the
only chance you have

105
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,875
to test your true strength!

106
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,333
There's still
plenty of people on Earth

107
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,708
that you could kill
for your amusement

108
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,375
while you're waiting
for this fight!

109
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,416
Huh?

110
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,375
Uh, what? Piccolo!

111
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,791
[PICCOLO]
Be quiet, Dende!

112
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,750
Forgive me! But I know that
they can be wished back

113
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,875
with the Dragon Balls!

114
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,500
Hmm?

115
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,958
Now what?

116
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,125
[PICCOLO thinking]
I know what you're doing!

117
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,333
You're assessing how many
people are still alive!

118
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,875
Does this mean he's going
to give us the extra day?

119
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,375
Surely it would
take him that long

120
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,625
to hunt down
all of those people!

121
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:31,541
No. This is it!
We have got to act now!

122
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,166
[BULMA]
What's he doing?

123
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,333
[VIDEL]
I don't know.

124
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:39,416
Just taking a stroll!
He's got some nerve! Jerk!

125
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,541
[PICCOLO]
Krillin! Listen carefully!

126
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,416
I want you to go
wake up Trunks and Goten!

127
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,666
Keep them quiet!

128
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,458
Take them into the Hyperbolic
Time Chamber! To train!

129
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,125
Why don't they
just fight him now?

130
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:02,166
Are you crazy? There's no way!
He would annihilate Gotenks!

131
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,166
We've never encountered
anything like this guy!

132
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,291
[PICCOLO] No. No,
we need something more!

133
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,708
Trunks and Goten have
got to break through!

134
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,625
Krillin, this is
our last chance! Go!

135
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,083
Go while he's
looking the other way!

136
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:40,458
Dad! Let go! I demand that
you let go of me right now!

137
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,875
ChiChi! Would you stop that?

138
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,458
Please, don't go!

139
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,875
[CHICHI] It's time
to kick some butt!

140
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,458
[BULMA]
No!

141
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,750
Hey! That's your broom!

142
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,083
Come on! Let's go!

143
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,833
Ahh?!

144
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,041
[OX-KING]
ChiChi! Are you okay?

145
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:13,041
No, I'm not! I don't want
my son fighting that monster!

146
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,500
[sobs]

147
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:42,083
Look at him! Disgusting!
Makes my skin crawl.

148
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,250
[wails]

149
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,208
I'm scared, Mommy!

150
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,250
Snap out of it!
It's time to get up!

151
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,791
Come on, Goten! Get up!

152
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,916
Yeah! I love fried chicken!

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,166
Aye yi, yi! You're just
like your Dad, kid!

154
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,875
Goten! Wake up!

155
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,958
What is he doing?

156
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,958
Who knows? He's very peculiar!

157
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,333
[PICCOLO]
Huh?

158
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,041
[SUPER BUU]
Time to kill!

159
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,500
[gasps]

160
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,750
[PICCOLO] Stay still,
everyone! Don't move!

161
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,083
Whoa! Crazy!

162
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,791
Look! Wow!

163
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,666
[MAN]
Cool! Check it out! Fireworks!

164
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:06,500
[screaming]

165
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,166
Kai what's wrong?
Is it... Uh, oh!

166
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,375
Yes! The Earth! It's terrible!

167
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,708
Huh?

168
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,125
[SUPREME KAI] He's attacking
the entire populace!

169
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,000
[GOHAN thinking]
Is he for real?

170
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,916
Look, boy! They're everywhere!

171
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,750
Tien!

172
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,041
[TIEN]
Chiaotzu!

173
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,666
What have I done?!
I won't fail you!

174
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,833
I'll wish you all back!

175
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,541
Human Extinction Attack!
How do you like it?

176
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,708
Now, where is the strong one?!

177
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:06,375
I see! Yes! We just need a
short time to prepare him!

178
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:11,625
Yes! He can be ready in
one hour if that's okay!

179
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,208
Please, Buu!

180
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,833
What's an hour?
How long is it?

181
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,541
[PICCOLO] When all the sand
has fallen to the bottom,

182
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,500
one hour will be up!

183
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,916
No way!

184
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,666
Why not? What's an hour?
It's no big deal!

185
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,833
Unless you're scared!
Is that it, Buu?

186
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,041
Loud mouth girl!
You should die!

187
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,625
Wait! That girl is
Mr. Satan's daughter!

188
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,916
Hmm?!

189
00:17:55,166 --> 00:18:00,041
One hour! She's asking!
Mr. Satan's girl! Not us! Her!

190
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,750
It's true!
Her scent--it's like his!

191
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:14,416
Very well! This Majin
Buu will wait one hour!

192
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,333
Then I will kill you all!

193
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,041
Mhmm.

194
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,583
[VIDEL]
How does he know my father?

195
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,916
Wow! That was close!

196
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,666
There must have been millions
of those blasts! How awful!

197
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,333
[whimpers]

198
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:49,166
[MR. SATAN] Come 'ere! Don't be
scared! I'll protect you, boy!

199
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:57,166
[snoring]

200
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,791
Hey! Come on, you guys!

201
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,375
We have to go to the Hyperbolic
Time Chamber to train!

202
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,208
Now!

203
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,958
[OLD KAI cackles]

204
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:24,666
Aliens? What? You're
kidding me! This is great!

205
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,916
Kai! I can't sense the Earth!

206
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,916
Yes! True! They're gone!
They've all been killed!

207
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,375
What? All of them?

208
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,958
But they were there when
I looked five minutes ago!

209
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,541
Right! Buu eliminated them
all with a single attack.

210
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,958
There were millions
of them, Goku!

211
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,625
Excuse me, Sir!

212
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,541
Hmm?

213
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,791
Time should be up!

214
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,708
We've been sitting here
for over twenty hours!

215
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,708
Oh, yes! I think you're right!

216
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,708
It should be over by now!
Amazing that it's not!

217
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,541
Whoo! You must be super strong!

218
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,333
Sometimes it takes
a little longer

219
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,041
for the really
strong ones, of course!

220
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,208
I'm tired of your games, Kai!

221
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,750
Do you realize
what you've done?

222
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,750
How much time we...
It worked! Huh?

223
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,541
Amazing! Was that
power really mine? Wow!

224
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,500
Sorry, I yelled at you!

225
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,125
You're not done yet!

226
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,333
Sit back down on the
ground so we can finish up!

227
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,750
[GOHAN] Right! I'm sorry
I ever doubted you sir.

228
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,750
[OLD KAI]
Sshh! Quiet!

229
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,750
[GOHAN]
Sorry!

230
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,833
[OLD KAI]
The aliens! Hehehehehe!

231
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,000
[SUPREME KAI]
Very impressive.

232
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,041
Incredible! I really didn't
think that he could pull it off!

233
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,375
I knew! He's a Kai!
My great ancestor!

234
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,333
He's brilliant! And shameless!

235
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,750
What do you mean shameless?

236
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,375
He was telling the truth
the whole time, Supreme Kai!

237
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,375
I mean the kiss.

238
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,958
Oh, yeah! That's right!

239
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:44,125
And now we're going to have to
deliver! I hope Bulma agrees!

240
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:48,333
Aw! Sure! She will!
It's to save the world!

241
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,791
[ROSHI] Look at him.

242
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,750
He's just sitting
there like a statue.

243
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,166
He's not even blinking.

244
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,041
[ANDROID 18]
He's so creepy.

245
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,083
[YAMCHA]
Well, if he thinks staring at it

246
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,458
is gonna make it go away
faster, he's mistaken.

247
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,416
I've tried it before.

248
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,083
[yawns]

249
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,666
[KRILLIN] Hey! Quiet, you guys!
He's right out there!

250
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,625
[GOTEN]
Where?

251
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,958
[KRILLIN]
Will you two be quiet?!

252
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,583
[NARRATOR] After experiencing a
sample of his awakened powers,

253
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:31,250
Gohan has new faith
in Old Kai's abilities!

254
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,291
[NARRATOR] But with
less than an hour to go

255
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,041
before Majin Buu
attacks Gotenks

256
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,333
and the few remaining
survivors on Earth,

257
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,333
will the power raising
be completed in time?

258
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:47,541
And will it be enough to defeat
this radically powerful enemy?

259
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,541
[NARRATOR] Stay tuned for more
excitement on Dragon Ball Z.
