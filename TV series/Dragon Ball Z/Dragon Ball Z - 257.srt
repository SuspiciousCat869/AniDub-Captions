00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,791
a strong new
version of Majin Buu,

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,500
now dominated by hatred,
arrived atop the Lookout,

4
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,166
and when Piccolo could not
produce the challenger,

5
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,333
who had been promised,

6
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,416
Majin Buu unleashed
a horrific power:

7
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,791
The Human Extinction Attack.

8
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,875
[NARRATOR] Out of the entire
population of Earth,

9
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,875
less than twenty
humans now remain.

10
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,166
It was a blow
that would lay heavily

11
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,541
on Piccolo's conscience.

12
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,375
Human Extinction Attack!

13
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,333
How do you like it?
Now where is the strong one?

14
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:57,125
I see. Yes. We just need
a short time to prepare him.

15
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:01,291
He... He can be ready
in one hour if that's okay?

16
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,541
Please, Buu!

17
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:12,541
What's an hour?
How long is it?

18
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,375
[NARRATOR] Realizing Goten and
Trunks were not strong enough

19
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,291
to fight this altered form,

20
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,333
Piccolo has managed
to buy one hour's time,

21
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,791
time that will be
stretched to its maximum

22
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,500
as the two young fighters enter

23
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,666
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber
for final, desperate training.

24
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,666
Will Piccolo's
daring plan succeed?

25
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,375
Man, is that really Majin Buu?

26
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:03,208
If it is, he must
be on a big diet.

27
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,458
[PICCOLO]
Make no mistake.

28
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,666
That is Majin Buu

29
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,958
and his strength has
increased substantially.

30
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,041
You boys need to understand.

31
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:17,708
We're in a very grave
situation, things have changed.

32
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,125
For every minute out here

33
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:23,541
you can train six hours
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

34
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,333
Maybe that's enough.

35
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,666
Mom, where are you going?

36
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,458
What?!

37
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,666
Whatever it is you're
doing ChiChi, stop it.

38
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,125
You savage, do you even care
that you killed my oldest son?!

39
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,250
You look at me when
I'm talking to you!

40
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:53,791
[gasping]

41
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,291
Do you like eggs?

42
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,666
Huh?

43
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,583
[screams]

44
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:16,041
Ahhhhh!

45
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,333
My mother...

46
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,458
[GOTEN] I'll get you,
you stupid beast!

47
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,250
[PICCOLO]
No, Goten!

48
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,916
You go down and we're all dead!

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,333
But Mom was all I had left.

50
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,541
Goten...

51
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,166
Listen we can bring your mother
back with the Dragon Balls

52
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,083
provided only one thing,

53
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,458
that you and Trunks stay alive

54
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,125
long enough to
wipe out Majin Buu!

55
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,416
[PICCOLO] There is no way
to beat him at your current

56
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,333
power levels, and we've
got less than an hour left

57
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,916
so the two of you
must train quickly.

58
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,041
Can you do it?

59
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,583
[GOTEN]
Uh-huh.

60
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,458
Yeah, sure you can Goten!

61
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,125
We've all lost someone by now-

62
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,125
but that just means we have
to beat Buu harder! Right?!

63
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,750
[GOTEN]
Mm-hmm.

64
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,583
That's right!

65
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,250
Wow, this place is cool.

66
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,500
I wonder if they've
got any food around here?

67
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,333
My body feels kinda
weird and heavy.

68
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,500
Hey Goten, do you feel that?

69
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,666
Hey, you don't have to be
in such a rush you know!

70
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,083
A minute on the other side is
like hours and hours over here,

71
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,541
so we've got time to spare.

72
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,375
Huh?!

73
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,375
Piccolo forgot to mention
there's nothing to eat.

74
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,750
Wow, Goten,

75
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,250
whoever was in here last
must've really wiped it out!

76
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,916
Nothing but brown rice
and water in the fridge!

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,958
I don't know about you
but I could really

78
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,250
go for a roast beef
sandwich or...

79
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,458
Huh?!

80
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,833
Hey, don't start without me!

81
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,875
[TRUNKS]
Wait a second.

82
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,750
[VIDEL]
Piccolo?

83
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,791
Hmm?

84
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,833
[VIDEL] Earlier when you
were speaking to Majin Buu,

85
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,125
you talked about my father like
the two of them knew each other.

86
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,708
[PICOOLO]
Yes.

87
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,916
[VIDEL]
But I don't get it.

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,791
How could my father
have known Majin Buu?

89
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,666
Your father is a hero,

90
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,541
he took it upon himself to
journey to Majin Buu's home

91
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,958
and fight him on his own ground.

92
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,791
[PICCOLO]
For reasons we don't know,

93
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,416
Mr. Satan did
not fight Majin Buu.

94
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,958
Instead, the two
forged a friendship.

95
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,833
Your father is
the only human being

96
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,375
Majin Buu seems to appreciate.

97
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,041
Although other circumstances
brought it to a halt,

98
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:22,875
your father nearly made
Buu adopt a life of peace.

99
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,083
He may have transformed
into this evil entity now,

100
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,708
but Buu still has a
potent memory of a man

101
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,958
and the kindness
he showed a monster.

102
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,291
Your dad will never have
the powers that we do, Videl.

103
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,875
But his compassion
exceeds any victory

104
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,250
he could ever
achieve in the ring.

105
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,000
My dad...?

106
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:58,125
[SUPER BUU growls]

107
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,416
Aaaaaaaaahh!

108
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,791
No more, no more waiting!

109
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,291
No, it's only been
thirty minutes!

110
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,000
Wait! You won't have a
challenge if you fight him now!

111
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,875
The hour isn't over!

112
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:49,125
I'm done. I'm done waiting.
I'm fighting.

113
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:54,750
Come out!! Do you hear me?!

114
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,041
Aaaaahhh!

115
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,750
[KRILLIN]
Watch out!

116
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,375
[KRILLIN]
Hurry up!

117
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,625
Ow!

118
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,708
That's gonna
hurt in the morning...

119
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,750
[YAMCHA]
Whoa, this isn't good.

120
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,750
Why don't we get
Trunks and Goten?

121
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,291
They've got to have finished
their training by now!

122
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,833
Would you stop
worrying about yourself?!

123
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,458
[KRILLIN] Oh, forget the
morning, it hurts right now.

124
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,125
What happened out here?

125
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,208
Okay, I'll take you
to him. Let's go.

126
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,291
[PICCOLO]
It's this way.

127
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,625
It looks like Piccolo
is taking him right

128
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,416
to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

129
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,083
Goten and Trunks
won't be expecting Buu

130
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,916
to pop his head in that early!

131
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,625
[YAMCHA]
That's weird.

132
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,625
Why doesn't Piccolo just
bring out Goten and Trunks?

133
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,791
[KRILLIN] You think they're
actually going to fight inside?

134
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,458
If they do fight
Majin Buu inside

135
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,708
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber
and the entrance is destroyed,

136
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,375
then that dimension will
be closed off from this one.

137
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,333
Even if Trunks and Goten lose,
Earth might still be saved.

138
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:43,833
But whoever is left inside
will be trapped, maybe forever.

139
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:44,750
Ahh!

140
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,083
Hey!

141
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,375
But we can't wish them back
from another dimension, can we?

142
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,291
[PICCOLO] The Dragon Balls
are not bound by the limits

143
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,708
of different dimensions.

144
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:12,833
We will be able to wish
them back, if they're killed.

145
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:18,208
Well, it sure seems like Piccolo
has cooked up one mean strategy.

146
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,666
[ROSHI] Oh! Speaking of
what's cookin'... Hehehehe!

147
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,083
[BULMA growls]

148
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,333
[SUPER BUU] Do we have to
climb all of these stairs?

149
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,958
[PICCOLO]
I'm afraid so.

150
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,916
[KRILLIN] Well, at least
they're walking slow.

151
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,416
Roshi!

152
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,125
You're facing the wrong way!

153
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,958
Oh! Hahaha! Thanks for the
directional help, honey.

154
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,958
Doesn't it seem like Piccolo's
taking the long way around?

155
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,458
Yes. He's missed three turns

156
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,791
that would have taken
him directly to the room.

157
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,208
[KRILLIN] I bet he's stalling
to give them more time.

158
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,958
I mean since one minute
over here is worth six hours

159
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,000
in the time chamber, the
longer he takes, the better.

160
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,375
Come on, how far is it?

161
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,041
Not too far, we have to go down
a few flights to reach them.

162
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,541
[SUPER BUU] Down? After
climbing up all this way?

163
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,541
[PICCOLO] I assure you,
it's the only way to get there.

164
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,958
[GOTENKS]
Gotenks, over and out.

165
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,583
Man, that's a work out.

166
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,916
Hahaha.

167
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,208
It sure is neat to know
there's levels even higher

168
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,791
than Super Saiyan, huh?

169
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,583
Hmph! Now there's no
way he can beat us.

170
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,125
We weren't half this
strong when we came in here.

171
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,416
Trunks, I'm beat.

172
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,916
It feels like all of my energy

173
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
has just fallen
right out of my body.

174
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,083
And I think we might still
have a problem with time.

175
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,625
[TRUNKS]
Let's look.

176
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,291
[TRUNKS] See, by the time
we figured out our trick,

177
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,375
we only had five minutes
left before we separated.

178
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,833
Okay, so we'll try jumping
to the new super level

179
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,125
as soon as we fuse,

180
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,333
and then we'll beat
him in like four minutes!

181
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,791
But that's stupid
to win so fast!

182
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,041
Warriors drag out their
fights as long as possible!

183
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,791
I'm telling you, Goten, after
this week of training in here,

184
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,166
we're strong enough
to fight off Buu

185
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,250
even if we don't turn
into a regular Super Saiyan!

186
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,625
So, I'm thinking we
start fighting him

187
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,791
with our normal fusion,

188
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,875
getting in as many
hits as we can, right?

189
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,041
Spending as much time
as possible playing around.

190
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,041
Then we make it look like
we can't take anymore,

191
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,208
and that's when
we spring it on him!

192
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,583
We go to our new
Super Saiyan thing

193
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,583
as fast as we
can and we got him!

194
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:33,000
By that time he'll
tired and confused!

195
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,708
It'll be the kind of move
people will never forget!

196
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:39,458
Uh-huh. Hahaha!

197
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,250
Then he'll be sorry for
what he did to Gohan,

198
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,375
and your mom, and my dad! Ha!

199
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,708
Yeah, that's the plan.

200
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,958
Where are they?!

201
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,458
[PICCOLO thinking] Please,
don't run out of patience yet.

202
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,166
It's not far now.

203
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Goten, Trunks, can you hear me?

204
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,625
--Huh?
--Huh?

205
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,958
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Don't be frightened, boys.

206
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,916
It's me, Piccolo.

207
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,125
Piccolo?

208
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:32,833
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Be quiet and listen

209
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,250
very carefully to me.

210
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,333
The two of you are
going to fight Majin Buu

211
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,625
earlier than expected.

212
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,083
He's on his way
to you as I speak.

213
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,750
Ahhh! But we're so tired,

214
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,166
I don't know if we have the
energy to stand up right now.

215
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,708
[PICCOLO telepathically]
It's all right, Goten.

216
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm taking the long way around
to give you some extra time.

217
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,375
We should arrive at
the door in one minute.

218
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,041
That gives you six
hours to recuperate.

219
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,083
Do everything you
can to prepare. Sleep.

220
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,958
Drink some water.
Stretch your muscles out.

221
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,625
I believe in you boys.
We all do.

222
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,750
And I'm counting
on you to finish this.

223
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,875
[PICCOLO telepathically]
Good luck to you both.

224
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,541
Hah!

225
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,333
Six hours is more
than enough time for us.

226
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,125
You know what Trunks?

227
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,333
For the first time ever,

228
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,041
I actually feel
sorry for Majin Buu.

229
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,166
[laughing]

230
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,916
Would you care to
eat before the fight?

231
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,791
No!

232
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,166
I don't want to eat.

233
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,541
You take me there now,
before I break you in half!

234
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,416
[PICCOLO]
Of course.

235
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,333
[PICCOLO]
Here we are.

236
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,041
Where is he?

237
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,333
[SUPER BUU]
Hmm?

238
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,250
You ready, Goten?

239
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,708
Yeah!

240
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,333
What about Buu?

241
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,166
Doesn't look it.

242
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,041
Cool, let's do this.

243
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,333
Those kids?

244
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,833
[PICCOLO]
That's right.

245
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,625
[PICCOLO thinking] Even if these
boys are perfectly trained,

246
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,791
we still need a miracle.

247
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,125
All that training

248
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,333
and Piccolo is the only
one who came to watch us.

249
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,250
Why didn't anyone else come?

250
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,833
Where is the fighter?

251
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,458
It's them.

252
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,666
[TRUNKS] We might
not have an audience,

253
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,500
but let's still
give a good show.

254
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,000
[GOTEN]
Mm-hmm.

255
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,416
This is the end for you...

256
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,791
...Majin Buu.

257
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,666
Don't you think
it's a little bit stupid

258
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,458
that I just say "Majin Buu."

259
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,125
You had a few more lines there.

260
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,291
Is it my fault if
you can't remember them?

261
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,833
Let's begin!

262
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,666
[TRUNKS] Looks like the
bad guy's getting impatient.

263
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,083
Should we show him our moves?

264
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,083
Oh, all right.

265
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:20,875
Ready?

266
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,541
Let's go!

267
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,583
[TRUNKS]
Ow!! What's wrong with you?

268
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,291
You can't just come in swinging
like that, without any warning.

269
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,875
Don't you know
what a sucker punch is?

270
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,916
That's something only
inexperienced fighters do.

271
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,416
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

272
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,208
We're trying to prepare so
we can give you a fair fight.

273
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,250
So why don't YOU
try some, patience?

274
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,041
Now, we're going to power up.

275
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,458
You stand there and be quiet.

276
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,416
I'll tell you when
it's time to fight.

277
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,750
Let's try this
thing again. Ready?

278
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:57,333
Yep!

279
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,791
[BOTH]
Go!

280
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,458
Fu--

281
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,083
[PICOLO thinking]
What are they doing?

282
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,750
Why aren't they starting
as Super Saiyans?

283
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,833
[BOTH]
--sion!

284
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,208
Ha!

285
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,625
That's perfect! Their power
levels are exactly equal.

286
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:35,791
Ha!

287
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,083
Nice to see you
again Majin Buu!

288
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,916
Ah, yes. There's my fighter,

289
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,166
too bad no one else is here
to witness your final hour.

290
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,875
Final hour?
That's pretty clever.

291
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,083
Guess you can tell jokes now
that you're not a tub of lard!

292
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,541
But I've been changing too and
you're in for a real surprise

293
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,875
when my fists start flying.

294
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,375
This is really stunning.

295
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,333
His power level has
increased dramatically.

296
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,875
Maybe he can actually win this.

297
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,875
Huh? Huh?

298
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,625
You said you'd tell me
when I can start fighting.

299
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,375
Yeah, okay just wait
here for a second.

300
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,291
[GOTENKS thinking]
So much for the plan.

301
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,291
After that kind of attack,
he's not even bruised.

302
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,500
I'll just have to show
him a few of my secrets.

303
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,791
[NARRATOR]
It looks like Majin Buu

304
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,708
is even stronger than
the boys had predicted.

305
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:46,541
But Gotenks has several
more tricks up his sleeve.

306
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,708
The only question is:
Will they be enough?

307
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:54,083
This could be a problem.
