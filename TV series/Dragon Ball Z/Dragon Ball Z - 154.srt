00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,416
Tien kept the
monster Cell at bay

3
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,000
with a barrage of high-powered
energy attacks.

4
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,208
[NARRATOR] No matter
how hard Cell tried,

5
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:33,500
he could not escape the power
of Tien's ferocious blasts.

6
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,041
[NARRATOR] But Tien's technique

7
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,291
required an incredible
amount of energy,

8
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,625
and soon the courageous
hero could fight no more...

9
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,125
[NARRATOR] Furious at losing
sight of the androids,

10
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,208
Cell demanded that Tien
pay for the interruption...

11
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,958
...with his life.

12
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,708
[NARRATOR] But Goku was not
about to lose another friend

13
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,958
on the battlefield.

14
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,291
Employing his Instant
Transmission Technique,

15
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,041
he arrived in
the nick of time,

16
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,000
rescuing his friend and
challenging the android villian.

17
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,833
[GOKU] I'd really like to
teach you a lesson...

18
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,750
But I need one more day
before I'm strong enough

19
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,125
to go up against you!

20
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,333
I'm gonna take you down, Cell!

21
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:20,833
Your days of terrorizing the
Earth will be over for good.

22
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,000
[NARRATOR] And after placing the
near dead Piccolo on his back,

23
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,166
Goku was gone with a flash,

24
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,375
leaving Cell with
a mouthful of dust.

25
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:33,208
[CELL] Well, they won't
get away from me again.

26
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,208
Now I must continue my search.

27
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,875
[NARRATOR] The hunt is on
for the two remaining androids

28
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,916
and Cell won't rest
until 18 is absorbed.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,625
Can Goku complete his
training and stop Cell

30
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,666
from carrying out his evil plan?

31
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,791
Find out today!

32
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,333
Thanks for waiting, guys.
Did we miss anything?

33
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,875
It's good to have you back.

34
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,166
[GOKU] Things have gotten
worse since you've been gone.

35
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,083
[GOHAN] Hey, Trunks,
you've changed!

36
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,458
I'll say... Hey, you look
like you're in great shape.

37
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,208
[TRUNKS chuckles]

38
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,791
You were in the chamber
for a whole day.

39
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,083
I've never known anyone who
could last that long in there.

40
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,083
We probably could have
come out a lot sooner,

41
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,500
but father wasn't willing
to leave until he was sure

42
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,958
he'd done all he could do.

43
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,125
He insisted on training
for the full year

44
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,541
even though it
really only took him

45
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,750
a couple of months to trans--

46
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,791
Quiet!

47
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,333
You've said quite enough.

48
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,250
Our training is not to
be discussed... Ever!

49
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,708
[TRUNKS] Well, I guess
you're just going to have to

50
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,166
wait and see for yourself.

51
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,000
So it worked out, I guess...

52
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,833
Heh, heh. Maybe.

53
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,375
I will take care
of everything now.

54
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,041
There's no need to attempt
the training, Kakarot,

55
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,333
because I'm sure you
would not survive it.

56
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,916
Besides, I can guarantee that
I won't be needing any of you

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,458
to help me take care
of the androids.

58
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,958
You fool!

59
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:18,000
Listen, I don't know how
powerful you think you are,

60
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,791
but you're underestimating
our enemies.

61
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,541
[VEGETA chuckles]

62
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,875
While you were in that room,

63
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,000
Cell swallowed up Android 17
and transformed.

64
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,750
So don't try to tell us
you can handle it.

65
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,666
You don't even know
what you're up against!

66
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,166
[VEGETA laughs]

67
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,041
[VEGETA] Clearly,
trying to defeat Cell

68
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,166
has taken its toll
on all of you.

69
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,500
That's why I am offering
to take care of him myself.

70
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,000
[TIEN growls]

71
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,041
Vegeta.

72
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,375
I really suggest that you
listen to Piccolo and Tien.

73
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,416
I mean, you'd have
to triple your strength

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
to stand a chance--

75
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,291

[BOTH laugh]

78
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,166
Okay, Trunks, let's get going.

79
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,041
There'll be plenty of
time for fun on the way home.

80
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,208
But right now we better
hightail it to Kami's Place!

81
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,916
Hey! All right!

82

[KORIN] Whatta day.
Look how blue the sky is today.

this is a no fly zone!

[BULMA laughs]

86
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:07,666
Okay, maybe that was a little
too close. Sorry about that.

87
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,750
Curse them! Those androids!
They escaped!

88
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,916
They couldn't be too
far away from here.

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,833
And I will find them soon.

90
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,291
[ANDROID 18] Must you play with
that disgusting creature? Shoo!

91
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,500
Now wake up! We have to
get off this island, 16!

92
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,125
Oh, great. I think you're
starting to malfunction.

93
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,333
All you've been doing is staring
at these birds all day long.

94
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,708
What do you see in
those things, anyway?

95
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,958
Don't you care that Cell's going
to suck me up like he did 17?!

96
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,125
Don't you care that
he's going to kill you?!

97
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:35,166
Oh, wow! So this is
Kami's place, huh?

Yoo-hoo! Hell-O!

Look, it's Bulma!

[GOKU] Bulma, what
are you doin' here?

of you. You might need them.

Oh my gosh! Trunks,
what happened?!

109
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,125
I mean, you are Trunks, right?

110
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,916
Uh, yeah.

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,166
Oh! Wow! You've grown!
This a wig?

112
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,291
No, it's real!

113
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,500
I was in the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

114
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,166
I spent a year in there, but
outside only a day had passed.

115
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,333
That's why I've grown a little.

116
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,416
Oh!

117
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,416
[TRUNKS]
Father and I trained together.

118
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,916
Huh?

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,500
Vegeta, you don't
look that different.

120
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,875
Why didn't your
hair grow at all?

121
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,916
For your information,
a pure Saiyan's hair

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,625
does not change from
the day that he is born.

[GOKU &amp; BULMA]
Oohh!

Is that true? How 'bout that?

125
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,250
I guess that's why you've
never needed a haircut.

126

[GOKU]
Hey, yeah!

But I wish I could do something
about these split ends. Ha, ha!

128
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,500
Try shampoo.

129
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't have time to listen
to Kakarot's hair problems!

130
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,208
But I sure wouldn't mind
knowing why you're here!

131
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,041
Hold on, I'll show you!

132
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,208
You see, this fight with
Cell's gonna be tough,

133
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,041
so I thought you guys
might be able to use

134
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,541
some new combat suits.

135
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,958
And if you stop
being a jerk, Vegeta,

136
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,208
maybe you can have one, too.

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,333
[GOHAN] It's like the one I used
to wear on Namek! Remember, Dad?

138
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,125
A perfect fit!

139
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,041
Hey! These are
really light! Cool!

140
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,708
So all of these are
Saiyan combat suits?

141
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,625
More or less. I tried to copy
Vegeta's as much as possible.

[GOHAN]
You did a great job, Bulma!

Hey! Aren't you
going to wear yours?

145
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,583
I am a Namek, not a Saiyan, and
I'm not going to dress like one.

00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,666
That's right.

147
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,041
I refuse to wear
the same suit as Vegeta,

148
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,333
not after all of the
horrible things he's done!

Aw, come on guys...

They look good and
they fit great too.

152
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,291
There's no need for
you to wear that.

153
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,666
You won't even get
a chance to use it.

154
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,916
So why even bother
putting it on?

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,041
Is that because you plan on
finishing Cell all by yourself?

Well, I hope that you

[GOKU] You want me to
take you over there

with my Instant Transmission?

Oh, please. I don't need
any help from you, Kakarot.

I saved these two for you and

[TRUNKS]
Thanks, Goku.

169
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,958
Good luck! And if you
get into any trouble,

get yourself outta there, okay?

171
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,333
Right. Thank you for
everything, Goku.

And I hope that your

I want you to take care
of yourself, Trunks.

00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,000
And look after Vegeta too.

I'll see you later.

Yeah! Great! It's time for us
to start our training, Gohan!

Come out!

I should have caught up
with those androids by now!

There's no way they could
have gotten so far away from me.

Not with 16 as injured as he is.

They must be hiding on one of
these islands. But which one?

Of course!

Perhaps I'll be able
to flush them out.

I will find you!
Give up now, 18, or else!

If you do not show yourself,

I will destroy these islands one

Make it easy on yourself!

Come out now and your

No one is stronger than me and
I will find you eventually!

anything you can
possibly comprehend!

Heh, heh, heh.

Nice of him to let me
know where he is.

I can't wait!

Do not be afraid, 18.
Please stay calm.

227
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,333
I do not think Cell
would destroy these islands.

You are far too valuable.

of destroying you.

to show their faces.

strong enough to destroy
everything but you.
