00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,375
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,791
Goku's hidden powers
had at last awakened,

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,333
as he transformed into a
legendary Super Saiyan.

4
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,708
Faced with
this new threat,

5
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,083
Frieza launched a
desperate volley of attacks

6
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,583
but to no avail.

7
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,125
[FRIEZA yells]

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,291
[NARRATOR] For all of his might,

9
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,541
it seemed the once
invincible Frieza

10
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,500
had finally met his match.

11
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,125
[FRIEZA] You--!

12
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,833
What... What are you?!

13
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,750
I am the hope
of the Universe.

14
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:50,458
I am the answer to all living
things that cry out for peace.

15
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,500
I am protector
of the innocent.

16
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,416
I am the light
in the darkness.

17
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,166
I am truth.

18
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,916
[NARRATOR] Now, with
Planet Namek set to explode

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,166
at any minute, the
final, decisive round

20
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,791
of this epic battle
is about to begin.

21
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,833
Today, on Dragon Ball Z!

22
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,750
[GOKU] Ally to good!

23
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,208
Nightmare to you!

24
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,875
[FRIEZA whimpers]

25
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,791
[FRIEZA growls]

26
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,041
Bah! Super Saiyan.

27
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:37,333
So, out of that whole barrel of
monkeys, one finally made good.

28
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,583
[FRIEZA chuckles]

29
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,750
[FRIEZA] Vegeta...

30
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,833
He was sure that
he was the one.

31
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:46,041
Ha, ha! When he was a boy, that
legend was his only comfort.

32
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,958
He tried so hard and failed.

33
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,458
What a dope!

34
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,750
He thought he was a jewel,
but he was just a dirt clod.

35
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,000
[GOHAN] Hmm...

36
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,250
[GOHAN thinking] Gosh,
what a battle!

37
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,708
Krillin, where are you?

38
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,958
We made it so far together...

39
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,541
I can't believe that
you're not with me now...

40
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,375
We were so close!

41
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:38,041
[FRIEZA growls]

42
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,250
[FRIEZA] Huh...?

43
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,000
What?! No way!

44
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:57,166
[FRIEZA yells]

45
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,041
[FRIEZA growls]

46
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,875
Nooo!

47
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,750
[FRIEZA growls]

48
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,958
[FRIEZA thinking] This can't be!

49
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,416
I am lord of the Universe!

50
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,833
How could his power rival mine?

51
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,208
By toying with him

52
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,708
I gave him the chance to
develop his power even more!

53
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,333
[FRIEZA growls]

54
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,416
[thinking] I should have
destroyed this scum

55
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,750
the moment I first
laid eyes on him!

56
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,916
[MELAKKA] Sir, all
check-point communications

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,125
from the Ginyu Force
have stopped!

58
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,333
And, Sir, Lord Frieza's
scouter is still offline!

59
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:49,166
I can't even get a reading
of their power levels!

60
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,500
That means... That
means it's possible

61
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,250
that they've all been
destoyed somehow!

62
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,791
[SOLDIER] Well,
I say good riddance!

63
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:56,708
[gasping]

64
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,000
That's right! You heard me!

65
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,666
What?! Are you crazy?!

66
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,416
[SOLDIER] Frieza
destroyed my entire race,

67
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,625
so let him get
what's coming to him!

68
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,541
[SOLDIER screams]

69
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,333
You...

70
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,333
...idiots!

71
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,916
Live as slaves if you want to!

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,250
[CUI] No one double-crosses
Frieza and lives!

73
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,916
[SOLDIER screams]

74
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,208
[CUI] Take note men, of
what happens to someone

75
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,333
who decides to oppose Frieza!

76
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,833
[MELAKKA] B-But he was
one of your own kind!

77
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,750
That man? My own kind?

78
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,291
Yes, he was!

79
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,166
[CUI] Listen!

80
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,458
Don't you men get it?!

81
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,250
There are no individual
races anymore!

82
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,791
There are only
two kinds of people now:

83
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,541
Those who obey Frieza...
And those who disobey him!

84
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,375
And they never live very long!

85
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,375
So which kind
of people are we?!

86
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,208
Do we support Frieza?

87
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,750
Good! It's
better than dying!

88
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,958
Take my word!

89
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,375
Now, get back
to work, you bums!

90
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,666
[beeping]

91
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,875
[BLUE] There we go!

92
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,291
Picking up a power level
reading from Namek!

93
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,833
Isolated!

94
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,125
Wow, it's him! Frieza!

95
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,041
It's huge!

96
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,791
I'll say! It's
off the scale!

97
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:19,500
[CUI laughs]

98
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,750
Excellent!

99
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,708
It looks like the boss
is turning up the heat!

100
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,416
Huh?!

101
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,583
What's that?

102
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,666
There's one more,
and it's huge, too!

103
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,750
How big?!

104
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,458
It seems equal in
measure. No, wait!

105
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,666
It's actually a little bigger!

106
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,083
[BLUE] Here we go, sir!

107
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,041
Isolating signal right now!

108
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,125
[MELAKKA] Unbelievable!

109
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,916
[BLUE] Complete system overload!

110
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,375
[grunting]

111
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,916
[SOLDIER 2]
Let's get out of here!

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,833
[SOLDIERS screaming]

113
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,958
[MELAKKA] Commander,
she's going to blow!

114
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:58,500
[screaming]

115

[FRIEZA growls]

116
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,083
It's over.

117
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,625
You're finished.

118
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,500
[FRIEZA gasps]

119
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,750
[FRIEZA] How dare you?

120
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:27,875
Me?

121
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,375
Finished?

122
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,416
No one says that to me!

123
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,000
I reign supreme over all!

124
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,166
[FRIEZA growls]

125
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,958
[GOKU] Ka... Me... 

126
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,416
Ha...

127
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:05,208
[FRIEZA growls]

00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,041

[FRIEZA growls]

130
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,625
[GOHAN] There it is!

131
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,500
Dad's spaceship!

132
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,125
It looks okay!

133
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,250
Hang on, Piccolo!

134
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,708
We're going home!

135
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,083
[DR. BRIEF hums]

136
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,541
[CHICHI] You sure have
been up here a long time.

137
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,666
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

138
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,166
[DR. BRIEF] My dear,
in this line of work,

139
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,083
patience is a virtue!

140
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,250
[DR. BRIEF yells]

141
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,833
Who said being a
scientist isn't dangerous!

142
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,458
Just look at the swelling!

143
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,083
[CHICHI growls]

[SCRATCH] Meow!

146
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,583
[DR. BRIEF] Hm?!

147
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,250
Somebody has triggered the
floor sensor in Goku's ship.

148
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:30,916
[CHICHI] Huh?!

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,291
Oh my goodness!

150
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,541
Who do you think it is?

151
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,833
Well, there's only one
way to know for sure...

152
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,208
Now...

153
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,375
Let's hope this works!

154
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,541
[CHICHI] Is that Gohan?

155
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,666
It really is him!

156
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,666
Gosh, it's bad!

157
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,250
Gotta focus; there's
no time to waste!

158
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,333
Huh?

159
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,625
My baby!

160
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,916
[GOHAN] Mom?!

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,583
Is that you?!

162
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,750
Gohan, I can't believe it!

163
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,708
It's really you!

164
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,083
You're still alive!

165
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,250
[ROSHI] Ask him
about the others!

166
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,375
Are they okay?!

167
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,875
Krillin's gone...

168
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,708
Krillin?! He's gone?!

169
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,166
How dare you!

170
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,625
Gohan! What's going on?!

171
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,000
Is the fight over?!

172
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:25,208
No, Dad told us to take off
while he handles Frieza.

173
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,000
Frieza got Krillin...

174
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,750
He's gone now...

175
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,208
[ROSHI] Is Goku winning?

176
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know.
And I'm sorry,

177
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,250
but I don't have time to answer
any more questions right now!

178
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,583
[CHICHI] Where are
your manners, Gohan?

179
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,041
This is your mother speaking!

180
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,000
[CHICHI] Gohan, wait!

181
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,916
You come back here this instant!

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,833
Alright then, you're grounded!

183
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,333
Do you hear me, Gohan?!

184
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,333
Hey, just what do you
think you're doing, Gohan?!

185
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,458
Get back here right now!

186
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,791
I'd destroy us both
before I let you live.

187
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:13,541
Either way, you'll never
make it out of here alive!

188
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,583
We'll see about that.

189
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:36,583
Guess what?

190
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,208
I just had a brilliant idea.

191
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,541
I've figured out
how to beat you!

192
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,791
Hmm?

193
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,333
Your power is amazing

194
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,250
but there's more to
winning than that!

195
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,583
Sometimes it's the smartest
one who wins, not the strongest!

196
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:53,416
[FRIEZA laughs]

[GOKU gasps]

198
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,875
Now, say
goodbye to Namek!

199
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,333
[GOKU yells]

200
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,666
Die, planet! Die!

201
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,708
Say goodbye to Namek!

202
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,416
Can't stop it!

203
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,125

[FRIEZA yells]

207
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,083
[CHICHI] What's happening?!
What's that light?!

208
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,250
It looks like the
planet is exploding!

209
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,166
[DR. BRIEF] Unbelievable!

210
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,916
It can't be!

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,375
[ALL scream]

212
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,250
Gosh! Oh, no... No!

213
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,166
I don't want to die!

214
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,708
[BULMA screams]

215
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,416

[GOHAN grunting]

217
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,708
[GOHAN] Whoa!

218
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,500
Dad, hang on!

219
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,875
[KING KAI] Huh...?!

220
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,333
[KING KAI] Oh, my! Dear me!

221
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,000
[CHIAOTZU] What's
the matter, King Kai?

222
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,166
What happened?

223
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,500
[KING KAI] I'm afraid
it's bad, guys...

224
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,416
What?!

225
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,250
Tell us, please!

226
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,333
[KING KAI] Goku was
doing well, extremely well!

227
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,166
But now he's finished...

228
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,916
It's all over...

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,208
Huh?

230
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,500
What?! No way!

231
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,625
It looks like Frieza
won this one, my friends.

232
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,458
Goku had Frieza
against the ropes!

233
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,791
With his new power, Goku had
Frieza totally outclassed

234
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,708
in strength
and speed!

235
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,833
Then how?!

236
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,125
What went wrong?!

237
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,000
M-Maybe Goku's
still okay!

238
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,333
No, I wish that were
possible, Chiaotzu...

239
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,916
Frieza got desperate.

240
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,416
He was losing the battle.

241
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,291
So he used his trump card.

242
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:13,625
He couldn't beat Goku,
so he destroyed Namek!

243
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,250
Destroyed Namek...?

244
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,833
But then... That means...

245
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,541
That means that there was
no longer any atmosphere

246
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,708
or air for them to breath!

247
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,666
I'm afraid it's all over...

248
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,916
[CHIAOTZU gasps]

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Gosh! Goodness...

250
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:36,333
[YAMCHA] But what about Gohan?
And Piccolo?! And Bulma...?

251
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,791
[KING KAI] All gone,
I'm afraid...

252
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,541
[TIEN] It looks like we'll
be sticking around for a while.

253
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,958
[KAME] King Kai!
Can you hear me?

254
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,208
This is Kame.

255
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,708
Kame? Oh!

256
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,708
Yeah, sure. How's
the weather there?

257
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,958
[KAME] Uh, yes, the weather
happens to be very pleasant

258
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,916
right now, King Kai.
But we have other concerns.

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,291
Do you remember my
trusty assistant Mr. Popo?

260
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,375
Short guy?

261
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,916
[KAME] Yes, that's him.

262
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,166
Well he's been searching
for the Dragon Balls

263
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,500
and he's doing very
well, bless him.

264
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,000
He already has five of them!

265
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,541
[KING KAI] Hmm...?

266
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,500
Kame... exactly
where are you?

267
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,291
[KAME] Why, I'm
on Earth, of course.

268
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,250
Hey..

269
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,291
That means... Huh?!

270
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,916
Hey! That means that...
you're still alive, Kame!

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,416
[KAME] Huh...? Why, yes, I do
have a little indigestion

272
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,000
but I don't think it's
anything that serious.

273
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,833
[KING KAI] Do you know
what this means, Kame?!

274
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,541
Piccolo must still be alive!

275
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,625
Huh?

276
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,583
Yes, I couldn't be
here if he wasn't.

277
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,750
But you know that better than
anyone, don't you, King Kai?

278
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,291
Well, guys,
Piccolo's alive!

279
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,541
Really?!

280

[CHIAOTZU &amp; YAMCHA gasp]

281
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,083
[KAME] King Kai,
are you still there?

282
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,750
This is Kame.

283
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,291
Hello, is anyone home? H-Hello?

284
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,708
Hey! Be quiet, will ya?!

This is great! Just great!

[BULMA grunts]

290
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,791
[BULMA] No way...

291
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,458
I'm not giving up now..

292
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,291
I've come too far!

293
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,791
Rrrgh!

294
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,041
Whew...!

[BULMA] Guys, where are you?!

[thinking] You can do it, Dad!

297
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,041
I know you can!

298
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,958
It looks like we're going
into overtime, you guys!

299
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,291
Goku is fine!

300
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,000
And so are Gohan,
Piccolo, and Bulma!

301
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,250
We're back in the saddle!

Yes! We can
still do it!

[CHIAOTZU &amp; TIEN cheer]

305
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:06,958
Darn.

306
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,375
I held back too much power.

307
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,291
So, you couldn't do it.

308
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,458
You couldn't go through
with it after all, huh?

309
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,916
Hmm?

310
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,500
I don't blame you.

311
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,333
Destroying both of
us to make sure

312
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,458
that I don't win isn't
any way to fight.

313
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,958
It's just another
way of giving up.

314
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,000
You still don't
get it, do you?

315
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,000
[FRIEZA chuckles]

316
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,666
[FRIEZA] I didn't plan
on destroying myself,

317
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,208
just you and the planet!

318
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,458
[GOKU] Hm?

319
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,041
[FRIEZA] I can breathe
in space and you can't.

320
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,083
That means if the planet goes

321
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,708
then you won't have
any more air to live on.

322
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,250
And I shall be victorious!

323
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,458
Five minutes.

324
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,166
That's how
long you have.

325
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,791
This planet is
still going to blow;

326
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,208
the core has been
completely disintigrated.

327
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,833
Hmph.

328
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,791
Five minutes
is all that I need!

329
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,791
It won't take that
long to beat you

330
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,541
and leave with my
friends on my spaceship.

331
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,541
You underestimate me.

332
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,125
The true depth of
my power escapes you.

333
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,291
Well, it's time
that you experience

334
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,958
the ultimate Frieza!

335
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes, a very rare
occurrence indeed.

336
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,583
One hundred percent
of my true power!

337
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,916
You never really had
a chance to beat me!

338
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,583
It's over!

339
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,750
Can your body handle the
stress from all that power?

340
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,833
Well, I don't
think that it can!

341
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,916
In any case, I'm not going
to give you the time

342
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,833
you need to power up!

343
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,416
[GOKU growls]

344
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,583
This battle
ends right now!

345
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,666
[NARRATOR] In just
a few minutes time,

346
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,750
Planet Namek is
going to explode!

347
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,583
[NARRATOR] Hurry up, Gohan!

348
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:38,083
There's no time to lose.

349
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:42,000
You've got to find Bulma and
bring her back to the ship.

350
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,083
That's right.

351
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,375
Keep a keen lookout, guys.

352
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,625
The decisive moment
has finally arrived

353
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,708
on next
exciting episode...

354
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,291
of Dragon Ball Z!
