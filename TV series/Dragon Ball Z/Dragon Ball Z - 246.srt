[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,250
Babidi and Majin Buu set their
wicked sights on West City,

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,541
and forced
Goku to put his

4
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,750
plans for fusion
training on hold!

5
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,041
[BULMA]
Listen, if we let Majin Buu

6
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,875
get to the West City
and destroy it,

7
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,583
then he'll destroy
the Dragon Radar, Goku!

8
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,666
[gasps]

9
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,833
[GOKU]
Yeah, that does pose a problem.

10
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:36,208
Trunks, listen up. I need
you to go to Capsule Corp

11
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,666
and bring back the radar.

12
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,958
Huh?

13
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,125
[GOKU]
While you do that,

14
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,833
I'll get in front
of Babidi and Majin Buu

15
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,708
and try to slow them down.

16
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,500
Are you sure about that?

17
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,458
Those guys are
pretty tough, you know.

18
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,083
They're going
to wanna fight back.

19
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:55,166
Yeah, but you let me worry
about them. I'll be okay.

20
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,166
Now, hurry up before
they get ahead of you.

21
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,583
[NARRATOR]
With not a moment to spare,

22
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,166
Trunks raced toward Capsule
Corp at Super Saiyan speed

23
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,125
while Goku put the brakes
on his adversary's advance.

24
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,375
[GOKU]
Hi.

25
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,541
[NARRATOR]
Goku didn't waste any time.

26
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,625
[GOKU]
Here we go!

27
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,208
[yells]

28
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,041
[NARRATOR] The mighty warrior
quickly gathered his strength

29
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,333
to give Majin Buu and
Babidi a lesson in power

30
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,125
they would not soon forget.

31
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,458
[GOKU] And this is what is
known as a Super Saiyan

32
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,166
that has ascended
beyond a Super Saiyan.

33
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,708
[NARRATION] But the
demonstration didn't end there.

34
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,166
[GOKU]
And this...

35
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,375
[NARRATOR]
With a deafening roar,

36
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,083
Goku concentrated his energy

37
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,208
for the transformation
of is life!

38
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,333
Tapping into hidden depths
of his Saiyan powers

39
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,041
that had long lain dormant.

40
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,208

[gasps]

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,166
[NARRATOR] The end result of
this spectacular transformation?

44
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,291
Goku had ascended once again,

45
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,333
achieving an unprecedented
new level of power--

46
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,750
Super Saiyan 3!

47
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,875
[BABIDI whimpers]

48
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,708
Buu!

49
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,625
[NARRATOR] With his newly
energized strength and speed,

50
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,708
Goku launched a dizzying attack

51
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,375
that reduced Majin Buu to
a pudgy pink punching bag.

52
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,291
But after every blow
the Saiyan delivered,

53
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,791
Buu bounced back for more!

54
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,416
How much longer
can Goku hold off

55
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,958
this seemingly
unstoppable monster?

56
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,208

[PEOPLE gasping, whimpering]

64
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,166
If they keep this up,
they'll destroy our town!

65
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,541
The town? They'll
destroy the whole planet!

66
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,791
Keep it up, Goku!

67
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,666
My dad's stronger than ever!

68
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,333
This is getting dangerous.

69
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,000
Goku may be more
powerful than ever before,

70
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,208
but the harder he fights,

71
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,416
the more Majin Buu's
strength increases!

72
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,041
There seems to be no end to it!

Get outta there!

He'll be alright, Goku's been
in tighter spots than this.

[DR. BRIEF] Okay, now what
was I looking for again?

What do you two fellows say
we take a little snack break?

Don't you get it?!
We can't stop looking!

104
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,708
Majin Buu will destroy West City
along with the Dragon Radar

105
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,833
and without that we won't
be able to bring back

00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,125
any of the people he's killed,

107
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,625
so we have to keep
it in high gear!

What'd ya say, Bulma?

143
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,416
I'm saying that
Trunks is looking

144
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,291
in the wrong place
for the Dragon Radar!

slipped my mind,

for the Dragon Balls earlier,

Oh yeah, I know,
but in situations like this

it's really hard for me.

Oh, I just crumble
under pressure!

154

We have to get in touch
with Trunks immediately.

a phone and call him.

to lure those three other rats

enough to beat the two of us!

only going to fight one of you

do nothing but bark orders.

I am giving you an order!

323
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,875
I am not going to
tell you again, okay!?

324
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,458
You start moving
and you find him!

325
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,583
[BABIDI] Fine, you want
to act like a child?!

326
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,166
Then I'll treat
you like a child!

327
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,416
You have until the
count of three! One, two...

328
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,333
Mister Babidi?

329
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,750
Wha... What is it?

330
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,458
Buu have a better idea.

331
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,333
You're actually
having an idea?

332
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,166
Doesn't that sound
like a great trick?

333
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,416
Okay, then.

334
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,166
Why don't you tell me
what you've come up with

335
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,166
in that walnut-sized
brain of yours?

336
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,625
Buu have a great idea.

337
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,166
You said that already!

338
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,916
Just cough it up so we can
get on with the serious stuff.

339
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,166
Ooohh...

340
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,625
[giggles]

341
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,583
[BABIDI rasps]

342
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,958
[laughs]

343
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:02,333
[BABIDI grunts]

344
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,333
Now you no talk.

345
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,833
Now no more can say words
to seal Buu back up in ball.

346
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,041
No, no, no!

347
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:14,125
[BABIDI rasps]

348
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,666
Daddy? Daddy!

349
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,833
Goku.

350
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,208
[GOTEN] You're back!
You were great, Dad!

351
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,708
[PICCOLO]
How are you feeling, Goku?

352
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,166
Fine!

353
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,250
Trunks found the Dragon Radar
and is on his way back!

354
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,333
So we've avoided
one catastrophe, I guess.

355
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:44,625
Yes, I know. Now, even if Majin
Buu does destroy West City,

356
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,500
we'll be able to
undo all of his damage.

357
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,375
And not only that...

358
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,875
We'll be able to wish back
all of the innocent people

359
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,416
Buu and Babidi killed today.
Every single one of them.

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,791
[BABIDI grunts]

361
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,458
You teach me lots
of good things

362
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:10,875
but Buu think it time
Babidi go bye-bye-bye.

363
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:15,541
[BABIDI whimpers]

364
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,291
[giggles]

365
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,041
Bye-bye!

366
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:30,666
[whimpers]

367
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,125
[BUU]
Aaahhh...

368
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,208
[NARRATOR] Now that Babidi is
permanently out of the picture,

369
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,625
Majin Buu is free
to do his own bidding.

370
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,250
But will he continue down
the destructive path

371
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,333
that Babidi has set for him?

372
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,000
And if he does,

373
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,083
is there anyone left
who can stop him?
