00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,958
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,000
warriors from around the
universe came to celebrate

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:23,250
King Kai's death in the only
way they knew how-- by fighting.

4
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,666
Deep within the Grand
Kai's palace, in a room

5
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,250
the size of a
small solar system,

6
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,625
preparations for the Other
World Tournament were made.

7
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,666
[NARRATOR] Four fighters from
each quadrant were allowed

8
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,458
to participate, and the winner's
prize was said to be enormous:

9
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,875
A private lesson from
the Grand Kai himself!

10
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,083
[NARRATOR] So, with a
crash of the Grand Kai's gong,

11
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,958
the competition got off
to a lightning-speed start,

12
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:59,000
until Goku's competitor Caterpy
took an unexpected time out.

13
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,125
[MUSHROOM MC] Pardon me,
South Kai...

14
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,583
But may I just ask you
how much time

15
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:09,041
this metamorphosis
of his will take?

16
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,500
[SOUTH KAI coughs]

17
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,500
I'd say in the neighborhood
of twelve hundred years...

18
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,833
[NARRATOR] But Goku
couldn't wait that long!

19
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,666
[GRAND KAI] Yeah...
Well, neither can I.

20
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,291
So Goku wins this
round by default!

21
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,833
[NARRATOR] The first match
has been fought and won,

22
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,958
but it's far from over yet.

23
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,166
Now brace yourself, Goku!

24
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,750
It's time for the second round!

25
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:54,375
Wow! I don't know about you
guys but I haven't seen

26
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,500
such competition since
I was just a toadstool!

27
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:02,958
Now let's have a big hand for
our eight advancing contenders!

28
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,791
Fighting for the
South Quadrant...

29
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,625
the amazing Torbie and Froug!

30
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,166
[CROWD cheers]

31
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,666
[MUSHROOM MC]
And in this corner,

32
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,583
pride of the East Quadrant,
the flipper-of-fins Arqua!

33
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,375
[CROWD cheers]

34
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,791
[MUSHROOM MC] From the
North Quadrant...

35
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:25,375
We have the new sensation Goku
and the heroic Olibu!

36
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,541
And finally, the West Kai's
stellar dream team!

37
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,875
Maraikoh...

38
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:31,791
Tapkar...

39
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,875
and Pikkon!

40
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:38,916
[CROWD cheers]

41
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,000
[WEST KAI laughs]

42
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,291
Hey! Three of my
fighters advanced!

43
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,541
I'm incredible!

44
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,125
[KING KAI] Yes, West Kai...

45
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,250
Incredibly lucky!

46
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,208
[WEST KAI] I dare you
to say that again!

47
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,416
Lucky!

48
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,666
[WEST KAI] Oh! You're
brain's slower than

49
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,208
South Kai's fighters!

50
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,916
[SOUTH KAI] Guys!
Guys! Let's not argue!

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,791
Let's make fun of East Kai.
She only has one fighter!

52
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,250
[EAST KAI] Quiet!

53
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,208
I only need one of my
fighters to beat you dummies!

54
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,666
[WEST KAI] You want to
try saying that again

55
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,875
without spitting in my ear?

56
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,916
[MUSHROOM MC] And now the
start of the Quarter Finals!

57
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,166
[MUSHROOM MC]
First in the ring!

58
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,166
Torbie from the
South Quadrant.

59
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,416
And Tapkar from the West!

60
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,583
Torbie! Kick that little boy
back to his own galaxy!

61
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,166
[WEST KAI laughs]

62
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,833
South Kai, I sure hope you're
ready to eat your words!

63
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:37,958
[SOUTH KAI] Hmph!

64
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,958
Tapkar! Show them your footwork!

Ah... Oh, wow!

72
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,083
He's so fast, my eyes
can't keep up with him!

73
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,208
[WEST KAI laughs]

74
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,625
This... is bad...

[TORBIE stammers]

91
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,833
That ring is just
designed for big people.

92
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:35,000
It's biased against
small guys like Tapkar.

93
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,125
You're such a sore loser!

94
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,041
[MUSHROOM MC] Next match!
Froug versus Maraikoh!

[MARAIKOH laughs]

98
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,416
You think being bigger
than me is funny, huh?

[MARAIKOH growls]

100

[MARAIKOH] Hmm?

You stopped laughing!

102
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,833
Guess it's not so funny
when you're the small one!

[FROUG laughs]

104
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:40,375
[MUSHROOM MC] Froug continues to
swell up to unbelievable size!

105
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,583
But what does he plan to
do with this odd ability?

106
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,875
Oh, wow...

107
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,958
This sure is some
wacky competition.

108
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,541
Kinda like a circus...

[FROUG laughs]

110
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,208
[FROUG] That's right...
Keep sliding back...

111
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,458
And before long, there'll
be nowhere to slide back to

112
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,416
except "out of the ring".

My oh my!

114
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,208
With Froug's expanding gullet,
he's giving new meaning

115

to the phrase "this ring's not
big enough for the both of us."
