Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,541
Goku was fully recovered and
was finally ready for action.

3
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,125
ChiChi could only
stand by helplessly

4
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,791
and wonder if she would ever
see her precious Goku again.

5
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,958
Saving the world is a tough job,
but somebody's got to do it.

6
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,083
Piccolo wasn't wasting
any time doing his part.

7
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,916
Marvelously strong after
being reuniting with Kami,

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,333
the Super Namek found
himself at the forefront

9
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,291
of the battle
against the androids.

[NARRATOR]
Amazingly enough,

13
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,375
a much greater threat
than the androids

14
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,750
was lurking in a city nearby.

15
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:01,000
Ah, yes, perfect! Piccolo
must be fighting Android 17,

16
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,583

This is going to be
far less difficult

20
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,958
[NARRATOR] It seems that Cell
is not far from absorbing

21

Androids 17 and 18 and
completing his evolution!

carrying out his deadly mission?

nothing to do with you.

It's Goku that we're after.

28

Terminating your life is not
something that we wish to do.

have no interest in killing you.

Why don't you just
tell us where Goku is

32
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,750
and then leave, unharmed.

33
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,916
It's the only
logical thing to do.

Well, soon you'll realize

they've rubbed off on me.

Now, how's that sound?

you're not boring.

[blows landing,

00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,416
How rude.

160
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,833
[YAMCHA] Piccolo's on the
move again, isn't he?

161
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,958
[TIEN] Yeah! Definitely!

162
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,791
It feels like Cell
is hot on their trail!

163
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,750
You know it! That hideous
monster isn't wasting any time!

164
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,208
He wants to absorb
those two androids!

165
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,750
And, the thing is, Piccolo's
leading him right to them!

166
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,208
Man!

167
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:38,041
[CHICHI] Hey! Telephone, guys!
Collect call! It's Bulma!

168
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,166
[YAMCHA] Don't accept.

169
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,791
Oh, come on, guys.
It's urgent!

170
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,875
She's figured out a way
to disable the androids!

171
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:43,666
What?

172
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,708
[ALL] Accept the charges!

173
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,500
I heard all that!

174
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,500
Well, I guess I'll still
let you guys use the remote

175
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,083
I invented that disables
the androids' circuits!

176
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:57,083
But only if Mister Loud-Mouth
Don't-Accept-the-Charges Yamcha

177
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,500
agrees to give
yours truly a foot massage!

178
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,958
[KRILLIN] Gosh,
I don't know, Bulma!

179
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,458
Well, that's the deal! So!
You can take it or leave it!

180
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,166
She knows that I can't
stand rubbing her feet!

181
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,333
Hey! You've got a deal!

182
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,250
But we're running
out of time, Bulma!

183
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,916
Piccolo's already
fighting the androids,

184
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,083
and Cell is on
his way to the battlefield!

185
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,875
[BULMA] Right! I'm on my way!

186
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,541
That's great! If we
can destroy the androids,

187
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,750
then there's no way that Cell
can complete his evolution!

188
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,500
[YAMCHA] Ha! Leave it to
Bulma to figure out

189
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,000
how to get rid of the most
powerful fighters in the world

190
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,416
with the push of a button!

191
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,666
[TIEN] Yeah!

192
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,541
[YAMCHA] I'm telling you, bro.

193
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,500
[KRILLIN thinking] It
happened so fast!

194
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:42,458
But it seemed to
last forever! Wow...

195
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,833
What's wrong?

196
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:48,666
[KRILLIN] Uh, wrong?
Nothing's wrong! Why?

197
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,208
[BULMA] Guys, I'm leaving Trunks
here! This is an emergency! Hey!

198
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:57,250
Think again! No way! You
hear that? That's an emergency!

199
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,875
You're the one who
made him cry, you dope!

200
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,791
Now let go!

201
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,875
Whoa! Daddy!
It's Cell! Isn't it?

202
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,583
He's heading
for Piccolo, isn't he?

203
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,916
[GOKU] Yes, Son! I'm afraid so!

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,041
And... Son, I know how you feel.

205
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,000
I'd much rather it be
me down there than Piccolo.

206
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,833
[GOKU] Come on, Vegeta!
Please! Hurry!

207
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,458
Out of all the
battles I've been in

208
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,375
this is the hardest thing
that I've ever done by far...

You recognize me, don't you?

Thank you for
bringing 17 and 18 here!

and complete his
dreadful evolution!

Does Android 16,
the silent giant,

263
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,541
have the power to stop him?

264

And why is Piccolo the
only one sweating bullets?

265
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,833
Don't the androids
realize who Cell is

and what he intends to do?
