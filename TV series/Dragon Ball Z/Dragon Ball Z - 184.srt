00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,625
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,583
Cell became obsessed
with a new goal.

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,583
Having learned of Gohan's
incredible dormant power,

4
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,208
he was now determined
to bring it out.

5
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,458
[NARRATOR] It was a painful
process of trial and error,

6
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,583
as the mighty Cell made
several varied attempts.

7
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,000
[CELL laughs]

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,416
[NARRATOR] Trapping Gohan
in a powerful death lock,

9
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,083
Cell tried to
lure the boy's power

10
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,333
with a heavy treatment of pain.

11
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,750
[CELL] Do it!

12
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,958
[NARRATOR] Goku had been
confident of his son's ability

13
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,083
ever since they stepped out of
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

14
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,083
But as the Saiyan hero
watched his son

15
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,875
being tortured on
the battlefield,

16
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,125
he realized
he had made a mistake.

17
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,583
He would have to step
in and stop Cell himself.

18
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,791
[NARRATOR] But beating
Goku to the punch

19
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,208
was the silent giant Android 16,

20
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,125
whose attempt to stop
Cell was quickly shattered.

21
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,708
along with his metal body.

22
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,666
And seeing Gohan's reaction
to the android's death

23
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,708
gave Cell a new strategy.

24
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:23,958
[CELL] So, Gohan, we still
haven't gotten you mad.

25
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,041
Let's try some
friendly persuasion.

26
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,666
[NARRATOR] And then the
unthinkable happened.

27
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,583
Cell spawned
from his tail

28
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,500
seven miniature
versions of himself

29
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,541
to attack the Z Fighters.

30
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,875
With the hopes that
watching his friends in pain

31
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,250
would cause Gohan to
unleash his hidden strength.

32
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,041
[CELL] Now, my dear children.

33
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,666
Those seven on the
cliff are your enemies!

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,333
Give them pain.

35
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,000
Kill them if it makes you happy!

36
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,458

37
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,250
Hop to it!

38
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,166
[NARRATOR] How will Goku
and the others

39
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,166
fair against these
frightening creatures?

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,541
Will this be the key to
triggering Gohan's power?

You do not like to hurt.

327
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,875
I know because I too
have learned these feelings.

328
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:21,500
But it is because you cherish
life that you must protect it.

329
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,250
Uegh!

330
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,833
This sentimental
downpour is killing me!

331
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,041
It's so nice of
you to help, 16.

332
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,916
But I plan on doing this my way.

333
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,791
Please, drop your restraints.
Protect the life I loved.

334
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,500
You have the strength.
My scanners sensed it.

335
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,541
Just let it go.

336
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,208
[GOHAN gasps]

337
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:04,125
[circuit buzzes]

338
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,166
[GOHAN whimpers]

339
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,875
Yet another fighter
you could have saved!

340
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,291
[thinking] 16, you loved
life.

341
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,500
You gave everything
up to save it.

342
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:32,875
And you were just an
android... I let you die!

343
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,958
I can't do that...
I won't watch any more!

344
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,041
I-I feel it slipping!

345
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,458
[GOHAN thinking] And I
won't watch this anymore!

346
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:51,958
[GOKU screams]

347
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:57,458
[screaming continues]

348
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,666
[BOTH gasp]

349
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,458
[gasping]

350
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,375
Gohan...!

351
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,875
[NARRATOR] It is a secret
we have known before

352
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,500
Gohan could even
form words in his mouth.

353
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:24,083
Through fights with Raditz,
Garlic Jr., the Ginyu Force,

354
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,625
and even Frieza,

355
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,958
we've caught glimpses of
the child's explosive power.

356
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,416
But like an explosion,

357
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,750
it always vanished
with the moment.

358
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:36,083
It couldn't be
controlled, until now.

359
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,916
At last, the beastly
power has been harnessed.

360
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,208
Gohan has awoken.

361
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,833
Now Cell will battle a warrior

362
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,375
eleven years in the making.

363
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,333
On the next Dragon Ball Z!
