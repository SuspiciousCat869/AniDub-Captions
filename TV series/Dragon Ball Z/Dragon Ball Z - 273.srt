00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,500
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,541
Majin Buu restored Vegito
to his humanoid form

3
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:22,625
after a painful bout
with the calamitous candy!

4
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,875
[VEGITO]
Oh, it's me again!

5
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,208
[NARRATOR] But, big or small,
the pain remains the same

6
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,666
when dealing with the synthesis

7
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,958
of Super Saiyan legends!

8
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,333
[VEGITO] Is this how you
want it to end? Huh?

9
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,458
So much for the tough warrior!

10
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,000
[NARRATOR] When his last
desperate attempt failed,

11
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,291
it was time for
the final countdown!

12
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,000
Vegito had had enough!

13
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,500
[VEGITO] I'm going to
count to ten, Buu!

14
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,625
[NARRATOR] But rising like
dough in a hot oven

15
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,416
was a perfect
recipe for disaster!

16
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,750
[NARRATOR] Silently, it
stalked its prey and struck!

17
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,916
Consuming Vegito
in one swallow!

18
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,458
[NARRATOR] Had Majin Buu
done the impossible

19
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,125
and, against all odds,

20
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,916
toppled the greatest
fighter in the Universe?

21
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:37,166
[cackling]

22
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,583
You fool! Oh yeah!
Who's on top now?

23
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:49,750
Majin Buu! Me! You big
loud-mouthed jerk!

24
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:57,916
[laughs]

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,708
Yeah!

26
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,041
[KIBITO KAI]
I failed!

27
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:15,083
Despite all my power,
I failed! Sir,

28
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,666
I'm a disgrace to the Kai line!

29
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,833
[KIBITO KAI]
It's over! The Earth is doomed!

30
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,583
The entire physical Universe
is at the mercy of Majin Buu!

31
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,583
[OLD KAI]
Maybe. Maybe not!

32
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,833
[KIBITO KAI]
Huh?

33
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,333
Lookee! Notice
something strange?

34
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,125
[KIBITO KAI]
Hm? No!

35
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,375
Come now! Take a closer look!

36
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,708
In the past, when Majin
Buu absorbed his victims,

37
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,458
he mutated and took on some
of their characteristics!

38
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,625
Hey, you're right!

39
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,458
He looks exactly the
same as he did before!

40
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,333
But, but just
what does it mean?

41
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,833
[OLD KAI]
It means it's not over yet!

42
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,833
He's having trouble
digesting those two!

43
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,083
I have that problem
with Mexican food!

44
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,583
[SUPER BUU]
Yeah!

45

[SUPER BUU]
I should've saved some people!

53
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:10,750
It's not as fun without hearing
their ridiculous cries for help!

54
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,708
Whew.

55
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,000
I could've been killed!

56
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,625
[DENDE]
Mr. Satan, are you okay?

57
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,291
Okay?! Just what is there
to be okay about? Huh?

58
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:37,166
Well, it seemed as if Vegito was
going to win there for a while!

59
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,333
But now the future of the Earth
is in the hands of Majin Buu!

60
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,666
What are you talkin' about?

61

You're supposed to be
the Guardian of the Earth!

So come on and do somethin',

yours to beat 'im!

[DENDE]
Sorry! I would if I could!

00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,125
But it's beyond
my power to do that!

66
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,416
Now, put me down!

67
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,833
[MR. SATAN] What am
I doin'? I'm sorry, Dende!

72
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,958
Hit the deck!

73
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,791
[SUPER BUU] What a
beautiful place to destroy!

74
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,000
Except, I'm wondering...
Why haven't I changed?

75
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,708
Oh, well! That guy was
tougher than I thought!

76
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,708
He might take a while to digest!

77
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:45,958
But when he does,

78
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,791
my power will jump to a level

79
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,625
that will truly
be unsurpassable!

80
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,666
There will be no one left who
has the audacity to stop me!

81
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,208
Soon, I will be
the sole proprietor

82

of the entire Universe!

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,625
Give me a break! Ah, fruitcake!
It's bad enough to be in here!

87
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:11,208
But to have to endure that
ridiculous laughter of his...!

88
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,833
On the bright side,
the barrier did the trick!

89
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,208
He hasn't been able to
turn me into Buu goo!

90

Well, I'd better get busy!

91

Finding a way out of this
place won't be a picnic!

The others are still
in here somewhere!

I can feel it! But where?

[OLD KAI]
I don't believe it!

95

He actually got sucked in
on purpose! What a guy!

96
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:44,083
He wanted to rescue the others
before he annihilated Majin Buu!

He's fantastic!

I-I don't get it!

00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,791
Why did our bodies separate
when we let the barrier down?

How would I know?!

107
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,000
How bizarre!

108
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,458
I was told that once you
and I were joined together

109

by these earrings,
we could never separate!

Well then, I guess
we lucked out!

I'm me! And you're you, Kakarot!

And that's just the way
I like it! So, there!

Hey! What are you doing?
Put that back on!

114

fuse together again

as soon as we leave Buu's body!

we could blow our chance!

lost your mind?!

Now there's no way for
us to join bodies again!

124

Why do you have
to be like that?

125
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,166
Isn't it worth you and
I being stuck together

126

if we can beat Buu?

No! I perfer to be

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,166
Doesn't he eat
anything but sweets?

160
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, he's worse than a child!
This is revolting!

161
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,583
Not a singal bit
of meat at all!

162
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,583
Huh? Oh, wow!
What's that smoke?

163
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,125
Huh? Idiot!
You're being digested!

164
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,791
That smoke is coming from your
roasting carcass, you moron!

165
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,666
[yelps]

166
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,625
[GOKU]
Uh-oh! Do you hear that?

167
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,833
Great galaxy!
If I know my anatomy,

168
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,458
that leads strait
for the southern exit!

169
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,541
[GOKU]
Oh, ew...

170
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,083
[rumbling]

171
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,375
[VEGETA]
What are we going to do?

172
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,916
[GOKU] We're going to get
sucked into that hole!

173
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,166
[VEGETA] No, Kakarot! I mean,
how are we going to stop it?!

174
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,625
[VEGETA]
Huh?

175
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,958
Well, I think it's too late...

176
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,458
[GOKU]
Uh-oh!

177
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,625
Man! Some rescue
operation this is!

178
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,875
[VEGETA] I will not suffer the
same fate as cream filling!

179
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,916
[VEGETA, GOKU yelping]

180
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,041
[GOKU thinking]
Got to think of something fast!

181
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,125
We're out of time! Hm?

182
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,958
[GOKU muffled]
Mm? Vegeta!

183
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,291
[VEGETA grunts]

184
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:37,416
[SUPER BUU] Uhh! Indigestion!
Must've been the meat I ate!

185
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,958
Darn him!

186
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,708
Even going down,
he's a royal pain.

187
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,458
Soon, he'll be something
you wipe off your shoe!

188
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,208
[GOKU, VEGETA yell]

189
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,041
[GOKU, VEGETA yell]

190
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,458
Phew! That was close,

191
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,791
but I think you and I

192
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,541
might want to be a little
more discreet down here

193
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:23,125
so Majin Buu doesn't figure
out that we're still alive!

194
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,708
[VEGETA]
Oh! I see!

195
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,666
We should have just gone quietly
down that little hole like mice

196
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,500
and become part of
Majin Buu's excretions?!

197
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,208
Ha! No thanks, Kakarot!
I'm a true Saiyan!

198
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,625
I'm going out the front door!
Now let's get a move on!

199
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,500
The Earth is on a
short fuse right now!

200
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,500
[GOKU] I don't know how I ever
managed without you, Vegeta!

201
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,500
[GOKU]
I don't know how he does it!

202
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,625
You'd think that he
would just keel over

203
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,500
from eating this many sweets!

204
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,833
[VEGETA] Oh, you have no
room to talk, Kakarot!

205
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,416
Oh, I've seen you eat desert!

206
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,333
Ho! As bad as it seems,

207
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,083
I'd much rather be down here

208
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:15,208
than in your stomach after
one of your pig-out sessions!

209
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,416
[giggles] You're kidding!

210
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,416
[VEGETA]
No, I'm not! Huh?

211
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,750
What? What's wrong?

212
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,625
Quiet!

213
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,625
Listen! Do you hear that?

214
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,750
[rapidly pulsing beat]

215
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,875
Yes! What is it?

216
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,958
[VEGETA]
I don't know. But I don't

217
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,750
have a very good
feeling about this.

218
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,166
[GOKU]
Me either!

219
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,000
[VEGETA] What direction
is it coming from?

220
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,541
[GOKU] It seems to be
coming from every direction!

221
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,666
[VEGETA] Precisely! We're being
surrounded! But by what?

222
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:01,916
There!

223
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,125
[VEGETA]
Look out!

224
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:15,500
[GOKU] Hm... Hey there!
What's up, little guys!

225
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,708
Ow!

226
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,666
[VEGETA laughs]

227
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,791
Oh, he almost defeated
the great Kakarot!

228
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,291
[GOKU]
Get out!

229
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,166
Look! Voracious little
rascals, aren't they?

230
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,166
[VEGETA] Yes, they are.
Little savages, all right!

231
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,916
There's millions of them!
I mean... what are they?

232
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,458
That's what I was wondering.

233
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,000
Look at 'em go!

234
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,166
It's possible they roam
about breaking down any food

235
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,000
or whatnot that doesn't
make it into the intestines!

236
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,833
[GOKU] I think we fit into
that category, don't we?!

237
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,916
[VEGETA] Yes, but I doubt
they've ever tried to eat

238
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
a full-blooded Saiyan before!

239
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,791
[GOKU] It looks like
they're about to try!

240
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,083
[VEGETA] Well, you must have a
sweeter scent than me, Kakarot!

241
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,791
They obviously prefer you!

242
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,333
[GOKU]
Yeah! Gee! Aren't I lucky?

243
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,666
[GOKU] Vegeta? Uh... Since there
are about a million of them,

244
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,583
I don't suppose you would mind
lending me a hand, now would ya?

245
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:24,083
Who, me? Of course not!
I'm a team player!

246
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,875
Hey! Seriously!
This could get ugly!

247
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,791
[GOKU grunts]

248
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,708

Ugh! They're everywhere!

254
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,958
[VEGETA]
All right!

255
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,541
[VEGETA grunts]

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,333
[VEGETA yells]

257
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,208
What's he doing? He's going
to blow our cover!

258
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,333
That crazy--

259
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,875
[GOKU]
Ah! Little boogers!

260

00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,125
No, Kakarot!

262
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,708
What? What's that?

263
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,000
[screams]

264
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,333
[VEGETA]
It feels like an earthquake!

265
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,333
[GOKU]
Maybe he's having a, you know?

266
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,916
Huh?!

267
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,583
[VEGETA]
Look out!

268
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,416
[VEGETA]
Son of a Namek! What is it?

269
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,041
[GOKU]
I don't know!

270
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,833
[gasps]

271
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,375
[GOKU]
What in the world?!

274
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,958
Kakarot! It's the slime!

275
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,833
The creature is communicating
with it! Get rid of it! Quick!

276
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,958
I can't!

[NARRATOR]
As Goku struggles to get free,

281
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,958
the jaws of death are
about to close on him!

282
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,791
Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
