1
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,708
[GOKU yells]

2
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,958
Having spent the
last of his strength,

4
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,541
Goku was powerless to free
himself from the clutches

5
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,541
of Vegeta's
death-grip...

6
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,291
But help was
on the way!

7
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,875
It's just up ahead!

8
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,375
[NARRATOR] Gohan and Krillin
returned to the battlefield,

9
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,416
in the hopes of saving Goku
from this crushing defeat.

10
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,958
Goku's in pretty bad shape.
Come on! We have to move fast!

11
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,458
Put my dad down,
right now!

12
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,041
[NARRATOR] While Gohan
distracted the giant ape,

13
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,041
Krillin readied
a surprise attack!

14
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,666
Destructo Disk!

15
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,958
[NARRATOR] But despite
Krillin's heroic effort,

16
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,875
the blast intended to
slice off Vegeta's tail

17
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:01,666
and end his monstrous
transformation missed its mark.

18
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,208
Suddenly, an unexpected
hero burst onto the scene

19
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,166
with a surprise
attack of his own!

20
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,083
In one fell swoop,
Vegeta's tail was gone,

21
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,625
and so was his
grip on Goku!

22
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:17,458
[APE VEGETA groaning]

23
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,791
[NARRATOR] Now, as Vegeta
returns to normal once more,

24
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,041
his powers
drastically reduced,

25
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,708
Goku has one final plan
to defeat the evil Saiyan.

26
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,083
He has passed the
remaining energy

27
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,166
from the Spirit
Bomb to Krillin.

28
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,291
The question is, can
Krillin hit his target?

29
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,166
Another miss
spells disaster...

30
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,333
Today, on
Dragon Ball Z!

31
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,375
Rraaugh!

32
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:20,291
Clear your mind, Krillin.
Don't try to force it...

33
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,291
Let it flow
through you...

34
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:34,041
Wow, I did it!
Um... what did I do?

35
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,500
[GOKU] It's a Spirit Bomb.
King Kai taught me...

36
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:41,083
Listen, you
can do this..

37
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:46,833
I know you can...
But, you have to be careful.

38
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,666
We only get
one... one shot.

39
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,791
Right. Got it!
I promise... I'll do my best!

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,250
He's just
way too strong.

41
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,833
If my dad couldn't
beat him,

42
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,500
then how am I supposed to
do it? I'm just a kid!

43
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,458
[KRILLIN] All right... This
should be a good vantage point.

44
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,791
[thinking] It looks like
this brat's almost used up

45
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,291
all his energy...
Hah! He's mine.

46
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,333
[ROSHI]
This is amazing!

47
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,000
Gohan's running stride for
stride with that alien!

48
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,416
Gohan's going to
win! Isn't he, Dad?

49
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,708
Well, uh, you know,
it's possib--

50
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,625
Honey, I can't say
that for sure, but...

51
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,041
Let's yell!
It helps!

52
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,708
[OOLONG] Yeah!
C'mon, Gohan!

53
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,791
[ROSHI] C'mon, son!

54
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,750
Hey, ChiChi...

55
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,375
[CHICHI sobbing]

56
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,416
ChiChi...

57
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,833
[sobbing continues]

58
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,666
[OOLONG] Look!
They're at it again!

59
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,791
[BULMA]
They're moving so fast!

60
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,708
[CHICHI] What happened?
They disappeared!

61
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,750
You! Do your hocus-pocus!
Change the channel!

62
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,833
Whatever it takes to get
them back on, do it!

63
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:40,875
Do you hear me,
old woman?!

64
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,583
Oh... Oh...
My aching back.

65
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,875
What's gotten into you?
Put me down this instant!

66
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,041
You people are crazy,
that's all there is to it!

67
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,208
Alright now, let's
see what we can do!

68
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,125
Hoya, boya, boo!

69
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,958
Rrgh... Hraagh!

70
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,333
Masenko... HA!

71
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,125
Ha! That trick
again, huh?

72
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,791
One more!

73
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,166
Haa!

74
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:46,291
[GOHAN] Haah! Yaah!
Hyaah! Haah!

75
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,000
Man, how am I ever
gonna hit him?

76
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,333
He's moving
way too fast!

77
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,750
[KING KAI] Don't use your eyes
when throwing the Spirit Bomb!

78
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,708
Feel it out!
Trust in your senses!

79
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,416
You'll know when
the moment is right!

80
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,416
Hey! Who's there?

81
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,000
[KING KAI] I am the one
who trained Goku!

82
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,833
I taught him how to
use the Sprit Bomb!

83
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,208
Wow, it's King Kai!

84
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,833
[KING KAI] I did not expect
this turn of events,

85
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,625
but you are now in
control of the Spirit Bomb!

86
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,875
Remember, it
contains the hope

87
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,416
of every person
on your planet!

88
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,208
The fate of the entire planet
is resting in my hands! Whoa...

89
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,666
[VEGETA laughing]

90
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,375
I've got to
hand it to you,

91
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,958
your strength
is surprising!

92
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:45,208
Yes, you should be proud...
You fought well...

93
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:52,041
But, unfortunately for
you, it wasn't well enough.

94
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,666
[KRILLIN] Oh, man!
He's got his back turned!

95
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,916
Maybe I should
throw it now!

96
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,000
[thinking] No...

97
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,250
[thinking] King Kai said I'd
know when the moment was right!

98
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:16,708
[GOHAN whimpering]

99
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,125
It's time we put
an end to this.

100
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,041
Rraaaugh!

101
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:37,333
[VEGETA growling]

102
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,791
[GOHAN shouting]

103
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,375
[growling continues]

104
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,416
[shouting continues]

105
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,708
You can't
run forever!

106
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,791
[thinking] Damn!
Gohan's in trouble!

107
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,208
But, I can't throw
it yet... Not yet!

108
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,250
[VEGETA growling]

109
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,083
[GOHAN screaming]

110
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,916
[YAJIROBE thinking]
Krillin, you idiot!

111
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,791
That's some nice
energy you got there,

112
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,708
but you might as well
stand up and shout:

113
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,875
Here I am!

114
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,416
Doesn't anyone know
how to sneak around?

115
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,333
[VEGETA laughing]

116
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,875
I hope you're watching this,
Kakarot! Get a good look!

117
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,583
Because it's the last time
you're going to see your son!

118
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,666
That was it!

119
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,791
Krillin, what are you
waiting for you dope!

120
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,500
Just throw the darn
thing, will ya?

121
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,000
Here goes nothin'!

122
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,208
What... is that thing?!

123
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,416
C'mon, hit!

124
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,625
Ahh! I missed him!

125
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:35,583
[OOLONG] Look!

126
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,208
[ALL gasping]

127
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,750
[screaming]

128
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,666
My crystal ball's gone!
I think I'm going to be sick!

129
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,458
Ahh... but...
Gohan!

130
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,708
[KING KAI] Goku! Try a rebound!

131
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,416
[thinking] Gohan!
It's Dad! Can you hear me?

132
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,166
Huh?

133
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,708
[thinking]
Bounce it back, Gohan!

134
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:05,000
That ball won't hurt you if
there's no evil in your heart!

135
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,250
You have to
bounce it back!

136
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,166
No!

137
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,125
Huh?!

138
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,875
Ahh! No!

139
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,375

[VEGETA screaming]

142
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,416
[KING KAI] Oh, my...
I... I don't believe it...

143
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,083
They did it!

144
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,125
Yahoo!

145
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,875
Yeeaah!

146
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,791
Ha, ha, ha! Goku!
He did it! He did it!

147
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:40,708
[KRILLIN laughing]

148
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,583
Ahhh...

149
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,333
[BABA]
That's just great!

150
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,250
I come here to help
and look what happens!

151
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:02,083
Roshi... You don't have any
of that Turbo-glue, do you?

152
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:07,166
Turbo-glue? Wait... I must
have something you can use.

153
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,833
[CHICHI]
What about my Gohan?

154
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,791
Isn't there anything
you can do, Baba?

155
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,500
Don't you have
another crystal ball,

156
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,791
a spare one
or something?!

157
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,833
ChiChi, stop that!

158
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,666
But, Daddy, little
Gohan's still out there...

159
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,750
So is Goku!

160
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,958
I know that...

161
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,166
But, honey, there's
just nothing we can do

162
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,208
to help from here.

163
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,916
Well, in that case, I guess
we'll have to go to them!

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,166
Ah! You mean it?
But, how will we get there?

165
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,708
In the air boat!

166
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,750
Great idea, Bulma!
Thanks a lot!

167
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,458
You're welcome, ChiChi.
Now, we'd better get moving.

168
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,250
I'm not sure if there's
anything we can do to help,

169
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,666
but, at least it's better than
sitting here doing nothing!

170
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,083
All right,
I got some glue...

171
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,625
[KORIN] But is
it Turbo-Glue?

172
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,083
[ALL gasping]

173
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,791
It's...
It's Korin!

174
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,958
[KORIN chuckling]

175
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,208
[ROSHI] Good thing Ox
King decided not to come.

176
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,041
We'd never
have enough space!

177
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,625
[BULMA] Well, I'm just
glad I don't have to sit

178
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,125
next to that pig, Oolong...
He's such a coward.

179
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,833
[GOHAN] Dad... are you
going to be okay?

180
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,208
Yeah, but I'll probably
be sore for a while.

181
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,416
Well, I gotta admit, I have
seen you look better...

182
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,250
[GOKU] Maybe so. But it
could be a lot worse.

183
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,791
Yeah... You could
be that alien!

184
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,916
[ALL laughing]

185
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,375
Huh?

186
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,875
[GOHAN] What in
the world?

187
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,666
No! It can't be!

188
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,458
Hey, maybe now
he's harmless.

189
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,000
Heh... Now I can
claim my prize.

190
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,416
[KRILLIN] He looks
finished, alright...

191
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,458
I guess that blast
really did him in...

192
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,791
Good thing, cause he
was bad to the core.

193
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,000
At least now we won't
have to look at

194
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,333
his ugly
face any more...

195
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,625
Whose face
is ugly?!

196
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,125
[KRILLIN whimpering]

197
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,541
[GOHAN yells]

198
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,208
[GOKU gasps]

199
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,041
Aahh!

200
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,666
[KING KAI] Ah! The
Spirit Bomb didn't work!

201
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,875
No! I didn't
foresee this!

202
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,375
The Saiyan is tougher
than I ever imagined!

203
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,625
[VEGETA] I suppose you think
you're very clever, don't you?

204
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,083
Well here's a
piece of advice...

205
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,291
If you're going to shoot
someone in the back,

206
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,875
make sure and
finish them off!

207
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
It's going to be my
greatest pleasure

208
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,000
wiping you and your
worthless friends

209
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,541
off the face
of this planet.

210
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,916
[VEGETA] Raaugh!

211
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,541
How does it feel

212
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,458
knowing you had one chance
to save your precious Earth

213
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,708
and everyone on it,
only to fail miserably?

214
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,416
[VEGETA laughing]

215
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,666
Hey, come on now...
Keep it straight.

216
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,166
[BULMA]
Back seat driver!

217
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,291
Bulma! You could at least try
to show some manners here!

218
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,208
Don't you have any idea
who you're speaking to?

219
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:13,333
Hm? I dunno. He looks like
an ordinary house cat to me.

220
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,833
[coughs]

221
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,583
[ROSHI] Bulma!

222
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,500
This is it, Kakarot.
No more tricks. No more games.

223
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,083
No more chances for you
and your friends to escape.

224
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,208
[GOHAN whimpering]

225
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,708
I'm done
toying with you...

226
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,791
I'm going to do now
what I should have done

227
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,375
from the very beginning.

228
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm going to blast all of you
insolent pests into oblivion!

229
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,083
[GOHAN whimpering]

230
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:08,333
Run, Gohan... Run!

231
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,500
Goku...

232
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:20,041
[VEGETA growling]

233
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,541
[VEGETA yelling]

234
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,625
[VEGETA] This is pathetic!

235
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,791
How could I be
reduced to this?

236
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,000
[VEGETA] I don't have enough
energy to complete the attack!

237
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,500
They're still alive!

238
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:19,666
That last attack must have
damaged me more than I thought.

239
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,333
I need to end this...

240
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,583
Aaugh!

241
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,666
It... can't be!

242
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,208
He has... He has a tail!

243
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,166
Yeah, his tail...
I forgot about that.

244
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,208
It must have
grown back...

245
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,333
[VEGETA] The Blutz Waves!

246
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:25,291
I can't allow this brat
to transform! I can't!

247
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,000
[NARRATOR] What startling
new development is this?

248
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,958
Gohan's tail has
suddenly grown back,

249
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,750
and its appearance has
sent a wave of terror

250
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:36,041
through the otherwise
unshakeable Vegeta!

251
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,458
All eyes are on the
evil Saiyan warrior

252
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,041
as he towers over
the unconscious Gohan.

253
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,041
For with Vegeta's
next move,

254
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:46,166
the fate of the
world will be decided!

255
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,041
[NARRATOR] Tune in next time,
as the epic battle reaches

256
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,708
its Earth-shaking
conclusion...

257
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,875
on Dragon Ball Z!
