[ZARBON roars]

2
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,708
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z...

3
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,083
Vegeta and Zarbon
went head-to-head

4
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,625
in a no-holds-barred
battle to the finish,

5
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,833
where Vegeta proved
once and for all

6
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,916
that he had
the upper hand...

7
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,083
[VEGETA] Raah!

8
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,541
[VEGETA chuckles]

9
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,666
[NARRATOR] Krillin, realizing
that he was no match for Vegeta,

10
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,500
gave up the Dragon Ball
given to him by Guru...

11
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,125
[VEGETA] The last Dragon Ball
is finally in my possession!

12
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,291
Now, all that remains is
calling forth the Dragon!

13
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,125
Then I'll have my wish for
immortality and become the

14
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:55,791
Supreme Ruler of the Universe!
And Frieza will die!

15
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,583
[VEGETA laughs]

16
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,208
[thinking] I don't
think so, Vegeta...

17
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,500
You'll never get
to make that wish...

18
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,041
[NARRATOR] That's because Gohan

19
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,125
has recovered the
last Dragon Ball,

20
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,041
but will he make it back
before Vegeta finds him?

21
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,833
Find out today!

22
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,000
[BULMA] How could you hand
it over so easily, Krillin?

23
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,166
You heard him!

24
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,541
He said that's
the last one!

25
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,375
And now he's going
to summon the dragon

26
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:39,750
and make his wish, so it
looks like we're doomed...

27
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,083
[KRILLIN] He would have killed
us for that Dragon Ball...

28
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,791
And then he would've taken
it from us anyway...

29
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,458
At least this way,
we managed to stay alive.

30
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,291
But even with
that ball,

31
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,875
he still can't
make his wish yet...

32
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,083
Uh?

33
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,833
Gohan didn't know it,
but he stopped him.

34
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,333
Didn't you say that he
left here to go after

35
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,375
a Dragon Ball you
saw on the radar?

36
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,875
One that had
been left behind?

37
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:05,958
[BULLMA gasps]

38
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,416
You're right, Krillin!
You've got it!

39
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,416
Gohan has just one
of the Dragon Balls,

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,250
then Vegeta can't
make his wish!

41
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,541
I knew that little guy
would come through for us!

42
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,625
Let's just hope that he
doesn't run into Vegeta.

43
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,500
[quietly whimpering]

44
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,291
Zarbon's late...

45
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,833
Ah! Right!

46
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,125
I tire of waiting... He
should have been back by now.

47
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,625
Either Vegeta
has defeated him...

48
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,458
Or, he has failed
in his mission

49
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,583
and run away
to escape me...

50
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,333
I knew it! I should
have dispatched

51
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,416
the Ginyu Force 
from the very beginning!

52
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,250
Ah! Lord Frieza!
You'll be pleased to know,

53
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,875
the Ginyu Force has been
notified of your command

54
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,666
and are making preparations
for immediate departure!

55
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,250
I'm expecting
confirmation any minute now!

56
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,625
There, you see?
Now that's professionalism.

Ah?

60
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,083
I'm afraid with the
Ginyu Force coming,

61
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:35,166
you will no longer
be needed. Ever.

But I know who
is responsible.

called the Ginyu Force.

00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,708
And that bratty girl
that was with him.

161
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,208
[GOHAN] What did you
do to them?! Huh?

162
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,041
Did you hurt them?!
Answer me!

163
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,041
[VEGETA] Actually I
never even touched them,

164
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,375
but if you want, I could easily
be talked into going back!

165
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,458
[GOHAN gasps]

166
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,708
You see, boy,

167
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,291
because I now possess
all of the Dragon Balls,

168
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,666
I was, as you
say, "merciful".

169
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,375
He thinks he
has all of them...

170
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,291
[GOHAN screams]

171
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,166
[VEGETA] Tell me, what's
that thing in your hand?

172
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,333
It's just a watch!

173
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,833
[VEGETA laughs]

174
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,041
[VEGETA] With all the scientific
technology on your planet,

175
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,666
you're trying to tell me that
that huge device is a watch?

176
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,708
It's an
antique watch!

177
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:13,208
Anyway... Is your father
on this planet as well?

178
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,291
No, he's not! I don't
know where my dad is.

179
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,625
I haven't seen him in
a very long time.

180
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,916
Hmph.

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,166
Such neglect...
Awww...

182
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,708
Too bad.
Because, you see...

183
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,000
We are the last
of the Saiyans.

184
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,166
That means we have to
look out for one another.

185
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,625
Understand?

186
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:44,666
It's like... like the
three of us are brothers.

187
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,958
[VEGETA] Hrrgh!

188
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,750
Haaugh...

189
00:14:55,833 --> 00:15:00,375
[GOHAN groaning]

190
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,833
Not too bright,
are you boy?

191
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,625
You're even a bigger
fool than your father.

192
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,500
And that's
saying a lot!

193
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,708
[groaning continues]

194
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,833
Go home. Go cry
in the arms

195
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,125
of your mother,
little Saiyan.

196
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,958
This is no place for
a sniveling baby!

197
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,000
[VEGETA laughs]

198
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,458
[VEGETA] Bye.

199
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,291
[GOHAN whimpering]

200
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,916
The Dragon Ball...

201
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,083
He... he...

202
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,833
He never found the
other Dragon Ball!

203
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,458
[GOHAN yells]

204
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,541
[GOHAN chuckles]

205
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,916
[KRILLIN growls frustratedly]

206
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,375
Gohan!

207
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,583
Krillin!

208
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,416
I've packed everything
back into a capsule!

209
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,458
Any sign of
Gohan yet?

210
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,416
No sign of anything!

211
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,750
I'm beginning to think
that something terrible

212
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,416
has happened to him!

213
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,833
After seeing Vegeta
take out that monster,

214
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,250
I don't want to think about
what he could do to Gohan...

215
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,250
Come on, Gohan. Hurry!

216
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:29,500
We've got to get out of
here! Gohan! Please!

217
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,041
[KRILLIN gasps]

218
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,458
Hey! Krillin!

219
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,916
Gohan!

220
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,916
[GOHAN] You guys!
Look what I found!

221
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,291
Yes!
Way to go, Gohan!

222
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,000
You did it, kid!

223
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,458
[GOHAN laughs]

224
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,625
Uh, Gohan,
we'll have to save

225
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,000
the celebrating
until later,

226
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,083
because right now we
gotta to get outta here!

227
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,958
[GOHAN] Yeah, I know. Vegeta
told me that he'd been here.

228
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,208
Uhh...

229
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,375
I was able to hide the
Dragon Ball from him!

230
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,708
He never even
knew I had it!

231
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,833
No way!
Boy, were we lucky!

232
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,291
Krillin! Gohan!
Move it or loose it!

233
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,125
--Okay...
--[KRILLIN] Oh, right!

234
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,958
[VEGETA laughs]

235
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:45,458
This is it! The last
Dragon Ball is right here.

236
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:49,958
And all I have to do is
swim down there and get it.

237
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,458
[thinking] In mere
moments I will possess

238
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,333
all of the
Dragon Balls,

239
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,666
and then the universe
will be mine!

240
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,750
No one, not even Frieza,
will be able to stop me...

241
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,750
[thinking] Hmm...
That's strange...

242
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,083
It's got to be around
here somewhere...

243
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,791
[thinking] Where is it?

244
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,208
[VEGETA thinking]
Where is that damn ball?!

245
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,416
[thinking] NO!

246
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,791
[VEGETA] It was that boy!
I sensed he was

247
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,375
hiding something from me!

248
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:39,791
He has the Dragon Ball! That
little brat stole it from me!

249
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,583
But how did
he get it?!

250
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,500
It's just a watch!

251
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,750
[thinking]
That was no watch!

252
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:54,125
It was some kind of
Dragon Ball locator!

253
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,500
[VEGETA growls]

254
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:05,833
[VEGETA yelling]

255
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:11,125
When I find you,
I'll kill you! You're dead!

256
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,750
I swear it!

257
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,958
You are dead!

258
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:42,166
Where are you, boy?!
I want that Dragon Ball!

259
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,458
[VEGETA] NOOOO!

260
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,333
[VEGETA growling]

261
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,500
Where is he?!

262
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,750
[VEGETA] They're hiding.
I can't sense their energy.

263
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,208
But I'll find them...

264
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:20,291
The instant they make their
next move, I'll find them!

265
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,291
No one makes a
fool out of me!

266
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:27,625
I swear they'll regret the
day they were ever born!

267
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,458
They won't leave
here without trying

268
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,291
to get the other
Dragon Balls,

269
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,250
and when that time
inevitably comes

270
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,541
they will have to
deal with me...

271
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,958
[VEGETA chuckles]

272
00:20:55,458 --> 00:21:00,291
We're safe now. Vegeta will
never find us down here.

273
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,500
Why would anyone look for
us in such a horrible place?

274
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,916
Well, uh, look on the
bright side, Bulma.

275
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,291
At least this way you're not
stuck in a cave anymore.

276
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,625
Krillin's right, we just gotta
be positive, that's all!

277
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,291
You want positive?
Alright!

278
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,875
I am positive that
we have no food,

279
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,541
or water or even a
bathroom for that matter!

280
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,958
How's that
for positive?

281
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,208
Well?

282
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,166
Hey, I got an
idea, Bulma!

283
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,333
Why don't you wait
here while Gohan and I

284
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,875
visit Guru and get him to
awaken Gohan's hidden powers.

285
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,666
To... to do what?

286
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,750
I will not be left out
here all by myself, okay?

287
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,000
You gotta
trust me.

288
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,916
First of all, we'll be
back before you know it!

289
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,041
And second,
when we do return,

290
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,375
Vegeta won't stand a
chance against me and Gohan!

291
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:59,333
[KRILLIN chuckles]

292
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,333
[NARRATOR] The special assault
team known as the Ginyu Force

293
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,041
has answered
Frieza's call

294
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,625
and is on its way
to Planet Namek.

295
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,500
Once these
mercenaries arrive,

296
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:18,208
Frieza will be
unstoppable...

297
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,333
But they're not the only
ones headed for Namek...

298
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,750
Goku is also en-route
to the planet,

299
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:29,500
training hard and pushing his
strength further and further...

300
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:33,125
And while Vegeta searches in
vain for the Dragon Balls,

301
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,958
Krillin is taking
Gohan to meet Guru,

302
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:40,250
who will unlock the secret
powers lying within him...

303
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,708
It's a race
against time,

304
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:46,500
but who will win,
and who will be too late?

305
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,750
The fate of our heroes
hangs in the balance...

306
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't miss the next
action-packed episode of

307
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,041
Dragon Ball Z!
