[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,083
with Gohan, Piccolo,
Goten, and Trunks in hand,

3
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,083
Goku and Vegeta
made a daring escape

4
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,625
from inside of
Majin Buu's head!

5
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,250
[NARRATOR] It was a moment of
triumph for the super duo.

6
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,291
Never before had
anyone managed to escape

7
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,000
after being
absorbed by Majin Buu.

8
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,125
At last, the weary
captives were liberated

9
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,625
and laid down in a
safe place to rest.

10
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,375
But was anywhere safe?

11
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,041
The new Buu was about
to unleash an attack

12
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,791
that would destroy
the entire planet!

13
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,041
[VEGETA]
Hey, Buu!

14
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,375
[NARRATOR] The fusion earrings
could help, but was it too late?

15
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,041
[KID BUU screeches]

16
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,791
[NARRATOR] Yes!
It was time to abandon ship.

17
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,250
[GOKU] Vegeta!
We'll grab the boys

18
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,208
and use Instant Transmission!

19
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,041
[VEGETA]
Yes!

20
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,958
[NARRATOR] When Goku saw Dende
and Mr. Satan in distress,

21
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:17,791
he made a detour to save them
as well. But what had he done?

22
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,500
Now, there was no time left
to recover Gohan and the others.

23
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,041
It was over.

24
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,041
[NARRATOR] On the wings of
Instant Transmission they fled,

25
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:31,791
just as the Earth
breathed her last breath.

26
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,250
Stay tuned.

27
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,500
[gasps]

28
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,041
[grunting]

29
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,500
[KIBITO KAI]
The Earth!

30
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:05,000
[OLD KAI] Yes... I'm afraid
she's gone. Blown out of space.

31
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,208
Sir! What about
Gohan and the boys?!

32
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,166
[OLD KAI]
Mm?

33
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,833
They're gone, Goku.
Along with the Earth.

34
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,541
The Earth is gone you say?

35
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,541
[laughs]

36
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,041
Who are you trying to fool?
What do you think this is?

37
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,666
Huh? Put that in
your diaper, old man!

38
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,041
[DENDE] Please! You don't
know what you're saying!

39
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:38,291
That's no ordinary
old man! He's a Kai!

40
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,333
He does look a little strange!

41
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:45,833
A Kai? What's that?
Some sort of purple leprechaun?

42
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,000
[DENDE] No! The Kai's are
the illustrious overseers

43
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,041
of the Universe!

44
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,083
Each Kai protects
one of the quadrants.

45
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,166
But these two-- they're
actually Supreme Kais!

46
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,916
No one in the whole Universe
has more authority than them.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,625
Really? Hmm?

48
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,083
I've got a question, then!

49
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,125
If these two are
so "great and powerful",

50
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,958
why don't they stop Majin Buu?!

51
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,416
[BOTH gasp]

52
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,083
[DENDE]
Uhh...

53
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,375
They saved this nut? My word.

54
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,750
Hey! They have
pointy ears, too!

55
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,833
And I'm thinkin' you
must be one of them, kid!

56
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,458
[DENDE groans]

57
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,916
Huh? Hey!

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,250
[gasps]

59
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:39,458
Yeah! Now I get it! [laughs]
This is all a dream!

60
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,291
[laughs]

61
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,416
Just a silly ol' dream!

62
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,666
Of course! Of course!
Now it all makes sense!

63
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,416
First of all, there couldn't be
somebody who's stronger than me,

64
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,083
the undisputed martial arts
champion of the world!

65
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,708
[chuckles]

66
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:05,958
Secondly, pink monsters
like Buu don't exist!

67
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,250
And neither do purple people
with pointy ears, now, do they?

68
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,916
And there's no such
thing as little green men

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,708
that guard the Earth from evil.

70
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,291
But, sir!

71
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,791
[MR. SATAN] And how absurd is
this? Look at all those moons!

72
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,458
Hey, wait!
Where are you going?!

73
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:22,250
[MR. SATAN] I'm gonna
fly away! It's my dream!

74
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,416
And I can do whatever I want!

75
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,750
Hey! Yo! Majin Buu!

76
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,750
I don't care
if this is a dream!

77
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,875
No one hurts my daughter
Videl or the Earth!

78
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,875
Do you got that, pal?!

79
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:44,125
I'm coming for you,
you pink stink! Prepare to die!

Ow! T-The pain! Oooh!

85
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:07,166
Eeeh! How can it hurt this bad
if this is a dream? Ughh...

86
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,083
You can't pay for
entertainment like this.

[VEGETA]
Kakarot! I can't believe this!

88
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,458
Do you see what we
have to put up with

89
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,500
because of your
incompetent decision?!

90

And you're
supposed to be a Saiyan?!

They're gone!
We can't even wish them back!

92
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,083

destroyed along with the Earth!

[KIBITO KAI] How can he
possibly reform so quickly

97
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,750
after a blast like that?!

He's mad!

That fiend! Darn him!

102
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,500
Ah! If he can withstand an
incredible explosion like that,

103
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,791
how are we ever
going to defeat him?

104
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,750
Did you see that?

105
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,833
[GOKU] Yeah! He's using
Instant Transmission!

106
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,125
[KIBITO KAI] But how could
he have learned it that fast?

107
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,833
Now he can travel
at the speed of light!

searching for you two.

are stronger than average

What's he going to do?

00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,125
Destroy every single
place he looks? My gosh!

Yes! I'm afraid so!

119
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,083
This Buu, he experiences
no remorse whatsoever!

120
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,291
He's a killing machine!

121
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,083
[GOKU]
With Instant Transmission,

122
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:41,041
he can destroy an entire solar
system in less than an hour!

123
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,916
The Universe will
never be the same again!

124
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,500
Hey! Wait!

125
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,833
Huh?

126
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:56,041
I forgot! The Dragon Balls!

127
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,166
The new ones on Namek!

128
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,208
Frieza destroyed
our original home world,

129
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,208
but he couldn't
destroy the Dragon Balls!

130
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,125
Not as long as they live in
the hearts of my Namek brothers!

131
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,125
And I'm sure Elder Moori
has made a new set by now!

132
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,500
We can use them to
wish back the Earth,

133
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,416
and everyone
Majin Buu has killed!

134
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,041
Yes! He's right!

135
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,583
[GOKU]
There's a small problem.

136
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:21,083
Dende, the other
Nameks are too far away.

137
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,791
I can barely sense
them from where we are.

138
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,166
Which means we can't reach them
by using Instant Transmission.

139
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,791
We'd need a spaceship
of some sort to get there.

140
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,375
Which we don't have...

[growls]

142
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,875
Wait!

143
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,458
I'm not sure what the
Dragon Balls are, but I'm a Kai!

144
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,750
My instantaneous movement
is not limited by distance!

145
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,583
I can go anywhere I want, see?!

If you guys have a plan,

148
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,875
then the least I can do is
get you where you wanna go!

Yes! All right!

At last! Things seem
to be going in our favor!

[OLD KAI]
Hold it right there!

152
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,500
I'm familiar with
the Dragon Balls.

153
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,208
And using them in
this case just isn't proper!

154
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,333
Those balls are
strictly for the edification

155
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,458
of a very advanced
and peaceful race!

156
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,791
They aren't meant
to be used anywhere

157
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,833
except on their home planet!

158
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,291
Using those balls

process of the Universe!

Aren't you being

[OLD KAI]
Hmm?

00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,166
After all, the Earth has some
very beautiful women on it!

There's one in particular
I'm thinking about!

164
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,708
Remember your reward

Hm?!

Oh, you mean that one!

Let him kiss your woman!

But she's not near
as pretty as Bulma is, see?

It's a compliment!

He's not dead!

his way to Other World!

Perhaps you should reconsider.
