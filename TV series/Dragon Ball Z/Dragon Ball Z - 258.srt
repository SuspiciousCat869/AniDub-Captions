00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,750
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,291
after destroying most
of the Earth's population,

3
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,166
Majin Buu was led to the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber

4
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,791
earlier than expected,

5
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,750
demanding that he face his
long-promised challenger.

6
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,250
Those kids?

7
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,791
[PICCOLO]
That's right.

8
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,250
[NARRATOR]
But with minutes bought

9
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,208
by Piccolo's bold distractions,

10
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,333
the boys had enough time to
perfect their fusion training!

11
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,791
This is the end for you!

12
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,416
Majin Buu!

13
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,458
Let's begin!

14
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,375
Fu-sion!

15
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,791
Ha!

16
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,250
[NARRATOR] And in a
blinding flash of light,

17
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,250
Majin Buu's
challenger was created.

18
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,791
Gotenks had returned.

19
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:56,291
[NARRATOR] The war for planet
earth's few survivors has begun,

20
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,208
with Gotenks at the helm!

21
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:02,041
But still Majin Buu
stands unscathed.

22
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,541
[GOTENKS thinking]
So much for the plan.

23
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,125
After that kind of attack,
he's not even bruised.

24
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,833
I'll just have to show
him a few of my secrets.

25
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,375
The battle continues today!

26
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:55,541
Foolish, they should have become
Super Saiyans before they fused.

27
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:59,166
This won't, take long,
earthlings are weak.

28
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,250
Not me, I just gotta
get warmed up first.

29
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,875
Then I'm deadly.

30
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,375
[gasps]

31
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,875
This next move is a new
one I've been working on,

32
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,541
tell me what you think.

33
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,791
A nuclear kick!

34
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,958
[pants]

35
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,083
Now, that worked well.

36
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,458
[GOTENKS]
Detonate!!

37
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,333
[SUPER BUU]
So you made smoke?

38
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,583
Looks like this is
going to take a while.

39
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:08,708
You better prepare yourself
for the spindletop punch!

40
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,125
Wait!

41
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,666
[GOTENKS]
Huh?

42
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,833
Not there.

43
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,625
Try my face.

44
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,958
Don't tell me how to fight!

45
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,791
[GOTENKS] How 'bout a chopper
on your chops, wimp!

46
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,750
That's it!

47
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,375
[GOTENKS]
Charging mad bull attack!

48
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,333
[GOTENKS]
A swinging disaster blaster!

49
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,291
[GOTENKS]
Reverse double dropkick!

50
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,125
[GOTENKS]
Stinging Tommy-gun punch!

51
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,250
[GOTENKS]
Quick darting ankle-blast!

52
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,333
Gotenks!

53
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,916
Wait. What's the next move?

54
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,958
[GOTENKS]
Exploding snake attack!

55
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,666
Ultimate twin elbow combo!

56
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,000
Flying bluejay assault!

57
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,166
Screaming angry wombat.

58
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,541
Screaming angry wom--!

59
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,750
Ah!!

60
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,583
Ow!

61
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,208
That hurt!

62
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,291
We're doomed.

63
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,708
[GOTENKS] So, it looks like
you can take hits pretty well.

64
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,583
You're a lot stronger than you
were the last time we fought.

65
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,875
But I've planned for that...

66
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,291
Oww, it keeps throbbing!

67
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,083
Huh?

68
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,916
Need a couple of minutes.

69
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,208
Huh?

70
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,083
Piccolo, be honest,

71
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,458
do you think that there's any
way that I can beat this guy?

72
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,875
I think there's a way
to succeed in everything,

73
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,041
you just have to
be serious about it.

74
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,708
That's no answer!

75
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,541
I... Uh...

76
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,750
Hey!

77
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,166
I'm throwing punches
as hard as I can,

78
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,958
pulling out every
trick in the book

79
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,250
and even a handful
that I just made up.

80
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,625
You made up what?

81
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,083
My own moves!

82
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,583
That is what real
warriors do, you know!

83
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,083
Plus, I've been thinking
about some new strategies

84
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,083
that might work later.

85
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,416
[PICCOLO]
Oh, is that so?

86
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,291
And what particular strategies
did you have in mind?

87
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,416
[GOTENKS] Well, usually
you take a beating,

88
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,708
wearing the other guy down
until you turn the tables on him

89
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,416
at the end and finish him off.

90
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,541
But I've been attacking
in a way that makes him think

91
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,375
I'm a lot weaker
than I actually am

92
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,583
because I've got a
huge trick up my sleeve.

93
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,375
Get it?

94
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,416
[PICCOLO]
Gotenks, why didn't you attack

95
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
with your full strength
from the beginning?

96
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,166
[GOTENKS]
What?!

97
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,541
Because, I want
people to remember this

98
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,708
as something unique,
not just another brawl.

99
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,208
[PICCOLO]
Cut the nonsense!

100
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,458
Do you understand that the
fate of the world rests

101
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,666
on your ability to beat him?

102
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:57,250
[SUPER BUU]
All you people do is TALK!

103
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,625
Fine! Then let the
second round begin!!

104
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,583
Haaa!

105
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,875
[PICCOLO thinking]
He better do it right this time.

106
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,083
[KRILLIN]
Man, I hope Trunks and Goten

107
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,291
had enough training
time in there.

108
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,041
[ROSHI]
Did you see that guy, Krillin?

109
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,416
No amount of training
is gonna be enough

110
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,291
to beat something like that.

111
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:24,125
Quiet! This is hard enough
without you two making it worse!

112
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,166
How do you think I feel?

113
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,208
You think I don't
know their chances?

114
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,083
I know they might not survive!

115
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,541
And I know Piccolo might destroy
the door and trap them in there!

116
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,291
But they can be revived
with everyone else

117
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:39,250
using the Dragon Balls.

118
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,708
But what if they're not dead?

119
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,000
What if they simply
lose the fight?

120
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:47,166
Do you expect Piccolo
to kill them and himself?

121
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,833
Well, I don't know about you,
but I absolutely hate the idea

122
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,041
of my son's mentor murdering him
so he can come back to life.

123
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,208
Can you understand that?

124
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,333
[PICCOLO thinking]
Please tell me that move was

125
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,333
part of his plan.

126
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,708
[SUPER BUU]
Feeling dizzy?

127
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,583
I've had enough!

128
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,708
I should be
fighting great warriors!

129
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,708
There's nothing
great about you.

130
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,291
Is that so?
'Cause I've got a secret.

131
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,375
I've been using
a little strategy.

132
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,916
And I'm stronger than you think.

133
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,250
Nice move, huh?

134
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:08,125
You know if I was you,
I'd start running about now.

135
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,875
Yes!

136
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,166
Su--

137
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,791
--per--

138
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,625
Saiyan!

139
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,208
[snickers]

140
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,583
Hmm?

141
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,083
I had no idea you could become
a Super Saiyan after fusing.

142
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,916
[GOTENKS thinking]
Yeah, that's much better.

143
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,125
Majin Buu has no
idea what I just did

144
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,875
now I'll kick this up a notch.

145
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,583
Good, we may
still have a chance!

146
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:48,250
[GOTENKS] Time to put all
the goofing around to an end.

147
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,291
[GOTENKS]
What do you say, ugly?

148
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,916
Are you ready?

149
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,791
[GOTENKS] But I'm, not
exactly sure which of my moves

150
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,458
I should throw out first.

151
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,291
I'll save some for later

152
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,333
but I have to use
a good one right now.

153
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,875
He's getting impatient,
Gotenks, get up!

154
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,041
All right, got it.

155
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,958
But this particular move might
cut him in half, which is fine!

156
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,708
The cosmic halo!

157
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,833
Stop!

158
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,750
Down!

159
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,208
He's got him!

160
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,500
Looks painful.

161
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,333
You know,
I'd give you a breather,

162
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,916
but it feels pretty
good from this end!

163
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,916
[chuckles]

164
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,125
Watch this.

165
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,750
[gasps]

166
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,250
He's too strong.

167
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,041
[GOTENKS]
Uh-oh.

168
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,041
Ha ha ha ha!

169
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,791
Just what I thought you'd do.
Your moves are so predictable.

170
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:19,000
If you really think that, then
you would have your guard up.

171
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,625
Missed me!

172
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,666
[SUPER BUU]
Wrong.

173
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,000
Wait, hold on.

174
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,458
Well that could
have ended better.

175
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,291
That wasn't me.

176
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,500
Get out of the tub.

177
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,625
Hey, it's not like we
both couldn't use a bath.

178
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,083
[PICCOLO]
You got my cape soggy.

179
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,958
[GOTENKS]
Come here!

180
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,458
It's time for a serious move.
I've had enough of this!

181
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,000
Heads up!!

182
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:30,916
Hey, Majin Butt!
How's that headache feeling?!

183
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,708
[growls]

184
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,833
So you're not completely
indestructible are you, big guy?

185
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,791
You know, I've
got a certain move

186
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,750
I've been saving
for this exact moment.

187
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,416
I hope you enjoy it!

188
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,333
[GOTENKS] It's new so sorry
if it's a little sloppy.

189
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,375
A Super Ghost Kamikaze attack!

190
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,291
[gasps]

191
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,125
[PICCOLO] Come on Gotenks
let's try something that works.

192
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,750
Ha!

193
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,625
What the heck...

194
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,500
...is that thing...?

195
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,000
Hi! Ready, Buu?

196
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,666
[NARRATOR]
As strange as it sounds,

197
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,875
Gotenks has burped
out what appears

198
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,500
to be a ghost of himself.

199
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,333
Is this part of the
brand new technique

200
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,041
he's been bragging about?

201
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,000
And if it is,
what exactly does it do?

202
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:30,458
Stay tuned for more excitement,
on Dragon Ball Z!

203
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,416
You're dead.
