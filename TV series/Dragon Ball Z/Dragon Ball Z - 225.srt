[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,583
Babidi and Dabura
took a major step

3
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,000
toward reviving the
terrible Majin Buu.

4
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,833
But when the wizard realized
he still had only half

5
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,250
the pure energy he needed to
awaken his sleeping monster,

6
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,666
he sent his henchmen to
gather the rest.

7
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,750
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
this would prove to be

8
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,500
a difficult task indeed.

light-eating monster Yakon

11
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,833
tried to rob Goku of his
Super-Saiyan power,

12
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,625
Goku gave the beast a little
more than he bargained for...

Who will protect me?

I will be the warrior
they must battle.

[NARRATOR] With Goku
and the gang getting closer,

20
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,875
Babidi's back is to the wall.

21
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:12,375
Fortunately for him, he's still
got Dabura on his side.

22
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,125
The demon king has retired to
his mediation chamber

23
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,250
to increase his
fierce fighting spirit.

[BABIDI]
Good!

25

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
the Battle Royale continues...

30
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,208
Five fighters--
No, make that three!

31
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,166
Three fighters locked
in an all-out battle

32
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,375
for the tournament title!

33
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,833
The last one standing
will be named

the Number-One-Under-The-Sun.

35
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:41,000
Trunks and Goten, posing as the
mysterious Mighty Mask,

36
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,250
have their hands and feet
busy trying to block

37
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,666
the furious fists of
Krillin's wife, Number 18.

38
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,416
It's a ferocious fight and
whoever wins will go on

39
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,375
to face Mr. Satan.

40
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,833
Will this be the day that
Mr. Satan is exposed

41

for the fraud he really is?

for the last two stages?

46

You probably scared them off!

00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:12,583
[ALL grunting]

325
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,375
Hey! The two of you
can't fight together!

326
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,541
You're disqualified!

327
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,541
Do you hear me?!

328
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,458
Uh-oh. I think we're in trouble.

329
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,958
Me too... Should we go?

330
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,958
Uh-huh...

331
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,166
[TRUNKS]
Your tournament was stupid!

332
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,041
Hey! Goten!
Where are you going?!

333
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,291
Yeah! Trunks!
Get back here now!

334
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,750
[sighs]

335
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:47,916
[MR. SATAN whimpers]

336
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,666
Wow.

337
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,500
Number 18's done it!

338
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,666
Mighty Mask was disqualified
because he was two people!

339
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,083
And that means Mr. Satan and
Number 18 are the last fighters!

340
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,583
One of them will be
declared the champ!

341
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:14,500
[CROWD cheering]

342
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:18,125
Go, Mom! You're the best!

343
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,208
[CROWD cheering]

344
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,541
[MR. SATAN thinking]
What'll I do?

345
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,583
I'll be a goner if I fight
this girl all by myself!

346
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:46,250
[GOKU yawns]

347
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,666
What time is it?

348
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,333
Gosh, I really wish
they'd hurry up!

349
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,791
[BABIDI]
Hmmm...?

350
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,916
Dabura!

351
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,708
[DABURA chuckles]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

352
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,541
[NARRATOR]
Uh-oh!

353
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,875
Dabura has come out of his
meditation chamber,

354
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:27,125
100% charged and ready to fight!

355
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,791
Gohan's anxious for his
challenger to step through

356
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,541
the door,
but is he ready to face

357
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,000
the King of the
Demon World himself?

358
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,333
And back at the
Battle Royale,

359
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:41,458
Number 18 has her sights set on
Mr. Satan's championship title.

360
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:46,000
[MR. SATAN whimpers]

361
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,916
[NARRATOR] It's gonna be
showdown of epic proportions.

362
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,833
