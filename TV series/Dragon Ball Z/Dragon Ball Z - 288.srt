00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,291
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:19,333
the mighty Goku obliterated
Majin Buu with his Spirit Bomb!

3
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,416
The evil Buu was wiped out,

4
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,333
but the good Buu was left
to start a new life on Earth.

5
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,208
But, could he fit into society?

6
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,875
[GIRL]
Go get your own!

7
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,375
[PIT BULL PETE]
That's from Pit Bull Pete!

8
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,791
[NARRATOR] His quest for ice
cream, led him to challenge

9
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,625
a street fighter,
and his victory earned him

10
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:42,791
a sweet payday!
Buu had scored the mother lode!

11
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:47,125
Everyone was happy...
Except Bulma, that is!

12
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,166
But was shopping
the perfect cure?

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,583
It was until a pair of
desperate thieves barged in!

14
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:58,208
[BUU] Hey, you nice men!
Give Buu money for ice cream!

15
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,000
[NARRATOR]
But with Citizen Buu on hand,

16
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,000
even the most
dangerous situation

17
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,083
seemed like mere child's play!

18
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:12,291
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, underneath
a starlit sky at Mount Paoz,

19
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,000
Goku, Trunks, and Goten

20
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,208
were demonstrating the old
saying that boys will be boys!

21
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,875
And these boys
were fighting back!

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,833
[GOTENKS]
Geronimo!

23
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,916
[GOKU] Ow! Hey! So you
wanna play rough, huh?

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,916
[NARRATOR] It was a
bathtub brawl to remember,

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,208
but the naked truth was that
Goku simply could not be beat!

26
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,416
[CHICHI] Hmm! Well, I like it,
but it doesn't like me.

27
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,125
It makes my bottom look big.
This one won't do either...

28
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,583
It's out of style.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,416
[CHICHI]
Hey! Yeah! This'll work!

30
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,083
It's a classic,
but it's still alluring.

31
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,250
[GOHAN]
Mom?

32
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:08,250
Oh? Hey! Don't you
look stunning? Goodness!

33
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,750
Thanks, Mom.

34
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,166
But do you think we might
be overdressing a little bit?

35
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,166
We're not overdressed!
How could you say that?

36
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,333
[chuckles sheepishly]

37
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,541
Besides, isn't your future
wife going to be there?

38
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,083
I remember the first party
that your Dad and I went to!

39
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,208
Did I ever tell you about that?

40
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,916
You would think we
were going to the opera,

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,750
but we're just going to Bulma's!

42
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,958
It's a barbeque, isn't it?

43
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,416
[CHICHI]
Gohan?

44
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,958
What do you think?
This is more casual, right?

45
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,333
Yeah, it's cool.

46
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,166
I like it a lot better
than those other outfits.

47
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,833
Good, I-I guess a little
lipstick wouldn't hurt, huh?

48
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,208
What about my hair? Do you
like it better the other way?

49
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,833
[GOTENKS]
Hmm-mm.

50
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,916
Ugh. I'm glad
we got that settled!

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,916
By the way, where's your father?
Is he ready to go yet?

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,375
To go? I think he already went.

53
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,375
He was here a few minutes ago,
and now he's gone!

54
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,458
Ohh! I know where.

55
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,958
[CHICHI] Oh, great!
Where is he this time?!

56
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,375
[GOKU]
Hey! What in the world?

57
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:35,750
[GOKU] Oh, there it is! It fell
through! I'm glad I came!

58

[screams]

60
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,708
All right! I get it!
I was only trying to help!

61
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,166
Give me a break!

62
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,750
[GOKU]
Not that kind of break, man!

63
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,166
I'm glad you're happy,

64
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,125
but if the egg hatches there,
your baby's going to fall!

65
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,291
[CHICHI] You mean
he deserted his family

66
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,625
to go look at some eggs?!

67
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,875
What kind of
lame excuse is that?

68
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,166
Yeah, but they're
gonna hatch soon!

69
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,000
He wanted to make
sure that they're okay!

70
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,291
[GOHAN] I looked all over, Mom.
He's not anywhere around here.

00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,541
Hey, do you want me to check on
the other side of the mountain?

72
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,583
No way! Come on!
We're leaving without him!

73
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,583
Can't he stop saving
things just for one day

74
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,500
so we can be
together as a family?!

75
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,083
Is that too much to ask?!

76

Why can't someone else be the
egg man today?! This is absurd!

You're smart, but building nests
obviously isn't your forte.

just like these
