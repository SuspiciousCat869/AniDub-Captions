00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,541
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,875
Goku transformed himself
into a Super Saiyan 3,

3
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,458
stunning his opponents,

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,375
the evil wizard Babidi and his
forceful henchman, Majin Buu,

5
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,666
with his uncanny
strength and ability.

6
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,333
It seemed as though the monster
had finally met his match

7
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,250
in the form of
the Super Saiyan 3.

8
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,375
But even at this
intense power level,

9
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,875
Goku could not
topple Majin Buu.

10
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,500
Although for the time being,

11
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,916
absolute victory
was not Goku's goal.

12
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,750
[GOKU thinking]
What's taking Trunks so long?

13
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,208
I can't go on fighting
like this forever.

14
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,708
My energy's draining fast,

15
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,500
and Majin Buu just keeps
coming back for more!

16
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,958
[NARRATOR] The Saiyan just
needed to stall Majin Buu

17
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,875
while Trunks searched for
his mother's Dragon Radar.

18
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,708
[TRUNKS]
Hey, here it is! I found it!

19
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,833
Well, that's just
wonderful, Trunks.

20
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,750
Now, we all have
time for a relaxing lunch.

21
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,416
What is it with you and food?
Gotta go, love ya!

22
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,083
[GOKU thinking]
There he is. Good.

23
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,083
He's on his way
back to the Lookout.

24
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,333
He must've finally
found the Dragon Radar.

25
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,250
I guess it's time to
wrap up my business here

26
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,791
so I can head back, too.

27
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,333
[NARRATOR]
With Goku's task complete,

28
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,333
he powered down
to his normal state,

29
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,875
and bid adieu to
Babidi and Majin Buu.

30
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:27,958
[GOKU]
See ya.

31
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:33,125
[BUU]
Huh? Uh? Huh?

32
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,625
Don't just stand there floating.

33
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,458
Get your doughy pink body moving
and find him right now!

34
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,458
[NARRATOR] But Majin Buu had had
enough of being bossed around

35
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,125
and abused by Babidi.

36
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,916
The time had come for a mutiny.

37
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,875
[BUU] You teach me
lots of good things,

38
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,916
but Buu think it time
Babidi go bye-bye-bye.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,333
[NARRATOR] Now there's a new
master of evil on the loose,

40
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,958
and he's angry!

41
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,500
[BUU]
Bye! Bye!

42
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,875
[BABIDI screams]

43
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:25,541
[BUU] You go bye-bye now!
Bye-bye, Babidi!

44
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,875
No more tell Buu what
to do! No more meanie!

45
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,791
Pull!

46
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,666
Ha, ha!

47
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,958
[cackles]

48
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,375
Woo! Ha, ha!

49
00:04:55,458 --> 00:05:00,125
[cheering]

50
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,208
What's the matter?
What's wrong, Dad?

51
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,041
Goku, what is it you're sensing?

52
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:12,750
[GOKU]
It's Majin Buu. He's-He's...

53
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,416
[PICCOLO]
He's what?

54
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,166
He's killed Babidi.

55
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,041
[GOTEN, KRILLIN gasp]

56
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,166
He killed him?!

57
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,333
Well, this is quite a
surprising turn of events.

58
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,958
I had a feeling that he might.

59
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,958
They didn't really
seem to get along.

60
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,000
So, what happens now?

61
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,583
Majin Buu has no one telling
him what to do anymore.

62
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,958
There's no denying that Babidi
was definitely the brains

63
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,125
of that particular operation.

64
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,333
[sighs] Maybe things will
turn out happy after all, guys!

65
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,916
Yeah!

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,833
I'm not so sure.

67
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,416
The only thing
we can do now is hope.

68
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,666
I promise, give them two days
and they'll be ready to fight.

69
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,875
There's no need for
you to destroy West City

70
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,458
or kill anyone else.

71
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,375
I'm asking, have some patience.
They'll come to you.

72
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,708
Are they really strong?

73
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,625
Unbelievably.

74
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,541
[GOKU thinking]
We can only hope.

75
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,875
[BUU] Buu so free! Buu so free!
Like bird in no cage.

76
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,833

77
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,791
So free!

78
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,583
[BUU]
What do Buu do first?

79
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,041
Buu have so much fun now!

80
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,041
No more Babidi tell
Buu what to do.

81
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,458
Over there! Look fun!

82
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,666
Look like fun! Look like fun!

83
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,833
Over there! Fun!

84

you're goin', hot shot!

It's Majin Buu!!

[BUU thinking] This make
Buu happy. Verry happy!

89
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:03,541
They look much like toys!
Buu like to play with toys!

Hello girl, you think Buu sexy?

you're very, very sexy!

00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,708
So, Earth girls like boys
pretty like this, huh?

122
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,916
How Buu s'posed live up
to body image in magazine?

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,125
He's even worse without Babidi!

141
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,541
[GOKU] Hmm. I guess it's just in
his nature to cause destruction.

142
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,291
It's probably the only
thing he's ever known to do.

143
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,541
No! Don't go making
excuses for him.

144
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,416
There's no reason
to demolish planets,

145
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,875
regardless of
personality defects.

146
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,541
Don't worry, I'm fairly certain

147
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,083
we can keep him from
wiping out the entire planet.

148
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,666
Buu seemed very
eager when I told him

149
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,083
stronger fighters
than me would be

150
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,125
facing off against
him in two days. So...

151
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,625
...that buys us some time.
But I can't help feeling bad

152
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,875
for all the innocent people down
there who stand in his way.

153
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,208
But we can bring
everything back to normal

154
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,791
with the Dragon Balls, right?

155
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,041
Perhaps, Krillin, but that
doesn't do us any good

156
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,458
if the boys aren't prepared
to fuse and defeat Majin Buu

157
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,708
in these next two days.

158
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,833
[GOTEN]
Hm?

159
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,458
[PICCOLO]
That should be our priority.

160
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,041
You and the boys are going
to have to learn fast, Piccolo.

161
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,375
My time here on
Earth is running out.

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,083
I have less than an hour.

163
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,583
Less than an hour?!

164
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,041
No, you must have
more than that.

165
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,208
It hasn't been a full day yet.

166
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,083
Why do you have to
leave so soon, Dad?

167
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,875
Please don't. I like you.

168
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,333
I like you too, Goten,
but it seems Super Saiyan 3

169
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,416
is a level that can only be
handled in Other World.

170
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,750
The living world has more
rules than Other World,

171
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,500
and transforming
takes too much energy.

172
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,750
So I got very, very tired.

173
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,625
Oh no! So that's why you
seem so exhausted, huh?

174
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,250
A little fatigue and energy loss

175
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,250
is nothing Dende
can't take care of.

176
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:15,916
No I can't. For this I have
to return to the Other World.

177

[BABA]
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

178
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,458
Greetings, Goku. At the tone,

179
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:28,333
your time remaining on this
Earth will be 30 minutes.

180
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,166
Baba, what are you--
Thirty minutes?! Ah!

181
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,458
Is that all the time I've got?

182
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:38,916
[BABA]
At the tone, Goku -- beeeeeep!

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,833
Trunks had better hurry up.
There's no time!

184
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,750
[TRUNKS thinking]
Trunks is on the way, guys!

185
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:15,833
[GOHAN grunting]

186
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:22,375
[GOHAN thinking] The sword
is an extension of my body.

187
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,958
Feel the sword.

188
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,333
Be the sword.

189
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,125
[grunting]

00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:40,000
[grunting]

191
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,208
Don't hurt yourself, Gohan!

192
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,875
[panting]

193
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,875
Incredible!

194
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,750
Gohan's natural ability
to handle the Z Sword

195
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,416
with such finesse is uncanny.

196
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,125
I've never seen anything
quite like it, Master.

197
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,916
What did I tell you, Kibito?
Gohan is the one!

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,208
Everything is going exactly
according to my plan.

199
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,791
Soon enough, Gohan will
be ready to slay Majin Buu,

200
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,125
and restore order
to the universe.

201
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:30,333
[panting]

202
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,250
Don't wear yourself out, Gohan.
Rest for a few minutes.

203
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,041
You've done so much,
more than I even dared hope.

204
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,291
No, I still have
a long way to go.

205
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,750
Huh?

206
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,458
[GOHAN thinking]
I won't let them down again.

207
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,041
I may have been unprepared
for Majin Buu before,

208
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,000
but I refuse to be
defeated by him this time.

209
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,500
It's gonna take
everything I've got,

210
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,375
but I'm willing to
give that and then some.

211
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,000
I just hope that's enough.

212
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,083
Until then, all I
can do is practice.

213
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:15,583
[KRILLIN, GOTEN grunting]

214
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,666
Goku, I've been meaning
to ask you a question.

215
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,458
Go ahead.

216
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,375
When you went
Super Saiyan 3...

217
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,083
Would it have been possible?

218
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,750
Could you have actually defeated
Majin Buu once and for all,

219
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,125
if you really tried?

220
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,916
Well, I don't know.

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,500
I mean you have to
admit that Majin Buu

222
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,083
is no ordinary opponent.

223
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,000
It might have been
impossible for me to win.

224
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:48,166
Might?! Why didn't
you at least try to

225
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,041
give him everything
that you had?

226
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,583
Were you afraid of
what would happen

227
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,791
if your body was
destroyed on Earth?

228
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,166
No.

229
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,208
By all accounts,

230
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,375
I shouldn't even
be here in this world.

231
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,666
It's not my place to do that.

232
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,875
This is their world, Piccolo.

233
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,208
Even if I did somehow
defeat Majin Buu,

234
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,083
he wouldn't be the last villain
to terrorize the Earth.

235
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,541
And then who would be
prepared to save them?

236
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,041
Call me crazy,

237
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,041
but after watching those
boys fight each other

238
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,250
at the Junior Division,
I decided to take a chance.

239
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,125
[PICCOLO] So you're going
to wager the world's future

240
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,458
on the shoulders
of little children?

241
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,583
[GOKU] I think it's a
pretty safe bet, don't you?

242
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,666
You've always been a
hopeless dreamer, Goku.

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,541
Goku, I'm sorry.

244
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:56,125
Well, give him my regards when
you see him in the Other World.

245
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,000
[GOKU] I'm sure that Gohan
misses you very much, too.

246
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,583
He was always fond of you.

247
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,500
[GOKU] You were like
family to him, Piccolo.

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,791
Hey! Heads up, guys!
Trunks just flew in!

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,666
It's so good to see my little
Trunks. You must be tired.

250
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,291
Mom! I'm fine.

251
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,208
[BULMA] Of course you are,
dear. You're so grown up.

252
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,333
Here it is, sir! Confirm:
Is this your Dragon Radar?!

253
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:32,833
Confirmed! Good job, soldier.
Mission accomplished.

254
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,041
Thank you, sir!

255
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,333
Great! Now, thanks to Trunks

256
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,833
we can track down
the Dragon Balls

257
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,333
and wish for everything
to be brought back to normal.

258
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,208
When do we get to
train for the fusion?

259
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,083
You guys didn't start
without me, did you?

260
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:51,250
Of course we didn't.
It takes two to fuse.

261
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,625
Ooh! Ooh! Wouldn't it be cool
if I could fusion with myself

262
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,583
and become two of me? Huh, Dad?

begin our training right away.

[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Yes, sir!

269
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,833
[GOKU] Now, I don't
have much time left,

270
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,875
so we're going to need
to work hard and fast.

271
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,833
The fate of the world depends
on your cooperation. Got it?

[BOTH]
Sir, yes, sir!

00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,708
Wow! What do you
think got into them?

274
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,583
Well, maybe you
can teach these kids

275
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,125
some new tricks after all, Goku.

276
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,208
Let's begin!

277
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,333
First, you two have to realign
your energies with one another.

[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Yes, sir!

Target has been located
and confirmed, Major.

281
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,458

be a piece of cake.

in our cross-hairs.

want to play with Buu?

to lose him back there--

Your energies are perfectly
matched. Just keep practicing,

305
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,375
otherwise you'll slip out
of sync with each other.

306

Hey, you don't look so good,
Goku. Even for you.

Thanks, but I'll be all right.

the most difficult
part of fusion?

315
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,250
It'll require
a lot of patience,

316
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,833
and some real discipline.

00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,500
Once you've matched
your energies precisely,

319
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,375
you must strike a delicate
series of poses together.

320
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,958
If either one of you is
even the slightest bit off,

321
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,458
the fusion will fail.

322
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,125
Now, I'm about to teach
you the exact moves.

323
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,416
So, pay close attention, 'kay?

324
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes!

325
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes!

326
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,458
To get it started,

327
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,083
the two of you will stand
right next to each other.

328
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,375
Then go like this,

329
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,833
and make sure your arms
are straight. Then you say:

330
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,875
Fu... You'll approach each
other with outstretched arms,

331
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,708
moving exactly three steps over,

332
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,958
and once you got that you say...

333
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,333
...sion!

334
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,875
Quarter turn and watch
the angle of your knee.

335
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,291
Ha!

336
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,750
Now watch! Point your
fingers parallel,

337
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:51,000
and don't forget the angle of
your legs! It's very important.

338
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,875
This might be a bit tough.

339
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:11,000
[BUU]
Boooooooooooom!

340
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,291
[NARRATOR] Without anyone
to keep him under leash,

341
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,875
Majin Buu has become even
more dangerous than before!

342
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,125
Now, it's your turn
to try, boys!

343
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,375
[BOTH]
Yes!

344
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,125
[NARRATOR] Can Goten and
Trunks really master

345
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,958
the complex art of fusion

346
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,833
before Goku has to
return to Other World?

347
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,041
They'll have to,

348
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,708
if there's any hope
of defeating Majin Buu.

349
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,250
But they'd better hurry.

350
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,541
Goku's time is running out,

351
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,125
and so is the planet's!

352
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,250
Don't miss the next exciting
installment of Dragon Ball Z!
