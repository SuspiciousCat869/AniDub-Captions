[NARRATOR] It was a moment
that shook the earth...

When a brave young boy
stepped into his father's shoes,

creation known as Cell.

named Goku, and the
great courage of his son,

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,875
the Earth's future
has been redirected,

chance at keeping the peace.

that chance
has not been wasted.

13
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,625
These last few years
have been calm and prosperous,

14
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,583
as the entire world
was reminded

00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,041
of how precious peace can be.

16

a teenager.

Gohan has at last

been free to do his studies
like his mother wanted.

30

And since his mountain village
was far from any schools,

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,166
he did his education at home,
under ChiChi's careful eye.

32
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,250
But now, Gohan has decided

33
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,708
to enroll in high school
with other students,

34

ready to try his luck
at normal life.

I know you'd
have a good laugh.

The whole world thinks Hercule
was the one who beat Cell.

41
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,166
And now they've even
named a city after him!

[GOHAN chuckles]
Probably for the best.

sound kind of silly. Heh.

So you're the guy!

164
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,166
[GOHAN gasps]

165
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,958
Yeah. You're the guy
who I talked to outside of

166
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,750
the bank this morning!

167
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,250
Yes, I am.

168
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,416
Wow! Right after
the Gold Fighter vanished?

169
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Who? The Gold Fighter?

170
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,708
Is he a celebrity too?

171
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,708
Where are you from?
You're out of the gossip loop!

172
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,833
He's a crime fighter with
super strength and magic powers!

173
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,875
They say he looks
like a teenage boy

174
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,333
except he has
glowing golden hair!

175
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,375
Everyone's talking about it.

176
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,375
[GOHAN thinking]
Uh-oh! It's been five hours

177
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,083
and they've already
made a legend out of me.

178
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,166
[GOHAN gasps]

179
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,625
[VIDEL] Hmph!

180
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,458
[GOHAN thinking] Does she know?!

181
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,333
Now, let's see
if you can find

182
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,333
the unessential clause
in this sentence.

183
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,250
"On the bus I told my friend

184
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,375
who knew me well
a very important secret."

185
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,791
--[FEMALE TEACHER] Well...
--[VIDEL] Gohan!

186
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:27,833
Huh?

187
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,416
I remembered something.

188
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,541
What the Gold Fighter
was said to be wearing...

189
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,166
It was a white shirt,
a black vest,

190
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,041
and red pants.
Sound familiar?

191
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,041
Uh...

192
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,833
[ERASA] Hey, that's funny!

193
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,250
You and the
Gold Fighter dress alike!

194
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,833
Uh, yeah. Funny...

195
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,208
[FEMALE TEACHER] You three
in the back! Pay attention!

196
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,541
Yes. Yes ma'am.

197
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,875
Good... Now then...

198
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,833
The essential clause
"that" is...

199
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,291
[SHARPNER laughs]

200
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,958
Come on, Videl.

201
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,666
You know he can't
be the Gold Fighter.

202
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,375
Who in the world's ever heard
of a little book nerd

203
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,791
secretly being a superhero?

204
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,375
The guy's gotta be buff.

205
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,083
Ignore him.

206
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,666
I bet you could
fight crime if you wanted.

207
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,708
Oh, I doubt it...

208
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,291
[VIDEL thinking]
Of course it's not him.

209
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,625
His hair's not even right.
But then again...

210
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,416
Those fighters
in the Cell Game videos

211
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,750
turned their hair gold, too.

212
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,791
Although Dad said
it was a cheap trick.

213
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,375
[ERASA] So, uh, did you
just move into the city?

214
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,500
Maybe we could
study at your house.

215
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,291
Well... actually I commute here.

216
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,333
Oh, that's cool. Where from?

217
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:50,166
The... 439 Mountain Area.
See, it's... pretty small.

218
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,333
What?! Oh, get out of here!

219
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:56,250
The 439 Area
is like 500 miles away!

220
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,833
Hey! Excuse me, miss!

221
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,833
But I am trying to
teach a class here!

222
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,583
[ERASA gasps] I'm sorry!

223
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,375
How in the world
do you get here?!

224
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,875
That's gotta be close to
a five hour car drive!

225
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,125
Yes, well, uh...

226
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,125
That's how dedicated
I am to my education.

227
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,000
[GOHAN chuckles]

228
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,083
[GOHAN thinking] I can't
believe I just said that.

229
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,041
Now, let's move forward.

230
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,333
Creating the complex sentence.

231
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,708
Can I get a volunteer to read
this sample paragraph?

232
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,166
[GOHAN thinking] That's crazy!

233
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,416
They even talk about Hercule
in the grammar exercises.

234
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,375
Hey! Brains!

235
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,208
Volunteer and show us
how good you read!

236
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,291
[GOHAN] Huh?

237
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,708
Yeah! Do it!

238

--[ERASA giggles]

[FEMALE TEACHER]
Excellent! A volunteer!

00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,708
Now, I haven't quite
learned your name yet.

241
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:58,250
This is Gohan,
the perfect test-score boy.

00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,791
Oh, that's right.

243
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,916
Well, Gohan, now go ahead.

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,125
Yes, ma'am...

245
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,875
Now what am I...
doing exactly? Heh heh.

246
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,916
[SHARPNER chuckles]

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,125
You're reading the paragraph!

248
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,458
Oh right!

249
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,125
"Mr. Satan went to
the city that was then called

who was very evil,

work a little harder!

Come on!
Give him a break.

271
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,583
I bet he could
think of a bunch of

272
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,750
really great strategies since
he's such a smarty!

Yeah! On the right! Right?

Right...
Just get on to the field.

around here without Gohan.

[GOHAN thinking] The runner
on third's left the base.

296
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,583
That means if I throw it
to third, he'll be out!

Okay...

the hang of this game!

They sure make
a difference, huh?

Right. It's gotta be the shoes.

as hard as he throws?

it was just beginner's luck!

00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,916
[GOHAN] Is that bad?

323
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,541
Well, no, just...

324
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,750
most right-handers
bat from the other side.

325
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,333
Oh? How come?

326
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:59,291
Well... why don't you swing
there and see how it works?

327
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,458
So brain-boy thinks
he can catch my hits?

328
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,375
I'll just have to
give him a good scare.

329
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,666
[GOHAN thinking] I don't want to
show any more of my strength.

330
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,500
I better not swing.

331
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,875
[SHARPNER] I'll have you
ducking for cover like a sissy.

332
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,458
[SHARPNER chuckles]

333
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,916
[SHARPNER grunts]

334
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,500
Watch out!

335
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,500
[GOHAN grunts]

336
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,958
Ngh!

337
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,750
Aah! You idiot!

338
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,333
Why didn't you
duck like a sissy?!

339
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:39,875
[CATCHER 4 whimpers]

340
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:43,458
Coach... if I get hit,
that means that I walk, right?

341
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,041
--[COACH] Right.
--[GOHAN chuckles]

342
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,333
[GOHAN thinking]
That worked perfectly!

343
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:51,000
I got to base and didn't have
to show my strength! Heh heh.

344
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,000
What... the heck... is he?!

345
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,750
Bizarre...

346
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:09,208
[school bell chimes]

347
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,500
Gohan. What clubs
have you joined?

348
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,083
I haven't... joined any...

349
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,291
Good. You can
join the boxing club.

350
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,708
With a little practice, you just
might become a good fighter.

351
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,333
Thanks. But I don't think
I can join any clubs...

352
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,666
'cause...

353
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,125
'Cause he's got an extra,
extra long drive home

354
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,500
and doesn't have any time
to spend on clubs, right, Gohan?

355
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,500
Yeah, that's it!

356
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,250
[ERASA] Now Gohan...

357
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,291
what's say you give me
a ride home on your way out?

358
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,625
Oh well, uh--
I'm afraid that my ride

359
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,666
is just a one-seater!

360
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,583
I've got room
in my car, Erasa.

361
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,250
Sounds like a plan to me!

362
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,666
Now this is strange.

363
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,625
He says he lives very far away

364
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,750
but now he seems
to be walking home.

365
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,041
[GOHAN] Hmm?

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,541
[VIDEL panting]

367
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,416
Huh?

368
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,000
[GOHAN] Whew!

369
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,458
So many close calls!

370
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,583
I need a way
to use my powers...

371
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,541
without letting all of
my classmates know...

372
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,416
[GOHAN] Hmm...
Maybe Bulma can help...

373
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,583
[NARRATOR] So Gohan's first day
of class comes to an end.

374
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:55,083
But it seems the real
excitement is just starting up.
