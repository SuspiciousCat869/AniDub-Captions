To help save our world,

137
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,250
I will need the strength that
will even surpass the gods.

138
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,170
That is my extraordinary quest

139

that I have set out
to attain, my friend.

140

145
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,050

the anti-Buddhist movement

146

burdens you bear, my friend,

151
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,280
if that wasn't houriki
that you were doing,

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,030

like me could do it, right?

153
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,000

that technique?

154

won't use it for evil.

What is this, one of
those Zen conversations?

158

Well, there are
many reasons, really.

159
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,100
Hmm, but actually,
it's very important

160

much stronger.

162

I had a terrible fight
with this one guy.

163

He told me that I don't
know the basics of defense.

164
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,240
He told me that I
didn't know how to fight

165
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,100
and proceeded to give me
a total thrashing.

my reasons may seem very selfish
to someone like yourself,

The Meiji government.

What kind of question is that?

What in the world could
that have to do with anything?

Ask me something

to why I want to the strength
and I'll answer that question.

202

I hate them, if you must know.

203

205
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,010
But what does that have
to do with anything?

206
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,020
Never mind.

207

Listen to me.

force to this rock

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,160
However, anything,
including this rock,

211
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,250
has a resistance all of its own

212
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,120
that will prevent
any external forces

213
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,140
from going through it.

214
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,240
Any attempt to break it
will be a waste of force.

215

At least that is the way it
has always been, until now.

And now?

217
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,240
And now there is a way
to prevent this waste.

218
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,260
First of all, apply
the force to the rock

219
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,170
with your fist vertically.

220
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,140
Then at the instant
the force of the initial blow

221
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,100
contacts the resistance
of the rock,

222
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,210
bend your fist to apply
the second force.

223
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,000
When you do this,
your second force

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,260
will not be met
with any resistance.

225
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,080
It'll go through
the rock completely

226
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,130
and pulverize it into pieces.

Goodbye!

You can count on it,
Sanosuke Sagara.

You have a safe trip.

I can't believe it,
but in one night

499
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,060
he went from being
a braggart kid

500
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,020
to a mature man.

I hope he uses
the secret wisely.

Ah, it's you, Mr. Soujiro.

The battle is going
to begin very soon.

All ten of the
Juppongatana swordsmen

Edo immediately.

Once we get home,
I'll show him.
