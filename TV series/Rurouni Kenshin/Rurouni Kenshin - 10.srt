Yoshi was hit with

a poison dart by
an Oni gang member,

6
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,130
but made a full recovery
thanks to Dr. Gensai.

7
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,280
Kenshin brought
a troubled young lady

8

named Megumi
into our lives.

9

Everyone liked her,

but I had my
suspicions about her.

It turned out that one
of Sanosuke's friends

died from some opium

gang leader Henry Takeda,

Megumi went back to the

risking her life

him and his gang.

Sanosuke made
peace with Megumi,

25

that about Kenshin?

170
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,140
The Oni syndicate knows
about almost everything.

171
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,130
And so, I have an
exciting proposal

172
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,180
to offer you.

173
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,000
It would be an honor
to have you join

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,150
the Oni syndicate.

175
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,140
Your pay would be so much
that you could retire

176
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,180
in just one year.

177
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,080
Just think, after just
one year of working for me,

178
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,160
you'd never have
to work again.

179
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,200
Say yes?

180
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,040
Well, what do
you say, Battousai?

181
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,100
Are you going to
bring down Megumi now?

182
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,080
Or should I come up?

183
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,090
Huh?

184
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,180
I'll pay you
a thousand yen a day.

185
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,120
L-Let's make it two thousand.

186
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,080
Don't you understand,
this man is different.

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,070
He will not be bought.

188
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,100
Just shut up!

189
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,180
I have heard
enough from you.

191
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,170
All right, you've
wiped out most of my men,

192
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,240
so I guess I have
to surrender.

193
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,270
I will bring
Megumi to you.

194
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,090
But before I can surrender

195
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,090

Please, give me an hour

to leave the premises.

can never be bought
or compromised.

You're through being
boss around here, Takeda.

What?

250
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,060
Your attempts
to keep our gang tough

251
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,080
have been pathetic.

252
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,200
You've allowed us
to become way too soft.

253

Just what do
you mean by that?

254
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,190
To you, the only thing
this syndicate is for

255
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,240
is to generate money.

256
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,030
You have no sense
of pride about

257
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,280
the Oni gang and
the fear and terror

258
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,150
that we have made
our trademarks.

259

You are nothing but
a money-hungry jellyfish

with no honor to speak of.

261
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,280
So, based on your
lack of vision,

262
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,050
you can understand why
an individual like myself

263
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,070
will be replacing
you as boss here.

264
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,110
Now that that's settled,

265
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,250
let's get to the more
serious business at hand:

266
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,100
dealing with
Battousai the Slasher.

267

a good fighter in years.

But I need some protection.

270
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,280
He's coming back
in less than an hour.

271
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,180
What happens to you
from now on is of

272
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,290
little concern to us.

273

Too bad.

275
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,060
The only thing
he really wants

276
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,200
is to get Megumi back,

277

You must believe
in very short answers,

501
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,010
'cause you won't have
a chance against Kenshin

You've really
gotta be joking.

My only concern is
to fight Battousai.

And my advice to
you is you do well

Sit this one out?

Wow, he's been knocked out.

Sano, knocked out
with just one punch?

took my advice.

Now, it's time

So, shall we proceed?

524
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,110
A kodachi.

525
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,170
Yes, it's a little
smaller than a Samurai sword.

526
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,170
It's shorter so it
doesn't have the same power,

527
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,280
but it's lighter
and excellent for defense,

528
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,230
that's why it's known
as the sword that can

529
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,080
be used like a shield.

530
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,250
However, it's not exactly
an offensive weapon,

531
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,160
because it's almost
impossible to attack with.

532
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,100
He must be really good.

533
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,020
I can't imagine that he
concentrates on defense.

534
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,070
I'll let him attack
first and see.

standing there?

Are you just waiting?
