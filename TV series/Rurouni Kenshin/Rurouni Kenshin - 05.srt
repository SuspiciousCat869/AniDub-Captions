Let me tell you
something, Gohei,

103
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,080
this was my decision
to take up this fight,

104

I'm not buttin' in here.

I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,000
This morning, my patient
said he heard some news

about a fighter who's
looking for Kenshin.

129

And it seems that
he's a former member

of the Sekiho Force.

131
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,200
What is that, Dr. Gensai?

A group of hoodlums?

No, it's a fake Imperial Army.

An army?

135
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,280
The Sekiho Force was
an army that was created

136
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,010
by ordinary citizens
during the restoration.

137
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,140
Just regular people,
like farmers and merchants,

138
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,100
decided to form
their own special unit

139
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,030
of the Imperial Army.

140
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,090
But the leaders of the group

141
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,010
misled the people, lying about
free taxes and other things.

142
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,110
Then later, they were
all punished for that

143
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,060
by the restoration government.

144
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,110
So that's why the fighter's

145
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,180
coming for Kenshin,

146
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,130
because he's mad at anyone
associated with the royalists.

147
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,090
So why should he come
here picking a fight?

148
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,120
It's not Kenshin's
fault that they lied.

149
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,140
It's their own, and besides

150
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,250
he's swinging that zamba sword,

151
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,210

hurt my Kenshin,

153

Yumi, I thought you two
were with Kenshin?

157
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,010
Kenshin told us
to come back here,

158
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,000
because he had to talk
with a strange man

159

160

The royalists needed some way

to get more people
to join the army,

268
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,030
but then the royalist
government found out

269
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,080
that they could not
live up to their promise

270

So like sly cowards,

272
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,040

to find a scapegoat:

Us.

274
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,250
They could blame it
on all the Sekiho Force

275
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,160
and then execute them.

276

When we started out,

we fought very hard
for the new era,

282
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,210
because we trusted
the restoration government

283
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,050
and believed they
were truly righteous.

284

Captain Sagara.

335

Oh, that's right.

He must be
the one living survivor.

Sanosuke.

339

In that case, I'll
take care of him myself.

340
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,140

What do you say,
Mr. Legendary Swordsman?

376

Why don't you just give up?

377

Can't you leave
the past behind you

378

and quit blaming Kenshin?

379
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,180
You think Kenshin's
responsible for that decision?

380
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,230
He had nothing to do with
what you were talking about.

381

You people think the royalists
of the restoration were saints?

You have no idea
what they did to people.

383
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,150
They used us like chess pieces

384
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,250
on a game board.

385
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,170
I guess we were
human sacrifices.

386
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,220
What's he talking about?

387
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,130
I'm afraid he's right.

388
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,110
(together)
Huh?

389
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,290
The Sekiho Force was
used to recruit people

390
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,250
for the Imperial Army
who gunned them down.

391
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,030
So, I understand why
Sanosuke wants revenge

392
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,220
against the royalists.

393
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,070

394
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,260
Don't say it.

395
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,080
Captain Sagara trusted
the restoration.

396
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,140
He was a good man.

397
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,110
They never told him

398
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,240
to betray the others
or lie to anyone.

399
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,020
Never.

400
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,010

you or any other royalist.

Unfortunately, there

who are still being oppressed.

467
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,280
The people are the ones who
must carry out the changes

and make sure there's
peace throughout the land.

That is why I choose
to live my life as a wanderer.

he believed in,

his faith that there
will be peace someday.

one heck of a beating.

497
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm sure it's
going to take a while

498
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,080
for him to heal from all
those cuts and bruises.

499
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,290
Dr. Gensai said
it was a miracle

500
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,270
that Sanosuke didn't die.

501
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,060
I tried not
to hurt him too bad,

502
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,070
but he's a good fighter

503
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,250
so I had to give
him my best stuff,

504
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,110
and then he kept
asking for more.

505
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,090
I couldn't believe it.

506
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,240
He wouldn't quit.

507
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,090
Well, I'm glad this
thing is finally over.

508
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,010
Why don't we eat
a hot beef pie?

509
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,596
(crashing and shouting)

510
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:50,716
Oh, no.

511
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:51,696
What this time?

512
00:19:51,696 --> 00:19:53,060
There are those two
rowdy trouble makers

513
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,220
we saw the other day.

514
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,270
(footstep)

515
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,180
I have never seen anybody
talk so much about being tough

516
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,260
and then trying
to pick a fight

517
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,100
when they had no idea
how to defend themselves.

518
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,090
Sanosuke.

519
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,036
I thought you had orders
to stay in the hospital?

520
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:05,917
Are you kiddin'?

521
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,157
I'm not stayin' in that place.

522
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:11,020
Besides, this little scratch
really isn't anything.

523
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,070
(poking and knocking noises)

524
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,040
You know somethin'.

525
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,688
You two are startin'
to get on my nerves.

526
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:19,909
All right, that's enough.

527
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,190
Why don't you cut it out, 'kay!

♪

529
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,260
Oh, Sanosuke.

530
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,160
Why don't you take
the Sekiho Force symbol

531
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,270
off the back of your coat?

532
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,080
Because they will
always be a part of me.

533
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,040
I've been thinking about

534
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,280
all those things
you said yesterday.

535
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,210
They're much easier
to say than do,

536
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,160
but I've decided
to let go of my anger

537
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,000
towards the death
of my fellow comrades.

538
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,150
I think it's time to forget
the past and start living today.

539
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,240
Besides, you were right.

540
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Our work isn't finished,

541
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,040
and I know Captain Sagara

542
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,190
would want me to do
the same as you.

543
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,220
Huh?

544
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,130
So, if it's all right with you,
I'd like to hang around

545
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,170
and help you protect
people for a while.

546

I'm a new man.

547
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,060
Thanks to you, my friend.

548
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,120
I don't look it,

549
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,110
but I feel better

Watch who you're calling

It sure makes
things a lot easier
