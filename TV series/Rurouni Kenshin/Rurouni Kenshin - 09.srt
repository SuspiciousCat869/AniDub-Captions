where Sanosuke had taken
Kenshin to play dice.

Are you producing opium
for some medical reason?

167
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,110
I might be able to answer that.

168
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,230
You wouldn't happen to be
the daughter of Takawa Takani,

169
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,130
would you?

170
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,000
What?

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How do you know
my father's name?

172
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,280
Okay, now it's Suzie's turn.

Hmm.

I thought your name
sounded familiar.

177
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,050
The Takani family of Aizu

178
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,180
has a long and proud history
of turning out great doctors.

179
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,180
But six years ago,
they became involved

180
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,220
in a war with the imperial army.

181
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,010
Takawa Takani was
killed in the struggle

182
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,120
and the family home
was burned to the ground.

183
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,010
Mrs. Takani and her two sons
were thought to have died

184
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,060
in the fire.

185
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,090
According to reports,
only one young daughter

186
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,180
survived the attack.

187
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,180
It must have been awful for you.

188

I imagine the pain can
be overwhelming at times.

189

The loss of my
family is something

I will always carry in my heart

I came to Kyoto from
Aizu five years ago

194
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,110
and became a live-in
assistant to a local doctor.

195
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,280
I found out later
that the doctor

196
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,020
was tied in to the Oni gang.

197
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,230
He was making opium
for Takeda to distribute.

198
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,090
But the doctor got greedy.

199
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,280
He started selling
opium on the side

200
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,050
and they killed him

201

to take his place.

207
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,020
Instead of helping people,

208
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,000
I made something that
took over their souls

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,120
and finally killed them.

What happened that
finally made you run away?

214
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,040
I was forced to create
a new kind of opium

215
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,180
which could be mass
produced inexpensively.

216

There's no telling how
much damage it will cause.

What is this?

491
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,070
I can't believe he
still has the strength

492
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,030
to put up a fight.

493
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,170
You think you're the strongest,

494
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,270
but I know you're not.

495
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,040
Kenshin's the one.

496
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,130
You'll find out I'm
telling the truth

497
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,000
if you live to face him.

498
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,180
You're just a lowlife scumbag

499
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,140
who works for a bunch of crooks!

500
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
We'll never give in
to someone like you!

501

I'll have a picnic
on your grave!

502
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,260
Big talk for someone
that's about to die.

(groaning)

504
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,030
That's what I like about
these hard-headed bozos.

505
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,200
They always have
a weak spot somewhere

506
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,260
and they never think
you'll find it.

All right, we can go.

Hm?

Ya!

Come back, you freak!

513

You don't mind if we
take the girl, do you?

-Huh?

Are you all right?

You look hurt.

I'm fine, don't worry about me.

518

Help Megumi.

He's going inside!

Takeda threatened to
kill everyone in the dojo

522
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,100
if she didn't come back to him.

523
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,120
That's the reason she ran off.

524
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,170
I figured it must have
been something like that.

525
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,020
We have to go in and
get her no matter what!

526
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,170
She's part of our family.

527
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,130
She saved my life
when I was injured,

now I'm gonna go save hers!

Good for you!

530
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,120
Let's go show those lowlifes

531
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,130
what we're made of!
