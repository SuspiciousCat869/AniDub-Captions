During your long
journey together,

63
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,170
did Misao ever mention to
you that she was a member

64
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,090
of the Oni gang of spies?

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,150
And you must be...

66
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm afraid so.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,220
Your instincts are correct.

68

I am Nenji Kashiwazaki,

69
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,060
I once was an
important member

70
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,140

spy network.

71

Code name: Okina.

72
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,220
I was part of a special
investigation team.

73
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,090
The Aoi-Ya was established
as the base for Edo,

74
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,210
but, unfortunately,
the Tokugawa Regime

75
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,160
fell first and many
of my colleagues

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,130
who were unemployed came
here looking for work.

77

And I hired them.

78
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,150

Aoshi sent Misao here

for you to take
care of her.

that I'd really like

91
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,290
to ask you, Battousai, you've
stayed away from this place

92
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,140
for over ten years, why
is that you return now,

93
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,060
if I might be so
bold as to ask?

94
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,260
Does your return
have anything to do

95
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,100
with your successor,
Makoto Shishio?

Trust me, Battousai,

I have experience
in these matters,

I know everything that
happens here and believe me,

100
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,190
I know all about Shishio.

101
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,170
I couldn't believe it

102
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,030
when I heard that
he was still alive,

103
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,170
but I know that
he's here in town

104
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,130
and probably
up to no good.

105
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,070
I also think that you
must have come here

106
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,110
because of him.

107
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,140
He has a lot of troops.

I love this city
the way it is now

113

including Shishio destroy it.

115

If that means I
have to do my part,

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,210
Now if Shishio
is after you,

166
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,000
then he already
knows you're here.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,160
There is no
hiding from him.

168
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,040
-Let's go.
-Okina?

169
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,080
Battousai, if you're
going to fight Shishio,

170
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,170
you must assume an air
of dignity at all times.

171
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,170
Huh?

172
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,050
You must assume the
style of a righteous man.

173
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,230
Bet you didn't know I was
so philosophical, did you?

174
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,120
I come up with some
pretty good stuff.

175
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,170
(laughing)

176
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,140
I know sometimes he
sounds a little nutty,

177
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,120
but when he belonged
to the Oni gang,

178
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,150
the group nominated him

179
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,120
to be the leader
of all operations.

180
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,150
But he declined

181
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,100
and recommended
Aoshi to the post.

182
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,200
He thought that
a younger leader

183
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,100
was a wiser
choice at the time.

184
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,240
He went on to
become a member

185
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,170
of the investigative team.

186
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,260
Shakku Arai was
known the world over

187
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,230
as the best
sword maker around,

188
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,010
but because he went from
making a cutting sword

189
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,080
to a killing sword,

190
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,180
he was considered a heretic
by the other sword makers.

191
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,240
The same sword maker
who made a killing sword

192
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,150
also made a
reverse-edged sword?

193
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,230
That just doesn't make
any sense to me, Grandpa.

194
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,230
Things don't always
make sense, angel.

195
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,160
Sometimes people do things
that appear contradictory.

196
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,000
Right, Himura?

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,220
Shakku's son took over
the family business.

198
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,180
His father taught him
to be a sword master

199
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,000
in his own right.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,180
And because of
the Meiji Era,

201
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,040
there's been no
demand for fine swords.

202
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,070
He's had to make a living
making kitchen knives.

203
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,130
Let's hope he
can still make

204
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,110
a reversed-edge
sword for you.

205
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,190
Hello, we are customers,

206
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,030
we're looking for
Mr. Seiku Arai, is he in?

207
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,100
Hi!

208
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,220
Ahh!

209
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,280
-Huh?
-Seiku?

210
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,080
-Can't be.
-Hello!

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,260
So you want to
shake hands?

212
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,170
What's that,
who is this boy?

213
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,250
What's he want?

214
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,250
Give me your hands!

215
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,240
Oh, I get it, this boy's
the official greeter.

216
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,260
Iori, are you
being a good boy?

217
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,290
Ah, Mama!

218
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,180
Welcome, is there something

219
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,040
in our store
I can show you?

220
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,050
Yes, I would like to look
at some of your knives,

221
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,180
if it's all
right with you.

222
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,210
You want a knife?

223
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,240
May I try cutting something
with one of your knives?

224
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,260
-Sure.
-Yeah,

225
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,190
look at the knife!

226
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,060
(gasping)

227
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,020
-That's remarkable.
-Look at that.

228
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,060
It stuck together again
as if it were never cut.

229
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,020
How is that possible?

230
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,050
(speaking foreign language)

231
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,140
Amazing.

232
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,270
It means "restored cutting."

233
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,110
It's the first time
that I've ever seen

234
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,150
it performed before.

235
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,260
He cut this
without destroying

236
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,070
any of the essence.

237
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,230
None of the
fibers are damaged

238
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,250
so you're able to
stick it back together.

239
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,100
It's a highly
technical skill

240
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,130
that can only
be accomplished

241
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,150
with a fine blade and
a master swordsman.

242
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,170
That's incredible!

243
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,210
If his knives are that
good, can you imagine

244
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,120
what his reversed-edge
sword would be like?

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,050
We would like to
meet Mr. Seiku Arai,

246
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,120
the man who
crafted this knife.

247
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,150
Huh?

248
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,000
I would like to
commission him

249
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,220
to make a reversed-edge
sword for me right away.

250
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,150
Uh huh, but...

251
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,160
Hello.

252
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,130
-There you are.
-Daddy!

253
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,280
My name is Seiku Arai,
can I help you, sir?

254
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't believe it,
you're Seiku Arai?

255
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,100
You don't look
like a master.

256
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,010
I know, everyone says that.

257
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,110
I happened to overhear
your conversation.

258
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,130
You were asking
if I could make

259
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,110
a special sword for you?

260
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,060
Actually, I no
longer make swords

261
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,110
so I'm afraid I'll have
to turn down your offer

262
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,120
to make you a new one.

263
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,230
-Huh?
-Hmm?

264
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,100
What?

265
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm really sorry.

266
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,010
Listen here--

267
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,120
Why won't you make this
special sword for us?

268
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,200
My father was
considered to be

269
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
the best sword maker around.

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,050
He made thousands of swords

271
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,280
and they were
all used for war.

272
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,050
My father used
to say to me

273
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,290
that at the end of
the Tokugawa Era,

274
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,240
his swords would
make the new era.

275
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,050
He believed this
and his swords

276
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,190
became the weapon of choice.

277
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,210
Many men were killed
with my father's swords,

278
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,180
but I don't understand
what kind of new era

279
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,110
comes from bloodshed.

280
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,110
I really don't want
anything that I make

281
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,230
to be used for killing.

282
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,140
Ah, Daddy!

283
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,140
(gasping)

284
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,200
There, now I've got you.

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,010
Oh, I'm sorry, Seiku.

286
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,090
It's all right.

287
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,030
Besides, we're
in the Meiji Era.

288
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,230
Swords are not necessary
any longer, we're at peace.

289
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,010
I've decided that I don't
want to make swords anymore,

290
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,220
I only want to make
household items

291
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,080
that people can enjoy.

292
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,100
I don't want to make
things that hurt people.

293
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,190
Well, Seiku, I can see
that you and your father

294
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,000
are complete opposites when
it comes to these matters.

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,220
Oh, well, all I can say
is that I like peace,

296
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,050
I think everyone does.

297
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,190
I make tools that help,

298
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,190
not things that
destroy people's lives.

299
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,140
I can't believe what
I'm hearing here.

300
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,280
You're a wimp, there
are a lot of people

301
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,140
that are trying to
take away your peace.

302
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,120
We're trying
to help you

303
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,290
and you're too
stupid to know it!

304
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,190
Thanks for your
time, sorry we made

305
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,050
an unreasonable
request of you.

306
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,070
We'll be going now,
have a nice day!

307
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,240
What, we're leaving?

308
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,130
Bye-bye!

309
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,080
What are you gonna do
about getting a sword now?

310
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know but a
reversed-edge sword

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,130
is still a weapon
of destruction.

312
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,080
He made it clear he didn't
want any part of that,

313
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,070
and I wouldn't feel right
involving him in anything

314
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,070
that wasn't peaceful.

315
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,170
I'll just have to
find another way

316
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,030
to get a reversed-edge sword.

317
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,280
You know that swordsman?

318
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,210
He seemed to be in some kind
of trouble, didn't he, dear?

319
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,140
You don't have to
make him a new sword,

320
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,240
why not give him the last
sword your father made?

321
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,060
He really needs it.

322
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,130
Nah, it's not necessary.

323
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,190
Up you go.

324
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,110
This is the more
peaceful Meiji Era,

325
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,100
no one needs
swords anymore.

326
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,290
Battousai's been
spotted in town.

327
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,270
Tell Mr. Shishio immediately!

328
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,040
Right.

330
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,190
I can't believe that guy,

331
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,290
he was such a
self-righteous wimp,

332
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,270
you know, I would've
gotten that sword for you,

333
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,200
and I wouldn't have left
until he gave it to us.

334
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,230
No, that wouldn't be right.

335
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,270
I can't interfere with
his peaceful lifestyle

336
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,180
just for my own
personal reasons.

337
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,220
Now you're acting
just like a wimp!

338
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,200
Even if we forced him
to make us a sword,

339
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,080
it wouldn't be the
same as if he made it

340
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,000
with his heart and soul.

341
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,290
A sword made with no
spirit is worthless

342
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,140
and could prove
fatal to its owner.

343
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,170
The craftsman's
attitude is important

344

when creating a sword.

345
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,180
We don't need a sword
just for appearance sake,

346
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,180
the new reverse-edged sword
must exceed the old one.

347
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,200
You should've figured
that one out, Misao.

348

raise you, you know?

You're cracking my
ribs, you big dummy!

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,220
Who are you
calling dummy?

353

Why don't you try contacting
the other sword makers?

I've been doing?

Handshake!

356

I know I did
the right thing.

357
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,080
If Seiku makes me
a reversed-edge sword,

358

Shishio's men will
come after him.

be tough to beat.

When I get the sword,
I'll release him,

534

so don't do
anything stupid,

I have to convince him
to make that sword!

539
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,080
Why did you tell him
about that sword?

540
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,040
That sword was made
as an offering.

541
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,200
It's the only one that
isn't stained with blood.

542
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,230
If that sword
causes any bloodshed,

543
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,050
I don't think
I could handle

544
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,080
if my father will be
remembered as a monster

545
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,040
who created weapons
of destruction,

546

they'll forget that
he was a craftsman.

547

The memory of your
father is important,

548
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,210
but the life of our
son is more important,

549
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,220
and that's what I'm
worried about right now.

550
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,070
Didn't you see his eyes?

551
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,110
Those aren't the eyes
of one who loves swords.

552
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,240
Those are the eyes
of one who loves

553
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,220
to kill with a sword.

554
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,070
He's a cold-blooded killer.

555
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,270
If he finds father's
powerful sword,

556
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,040
he'll have an
unquenchable urge

557
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,160
to try it on the nearest
living thing to him.

558
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,140
Iori!

559
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,000
This is the reason
I didn't want to work

560

on swords any longer.

561

happens to our child.
