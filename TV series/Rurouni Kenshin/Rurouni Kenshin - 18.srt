at Lenny's Restaurant?

Yeah, we heard.

56
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,140
They said some
crazy guy with

57
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,190
a knife tried
to rob them,

58
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,190
and you stopped him.

59
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,170
Is that right?

60
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,090
Hmm, yeah, this
guy was huge!

61
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,260
He was about
seven foot tall,

62
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,050
he was coming at
me with a dagger,

63
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,230
but I stopped him
with a parry thrust

64
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,260
and knocked him out!

65
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,010
He had a dagger?

66
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,010
We heard that he
had taken a knife

67
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,040
from the kitchen.

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,040
I understand
the guy was

69
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,290
not much taller
than Kaoru.

70
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,260
Ha-ha-ha,
whatever height he was,

71
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,060
I took care of him!

72
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,220
From now on,
you can just leave

73
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,230
everything at the Kamiya
Kasshin School dojo to me!

74
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,040
I'll take care of
anyone who tries

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,281

I'm brave!

78
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,110

that I taught

79
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,160
everything there
is to know about

80
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,100
the Kamiya Kasshin style.

81
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,270
Oh, and be sure you
put that bamboo sword

82
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,200
away before it
gets all moldy.

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
And you're getting too
big for your britches!

84
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,020
You're still
a baby, you hear me?

85
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,170
A baby and
nothing else!

Hey, you better
call me "master."

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey, knock it off!

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,090
I don't have
to take that.

90

She doesn't know what
she's talking about!

91
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:08,781
I don't want
to work out

92
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,841

93
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:11,200
I want to use
a real sword!

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,010
No, I don't think so.

95
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,150
You're a little boy,
you're not man enough

96
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,020
to handle a real
sword, anyway.

97
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,020
Wait till
you get older.

98
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,250
I am so big
enough to handle it!

99
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,060
Take it easy!

100
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm the first one to admit
you've gotten stronger,

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,160
but remember, arrogance
is a very dangerous thing

102
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,190
for a swordsman.

103
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,050
Um, so what makes
you think I'm arrogant?

104
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,200
I just want to
use a real sword

105
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,230
for a change.

106
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,050
I'll decide when you're
ready for a real sword!

107
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,050

They are the finest
assassins around.

113

This is a very

you want us to

142

Kenshin's his name.

143
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
He's also known
as Battousai.

144
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,150
Battousai the Slasher?

145
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,200
Exactly.

146
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,100
Once I was the
premier swordsman,

147
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,160
but Kenshin,
Battousai the Slasher,

148
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,010
busted my fingers,
ending my career!

149
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,180
He ruined my
life that day.

150
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,030
Fortunately, I got
into real estate

151
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,110
and made a fortune.

152
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,000
But I've always
held him responsible

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,090
for taking away
the one thing

154
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,140
that I truly loved:

155
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,130

We earn our living

160
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,260
not by listening
to other people's

161
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,160
trivial sob stories.

162

165
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,190
I have a plan then.

166
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,230
I think I know
of something

167

him to come to us.

Fine.

If you can
trap this man,

so much the
better for us.

"oni," on the tablet

Judgment day
is here, Battousai.

finished cleaning up!

clean the bath for me.

187
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,090
I want to take
a nice hot bath

188

after practice.

189

Huh?

190
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,060
What was that, Kaoru?

191

Are you saying now
you want me to clean

192
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,110
the bathtub for you?

193
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,080
That's right.

194

If you're going
to stay here,

195
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,070
you're going to
have to pitch in

196
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,280
and help like
everybody else.

197
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,240
I don't clean bathtubs,
'cause I'm a swordsman!

198
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,030
Hey, don't
sweat it, Yoshi.

199
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,130
I'll clean the
bathtub when I get

200
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,060
back from shopping.

201

When you finish
your training,

202
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,000
you can do the
rest of your chores.

She's always
ordering me around!

Who does she
think she is anyway?

205
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,000
Ugh, this is ridiculous!

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,230
Is this how
you repay a hero?

Make him wash
the floors?

208
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,040
A parade in my
honor would be nice,

209
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,050
or maybe a nice medal
with my name on it.

Ow!

211
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,040
Ow, that hurt!

212
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,130
Heroes like you
shouldn't be made

213
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,260
to do all the housework.

214
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,020
How pathetic!

215

Gohei Hiruma!

Of course I remember you!

How could I forget an
ugly face like yours?

220

Why, you little brat!

221
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,020
Even though your
friend Kenshin

222
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,260
crushed my fingers,
I can still take care

223
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,130
of the likes of you!

224
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,170
Would you
like to try me?

225

I keep telling you,
it's not how strong you are.

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,290
An important part of
the Kamiya Kasshin style

229
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,200
is to take advantage
of the strength

230

of your opponent.

Ready?

238
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,290
You're an amateur!

If this umbrella
had been a real sword,

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,220
I could have
killed you about

242
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,070
20 times by now!

243
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,110
Oh, yeah?

244
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,230
The Kamiya Kasshin
School is called

245
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,240
the "Sword of Life."

246
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,190
Ha, that makes me laugh!

247
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,110
Your technique is
lame and so are you!

248
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,070
Hey, you watch
what you say!

249
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,250
You plan on going
against a real sword

250
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,220
with that
bamboo stick?

251
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,080
Any sword could cut that
ridiculous thing in two,

252
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,260
you pathetic
little insect!

253
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,010
Of course,
it's possible

254
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,040
that you could
stand some sort

255
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,060
of a chance if you
used a real sword.

256
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,220
But since your
Kamiya Kasshin style

257
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,000
prohibits killing
with a sword,

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,190
I guess that's out
of the question!

259
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,250
Therefore,
you'll always be

260
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,050
a loser because
you'll never be able

261

Then come to
the edge of town

Huh?

00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,110
Well, Mr. Big Man,
I think it's time

504
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,120
we headed back
to the dojo.

As a matter of fact,
I just developed

a new technique for the
Kamiya Kasshin School.

It's by the new master,
Yoshi, and it's called,

"The nutcracker kick."

You'll never change.
