What a rundown place.

167
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,130
Is this really a dojo?

168
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,240
Kenshin, who is that?

169
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,020
Oh, how rude of me.

170
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,170
This is Megumi Takani.

171
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,050
She got in some trouble,
so we decided to help her out.

172
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,090
Oh, much more than that,

173
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,200
Kenshin saved me.

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,240
He saved you?

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,270
So, in other words,
you met this beautiful girl

176
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,030
and you wanted to show
her around your new pad.

177
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,090
Ha, Kenshin, you sly dog you!

178
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,250
No, that's ridiculous,
it's nothing like that!

179
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,150
Then start talking, Himura!

180
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,190
Let me explain...huh?

181
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,080
He came to my
rescue like a hero.

182
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,130
He's so wonderful.

183
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,200
Kenshin...

184
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,040
I am so disgusted with you,

185
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,050
it's not even funny.

186
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,160
How dare you treat me like this?

187
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,140
You no-good, lousy pig!

188
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,010
Oh, you make me so mad!

189
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,150
♪

190
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,030
Oh, my goodness.

191
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,110
You're so violent.

192
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,080
Kenshin, darling.

193
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,260
Hey, would you mind
explaining to me

194
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,130
what your relationship
is to Kenshin, please?

195
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,160
Well, he is very important
to me because he's going

196
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,140
to protect me from
those evil men.

197
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,000
And what is he to you?

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,130
Uh, I, uh--

199
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,140
Well, you couldn't
possibly be his girlfriend.

200
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,270
I mean, no way would
a strong swordsman like him

201
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,150
go for a sweaty,
underdeveloped

202
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,020
tomboy like you.

203
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,220
How dare you call me a tomboy?

204
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,270
Why, you've got a lot of nerve?

205
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,170
Take it easy, Kori!

206
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,030
Please, watch your mouth
when you're talking to Kori.

207
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,200
She's naive and not
as hardened as you,

208
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,060
so don't pick on her.

209
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,180
She's an innocent girl
with an enthusiastic spirit.

210
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,120
Hmm?

211
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,050
What?

212
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,210
Sweetie, you like me
a lot more than that

213
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,160
violent girl,
don't you my strong,

214
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,050
handsome Kenshin?

215
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,180
Kenshin!

216
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:32,771
Well, you don't understand,

217
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:33,691
we tried our best!

218
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:34,751
No, don't do it!

219
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:36,591
Don't kill us,
we'll do anything!

220
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:37,372
Come on!

221
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,773
Please, Boss, we won't
fail you next time, I swear!

222
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,113
Just give us another chance!

223
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,033
Please!

224
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:42,554
Please, let us go!

225
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:43,274
Have mercy!

226
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:44,334
It wasn't our fault!

227
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,150
Please, don't do it!

228
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,240
Wait, wait!

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,230
(screaming)

230
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,190
I don't know
what it is about me.

231
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,090
Maybe it's my
good business sense?

232
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,270
But I feel I just have
to get rid of things

233
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,160
I have no use for.

234
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,030
I now it's
your territory, Boss,

235
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,020
so please excuse
my butting in.

236
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,130
Yes, I would prefer to handle

237
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,110
the discipline
of the men myself.

238
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,220
Don't undermine my
authority by doing my job.

239
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,060
Of course, I understand.

240
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,080
In any case, I'll be happy
as long as I get Megumi back.

241
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,160
You'll handle that?

242
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,260
Of course I will.

243
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,110
Hannya, where is Megumi Takani?

244
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,160
In a dojo near town.

245
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,190
Good, I want you
to go find Hoko

246
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,260
and then go with Beshimi
and bring her back here.

247
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,110
Yes, Boss.

248
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,110
Beshimi, you understand
the consequences if you

249
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,010
were to fail?

250
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,050
I understand completely.

251
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,240
Just make sure there aren't
any mistakes this time.

252
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,290
If we play our cards right,
she's the hen that will lay

253
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,040
the golden eggs.

254
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,230
This is our last chance
and we can't afford to lose her.

255
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,040
Takeda has about 60 warriors,

256
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,160
the leader of all the warriors

257
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,170
is known as the Boss.

258
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,280
Who's the Boss?

259
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,120
He's second in command
below Takeda, but considers

260
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,210
himself independent
from the operation.

261
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,280
He's formally
a top government spy.

262
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,210
At the age of 16,
just prior to the Restoration,

263
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,280
he became the head spy boss
to protect the Edo castle.

264
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,100
His name is Aoshi Himmo,
he's one of the top spies

265
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,000
in the world
and very dangerous,

266
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,030
but as long as you're here,
I have absolutely nothing

267
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,050
to worry about.

268
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,160
Well, gee, I don't
know about that.

269
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,230
If the spies decide to attack,
even he won't be able to stop

270
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,010
all of them.

271
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,200
I'd better not stay here long.

272
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,080
Megumi, I'm just
a little curious,

273
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,210
why are you running away
from Takeda and his thugs?

274
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,260
I guess you must've
done something

275
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,250
really horrible, huh?

276
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,020
Come on, why won't you tell me?

277
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,240
Because I don't want to.

278
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,010
Don't you know
how rude it is

279
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,140
to ask about a woman's past?

280
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,230
I think I have
a right to know.

281
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,150
(chuckles)

282
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,200
Caught in the act.

283
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
You know, Kori,
eavesdropping

284
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,270
isn't very ladylike.

285
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,010
I never thought
a woman like you

286
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,030
would stoop so low.

287
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,100
I can't help it,
I've got to know

288
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,060
what's going on!

289
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,160
Can't you see I'm
a nervous wreck?

290
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,230
How can he spend so much time
alone with her in his room?

291
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,050
I think he likes her a lot!

292
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,010
You know how he is,
Kenshin's very strong

293
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,150
when it comes
to fighting with a sword,

294
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,270
but when it comes
to everyday life

295
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,150
with regular people,
he can be a real pushover,

296
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,100
especially with
women and children.

297
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,290
That's what I'm afraid of.

298
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,090
To be honest, right now,
I really wish he wasn't

299
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,130
that big of a pushover.

300
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,030
What?

301
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,050
Huh, what?

302
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,010
Nothing, nothing, you have
nothing to worry about!

303
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,150
Kenshin thinks she's ugly!

304
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,070
Really ugly!

305
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,170
No, she's beautiful!

306
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,120
Sanosuke, is everything
all right out there?

307
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,200
Just peachy.

308
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,230
I've been doing
some thinking

309
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,280
about the situation.

310
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,080
Since we're dealing with spies,

311
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,190
they probably know
exactly where we are,

312
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,270
so we have to stay
on the lookout

313
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,290
at all costs.

314
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,160
Underworld spies, huh?

315
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,250
Is he talking about ninjas?

316
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,240
This is gonna get dangerous.

317
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,220
♪

318
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,010
I don't wanna scare you,
but we might have serious

319
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,200
trouble headed our way.

320
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,050
I don't know how
many there will be

321
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,170
or when they might get here,

322
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,170
but all of us need
to be prepared.

323
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,100
Kaoru, you've got
nothing to worry about.

324
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,050
You can handle yourself.

325
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,030
Thanks a lot.

326
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,060
No need to fear, Yoshi's here!

327
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,110
What?

328
