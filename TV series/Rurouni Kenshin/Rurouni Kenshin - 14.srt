505
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,150
Can you say placebo?

506
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,260
So now that your back's better,

507
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,090
how does it feel
to be working again,

508
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,240
Dr. Gensai?

509
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,150
Well, it's nice
to be busy again,

510
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,210
but everyone asks,

511
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,290
"Where's the lady doctor,"
when I come out!

512
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,270
They really say that?

513
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,060
I wish people were as interested

514
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,050
in joining a dojo,
as Megumi's patients

515
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,160
are interested in her.

516
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,110
If you were as smart
and pretty as Megumi,

517
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,200
more people would be
interested in you!

518
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,270
What did you say!

519
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,100
-Oh boy.
-Yoshi, ugh!

520
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,020
Those two.

521
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,110
They're like oil and water!

522
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,020
I think this lady doctor's
the best in town!

523
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,270
But there is something
that as a good a doctor

524
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,230
as she is,
even she can't cure.

525
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,060
And Sano's got it!

526
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,190
Next, please!

527
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,160
I can cure anyone that's sick
unless they're lovesick.
