You won't fool me again.

Plus, the blows
you've taken

177

Fortunately, there was
a short but vulnerable moment

178
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,240
when you switched
to the spinning sword

179

I was able to catch you.

For me, having a friends

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,210
not always looking
over your shoulder

188
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,210
is more important,

189

Relax, buddy.

Come back, buddy.

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,180
I feel fine...

Is he dead?

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,070
No, Yoshi,
he's just passed out

from lack of air.

208
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,200
But I'll bet he'll
have a sore throat

209
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,020
when he wakes up.

210
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,020
He was so stubborn
about having a complete

211
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,280
victory that his
repeated efforts

212
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,100
gave me a chance
to figure out his strategy.

213
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,280
Ultimately,
he defeated himself.

214
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,200
Wha--

215
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,220
What you did when
Aoshi knocked me down

216
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,200
really showed
a lot of courage.

217
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,050
Thanks for giving
me time to recover.

the life of a fighter.

Old habits are hard to break.

241
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,000
Those that live life
by the sword are resigned

to end our lives
that way as well.

has been from Aoshi.

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,090
He turned down
a chance to be a captain.

247
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,010
Instead, he kept us all
busy and well taken care of.

248
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,090
I created the Oni gang,

249
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,130

the title of most powerful

250

as a symbol
that we've arrived,

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,200
so I searched out
the most talented fighters

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,260
I could find
and trained them

so we really
would be the best.

But you are the
best, Battousai,

Don't say that!

Aoshi and all four of
his henchmen's bodies

508
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,290
had disappeared.

So, I suppose
it's possible

510
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,030
that he still might
be alive somewhere.

If he's still alive, Kenshin,

513
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,200
you think he's plotting
some kind of revenge?

Who knows?

515
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,140
I would hope that
after all the pain

516
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,280
his life of crime
has given him,

517
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,180
he'd find something
better to do with his life.

knowing Takeda paid
for his treachery.

And once I regain
my strength...

522
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,290
I'll make the others pay.
