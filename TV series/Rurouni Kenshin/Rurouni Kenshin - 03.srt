00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,230

with deep breathing,

I'm sick of the Kasshin style
and all this breathing stuff,

I want to know how to
really beat up an opponent,

it takes discipline!

Kenshin, I came here

to be good with swords,
not to protect other people!

are a lot better,

he shouldn't have.

Why don't you ask him

I'm too concerned not to know!

I know Kenshin Himura,
known as Battousai

143
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,180
is here.

144

impersonating Battousai

have confessed
the real one

150
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,010
is in this dojo,
and may I say

151
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,030
that if you don't
tell us the honest truth,

152
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,050
you will be prosecuted
for resisting the government.

Kenshin?

154
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,080
Just what do you mean?

155
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,220
What did Kenshin do?

156
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,070
That's classified top-secret
and the only one who knows

157
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,210
is waiting for him out front.

Oof!

165
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,050
Yoshi, tell Kenshin
that if he comes back here

166
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,080
he'll be caught!

167
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,140
Right, okay!

168

Oh, Kenshin.

171
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,250
(horse neighing)

172
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,210
I'm very close now.

173
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,010
I finally found him,
and this time,

174
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,080
Battousai is mine.

175
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,030
(marching)

176
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,210
Come on, hurry up!

177
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,150
Yeah, hurry!

178
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,090
If I run, I might
spill the tofu,

179
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,250
you silly kids!

180
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,000
Lookit, that
guy's got a sword!

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
Huh?

182
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,170
Oh...

183
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,000
You seem to be pretty brave
totally ignoring the decree

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,210
abolishing the wearing
of swords in daylight!

185
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,000
And right in front
of the police, too.

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,230
Why don't we have
a little fight?

187
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,030
I'll tell you what,
I'll let you go if you win!

188
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,150
I've got kids here.

189
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,000
Please, let's not fight.

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,010
Plus, my sword has
a reversed edge.

191
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,110
Reversed edge?

192
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,240
(laughs)

193
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,050
That kind of sword
couldn't kill a lousy flea!

194
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,100
You dummy!

195
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,050
(smash)

196
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,270
Ridiculous sword.

197
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,040
(laughs)

198
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,120
Kenshin, oh...

199
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,150
No need to worry,
Susie, it's okay.

200
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,180
I can't believe how
rude those men were.

201
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,190
I think they should apologize
for spilling our food.

202
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,220
Yeah, that's right, they should!

203
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,180
You're right,
they certainly should.

204
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,140
Get out of my way!

205
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,100
Police swordsmen coming through!

206
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,100

Please!

214
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,200
Shut up!

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,280
Please, please officer,

216
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,090
let him go!

217
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,180
Don't hurt him anymore,
it was only a little towel!

218
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,200
Excuse me,
but why don't

219
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,020
you let us handle this matter.

220
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,210
You're only going to make things
more complicated around here.

221
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,040
Listen, you third-class nobody

222

of a town officer,

223
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,280
you better watch your step.

224
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,140
You're still talking
to us even knowing that

225
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,070
we're from Satsuma?

226
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,010
No, I was just,
I mean I was--

Oof!

Get out of here.

230
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,020
Ah, got something to say?

231
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,250
We are the elite
swordsmen police,

232
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,210
we are in charge
of the situation.

233
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,060
We are permitted
to carry swords,

234
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,110
unlike you wannabes,
and if we have to,

235
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,200
we are permitted
by the government

236
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,170
to kill people,
so do not interfere.

237
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,100
Challenge us!

238
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,000

a criminal, lady!

248
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,180
Oh, father...

249
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,160
Sit down!

250
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,050

251
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,040

Let this be a strong warning

As swordsmen police,
we may execute

269
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,030
any of you as examples,

270
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,020

don't lose our touch.

Execution?

276
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,000
No way!

crime around here.
