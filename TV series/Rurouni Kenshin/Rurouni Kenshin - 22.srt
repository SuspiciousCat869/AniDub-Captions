Progress sometimes

but if you wait
around long enough,

it does happen.

8
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,040
The first railroad
ever built in Japan

9
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,260
was completed and ready for use

10
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,150
in the summer of 1872.

11
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,010
The first route
that was opened

12
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,210
was between
Shinbashi and Yokohama.

13
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,160
Riding this train,
trade merchants,

14
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,170
and the rest of us,

15
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,160
could get from
the capital of Japan

The steam locomotive came
all the way from England

traveling on a steam ship.

20
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,050
It had incredible power

21
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,130
and could pull eight train cars
filled with people and cargo.

22
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,020
Its top speed was over
40 kilometers an hour.

23
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,080
Some people feared
this new invention.

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,030
They thought that fire
from the locomotive

25
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,290
would explode and set
the whole countryside ablaze.

26
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,200
So most of the tracks
were built near the coast.
