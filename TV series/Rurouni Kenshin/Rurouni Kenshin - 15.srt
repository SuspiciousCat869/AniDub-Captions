So, Kaoru, just who
are the Jinpu Tai?

31
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,100
They are a group of assassins
who have reportedly been

attacking big-name politicians
and high government officials.

taking bribes or being corrupt,

defenders of righteousness.

Now, take a deep breath
and tell us what happened.

72
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,110
This boy was sitting in my class
when he started complaining

73
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,170
of stomach pains,
then he got very dizzy.

74
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,010
The next thing I knew
he was out cold

75
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,090
and I remembered
you know a doctor

76
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,210

Yes, we need to find

Are you really serious?

If his skills are
as sharp as I remember

163
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,050
he's as good a slasher
as Battousai ever was.

So, Grandpa, were
you thinking about us

330
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,150
during all your traveling?

331

I couldn't think
of anything else.

332

After all, you two
are my worldly treasure.

333
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,220
By teaching these children
that I treasure so much,

334
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,210
I can really change society.

335
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,020
Through my students, I am
able to embrace my life.

336
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,170
-I have to go.
-What?

337
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,010
Huh?

338

See you later!

Where's he going
in such a hurry?

Wait, I got it.

341
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,150
He probably figured if he
stayed here, Megumi would

342
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,230
find a way to put him to work.

Good, I'd like to
