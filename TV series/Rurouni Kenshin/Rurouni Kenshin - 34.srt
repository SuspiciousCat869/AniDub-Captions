00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,230
there are some pretty vicious
people that are after me.

490
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,000
You might be
risking your life

491
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,180
just traveling with me.

492
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,230
But if you're willing
to accept that risk,

493
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,180
I'd consider it an honor
to have your company.

494
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,070
Okay, Kenshin,
you've got a deal.

495
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,270
I'm not afraid!

496
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,130
And on the way to Edo,
you can tell me all about

497
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,210
what really happened
between you and Aoshi.

498
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,060
Ugh, don't you
ever give up?

499
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,160
No way!

500
00:21:36,290 --> 00:23:13,270
