Oh, my heavens!

170
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,130
I guess Raijuta hasn't
taught you very much yet

171
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,120
except for how to lose.

172
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,270

out of here either.

177
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,000
If you wanna leave,
you're gonna have to beat me

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,230
fair and square, man-to-man.

179
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,280
Got it?

180
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,190
Wait!

181
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,180
I'm not through!

182
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,040
I haven't lost yet!

183
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,190
You've lost.

184
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,220
But look at it this way--

185
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,170
it's a good opportunity
to learn something.

186
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,290
Get away.

187
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,140
It's no wonder you lost.

188
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,280
You may call
Raijuta your sensei,

189
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,110
but he's never
given you any lessons

190
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,060
in how to use that
sword or defend yourself!

191
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,280
Is it that obvious?

192
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,090
How 'bout taking
some lessons from me?

193
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,260
I am a teacher of the
Kamiya Kasshin style.

194
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,270
Kamiya Kasshin style?

195
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,040
It's a kendo technique.

196
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,200
I think you could learn it!

197
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,230
You're very honest,
and you're proud.

198
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,180
You have the right
type of personality

199
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,010
to excel at this discipline.

200
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,020
If I do this, will
I become a fighter?

201

And one more thing.

304
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,020
You've inspired me to
complete my training

305
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,150
in the Kamiya style.

306
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,110
Does this mean that
you'll take Kenshin's advice

307
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,170
and keep your
distance from Raijuta?

308
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,110
Why should I?

309
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,160
He also saved my life,

310
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,150
and he's promised to
elevate my family name

311
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,210

plans to establish soon.

man, and I support him!

You have to say
one thing about him,

he's an honorable kid.

332
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,240
I just hope he doesn't
get too disillusioned

333
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,160
if Raijuta and his
gang turn out to be

334

Sorry to bother you kids.

339
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,010
I'm Police Chief Maraki.

340
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,170
I came down here from
Tokyo to see Kenshin Himura.

341
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,170
It's important.

He's having a picnic
down by the river.

343

I heard he's
visiting this house.

Do you live here?

345

No, I live in the
big house up the road.

My name is Yutaro Tsukayama.

have the advantage

because they have rifles.

is a trained sword technique,

it to them right now!

The army's going to attack
Raijuta's sword group?

This is top secret.

I've told no one about this.

374

The government's been watching
this group for some time.

375
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,060
They've been worried
about its activities.

376
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,170
Raijuta's a subversive,
and the decision's been made

377
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,070
to shut the movement down.

378
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,160
Who made this decision?

379
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,000
Secretary Yamagata?

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,110
That's right, but he heard
you made contact with the group,

381
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,000
so before he gives
the final go-ahead,

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,080
he wants your input.

383
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,010
He thought you'd have
an idea of their numbers

384
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,020
and just how big a threat
they present to our forces.

385
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,160
I'm afraid these samurai
present a real threat.

386

They're trained killers,

387
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,220

to the last breath.
