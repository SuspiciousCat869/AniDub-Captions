Stop it!

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,140
Saito, I order you
to stop fighting.

176
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,210
You were assigned to come here

177
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,170
to measure Battosai's
fighting abilities,

178
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,260
not to try to kill him.

179
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,160
So I got a little carried away.

180
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,110
Just because you're the
Metropolitan Police director

181
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,220
doesn't mean you can stop us.

182
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,010
The police director?

183
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,230
Measure his fighting abilities?

184
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,030
What's going on here.

185
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,250
Saito, you have completed
your assignment honorably.

186
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,200
I know as a member
of the Shinsen Group

187
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,000
you have a lot of pride
in finishing your work.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,220
But I would consider it a waste

189
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,090
to see Mr. Himura
die needlessly.

190
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,110
Please.

191
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,010
I get it.

192
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,260
So you're the one behind this.

193
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,030
Let me guess.

194
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,070
You're a former
Satsuma Clan Royalist,

195
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,230
but now you've become
the Home Minister

196
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,170
of the new Meiji government.

197
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,140
You are Toshimichi Okubo.

Who is Toshimichi Okubo?

200

Well, if you were to ask me

201
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,050
I'd say that guy looks
like somebody trying to do

202
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,030
a cheap Abraham
Lincoln imitation.

203
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,110
Now there's a brilliant
observation, Yoshi boy.

204
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,150
What?

205
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,010
Three people rendered
remarkable service

206
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,050
and sacrifice in restoring
the Meiji government.

207

Only one of those
statesmen is still alive.

That's him, Toshimichi Okubo.

209

So are you trying to tell me

210
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,220
that guy's important?

211

He's the Home Minister
of our entire country.

212
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,280
That means that he
is the very top guy

213
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,060
in our nation's government.

214
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm sorry Saito got a
little rough with you,

215
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,220
but we really needed to
be sure of your skills.

216

Now please listen to
what we have to say

Please be honest.

219
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,210
Will you hear us out, Himura?

220
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,020
Of course.

221
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,210
I'm willing to listen to you.

222
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,010
What is a big shot
like Okubo doing here?

To hell with Battosai,

224

I better report
this to Mr. Shibumi.

225
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,130
I'm sure he'd find
this development

226
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,160
very interesting indeed.

227
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,260
Hm.

228
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,110
Well, since our fight
has been interrupted

229
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,020
I guess we'll just have
to wait until next time

230
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,200
to finish this match.

231
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,170
Your life has been spared.

232
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,060
I'd say the same to you.

233
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,110
Hold it, Saito.

234
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,200
I suppose you want my evaluation

235
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,270
of Kenshin Himura.

236
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,180
Well, I'd say he's
not worth a damn.

237
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,140
But Battosai Himura
is good enough

238
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,290
for the task you have in mind.

239
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,010
I'm done.

240
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,060
I don't understand Saito.

241
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,260
He's certainly an excellent spy,

242
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,000
but I just don't know
what's behind that face.

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,290
He never shows any emotion.

244
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,040
Mr. Himura.

245
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,260
I have a carriage
waiting for you outside.

246
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,180
Please, won't you join me?

247
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,050
I'd like for us to talk.

248
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,200
But anything we need to discuss

249
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,260
we can talk about right here.

250
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm not the only one who was
responsible for what happened

251
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,060
during that blood bath!

252
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,030
Ah...

253
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,200
I'm not the only one responsible

254
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,020
for what happened
during that blood bath.

255
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,040
What blood bath?

256
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,090
Whatever you have to say, Sir,

257
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,070
you can talk freely
in front of my friends.

258
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,160
You're back, Kenshin, oh, boy!

259
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,210
Oh!

260
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,270
Megumi, he needs help.

261
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,260
Yoshi, hurry.

262
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,000
Go and get my medicine bag

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,250
and some bandages right away.

264
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,110
Gotcha.

265
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,180
Oh, Kenshin.

266
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,010
Is he the right man, Sir?

267
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,220
He might be our only candidate.

268
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,030
Now we just have
to make him realize

269
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,170
this mission's importance.

270
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,250
Our time is short so I'll
be perfectly honest with you

271
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,290
about this matter.

272
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:47,090
It seems that Shishio
has become active again.

273
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,210
So just who is this Shishio guy?

274
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,080
Some two bit troublemaker?

275
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,240
Hey, this really
doesn't concern you.

276
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Makoto Shishio was a slasher

277
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,220
at the end of the
Tokugawa era just like I was.

278
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,150
After I became well known
by the public as a slasher

279
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,150
Shishio took over the role of
the slasher in the shadows.

280
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,000
He was a Nagasu sect Royalist

281
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,120
who never achieved notoriety.

282
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,000
But he was reputed to have
tremendous slashing abilities.

283
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,270
Are you saying he was
as good as you were?

284
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,150
Oh, come on.

285
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,180
I have never even
heard of this guy.

286
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,190
That's because he kept
a very low profile.

287
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,090
Shishio was always secretive
in the way he worked.

288
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,170
Even during that time
almost no one knew he existed.

289
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,230
I never actually met him,

290
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,150
but I was told he
died ten years ago

291
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,160
at the Battle of Boshin.

292
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,020
But I've always
felt the real truth

293
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,120
was he was assassinated
by a fellow slasher

294
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,000
that was probably hired by you.

295

♪

296
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,180
As a government official
I'm sure you understand.

297
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,050
I cannot go on record as
confirming your suspicions,

298
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,230
but the fact is, you are right.

299
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,270
Our government's aim was to
maintain national security.

300
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,270
By eliminating the slasher
in the shadows discreetly,

301
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,140
we accomplished that.

302
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,020
Makoto Shishio was a
very talented swordsman.

303
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,100
And he fancied himself
a social climber as well.

304
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,220
While maintaining his
secret role as an assassin

305
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,120
he developed contacts with high
ranking government officials

306
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,250
and gained our
confidence and favor.

307
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,250
Eventually the
assassinations he carried out

308
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,240
were so important that if
the government's involvement

309
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,060
ever became public knowledge

310
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,170
the Meiji government would risk

311
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,250
being overthrown.

312
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,100
He made it known that
if he did not receive

313
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,210
a large amount of cash and
a position in the government

314
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,170
he would go public
with his revelations.

315
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,260
Let me guess.

316
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,150
You created a monster and
then you decided to destroy it.

317
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,250
Shishio had become
completely unmanageable.

318
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,070
He was such a high risk
there was no other alternative

319
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,070
but to have him killed.

320
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,150
So we poured gasoline on him

321
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,290
and tried to burn him alive.

322
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,200
But our fiendish
scheme didn't work.

323
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,010
Shishio was severely burned,

324
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,280
but somehow he survived.

325
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,240
He recovered from this
near death experienced

326
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,050
and it deepened his resolve

327
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,060
to cause trouble
for our government.

328
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,080
Shishio surrounded
himself with the frustrated,

329
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,220
the war hungry and
greedy weapons dealers.

330
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,020
He's the leader of this
ragtag underground army

331
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,060
who all share his wish
to overthrow our government.

332
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,240
Every day more people
become committed

333
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,000

We sent in our army

But they were routed
by Shishio's forces.

336
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,240
So rather than risk
another embarrassing defeat

337
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,280

only one way to stop him.

345
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,080
I mean, why should he?

346

and now you want
Kenshin to bail you out.

Kenshin's not the man for this.

He's no longer a slasher
that lives for the kill,

I'd say you lost yours.

379

If our government fails
there will be no peace.

You wanna see no peace?

I don't know much about

but I have figured
out one thing.

384
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,270
If the situation was
just a little different

385
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,290
you might be hiring
us to kill Kenshin.

386
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,060
Sir Okubo, I understand
by what you've said

387
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,150
how important it is for you

388
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,180
to have Battosai
the slasher for this,

389
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,110
but he no longer exists.

390
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,030
Kenshin will not kill
no matter what the cause.

391
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,000
We will not allow
Kenshin to go to Ito

392
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,220
and risk being killed for you.

393
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,190
No way.

394
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,050
You can't expect that of him.

395
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,110
It's just not fair to
expect him to fix your mess.

396
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,040
And if need be we will protect
him from you with our lives.

What?

398

Hey, we need a decision
from him on this right away.

Be quiet.

Huh?

What, Sir?

I understand that this
decision cannot be rushed.

We're willing to give
you some more time.

404

We just hope that you'll
make the right decision

405

Yeah, couldn't believe it.

So what are you
gonna do about it?

409
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,150
I got it.

410
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,050
So Saito's working
for Okubo, huh?

411
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,240
What we'll do is
give Saito more money

412
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,160
and have him eliminate Okubo.

413
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,181
And in the process I can become
the next Home Minister myself.
