Hey, Captain!

167
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,240
Captain Sagara, take a look

168
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,230
at this great muskie we caught!

169
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,120
There's lots more like this one!

170
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,070
Hey, come on, stop wiggling!

171
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,150
Stop moving around so much!

172
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,050
Come on, stop it!

173
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,160
We had two other nice fish,

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,180
but they got away.

175
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,240
Aw, you didn't have
to tell him that, did you?

176
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,260
It's the truth, Sano,
that's what matters.

177

That's the discipline.

178
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,290
He taught us
to value individuals

179
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,100
regardless of station.

180
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,100
That's what he
believed in and fought for.

181
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,260
Yes, he gave us the dream
and then made it real for us.

my friend.

330
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,090
Our paths will
someday cross again.

331
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,140
It is meant to be."

No, he can't do it alone.

333

I don't know, I swear!

334

335
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,240
Tsunan Tsukioka?

336
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,851
You know that name, don't you?

337
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:05,850
New one on me.

338
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,691
Sorry, friend.

339
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:07,511
Thanks.

340
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,160
Hey, Sano, Sano!

341
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,190
Wait up!

342
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,100
What's up, guys?

343
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,190
You have something to tell me?

344
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,180
Hey, Sano, we just heard
a rumor and we thought

345
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,040
it might have something
to do with this guy.

346
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,210
You know, the one
you've been looking for?

347
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,050
Why, what did you hear?

348
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,030
There's some guy
over at the gaming parlor

349
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,250
who's been throwing
a lot of new money around

350
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,060
and claims he's
been getting rich

351
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,190
because of the Sekiho troop.

352
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,170
Sekiho?

353
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,080
What's this liar call himself?

354
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,070
Well, uh--

355
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,870
Shinzou!

356
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,140
I heard him call
himself Shinzou!

357
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,270
Thanks a lot
for telling me, fellas.

358
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,210
Hey, don't mention it.

359
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,210
We're on your side.

360
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,040
Just doing our
civic duty, you know?

361
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,280
No sweat, we're happy to help.

362
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
We'll see you later, Sanosuke!

363
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,200
I didn't give it any thought

364
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,030
till I read about it in
the paper like everybody else.

365
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,220
How was I supposed
to know they turned up

366
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,010
at the crime scenes?

367
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,230
As a matter of fact,
I really didn't even like

368
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,150
the prints when I first saw 'em.

369
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,180
I took them off
his hands as a favor.

370
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,260
And so, what you're saying
is someone came along

371
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,150
and bought the whole
lot of them, right?

372
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,290
You got a name or a description?

373
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,040
Who was your customer?

374
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
He bought only one
print to start with,

375
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,190
then he came back later
and took the rest of what I had.

376
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,160
When he did come back,
he had this great big

377
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,260
nasty-looking fellow with him.

378
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,100
Nobody used any names.

379
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,060
What was I supposed to do, huh?

380
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,010
They said I'd be
in real big trouble

381
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,200
if I told anybody about it.

382
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,120
You'll be
in trouble if you don't.

383
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,130
Oh, great, snake eyes!

384
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,050
All right, new shooter!

385
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,040
Look out now!

386
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,200
Ante up, gentlemen!

387
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,120
I'll never get used to losing,

388
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,160
even if I already have
more money that I can count!

389
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,090
Hey buddy, you're on
a real losing streak!

390
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,240
Can't hack it, huh?

391
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,130
It'd really bother me,
but it doesn't seem

392
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,160
to bother you at all.

393
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,170
You're a cool customer, pal.

394

Oh, yeah.

I'd like a piece of that action.

Have you thoroughly
scouted out next target?

Indeed we have.

420

The art collection of Shimizu
will bring us a nice fat income.

421
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,120
The local police
have been advised

422
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,220
to stay away

Mm-hmm, excellent.

424
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,040
Meanwhile, I have
used my position

425
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,010
in the Meiji government
to spread disinformation,

426

it keeps them away from us.

427
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,000
So it would seem,

someone's bound to see through

434
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,270
It is fortunate that
a massacre survivor

435

should provide us
with a cover for our activities.

to take too much for granted.

440
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,180
Men of deep conviction should
always be considered dangerous.

441
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,020
Twenty years as
a provincial policeman

442
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,170
taught me all I need to know
about the dangers of morality.

Same here.
