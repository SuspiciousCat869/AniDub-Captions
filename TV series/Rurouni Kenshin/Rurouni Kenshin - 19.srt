Ah!

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,110
Young Master Yutaro
lost both his parents

64
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,240
when he was
very small.

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,180
He became the master
of the mansion when

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,230
he was five.

67
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,170
His father was
very, very wealthy.

68
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,230
Five years old?

69
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,000
That's right!

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,260
As a matter of fact,
all the land you see here

71
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,040
belongs to him, too.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,210
Whoa!

73
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,060

Please, forgive
me, Master,

I have tried everywhere,
but I can't find anybody.

84
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,270
Now I've told you,
I want to start

85
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,040
learning kendo as
soon as possible.

86
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,130
So when are you
going to find me

87
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,220
a teacher?

88
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,080
Is that the young
Master Yutaro?

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,100
Mm-hmm.

90
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,030
Now go on,
find me a master

91
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,120
swordsman who is
as good as my father.

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,220
But your late father,
Yuzaemon, was one of

93
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,060
the greatest master
swordsmen of all time!

94
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,140

where we could

95
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,030
find anyone
that good!

96
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,160
I don't even
know where to look.

97
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,070
I want to be
a great swordsman

98
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,070
so my father will
be proud of me.

99
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,250
Find someone
who measures up!

100
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,060
Find him right away,

101
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,030
or you can look
for another job.

102
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,260
This young master's
nothing but a brat.

103
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,010
You understand?

104
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,070
Hmm?

105
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,020
Good morning,
Master Yutaro.

106
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,060
Would you like to
meet my visitors, or...

107
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,090
Who are they?

108
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,000
Are they your relatives?

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,100
Tell them they're
welcome to stay here

110
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,130
as long as they like.

111
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,170
Uh, they are
not my relatives,

112
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,030
but according
to my brother,

113
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,140
they are some of
the best swordsmen

114
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,020
in the land.

115
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,230
Ooh, that's quite
a grip, Hannah.

116
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,100
This one has an
impressive title

117
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,170
I can't remember.

118
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,020
Well, he doesn't
look very tough to me.

119
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,020
If he's so great,
bring him over here.

120
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's see
what he can do.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,220
(Yahiko growls)

122
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,020
All right, then,
let's see if you can

123
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,090
knock this
chandelier down

124
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,160
with your sword.

125
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,220
(gasp)

126
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,020
My father did it
with his sword.

127
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,150
It's a technique
called Raijin.

128
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,000
As a swordsman, my father
had no equal, none.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,230
So if you're not
as good as he is,

130
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,230
you're not qualified
to be my teacher.

131
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,170
Well, do it!

132
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,190
I would humbly decline.

133
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,200
Unfortunately,
I have no desire

134
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,260
to become your teacher.

135
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,290
What?

136
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,100
But I'll give you
your own house,

137
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,160
with servants,
if you like.

138
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,140
Arrgh!

139
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,260
Do you want a horse?

140
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll get you a horse.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,190
Ughh!!

142
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,210
That's it!

143
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,040
I can't take
this kid any longer!

144
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,260
You need to learn
some manners, pal!

145
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,150
Yahiko!

146
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,230
You haven't stopped
insulting people

147
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,160
since we've arrived here!

148
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,150
You can't insult
Kenshin like that!

149
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,240
Hey, let go of me!

150
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,050
You spoiled brat,
you don't deserve

151
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,140
Kenshin as a teacher.

152
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,040
Not only that,
you don't deserve

153
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,230
to learn how
to do kendo!

154
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,030
You can't speak
to him like that!

155
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,250
You think your money
will buy you everything!

156
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,240
Ha!

157
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,070
Ahhhhhh!

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
Ugh...

159
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,010
I'm sorry, but, uh,

160
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,140
there is some truth
to what Yahiko was

161
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,010
saying to you.

162
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,220
You do seem to
be pretty immature

163
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,270
about certain things.

164
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,070
Hey!

165
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,080
If you treat
your teacher

166
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,170
like a servant,
then you won't

167
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,280
learn anything.

168
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,290
A teacher must be
treated with respect.

169
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,070
Kendo is a
spiritual process.

170
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,000
Unless you change
your attitude,

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,020
you'll never have
the proper discipline

172
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,270
to learn the
martial arts.

173
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,000
How can you talk
to me like this?

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,030
You are guests
in my house!

175
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,020
I'm the Master!

176
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,290
Excuse me,
Young Master Yutaro?

177
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,070
But it's time to
take your daily ride.

178
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,090
Get out!

179
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,050
We'd be happy to,
Master Yutaro.

180
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,050
Master pain-in-the-butt!

181
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,110
Oh?

182
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,040
Don't you think
he reminds you

183
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,170
of someone you know?

184
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,040
Someone competitive
and stubborn,

185
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,290
just like you are?

186
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,240
No, not at all!

187
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,190
You left out the part
about them being childish.

188
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,060
He's probably not
such a bad guy, really.

189
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,942
He was brought up with
everyone treating him

190
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:37,966
like a king.

191
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,010
I mean, that
sort of treatment

192
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,160
would spoil anybody.

193
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,140
But I think
that underneath

194
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,110
all of that
is a good boy.

195
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,130
And with a
good teacher,

196
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,270
he would change
his entire attitude!

197
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,030
Young Master,
not so fast,

198
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,070
it isn't safe!

199

Shut up!

200
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,290
Who do these people
think they are,

201
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,130
talking to
me like that?

202
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,868
Ahhh!

203

204
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,130
Whoa, Master Yutaro,
are you all right?

205
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,140
His horse, get him!

206
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,130
Get the horse!

207
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,130

Don't kill him yet.

211
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,140
We have to ask
for a big ransom

212
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,240
from the mansion first.

213
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,150

we won't need him anymore.

Oh, no, children.

339
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,000
Huh?

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,270
You'll have to dry
your clothes off.

341
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,150
it'll be dark
and chilly soon,

342
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,000
and you'll both catch
your death of cold!

343
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,110
It's snack time!

344
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,190
Yummy!

345
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,150
Mmm!

That sword...

348
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,050
Something very strange
about all of this.

349
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,200
That Raijuta
Isurugi guy...

who is he,
what's his story?

351
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
So what's going
on at the mansion?

352
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,110
Huh?

353
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,260
Yutaro does
whatever Raijuta says.

354
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,000
And not only that,
he's brought some

355
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,050
other guys to stay
at the mansion.

356
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,150
And these men
are very rough.

357
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,230
Hannah, do you have
any idea who these

358
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,270
guys might be?

359
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,070
I have no idea,
but they act like

360
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,220
they own the place!

361
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,160
They've even sold off
several family treasures.

362
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,200
What?

363
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,180
They take the money
they get and buy

364
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,000
all kinds of
swords and spears.

365
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,120
They said something
about shinko style,

366
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,030
or something
like that.

367
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,240
Shinko style?

368
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,120
Kori, we got to go!

369
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,040
Huh?

370
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,050
We've got to help.

371
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,140
Yutaro is being
taken advantage of

372

by these swordsmen.

373

375

What's the
matter with you,

376
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,230
what are you
standing around

377
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,240
looking at?

378
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,210
Huh? Uh...oh.

379
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,160
Kenshin!

380
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,280
Sorry, I forgot.

381
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,050
Kenshin's got a lot
on his mind lately.

382
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,220
Yeah, I guess so.

383
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,080
This ridge will
be our defense.

384
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,150
Then our kingdom
will be complete.

385
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,260
Raijuta, do you
really think this

386
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,150
man will help us?

387
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,100
More importantly,
do you really think

388
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
this guy--

389
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,130
There's no
doubt in my mind.

390
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,060
That guy is Battousai,
the Slasher.

I told you to

I think that
sword's a little bit

much for you.

401

Don't talk
to me like that.

402
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,150
I meant no disrespect.

403

You need to go
back to the mansion.

414
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,170
But I want to stay
with my Sensei.

415
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,160
Go on, Yutaro.

Go, run along.

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,230
Listen, I need
to talk to you.

418
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,150
Yeah?

419
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,100
What about?

420
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,250
What do you think
of this Meiji era?

421
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,270
Swordsmanship reduced
to nothing more than

422
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,120
playing with
bamboo toys.

423
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,290
Tradition has gone
out the window.

424
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,250
It's a very sad era
for us proud Samurai.

425
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,010
A shame.

426
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,080
Together, we can
change all of that,

427
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,050
my friend.

428
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,030
We want you to join us

429
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,140
and bring back
the sword again.

430
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,080
Huh?

431
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,260
Your legendary
slashing power

432
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,100
would be a great
benefit to our cause.

433
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,150
You should join us,
we all used to be

434
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,040
honorable Samurai.

435
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,060
We have killed
thousands of enemies.

436
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,080
Then came the decree
prohibiting the wearing

437
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,140
of swords.

438
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,240
That's like telling
all of us to go die!

439
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,150
But how can we just
lay down our swords

440
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,210
and become
ordinary citizens?

441
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,020
We cannot!

442
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,040
We are going to
build our own country.

443
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,190
What?

444
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,000
Under my leadership,
armies who have practiced

445
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,260
diligently their
sword technique

446
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,120
will join along
with us and destroy

447
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,060
the present
government.

448
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,040
We will take over
this land of Izu

449
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,030
and become an
independent nation.

450
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,120
You're mad.

451
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,170
I don't think so.

452
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,270
The government will
hit us with everything

453
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,190
they've got,
but the ridge of Izu

454
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,210
will act as a
natural fortress.

455
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,200
We are the
masters of shinko.

456
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,140
We can match the
power of their guns.

457
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,150
We'll show them all
that the martial arts

458
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,120
are still the most
powerful art of fighting!

459
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,200
Hold on!

460
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,030
Innocent people will
be hurt or killed

461
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,120
by what you do,
thousands will suffer!

462
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,000
The price of war!

463
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,220
History has
taught us one thing--

464
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,070
that the strong
will always reign

465
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,260
over the weak
and helpless.

466
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,280
It has always
been that way.

467
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,200
You are the great
Battousai only when

468
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,120
you are wielding
your sword.

469
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,030
With your powerful
sword by our side,

470
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,240
we could make our
kingdom a reality.

471
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,090
I'll pass.

472
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,150
What?

473
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,140
My reverse-edged sword
is used to protect the

474
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,280
weak and the suffering.

475
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,020
It is not for building
a selfish kingdom for you.

476
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,020
You are all
well-trained Samurai,

477
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,040
surely you can use
your abilities for good

You coward!

480
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,060
Our lives will
be destroyed

481
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,260
if we don't
fight against them.

482
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,180
Your existence as
a former slasher

483

will be destroyed
as well, Battousai!

I have already
made a decision...

486

To continue my
retirement from slashing--

487

I'll never kill again.
