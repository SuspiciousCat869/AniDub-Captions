Bye!

495
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,040
Hello, Himura?

496
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Hmm?

497
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,240
Hmm.

498
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,270
I don't understand
why Shishio ran off,

499
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,130
maybe he doesn't do
his own dirty work.

500
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,160
He left a boy,

501
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,050
albeit a talented swordsman
to do a slasher's job.

502
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,250
We should enjoy
the fact we're alive

503
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,070
before the parade passes by.

504
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,040
I regret that I have
but one life to give

505
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,090
for my country,

506
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,280
but while I'm still alive
I refuse to be sad and mope.

507
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,150
Instead, we should celebrate!

508
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,070
You should always turn
your eyes up like this.

509
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,190
Sometimes you try to look cool.

510
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,040
Other times you just look crazy.

511
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,120
Or really lonely.

512
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,010
Or just close-minded.

513
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,010
Or you just cannot
see eye-to-eye.

514
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,110
But I like your happy eyes!

515
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,140
Okay?

516
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,090
Misao, you should really
come out of your shell

517
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,090
so you can learn how
to express yourself.

518
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,120
Well actually,
I've been working

519
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,220
on that a little.

520
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,010
(growls)

521
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,200
Am I getting the impression
that you're trying

522
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,100
to reach me with sarcasm?

523
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,240
You know I'm just
starting to like you?

524
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,250
After all, you
saved my life

525
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,260
when I jumped a chasm
and I'm falling for you

526
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
and then you pull this crap?

Huh?

529
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,050
Oh.

530
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,260
So, you do like me, after all?

531
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,080
Well, we've wasted enough time,
we better get going to Edo.

532
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,240
I don't think Shishio
will attack us

533
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,170
until we get to Edo,
so I really need

534
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,030
to pick up a sword
between here and there.

535
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,220
I can't believe he's
regarding my affection

536
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,230
so lightly that
he's just walking off!

537
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,270
I'm through being calm!

538
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,200
Ugh!

539
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,080

I could feel there
was a fierce battle

542
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,010
going on inside me.

543
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,210
Was I destined to be
Battousai the slasher, again?

544
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,170
Or Kenshin,

545
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,100
the peaceful wanderer?

546
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,040
I would find the answer in Edo.
