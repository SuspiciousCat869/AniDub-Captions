Let's take them
down from there

328
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,130
and give them a
proper burial.

329
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,030
-Good idea.
-Stop where you are.

330
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,220
Huh?

331
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,060
You can't take them
down from there.

332
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
Huh?

333
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,100
That is the
law of Shishio.

334
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,080
If you cut them down
without Senkaku's permission,

335
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,000
all of us will
get into trouble.

336
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,180
We don't know who you are,
but we have to live here

337
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,040
so mind your
own business.

338
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,140
How can you do this?

339
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,080
These people were
your fellow villagers,

340
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,190
you saw what
happened to them

341
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,060
and you're still
gonna do what Shishio

342
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,110
and Senkaku want?

343
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,110
How can you do that?

344
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,050
Because that's
what we have to do.

345
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,240
If any of us
break the law,

346
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,210
they will kill
us as well.

347
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,070
If we accept
their orders,

348
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,200
at least they
will let us live.

349
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,120
I don't want to cause
any more problems

350
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,170
for our village.

351
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,030
We've had enough
happen already.

352
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,180
Try to understand.

353
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,260
Now leave us alone.

354
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,040

Calm down.

357
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,160
There aren't that many
people who are willing

358
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,090
to sacrifice for
what is right,

359
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,200
and even fewer that will
protect the self-respect

360
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,050
and humanity of others.

361
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,260
Unlike food or water,

362
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,060
you don't need
dignity to survive.

363
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,080
You could say
what you want,

364
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,070
but you don't have
to live here, stranger.

365
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,210
The reason we're
in this mess

366

is that the police
couldn't help us anyway.

In this new era, Shishio
has made these people

live in fear and he has

Yes, but not

but this whole area.

397
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,280
This village is now a
territory of Shishio.

398
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,030
I'm afraid the police
have given up the idea

of taking it
back by force.

400
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,100
Why doesn't the
Japanese Army just invade

401
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,010
and make Shishio give the
village back to the people?

402
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,100
Because it's only
been six months

403

since we fought the Seinan War.

404

If the army comes out
for domestic disturbances,

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,200
foreign countries would
sense the uncertainty
