I'm already
feeding a big crowd,

168
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,190
one more at the
table won't matter.

169
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,180
That's very generous of you.

170
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,080
Don't get excited about this.

171
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,200
I'm warning you,
her cooking's awful.

172
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,170
Come on, you have to admit,
it's gotten better recently.

173
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,000
As a matter of fact,
I'd say it's almost edible.

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,130
It's an easy way
to commit suicide.

175
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,110
(laughing)

176
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,080
I don't see you starving!

177
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,240
This food is great.

178
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,280
Huh?

179
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,140
Yeah, I haven't had
anything this delicious

180
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,000
since I left home.

181
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,070
Well, I'm glad you like it.

182
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,200
It's obvious that
people who know good food

183
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,000
enjoy my cooking.

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Have some more.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,020
Thanks!

186
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,190
I appreciate it.

187
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,220
He's a champion eater,
that's for sure.

188
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,060
I guess that's
one competition

189
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,260
where he'll
never get beat.

190
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,070
Can I ask you something?

191
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,000
Did Senryoyama
harass you to the point

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,060
where you wanted
to quit the stable?

193
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,270
Well...

194
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,080
I don't know if that's
an accurate thing to say.

195
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,130
He was certainly strict,

196
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,120
but I'm the one who
lacked the ability.

197
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,000
For many years,
I was the strongest boy

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,110
in my hometown.

199
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,270
For as long as
I could remember,

200
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,120
I dreamed about
becoming a wrestler.

201
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,270
But when I got to Kyoto,

202
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,210
I realized I wasn't
good enough to excel

203
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,170
against the competition.

204
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,200
So, you mean,
instead of trying harder,

205
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,110
you're gonna just
give up your dream?

206
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,250
Well...

207
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,060
What would be the point?

208
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,080
He doesn't have
the desire to win,

209
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,140
so continuing to train
would just be a waste.

210
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,180
I think there's more
hope for him in sumo

211
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,020
than there is for you in kendo.

212
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,110
Why's that?

213
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,290
Because he's honest
about his shortcomings

214
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,220
and wants to improve himself.

215
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,070
And because he
appreciates my cooking,

216
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,040
which makes me feel
good about myself

217
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,180
and inspires me to do
something for him in return.

218
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,160
In fact, I'm so grateful,

219
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,090
I'm gonna train you, Toramaru.

220
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,080
You know sumo?

221
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,200
Not specifically.

222
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,220
But sumo and kendo
are both martial arts

223
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,000
and each one requires
the same discipline.

224
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,060
I'm a master of
the Kamiya style of kendo.

225
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,280
Don't worry, I can
handle the job.

Aw, come on.

Your training doesn't
qualify you to give

228
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,240
advanced sumo lessons
to someone, it's nuts!

229

Wanna bet on it?

That's one way to put it.

Yeah?

310

He must've decided
to give up sumo

311

and take up kendo.

312

He's so slow,

the stable master
heard what's going on,

-You did it, you did it!

502
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,250
So, Senryoyama,
I guess this is

503
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,040
what you were afraid of.

504
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,200
Oyakata.

505
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,110
Wha-what's going on?

506
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,070
You know very well
what's going on, Senryoyama.

507
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,260
You've been aware of
Toramaru's hidden talent

508
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,160
for some time.

509
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,110
But you were afraid
that someday he would

510
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,050
replace you as the number
one sumo in the stable,

511
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,280
so you made his
life miserable,

512
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,290
forcing him to run away.

513
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,140
You're saying Toramaru is
more talented than Senryoyama?

514
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,260
I'm surprised
you didn't pick up

515
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,030
on his natural abilities.

516
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,040
When he was thrown by
Senryoyama the other day,

517
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,060
his flexibility helped
him to avoid landing

518
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,190
on the child's toy.

519
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,170
And when the column
was about to crush Kori,

520
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,020
he tossed it aside
like a piece of paper.

521
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,230
He's the most talented
sumo wrestler I've ever seen!

522
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,090
The others were just too
jealous to tell him the truth.

523
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,220
I knew I was right about him!

524
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,140
I just had a feeling.

525
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,280
I guess I'm a better
judge of talent

526
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,150
than you thought,
Mr. Smarty.

527
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,180
This guy's gonna be
a grand champion.

528
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,020
Yeah, I guess
his only problem

529
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,230
is a lack of self-confidence.

530
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,270
We can work on that.

531
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,260
We can?

532
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,250
I'd be glad to
keep training you,

533
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,120
if you'd like
to come back.

534
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,140
Huh?

535
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,240
Would I like
to come back?

536
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,030
Of course!

537
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,280
I'm so happy
for you, Toramaru.

538
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,140
Yeah, me too!

539
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,270
We should all be happy
for you, Toramaru.

540
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,290
But if certain people
can't overcome their pride,

541
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,090
they may have
to leave the stable.

542
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,230
If you have the true spirit
of a champion sumo wrestler,

543
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,190
Senryoyama, you should
swallow that pride

544
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,270
and train Toramaru.

545
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,060
Help him achieve his dreams,

546
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,010
and you can make up
for what you've done.

547
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,110
What do you think, Oyakata?

548
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,200
Would that work?

549
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,030
If Toramaru is willing
to forgive Senryoyama

550
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,250
for his behavior.

551
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,090
I'll tell you this, Toramaru,

552
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,240
it would be
to your advantage.

553
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,200
Sumo is like any
other martial art.

554
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,210
You have to go up
against a tough opponent

555
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,160
to improve your
skills and advance.

You are right!

558
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,030
I wanna train
to be the very best

559
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,110
that I can be.

560
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,190
So, I ask you,
please help train me.

561
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,040
I'm touched.

Well, he may be
a champion sumo,

but he's still
a bit of a blockhead.

Kenshin's not much better.
