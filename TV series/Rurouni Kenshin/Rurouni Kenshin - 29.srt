Battousai lives

He doesn't have to be a great
detective to figure it out.

71
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,140
I did quite a lot of damage
to his friend and to his dojo.

He's got to know
it was me who did it.

Is that it?

79
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,040
That's right,
I'll lure him into a trap

80
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,030
and you can have the honor
of finishing him off.

Battousai is the Shinsen group's
