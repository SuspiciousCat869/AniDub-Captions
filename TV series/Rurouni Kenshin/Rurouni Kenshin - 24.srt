Money.

Oh, well, we'll

Yeah, we'll think of some idea!

that I'm gonna supply the money.

You can forget about it.

38
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,220
I hardly made enough
money in this dojo

39
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,150
giving hours of
sword fighting lessons

40
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,020

extra money in this house.

Hey, Kori, don't have
a conniption fit, all right?

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,120
I will take care
of the money, okay?

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,180
Just leave it to me.

47

You're going to get
credit from Lenny's?

That's a terrible plan.

49
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,030
We'll still have
to pay that off,

50
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,230
and that'll leave
us further in debt.

51
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,140
Don't worry, we'll do it here.

52
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,170

53
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,070
Yeah.

54
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,150
We can have a great time here,

55
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,170

anyone else, all right?

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,210

Then it's settled.

59
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,080
I'll go get some money.

60
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,010
Oh, Kori, do me a favor

61
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,270
and ask Megumi if
she would join us.

62
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,150
You want me to invite Megumi?

63
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,180
Yeah, if you wouldn't mind.

64
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,060
She's been a good
friend for a long time.

65
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,080
Besides, the more the merrier.

66

See you later.

67
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,120
Wow, that was incredible.

68
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,190
What was that all about?

69
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,050
I never thought he'd
invite Megumi for anything.

70
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,200
Every single time
they get together,

71
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,260
all they do is fight.

72
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,150
You know, you're right, Yoshi.

73
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,210
Sanosuke's not himself tonight.

74
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,110
I certainly hope he's not
sick or anything like that.

-Huh?
-Ah!

I know what he's so happy about!

77
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,140
He's excited that
the Sekiho troupe

78
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,250
has just been cleared
of any wrongdoing.

79
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,070
You just might have
something there.

80
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,090
Maybe that's it.

81
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,050
In that case,
we should party down.

83
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,240

Oh, Sanosuke,
this is quite a spread.

You really outdid yourself.

What I'm wondering is
where did you get the money

144
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,220
for all of this stuff?

145
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,050
You didn't do anything illegal

146
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,270
that would get us all
in trouble, did you?

147
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,100
Huh, I should have expected you

148
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,260
to say something
nasty like that.

149
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,060
You're still as
charming as ever.

150
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,030
Yeah?

151
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,270
Well, you have as
much charm as a snake.

152
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,290
You guys do this
every time we get together.

153
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,080
You're just birds of
a feather, you know that?

154
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,240
You know what you both act like,

155
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,210
like you're married.

156

Hey guys, take it easy,

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,130
this is a party!

160
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,190
We're supposed to have fun.

161
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,160
Let's not punch Yoshi for once.

162
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,000
It's a little late,

Let's celebrate!

164
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,230
Yay!

165
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,240
Yeah, sake!
