my family is gone.

327
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,120
My mother and
father passed away.

328
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,110
I don't want to
be alone anymore.

329
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,020
-Kori, stop!
-We better catch her!

Just where did she go?

334
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,170
Oh boy, I should've
tried to break the news

335
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,230
about Kenshin to her easier.

336
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,120
She's being so selfish.

337
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,260
Of course, people who
think they're in love

338
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,120
tend to always act selfishly.

339
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,040
We'd better look for her anyway.

340
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,150
Right now she's so crazy I
wouldn't put anything past her.

Kenshin!

You are leaving?

349

Her anger scares me more than
the thought of fighting Jinei.
