00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,090
would keep attacking
an injury like that.

172
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,040
Hm?

173
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,070
I told you.

174
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,170
It's the law of warfare

175
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,000
to keep attacking your
opponent's weakest point.

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,270
There's no such thing as dirty.

177
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,290
What is about to begin in Ito

178
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,150
is a battle of survival.

179
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,110
It's no place for
youngsters like you.

180
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,130
Stay put here in
Kyoto, little boy.

181
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,030
Don't go to Ito.

182
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,050
Do you understand me?

183
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,250
Aw, forget you!

184
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,070
I see.

185
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,120
Yoshi.

186
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,010
Katsu.

187
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,070
Stay out of it.

188
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,260
My shoulder doesn't hurt.

189
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,150
What really hurts is
that Kenshin thought

190
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,190
that I'd get in his way.

191
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,250
That hurts more than anything.

192
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,260
Kenshin is my friend,

193
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,160
I'll never be in his way.

194
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,240
Now get out or I'll
clean your clock!

Stay out of my way.

Hear me, Saito.

197
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,150
I'm going to shove
off now for Ito.

198

Yeah.

You really think your
fists will be helpful to him?

As a matter of fact I do.

Really?

204
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,040
You can't fight your
way out of a paper bag.

205

Oh, yeah?

206

Don't you dare trust him, Sano.

He's a dirty, cheating dog

and he'll do
anything to trick you.

Well, you don't trust

with your limited
brain capacity,

222
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,080
will realize that
when I beat you

223
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,110
your lack of skill is a
liability Kenshin can't afford.

he blocks me with
a little effort.

This guy's like a machine.

Sooner or later he's
gotta drop his guard.

to try and convince
someone like you.

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,200
If you wanna go to
Ito that badly then go.

303

Nothing I do or say

Come back here!

You know, conceited
people like you

don't last very long anyway

308
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,130
because you don't
know the basics

310

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,200
Looks like you won, Sanosuke.

Yeah, you defeated him.

314
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,070
You gotta be kidding,

315
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,160
that guy kicked my butt.

316
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,080
Yeah, I guess that he did.

317
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,110
Anyway, let's take care
of your wounds right now.

318
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,010
We really should patch
up that shoulder of yours.

319
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,100
Yeah.

320
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,170
Interesting.

321
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,180
When he was fighting with me

322
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,160
he didn't touch my shoulder.

323
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,010
He completely avoided it,

324
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,060
even when he threw
his first punch.

325
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,130
It was as if he was fighting me

326
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,070
at my level of skill.

327
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,090
He could have easily made
chopped salad out of me,

328
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,100
but he didn't for some reason.

329
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,270
That must be the power
of a Shinsen leader.

330
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,080
This is no time to be resting,

331
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,250
I've gotta get going.

332
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,200
Don't go, we've got to
take care of your wounds.

333
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,270
I'll be okay.

334
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,280
Yoshi, take care of
everything, will ya?

335
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,230
Make sure you take Kaoru

Uhhuh.

338

I'm going to get stronger
and better, I've got to.

You're only going

Can't you understand that?

In his way.

342
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,230
I am going to be stronger
by the time I reach Ito.

Look, her kimono's still here.

You're right, she's gotta
be somewhere around here.

You think we should
go look for her?

But you don't see me
laying around all day crying

411
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,070
I don't feel like
doing much of anything.

412
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,020
I just want you
to leave me alone.

413
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,160
So you don't wanna do
much of anything, huh?

414
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,290
If you could have
anything right now

415
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,200
what would you wish for?

416
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,290
I'd wish for Kenshin.

417
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,020
Then you should go to him.

418
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,120
I can't do that.

419
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,190
Maybe you're afraid that Kenshin

420
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,270
doesn't want you hanging
around, is that it?

421
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,120
I made some secret
medicine for Kenshin.

422
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,150
He told me last time I gave him
some that it worked very well.

423
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,260
Considering what's been going on

424
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,180
he could really use
some of this right now.

425
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,120
But I guess I can't ask a
crybaby like you to deliver it.

426
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,050
So I'll ask Yoshi.

427
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,240
And I'm sure that when
Kenshin gets this medicine

428
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,060
he'll remember me.

429
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,240
Even if he forgets
all about you.

430
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,230
Then tell me, why don't
you go all the way to Ito

431
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,190
and deliver it to him in person.

432
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,200
Do it yourself!

433
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,250
I'm afraid I can't.

434
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,290
I'm not lazy like you

435
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,160
and I have patients
to attend to.

436
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,070
I can't just leave
whenever I want to.

437
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,100
I have responsibilities.

438
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,140
Oh, your patients are more
important than Kenshin.

439
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,210
I guess that proves
that your feelings

440
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,090
don't really amount
to much, do they?

441
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,130
Oh!

442
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,250
Kaoru, you really should
be careful what you say.

443
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,050
I'm still the master of
the Kamiya Kasshin School.

444
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,070
Don't underestimate my ability.

445
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,200
Could we go home, right now?

446
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,050
Don't you dare
underestimate me, either.

447
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,180
I want you to look at me.

448
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,090
I became a doctor
to help others,

449
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,180
do you understand?

450
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,100
And as a way to make
up for my past crimes.

451
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,180
This is the path that
I've chosen to take

452
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,140
and it was Kenshin
who was responsible

453
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,110
for leading me to
this path I'm on.

454
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,090
I have him to
thank for everything.

455
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,120
Dying will not bring
those people back to life.

456
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,010
I can do better by using
my sword to help others.

457
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,220
I try to help as many as I can,

458
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,080
that's how I try to make amends.

459
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,220
You have a knowledge
of medicine,

460
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,250
it's a gift that could
save many people's lives.

461
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,120
You could help a lot of people.

462
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,250
Even more than the
sword of Battosai.

463
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,070
Become a doctor, Megumi.

464
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,150
Aid all the people that
are suffering, Megumi.

465
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,100
They all need your help.

466
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Not just the ones
who suffer from opium,

467
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,080
but the wounded

468
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,280
and the ones with diseases.

Please, Megumi.

470

Kenshin.

471
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,110
That's the reason that
even if Kenshin isn't around

472
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,130
I still have to take
care of the sick.

473
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,240
That's how I keep my
feelings alive for him.

474
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,230
You're just sitting there
feeling sorry for yourself,

475
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,240
don't you dare presume to
know how I feel about him.

476
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,080
At least I'm doing something.

477
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,140
What are you doing, huh?

478
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,140
What?

479
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,290
What are you going
to do now, Kaoru, cry?

480
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,090
You're hopeless.

481

I really thought you were
a lot stronger than this.

482

You really don't
understand, do you, Megumi?

483
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Kenshin told me to my
face he was going to leave,

484
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,240
he said goodbye to me.

485
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,090
Now do you understand
why I hurt so bad?

486
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,200
No, I don't.

487
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,220
Because you don't
know how I feel.

488
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,210
At least he said goodbye to you.

489
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,000
But he left here without
saying anything to me.

490
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,220
Nothing at all.

491

Instead of just sitting
around here all day crying

492
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,080
you should realize how
you really feel about him.

Hey, don't you understand?
