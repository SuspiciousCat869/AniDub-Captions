164
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,010
-Kenshin!
-Where are you?

165
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,250
(running footsteps)

166
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,260
There you are.

167
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,020
What's goin' on?

168
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,030
We were worried.

169
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,090
Jinpu Tai; I think
I just overheard

170
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,010
who they're going
to assassinate next.

171
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,768
(gasping)

172
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:05,020
All right, let's find
a way to stop them.

173
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,030
Why are they so committed
to assassination

174
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,110
as a political tool?

175
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,240
I hate to say it,
but I think it's my fault.

176
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,000
What do you mean?

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,120
You see, Touma's just using

178
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,090
exactly what he was
taught in my class.

179
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,210
Sensei.

180
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,140
What is it, Touma?

181
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,050
The class has heard
you've been appointed

182
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,080
the new head of
the Kyoto Patrol.

183
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,290
We're all very proud
to be students

184
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,240
of a such a respected teacher
of the Hino Haiito style.

185
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,110
The class wishes you well.

186
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,190
Congratulations, teacher.

187
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,270
Thank you, all.

188
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,180
What you have heard is true.

189
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,100
I will be leaving here soon,
and I want you to understand

190
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,050
why I accepted this
position with the Patrol.

191
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,030
Yes, sir.

192
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,150
Our nation is in danger

193
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,230
because the Royalists want
to restore their system.

194
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,050
They're willing to use
violence to achieve that end,

195
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,230
so in order to
save the country,

196
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,080
we must root out the
conspiracy and kill them all.

197
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,130
Please, Master,
I want to help.

198
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,210
When I'm good enough,
I want to come to Kyoto

199
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,260
and join your crusade.

200
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,140
I can't wait to prove
myself in battle.

201
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,130
Calm down, son,
this is no game.

202
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,290
You could be injured or killed.

203
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,040
I'm aware of that,

204
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,270
but I've decided to live by
the sword like you, Sensei.

205
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,070
I've become so good
no one is able to beat me,

206
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,180
and I'll only fight in
support of just causes.

207
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,130
What more is there
to say, Touma?

208
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,120
Good luck.

209
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,140
I used the time I had
left at the school

210
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,080
to teach my students
to be strong,

211
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,250
to be better fighters than any
opponents they would ever face.

212
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,130
Let's go again.

213
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,130
Touma was the
toughest student I had.

214
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,260
He was unstoppable

215
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,130
and completely devoted
to my technique.

216
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,160
But what this country needs
now is workers and statesmen,

217
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,000
not assassins.

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,170
Touma is a misguided kid who
was born into the wrong era.

219
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,260
He still believes he can
change the world with his sword.

220
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,030
I'm responsible, I'm the one
who taught him how to kill.

221
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,180
Now I have to kill him.

222
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,140
Sensei, you can't be serious.

223
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,170
You're no match for him,
you gave up the sword years ago.

224
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,200
-I have to try.
-Heihachirou,

225
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,150
you need us to help you,
and we're ready.

226
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,270
I thank you.

227
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,210
Hashizume,
is everything ready

228
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,010
for the assassination
of Yamagata?

229
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,110
It will be done tonight.

230
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,230
He was a good defense minister

231
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,230
before he started shooting
his mouth off about corruption.

232
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,240
He doesn't understand
the facts of life.

233
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,120
Money fuels politics.

234
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,180
How are you going
to carry it off?

235
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,240
The Jinpu Tai.

236
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,030
They'll get him on the
way home from the party.

237
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,240
Everything's already
been arranged.

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,100
He'll never know what hit him.

239
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,140
(chuckling)

240
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,100
By the way, how are you
going to handle the Jinpu Tai?

241
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,010
They're demanding
a voice in government,

242
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,010
you know that's unacceptable.

243
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,040
Don't worry, Minister,
once we're in power,

244
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,110
I will have them all killed.

245
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,250
They're too idealistic
to be of any use to us

246
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,140
except as assassins.

247
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,280

corruption in politics.

But to pull it off,
the first one cannot be so deep.

Battousai easily figured out
that the second one was coming,

and he took the necessary steps
to neutralize your attack.

the classic techniques,

apparently failed to learn.

Your swordsmanship

in this case.

408

It was obvious these
assassinations weren't random.

409

Mm-hm.

411
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,000
Mr. Hashizume, all the people
who were murdered were officials

and your power brokers.

413

The thread running through
this conspiracy is obvious.

I now have enough evidence.

You have no proof of anything.

I protest, you can't hold me
for these crimes, I'm innocent!

On the contrary, Mr. Hashizume.

421
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,010
Your fellow conspirators
have already confessed.

422
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,000
It's over, you might

433
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,160
I was behind the whole thing.

434
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
Just don't let him get near me!

435
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,270

Your pride and ambition
convinced you you were right,

447

of many good people.

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,180
The only salvation for you
is to admit your crimes

450
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,010
and accept your punishment.

451

He probably thought

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,110
instead of killing them.

488
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,150
Sort of a way of
improving their karma.

489
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,200
You know what, Sano,

490
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,230
you should think about
turning over a new leaf.

491
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,180
Your past is nothing
to brag about,

492
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,110
and your karma could
use some improvement.

493
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,200
I'd be happy to instruct--

494
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,270
Why, you little punk,
I oughta rip your head off!

495
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,120
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about!

496
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,110
I think you both could
use a karma transplant.

497
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,010
Don't pull my finger!

498
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,130
Well, one thing's for sure,

499
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,040
everything's back
to normal around here.
