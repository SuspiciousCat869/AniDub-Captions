WEBVTT

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.767
[DENJI panting]

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:35.244
[DENJI panting]

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.854
[DENJI]
Better get to work.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:03.855
[POCHITA barks]

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:29.047
[DENJI] Tree cuttin' nets me
about 60 thousand yen a month.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:34.261
And that kidney I just sold was,
uh, one point two mil.

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:38.223
My right eye was 300 thousand.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.309
Sold one of my nuts, too.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.728
How much did that go for again?

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.314
Not even a hundred K, I think.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:54.406
[DENJI] So, as of today,
I owe over 38 million yen.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:55.532
[POCHITA barks]

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.201
[growls]

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.163
What, Pochita?
You ready to kill something?

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.999
Well, that makes two of us.

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.209
[DENJI] Most devils ain't
what you'd call "good,"

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.463
but a dead one's good
for about 300 thou.

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:15.927
Huntin' devils is easily
the best way to make some cash.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:05.454
[sighs] Yeah, this thing's
gotta be the Tomato Devil, sir.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.498
Burn the seeds or it'll use 'em
to come back for round two.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.126
[YAKUZA A]
Ah, excellent work, Denji.

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:12.961
Someone on the
black market is bound to

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.380
pay a hefty sum
for this fresh corpse.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.132
How's 400 thousand sound to you?

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:18.300
Sounds awesome!

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.718
[YAKUZA A]
That's before subtracting your

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.470
debt payment and
interest, though,

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:24.306
which whittles it down
to 170 thousand.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.808
Then there's the
finder's fee, admin fee,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.895
management costs, and so on.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.522
[DENJI]
Just 70 K left for me.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.734
I definitely gotta use this cut
to pay the water bill,

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:39.404
then there are the debts
I still owe to other people.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.406
Funny how that works.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.868
We're already down to
eighteen hundred yen, Pochita.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.995
There's nothin' to eat
back at our place,

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:49.206
which means we have to make
this eighteen hundred yen

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.333
last the rest of the month.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.919
For dinner tonight,
let's go full-on carb-ivore

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.296
and split a slice
of bread, okay?

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.011
I really don't
understand why you hire

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.514
a punk like that
to take out devils.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.934
It's to ensure he pays off
the mountain of debt he owes us.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.977
Though his worthless
dead dad accrued it,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.146
Denji's the one
stuck with the bill.

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.190
Is a broke-ass kid
and his creepy little pet

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:17.442
honestly the best fit
for this sort of job?

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.445
Authentic Devil Hunters
wouldn't do what Denji does.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.823
Dealing the carcasses
of their kills to the yakuza

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.991
is too scandalous for them.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.201
But not him.

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:29.830
Denji's biggest perk
is how obedient he is.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.169
[GOON A]
Hey, Fido!

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.170
[DENJI]
Hm?

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:41.550
I'll give ya a hundred yen if
you swallow this cigarette. Hm?

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:44.469
Whoa! You will?

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.305
Alrighty, down the hatch
this sucker goes!

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:52.018
[laughs]

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.478
[YAKUZA A]
We'll be in touch.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.399
Keep in mind, you're pig slop
if you try to skip town.

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:05.740
[chuckles]

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.125
Now we're set for
another three days.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.293
[POCHITA barks]

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.755
[DENJI]
Guess what I found out recently.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:24.885
It's considered "normal" to
eat your bread with jam on it.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.803
Too bad normal's
a pipe dream for folks

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:29.264
down on their luck like us, huh?

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:33.059
Bet that I'll bite the big one
before I ever pay off this debt.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.023
Prolly won't kick it with a girl

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.483
before I kick
the bucket, either.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:43.945
My rinky-dink shack doesn't
exactly scream romance,

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.947
and no dough to go on dates.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.782
[whimpers]

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:52.954
If dreams do come true,

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:56.041
then before I croak,
I wanna be with a girl.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.308
[YAKUZA A] That cowardly
bastard strung himself up

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.061
before paying this
month's installment.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.648
Look, kid. I don't care if you
beg or whore yourself out.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.859
I want 700 thousand yen
by tomorrow.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:27.530
Otherwise, we chop you up
and sell the bits. Got it?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.458
[chainsaw revving]

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.877
[POCHITA growling]

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.629
[DENJI]
A chainsaw?

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:43.672
[gasps]

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.969
[DENJI]
It's a devil.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.597
Hurry up 'n' do it
if you're gonna kill me.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.391
I'm dead either way.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:57.602
[POCHITA growling]

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:01.564
[POCHITA groaning]

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.235
[DENJI]
You're hurt.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.862
Death's comin'
for both of us, huh?

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:13.952
[DENJI gasps]

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:15.203
Take a bite!

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.454
I heard that by drinking blood,

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.207
devils can heal whatever
wounds they've got.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:22.377
If you don't wanna die,
then bite me!

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.805
[groans]

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.182
My blood doesn't come free.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.351
You're signing a contract!

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.687
I helped you out
and saved your life.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.064
Now, return the favor.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:49.487
[DENJI] Because, like you,
I'd rather not die yet.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:09:01.332
[DENJI panting]

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.876
Here's an idea.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:06.296
Hire me as a devil hunter
so I can pay off what I owe.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.889
I'm way too hungry
to sleep right now.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.807
I think about money
when I can't sleep,

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.727
which makes falling
asleep even harder.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:26.191
[DENJI] When I do cop some z's,
I know what dream I wanna have.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.944
Gonna put jam on all my bread
and split every piece with you.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.280
Then I'll lay on the charm
and flirt with a girl.

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:34.199
We'll spend the night
playing video games together

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.659
and hug each other
as we doze off.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:38.953
Sweet, right?

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.288
[barks]

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.960
[DENJI coughs]

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.219
[barks]

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.387
[DENJI]
This just runs in my family.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.431
They said my mom died
from a heart condition

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:00.183
that made her cough up blood.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.851
[knocking]

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.438
[YAKUZA A]
Got a new devil for you, Denji.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.440
Time to go to work.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.879
[DENJI]
Wish they'd let me dream,

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.006
at least for a little bit.

00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:00.160
[DENJI] You sure a devil
showed up in here, sir?

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:06.791
Apart from us,
I don't see a soul.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.544
You think it's hiding somewhere?

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:13.256
Or maybe it made like
a bird and flocked off.

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:22.640
[gasps]

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:25.977
[YAKUZA A]
Denji, my boy.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:29.731
You know we're grateful
for your years of service, yes?

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:31.524
Um, yeah, o' course.

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.110
[YAKUZA A] You're as loyal
and obedient as a dog,

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:37.989
and to top it off, you work for
cheap treats like one as well.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.866
[DENJI]
Uh...

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.284
[YAKUZA A]
Only problem with dogs is

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:44.037
I can never tolerate the stench.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.503
[coughs]

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.426
[YAKUZA A]
The yakuza may be powerful,

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:02.722
but even the ones on top dream
of getting bigger and richer.

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:07.727
So we took a page from your book
and struck a deal with a devil.

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:11.314
[YAKUZA A] We wanted
to obtain demonic power

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.566
and see ourselves grow stronger.

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.526
[ZOMBIE DEVIL]
Whereas I want to see every

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:19.072
Devil Hunter
in existence perish!

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.533
I have to tell you,
little Devil Hunter.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.994
I've met rocks that were
smarter than these louts.

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.663
Such gullible fools!

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:29.415
I offered them a shred
of my demonic power,

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.668
and they willingly
handed their freedom to me

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.461
on a silver platter.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:34.420
Little did they know,

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:37.340
the power they sought would
turn them into zombies,

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:39.759
since I'm the Zombie Devil.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.011
You really should've
chosen an occupation

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:44.055
that doesn't butcher my kind.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.225
Because now I
have to butcher you.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.936
[ZOMBIE DEVIL]
Go, mindless minions.

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:52.272
Tear him apart and
toss every piece you collect

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.065
into the dumpster.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.400
[DENJI]
Shit!

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:04.993
[coughing]

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.709
[DENJI]
Where's the exit?

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:25.930
[coughs]

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.601
[DENJI]
Get off me!

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:38.401
[DENJI screams]

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:42.613
[screaming]

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.157
[DENJI]
It's not like I was asking

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:46.659
to be freakin'
king of the world.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:50.371
Just dreaming of a normal life
was enough to keep me going!

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:51.914
[DENJI screaming]

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:55.501
[DENJI] But I don't even
get to have that much?

00:13:55.543 --> 00:14:02.550
[DENJI screaming]

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.546
[DENJI]
Pochita. Pochita!

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.091
Rise 'n' shine.
We've got a long day ahead.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:46.010
[chainsaw revving]

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.273
[DENJI] Real talk?
I'm 99.9 percent positive

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.943
I'm gonna die fighting
a devil someday.

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:05.279
And my one regret will be
leaving you on your own.

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:08.658
What if you can't feed yourself
and just starve to death?

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:12.120
Or another Devil Hunter
slaughters you in cold blood?

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.542
There are some
devils in the world

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:21.003
that can take over dead bodies,
or so I've heard.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.506
If you happen to be
one of 'em, Pochita,

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.049
I hereby give you
full permission

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.301
to take whatever's left of me.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.762
[DENJI] Wait until
after I'm buried, though,

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:32.723
so the yakuza won't
be on your case.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.601
Then you could up and
leave this town,

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.603
and be ordinary.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.400
[DENJI]
I want you to live a normal life

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.735
and die a normal death.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.783
You'll live out
the dreams I never could.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.562
Pochita.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:20.771
[barks]

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:25.693
You did it, huh?
Took my body like I asked?

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:28.446
Just so you know,

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:29.989
I've always loved
listening to you

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.866
talk about your dreams, Denji.

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:33.784
[gasps]

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.912
Here's a new contract for you.

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.414
This time,
you're getting my heart.

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:41.125
In exchange,
show me your dreams.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.752
That's all I ask of you.

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.003
Pochita!

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:50.593
[panting]

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.803
[DENJI]
I'm in one piece.

00:16:58.476 --> 00:16:59.727
Pochita?

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:06.317
[ZOMBIES groaning]

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.278
[ZOMBIE DEVIL]
Hm? What's going on here?

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.864
You're still alive
after being cut to ribbons?

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.658
Repulsive freak!

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.744
I hate devil hunters because of
how persistent you are!

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:17.954
Go ahead and eat him.

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.373
Let's see 'im bounce back
from being devoured!

00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:25.795
[ZOMBIES groaning]

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:28.548
[DENJI] These guys had
plenty goin' for 'em already.

00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:31.425
Why is it they wanted even more?

00:17:32.343 --> 00:17:34.178
[DENJI]
Or maybe we're alike.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.182
Pochita made me happy,
and that shoulda been enough,

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:41.310
but I kept on dreaming
of a better life.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:46.649
[DENJI] I guess we all fantasize
about getting an upgrade.

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.986
Can't really say
I blame you for that.

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:52.905
Dreaming's not
a bad thing, but...

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.993
[DENJI] If you're gonna
get in our way...

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:01.455
...then you can all die!

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:07.086
[ZOMBIES grunting]

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:13.551
Eating him's bound to
keep that whelp dead for good.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:19.390
[ZOMBIES grunting]

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:22.560
[revving]

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:23.644
Huh?

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:27.106
[revving]

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:28.232
[ZOMBIE DEVIL]
Huh?

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.612
[DENJI yells]

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:40.911
[growls]

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.168
What in the world are you?

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:48.586
Did that runt of
a devil you were with

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:51.380
take control of your body?

00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:53.716
That means you're one of us!

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:57.386
[gasps]

00:18:57.428 --> 00:18:59.472
[ZOMBIE DEVIL screams]

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:05.186
[DENJI cackling]

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:10.316
[ZOMBIE DEVIL screaming]

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:11.609
[DENJI groans]

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.155
[DENJI]
My back...

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.753
[ZOMBIE DEVIL groans]
It hurts!

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:33.214
Stay away!

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.132
[ZOMBIE DEVIL grunts]

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.175
Huh?

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:40.429
Move!

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:43.432
[ZOMBIE DEVIL]
Get back! Don't come any closer!

00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:46.060
Don't you dare
budge from that spot!

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:48.771
Stay where you are, you freak!

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:57.363
[DENJI grunting]

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:04.203
[ZOMBIE DEVIL gasps]
Go away!

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:07.832
[DENJI yells]

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.583
[gasps]

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.961
[yells]

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:15.673
[ZOMBIE DEVIL screaming]

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:20.594
[yelling]

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:32.440
[ZOMBIES grunting]

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.991
[DENJI]
You guys went full devil,

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:44.994
right down to your twisted,
greedy little hearts.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:46.912
[DENJI]
And I'm out here tonight

00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:49.206
'cause you said you
had a job for me.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.000
I'm on the clock.

00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:53.544
So I should kill
you devils dead!

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:58.966
[DENJI cackling]

00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:03.763
Oh, yeah! Once you jerks are
worm food, it's bye-bye debt!

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:05.264
[cackles]

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.975
I won't owe a damn thing!

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:14.190
[DENJI cackling]

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.897
[MAKIMA]
Someone beat us to the punch.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.616
Looks like that one
there is still alive.

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:24.009
Huh. Your scent is
rather peculiar.

00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:27.179
It's neither a human's
nor a devil's.

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:32.101
So then, this your handiwork?

00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:38.774
[DENJI]
Please, will you hold me?

00:22:57.543 --> 00:22:58.961
He's a human.

00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:01.839
Is there any indication
that he's been possessed?

00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:06.135
[MAKIMA] None. It'd be written
all over his face if he were.

00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:10.931
Just so we're clear, I'm a
Public Safety Devil Hunter.

00:23:10.973 --> 00:23:13.976
I came to kill the
Zombie Devil that was here.

00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:20.858
[MAKIMA]
You have two options:

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.653
either you die by my hand
as a depraved devil,

00:23:24.695 --> 00:23:28.157
or you let me keep you
as a human being.

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:31.952
For the record,
my pets get delicious food.

00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:42.630
Delicious food, huh?

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:45.132
So what's on the breakfast menu?

00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:48.052
[MAKIMA]
Hmm. Bread with butter and jam

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:50.137
is always a given at my table.

00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:52.056
Coffee and salad's also good.

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:55.309
And then, maybe, dessert?

00:23:55.351 --> 00:23:56.810
Yeah.

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:01.815
[MAKIMA]
Hm?

00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:08.656
It's like one of my best
dreams ever just came true.
