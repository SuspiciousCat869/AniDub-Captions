00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:15.474
[AKI groaning]

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.441
[HIMENO]
Take this instead.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.738
[AKI] It rots your bones,
and I need mine.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.990
[HIMENO] I have a hunch this is
gonna be a long partnership,

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.701
so it'd be awesome
if you smoked.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.750
[AKI]
I'm only smoking one.

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:45.128
This is the first and last
cigarette I'll ever light up.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.799
Yes, I win!
Here, use my lighter.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.094
[AKI] Pretty terrible mentoring,
forcing a minor to smoke.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.637
Wait, you're a minor?

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:54.930
[AKI]
Uh, yeah?

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:59.434
Well, obviously,
smoking's out for you, duh!

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.019
[sighs]

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.566
Give it here.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.486
I'll just hafta hang onto this.

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:11.780
Back in the pack it goes.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.617
I'll return it one day, though.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.744
As soon as you're
a full-fledged grownup

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.496
ready for a good addiction.

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:26.503
[AKI panting]

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.156
[AKI] The Ghost Devil
doesn't have eyes.

00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:38.617
It uses fear to see.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.535
Thanks for explaining
that, Himeno.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.371
[gasps]

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.681
[AKI]
Himeno.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:04.726
[AKI]
I'll be with you soon.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:09.564
[AKI grunts]

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:20.737
Snake--!

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:21.655
Don't.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:22.823
[gasps]

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:44.219
Kobeni, why stay with the force
when you could've left?

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:51.601
Because our bonuses are
right around the corner.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.032
[DENJI]
Hm?

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.580
Ew, gross!

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.124
Huh? If it's meat, I eat.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.543
Bovine, porcine, human--
it matters not!

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.712
It sure as hell does!

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.381
[DENJI]
You better not try to munch on

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.258
that Samurai Sword dude.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.553
Our mission is to capture him.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:27.971
Got it?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.066
They haven't seen we're here.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.736
Don't make any loud noises.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.573
[POWER] You stand in
the presence of Power!

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:47.449
Huh?!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.118
We'll defeat them
with ease. 'Tis a battle!

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.162
[ZOMBIES groan]

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.539
Denji. Take heart and follow me.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.000
My back is yours to protect!

00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:01.588
[POWER grunts]

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.632
Ha! What say you now?

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.050
I have not fled!

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.011
I am proud and beautiful!

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:12.057
[POWER]
A worthy adversary appears.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.600
Denji. Observe.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:15.018
Bear witness to this day!

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.688
And tell the tale of Power,
the greatest of them all!

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.524
[POWER cackling]

[yawns]

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.926
Been lookin' for you, Sideburns.

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.469
Whoa, whoa, hold on a sec.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.554
Let's you and I have a chat.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:52.889
[DENJI]
Hm?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.435
Based on how you
decide to play it,

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.397
we're willin' to give up
'n' turn ourselves in.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.481
We just want a little closure

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:04.359
to take summa the sting
outta this anger.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.407
[SAMURAI SWORD]
Denji, it's no secret you killed

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.909
their friends and my granddad.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.787
Why not atone and
right your wrongs?

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.373
I mean, somebody else
killed 'em first.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.291
Those guys were zombified, dude.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.835
Don't you fucking lie!

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:25.088
Little shits like you
are always blowin' smoke!

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.841
All right, fine.

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:31.052
Say that whole zombie scenario
was the hard truth.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:34.556
They were still human at
one point. And you killed 'em.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.808
Don't you feel the slightest
shred of remorse?

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.144
Nah, I'm good.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.854
[SAMURAI SWORD chuckles]

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.273
Y'know, I've been put through
the wringer, too.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:47.902
Sawatari replaced my heart
with the Katana Devil somehow.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.821
But even I have trouble
sleepin' on nights

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.281
when I've slipped up
and sent zombies

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:54.034
on another trip
to the afterlife.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.745
I ain't completely heartless.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.289
But I guess that just
makes one of us, huh?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.709
If you got any kind of
conscience left in there,

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:06.004
you should do the world
a favor and let us kill you.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.094
No thanks.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.973
Then that's that.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.100
I'll carve up your
scrawny ass even more!

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:22.187
I'd like to see you try!
Heh, heh!

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:29.611
[DENJI]
Heh heh!

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:30.528
What the--?

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.280
[DENJI] Thought my
scrawny ass was grass.

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:35.325
What happened, huh? I'm waiting!

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:43.500
[DENJI yells]

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.085

You're lookin' a lot
sharper than before.

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:37.470
Tell me, what's the reason
that keeps you fighting?

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:41.349
[DENJI] I wanna protect
my new lifestyle. I guess?

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:45.436
Ah, so you've been livin' the
good life with Public Safety?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.439
Eh. It ain't all good.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.067
Hafta put up with
a nag and a brat.

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.778
But, hey. Could be worse.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.072
So, like it or not,
I'm kickin' your ass.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:59.576
Miss Makima'll praise me
all day for it.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.579
Cocky for someone who
has no hope of winning.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.456
What? You really think
you've got me beat already?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.417
If I got a pulse,
I got a chance!

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.127

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:43.526
Send backup.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.820
[DENJI] Wanna get in
on this, too, Hayakawa?

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:48.156
I guarantee it'll be the tits!

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.616
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.871
[DENJI]
I figured since he shot Himeno,

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.664
we should get to
take shots at him.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.791
It's only fair, yeah?

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.087
Except it'll be like a contest!

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:06.466
We'll take turns giving him
the hardest nut shots we can,

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.342
and whoever gets
the loudest scream outta him

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.887
before the cops show up
is the winner!

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.430
What kinda psycho are you?

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:13.931
[DENJI chuckles]

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:17.477
[AKI sighs]

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.690
What? You ain't gonna play?

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.068
[AKI]
Our job is to catch this guy,

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.321
and we're still on a mission.

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:31.949
We shouldn't torture him to
make ourselves feel better.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.076
Not like it'll bring her back.

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:36.746
I doubt she would even approve.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.208
Huh. Oh, yeah?

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:05.942
[AKI]
So.

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:09.237
What do I get if I'm the winner?

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:14.075
Heh. I thought his family jewels
would make for a nice prize!

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:15.701
[AKI chuckles]

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.995
[SAMURAI SWORD] Wait. You--
You aren't really gonna do it,

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:20.915
are you? Guys, come on--!

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:38.224
[sighs]

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:41.310
[yawns]

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:53.864
[screams]

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.909
[DENJI]
Yeah!

00:17:56.951 --> 00:18:00.788
[AKI] Himeno. Can you
hear this up in heaven?

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.789
[AKI grunts]

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:04.959
[screams]

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:09.630
[AKI]
It's a requiem from us to you.

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:17.096
[MAKIMA] These terrorist
attacks were instigated

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:19.724
by a former Devil Hunter
from the private sector

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.226
named Akane Sawatari.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.228
She had a contract
with the Gun Devil

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.939
and distributed firearms
to the yakuza,

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.567
but the payment she
demanded wasn't monetary.

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.485
She apparently wanted
the Chainsaw Devil's heart

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:33.321
in exchange for the guns.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:36.198
Is that all? You stopped
before you explained

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.243
why that girl was after
the Chainsaw Devil's heart.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.330
Unfortunately, we lost
our chance to ask.

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:43.998
[gasps]

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:48.002
[screams]

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:49.462
[EXECUTIVE B]
Suicide, huh?

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:51.380
[MAKIMA] Perhaps triggered
automatically by some

00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:55.134
stipulation in her contract
with the Gun Devil.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:58.095
On the upside,
we recovered 1.4 kilograms

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.139
of Gun Devil flesh
from the building.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.183
After combining that
with the five kilograms

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:04.727
already in Public
Safety's possession,

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:08.814
our piece, at long last,
gravitated toward the main body.

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:11.359
[EXECUTIVE B]
Then it's finally time.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.153
Just where is it headed, though?

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:26.220
[snoring]

00:22:28.389 --> 00:22:35.437
[DENJI panting]

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:09.263
[DENJI]
It's that same dream.

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:15.477
[DENJI] I always have it
and then I always forget it.

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:18.522
[POCHITA]
Denji.

00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:22.318
[DENJI gasps]
Pochita? Come on out!

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:23.652
Why're ya hidin'?

00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:26.322
Can I at least pet you
in a dream, buddy?

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.074
[POCHITA]
Stop.

00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:32.661
Don't open that door
no matter what.

00:23:57.728 --> 00:23:59.939
[REZE]
Tell me, Denji.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.315
If you had to choose between

00:24:01.357 --> 00:24:04.068
the country mouse
and the city mouse,

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.986
which would you rather be?
