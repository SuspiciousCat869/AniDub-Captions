[MAKIMA] Going after a civilian
devil hunter's target

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.157
is forcible obstruction
of business.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.285
Normally, you'd be
arrested for it.

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:36.745
Listen, Power.

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:39.873
You're going to need to think
a bit more before taking action.

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.543
Make sure you keep her
under control, Denji.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.878
[DENJI gasps]
You blame me?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.923
[MAKIMA] I blame Power's
Blood Devil inclinations.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:49.007
Though she's now a Fiend

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.343
and her talents are
useful in battle,

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.805
they get her blood pumping
in a couple ways.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.724
Suppose she might not
be Devil Hunter material.

[DENJI gasps] You liar!
Jeez! Stop making crap up!

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:08.652
Nay, I have made up no crap!

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:10.862
But you! You told me
to obliterate the target

Fake-ass faker!

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.332
Miss Makima should
arrest you for fraud!

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.960
Hark! More calumny, even now!

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:28.547
Devils don't tell lies.
Deception is a human tactic!

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:30.424
[DENJI]
First time I heard that one!

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:34.136
Lying about lying proves
you're guilty, shit-for-brains!

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:36.763
[POWER] 'Tis human nature
to speak falsehoods!

[DENJI] Quit talkin' all funky
to sound cooler than you are!

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.811

Please keep it down, you two.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:48.650
Right. That I shall.

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.027
Huh?

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.947
Thank you. Good girl.

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:55.782
Honestly, I'm not
interested in knowing

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.118
who was at fault
for this mishap.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.455
You thriving as a pair
is all that matters to me.

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:04.166
Is that something you think
you can demonstrate?

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:07.336
Yes! I--! We will.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.197
[DENJI]
Maybe this ain't the time to be

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.699

[CAT A meows]

Just slurpin' down drinks is
another dream come true for me.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.932
If we keep screwin' up
like we did today, though,

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.517
bein' thirsty
drops to the bottom

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.602
of my list of problems.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.271
[DENJI] That thought
should make workin' with

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:11.733
some lying chick
easier, but nah.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.946
[POWER] I only take pleasure
in the company of cats.

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:19.199
I hate humans
with all that I am.

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.743
And it's not because I have
a personal grievance.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:24.830
Despising mankind is almost
like a demonic instinct.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.040
And devils are
equally abhorrent!

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:32.379
I hate them, too, since one
took my pet cat, Meowy, away.

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.673
Before I was able to save Meowy,

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:37.384
Makima caught me
and thwarted my plans.

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:42.180
Meowy may already be dead,
but still, I can't give up.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:45.183
If it permits me to retrieve
that which I have lost,

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.770
I will even stoop so low
as to ally with mortals.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.731
I doubt you'd
understand such sentiment

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.524
for the likes of a feline.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:55.986
[DENJI] All for a cat?
That's dumb as hell.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.904
I know I'd go to some
pretty extreme lengths

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.323
to fondle some titties, though.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:05.162
[POWER] The human psyche
is a truly perplexing thing.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:11.334
Ohh. I think I might get it
if it was for a dog.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.922
Since you find the prospect of
groping breasts intriguing,

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.800

a reward for saving Meowy.

Nay. Forced to idly
while away my time in here.

place of Meowy's cat-napper,

alas, the cat becomes
a fluffy shield.

Should that transpire,
all is lost.

[sighs] Your words suggest
Pochita is dead.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.987
Death is the absence of life.

Nothing lives in your heart,

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:31.451
It's just a pathetic attempt
at self-comfort.

Yeah, true. Guess you're right.

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:51.096

[EXECUTIVE A]
The American matter has got

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:04.234
the Soviet war hawks crowing
louder and louder by the day.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.944
And the military
use of devils has been

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.697
doing rounds in
the rumor mill, too.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.865
We can only pray
devils remain Japan's

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.994

[EXECUTIVE B] I'm curious,
how have those hunting dogs

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:18.748
been performing in the pack?

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.417
Well, there's one
that's promising,

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:23.878
and one that's...
interesting, I'd say.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.964
Interesting?

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.466
A recently adopted pup.

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.970
Just don't form
unnecessary attachments.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:34.139
They aren't your lap dogs.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.849
Get these hounds
through obedience school

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.600
and put 'em to work.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:57.829
I think you meant disgusting
when you said interesting.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:02.250
[AKI] Why do you have
such high hopes for Denji?

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:20.769
There isn't a devil in existence
that was born nameless.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.855
And the more a devil's name
is feared by the world,

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.357
the more powerful it becomes.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.235
[MAKIMA]
Take coffee, for instance.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:32.322
It might scald you,
but it isn't very intimidating,

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:35.408
so a Coffee Devil
would probably be weak.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.452
Cars paint a much scarier image

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:40.872
since plenty of people dread
crashes or getting run over,

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.416
which would make
a Car Devil strong.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.506
What's interesting
is how Denji's part devil.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.635
The Chainsaw Devil at that.

00:09:57.055 --> 00:10:00.850
[AKI] Being interesting may not
coincide with being useful.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.812

Everyone in Public Safety has

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:10.193
But Denji is only doing this job
so he can "live the good life."

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.780
The kid's bad news
and a bad fit.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:18.076
What's more, he said he was
open to being a devil's friend.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:21.663
He's just an ignorant brat.
That's all.

Alrighty, then.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.061
Won't get there standin' here.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.953
[DENJI]
Yeah. I can turn into chainsaws.

[POWER]
What is it now?

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.756
You said he'd use the cat
as a fluffy shield

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.758
the second he saw you, right?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.553
So should you even be this close
to where they're hiding?

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:22.056
Oh. That was
my story, wasn't it?

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.558
Your "story"?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.186
A mere slip of the tongue. Oops.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:45.622
[POWER] Despite your dull mind,
your instincts are quite sharp.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.273
[BAT DEVIL] You had no qualms
leaving me to wait,

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.400
did you, Blood Devil?

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:17.487
I thought you'd
turned tail and fled.

Spare me your complaints!

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:22.450
Earning my freedom

What matters is that
I've met your demands.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.877
My first meal in ages.

his blood will no doubt
be brimming with vigor.

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:47.016
Look. See the wound
your kind inflicted on me?

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:50.103
Hacked my arm clean
off like savages!

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:52.021
The injury was
so severe that it forced

a grand creature such as I

it restored my body nonetheless!

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.890
[BAT DEVIL]
Egh! My mouth is still filled

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:29.559
with that vile taste!

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.646
I must swiftly find another
human and cleanse my palette!

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:44.907
And you, the sap who wants
to be buddies with them.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:51.247
I'm stunned you didn't
stop and question my story

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.958
when its plot holes
were so evident.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:59.422
Never was a species
more foolish than yours.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.933
[BAT DEVIL]
Ugh, the stench of cigarettes.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.978
The smell of makeup and drugs.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.563
--As if.
--Right?

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.565
[STUDENTS laugh]

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:20.568
[BAT DEVIL] Now there's
a pleasing aroma.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.572
Children's blood should
wash out that foul taste.

Look here, Bat Devil!

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.784
[BAT DEVIL]
Hm?

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.411
[POWER] I brought you
a human, as promised!

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:33.289
You've no reason to keep Meowy.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.584
Ah, that's right.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.962
You and I made
a little trade, didn't we?

[meows]

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.384
There you are!

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:45.510
[BAT DEVIL]
But I haven't punished you

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.763
for bringing such nasty fare.

Meowy!

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.315
From this day forth,
that's your name.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:02.985
And, gracious, do you smell
delectable for a cat.

[meows]

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:10.493
So spindly, though.

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:13.996
Methinks I'll fatten you up
before I feast.

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:26.175
Grow big and strong.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:30.012
I'm eager for the day
I can finally slaughter you!

[POWER] I've always killed
everything that met my gaze.

It's now become strange
to hear a voice

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:49.490
that isn't screaming in terror.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.909
So very strange.

Greetings, Blood Devil.

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:04.464
Blood's precisely what I need.

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:07.925
Lest you want to end
all nine lives of this cat,

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:11.220
bring me a human being.

[POWER gasps]

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:31.866
Earlier, you said you'd
never pet Pochita again.

[POWER]
I sympathize with you now.

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:38.998
'Tis a dreadful feeling.

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:50.426

All this nauseating blood!

I shall drain some children

[BAT DEVIL grunts]

After I gargle, I'll have a
virgin as an appetizer, I think.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.908
And then a large, plump man
for the main course,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.327
followed by a pregnant
woman for dessert.

You seriously drank
my blood? Revolting!

If I can't have yours,
you certainly can't have mine!

[DENJI] This one time,
Pochita went missing.

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:39.350
I noticed he was gone
when I woke up.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:42.645
I searched the town,
but I still couldn't find 'im.

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:47.358
[DENJI] Started thinkin' he'd
been eaten by another devil.

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:53.698
[DENJI] But when I got home,
he was in tears, waiting for me.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:57.535
I was so relieved,
I fell asleep holding him.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:02.999
[DENJI] I wonder how
she felt trying to sleep,

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.543
knowing that devil had Meowy.

do something like that?
