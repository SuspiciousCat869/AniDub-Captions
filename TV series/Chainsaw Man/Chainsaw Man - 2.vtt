[stomach growls]

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:22.022
Sorry, that was my stomach.

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:24.525
It's fine. What's your name?

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.610
[gasps] It's Denji, ma'am!

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:28.946
[MAKIMA]
Make a mental note, Denji.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.073
You have agreed
to become my pet.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.117
So you're officially
under my care now.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.453
Which means "woof" or "yes"
are all you say.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.122
Things like "no"
don't come out of my dogs.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:41.458
[DENJI gasps]
You're kidding, right?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.461
[MAKIMA] I'm giving you some
perspective on this job.

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:46.505
I have an acquaintance
in forensics.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:49.466
They told me unhelpful
pups get put down.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.099
[DENJI] Here I was
thinkin' she was sweet.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.351
Hell, I even liked her a little.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:02.354
Who knew she'd turn out
to be so scary?

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:05.566
Treatin' me like
a damn dog, of all things.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:06.650
[barks]

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:07.985
[gasps]

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:13.949
[DENJI] I just remembered
that Pochita's dead.

00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:16.618
[stomach growls]

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:20.038
[MAKIMA] None of us have
eaten breakfast either.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.749
We'll grab a quick bite
at the rest stop up ahead.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.961
No food for me.
I'm broker than broke.

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:27.504
[MAKIMA]
Get whatever you're hungry for,

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:29.506
and don't sweat the cost.
It's my treat.

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:30.966
[DENJI]
Really?

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.052
Wear this so your shirtless self
doesn't stand out.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.596
[DENJI]
Huh?

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:37.889
Take it.

00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:45.397
[DENJI] People always
call me dirty and smelly,

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.441
and straight up avoid me.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:50.068
Nobody ever acts this nice.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.530
'Specially when they look
half as good as her!

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.784
[DENJI]
I'm in love!

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.967
[DENJI]
Um. I'll take some udon and...

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.302
Sausage on a stick! That cool?

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:42.681
Very cool. Curry udon
for me, if you please.

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:43.765
[CLERK A]
Comin' right up.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:47.310
Man! That don't sound
bad either, y'know...

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.397
[MAKIMA]
Whoa, there. Are you okay?

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.523
Can you stand up?

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:52.774
[CLERK A]
Poor fella.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.401
[DENJI]
You smell good.

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.403
[AGENT A]
What's the grand total?

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:59.489
--[MAKIMA] Denji?
--[gasps] I'm sorry!

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.699
Those creeps weren't
the only ones

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.993
my chainsaws tore through.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:06.413
Guess I'm almost as low
on blood as I am on dough.

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:09.249
Just how did your body
evolve into a human weapon?

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.959
I adopted a pet devil,

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.920
and the little guy
replaced my heart.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.797
Unbelievable, right?

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.759
I honestly don't
wanna believe it.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.304
Pochita givin' up his life
so I could keep mine.

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.809
Historically speaking,
a devil taking the place

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:31.062
of a human's vital organ
has very few precedents.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.232
So few, in fact,
it doesn't even have a name.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.153
[MAKIMA]
Though it's rare, I believe you.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.991
See, I have a nose that detects
certain things most can't.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.451
And it knows you aren't lying.

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:45.994
[gasps]

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:49.039
[MAKIMA] Your best friend is
still alive inside of you.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.083
Both in a figurative
and literal sense.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:56.421
Your body's emitting two smells.
One human, one devil.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.799
Yeah? Awesome!

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.010
That's such a huge relief.

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:06.515
[DENJI gasps]

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:12.562
Where's the udon?
Huh, huh? Where?

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:16.858
[sighs]

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.777
[stomach growls]

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.154
Um, can I please dig in?

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:24.074
Sure. I have to ask, though.

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.325
Think you're really up to it?

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.910
Of course I--

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.038
I'm gonna need help.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.748
[MAKIMA]
Here. Say, "Ah."

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.625
Ahh.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.752
[MAKIMA]
Like it?

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:36.920
[barks]

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:40.257
It's endearing to see someone
enjoy soggy udon this much.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.342
You're a good boy, aren't you?

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.970
No different than a trained dog.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:50.600
So, I, uh... I didn't
catch your name.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.936
Makima.

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:54.396
Miss Makima.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:57.983
D-Do you have a type?
Like, in guys?

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.151
Huh. Well...

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.158
Currently, I'm into
Denji-type boys.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.453
Denji-type?

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:11.746
[gasps]

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.291
[DENJI]
Dude, that's me.

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:25.302
[DENJI] D-Do you have a type?
Like, in guys?

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:28.138
[MAKIMA] Currently,
I'm into Denji-type boys.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:33.310
You know, uh--
I'm into you, too, Miss Makima.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:37.022
[MAKIMA] Come on, Denji.
We're going in here.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.400
[MAKIMA]
This building's the Tokyo HQ

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.277
for our Devil Hunters.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.074
[MAKIMA] Including civilians,
there are over a thousand

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.035
Devil Hunters
defending this city,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.536
but Public Safety
operatives have

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.747
the best benefits
package by far.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.291
All the paid time off
is pretty amazing.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.631
[DENJI] Safe to say Miss Makima
has a thing for me.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:07.719
If the two of us work together,
will we eventually get together?

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:12.307
And then if we get together,
we can do that stuff together!

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.519
I want it! I wanna do
that stuff so bad!

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.438
[elevator dings]

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.981
You listening?

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.816
Yes?

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:25.195
[MAKIMA] Put these on.
We typically work in uniform.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:28.198
Once you're dressed, I'll
introduce you to a colleague.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:38.249
This gentleman here
is Aki Hayakawa.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.961
He's your senior by three years.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.171
You're going to shadow him
for the day, Denji.

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:44.172
[DENJI gasps]

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.382
[DENJI]
I thought you 'n' me would be

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.676
workin' together as a team.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.427
[AKI]
Well, you figured wrong.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.345
She's so out of your league

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.263
you don't even play
the same sport.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.098
Now let's go patrol.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:56.851
Wait, please! Miss Makima!

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.436
[AKI]
Really? Get up.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.399
[DENJI] No way! I ain't goin'
anywhere unless it's with her!

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.278
Perform well and we'll
work together down the road.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.572
The road's length
depends on you.

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.667
So, chin up, and do your best.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.551
[CROWD chattering]

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:35.473
[DENJI] Hey, big man. Is Miss
Makima, like, single? Or...?

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:39.561
[DENJI]
Do you know?

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.856
Hey!

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.566
Come with me.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.028
[DENJI groans]

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.292
[DENJI coughs]

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.469
Yeah, you really should quit.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.430
Show up tomorrow,
and I'll kick your ass again.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.682
What's your problem?

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:21.019
Just that my kindness
seems a bit wasted on you.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:24.189
People who don't knuckle down
and wise up to this job die.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.940
Every associate
I've met that got into

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.735
devil hunting for the paycheck
is pushing up daisies now,

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:31.196
and that's not an exaggeration.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.822
The only ones who
survive are those with

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.492
strong convictions
at their core.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.702
Lemme guess.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.914
Makima's the sole reason
you're here. Am I right?

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.500
Bingo.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.461
[AKI] Then I'm glad I
beat the crap out of you.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:53.051
[AKI] I'll do you a favor
and tell her you ran away.

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.221
Terrified by the devils
that would've ended you.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.772
[DENJI grunts]

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.649
[groans]

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.861
Thought you were
full of it when you said

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:14.197
you wasted kindness on me.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:15.657
But you are nice!

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:18.576
Cuz when I fight a dude,

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:22.413
it's nuts! Or! Nothing!

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:27.460
[DENJI panting]

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.003
Okay, so.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:32.215
I had some udon for
the first time ever today.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.843
I also ate a sausage.

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.678
Another first for me
was being treated

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.721
like a freakin' human being.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.723
Someone even paid for my meal.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:44.060
I'm almost afraid I'm gonna
wake up from this dream!

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.562
So what if I didn't
think it through

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:48.022
when I agreed to this gig?

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:53.194
I would die to keep
this life. Understand me?

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:57.073
[DENJI] Well, maybe I'm
not okay with dying.

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:59.742
It's not just my life anymore.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:02.745
[AKI grunts]

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.958
[AKI]
Yeah, you are dreaming!

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.501
See, a woman like Makima

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:11.421
is way too good for
a thug like you!

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:13.715
[DENJI]
Huh? What the hell?

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:14.924
Bet you're just
saying that cuz you

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:18.052
want her for yourself,
huh, numb nuts?

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:21.931
[AKI groans, coughs]

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:25.393
[AKI]
You weren't joking.

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:27.437
Just went for the balls.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.274
Nothing else. All balls.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.696
[DENJI]
Dammit.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:38.781
Hm?

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.033
A testicle devil appeared and

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.744
went apeshit on
his nutsack, ma'am!

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:46.372
No, he's lying. He made
that entire thing up.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.541
Aw, you already seem so close.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.460
You think you two can
work with each other?

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:51.461
[DENJI]
Not a chance!

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:53.338
I'd sooner work with a trashcan.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:56.341
Seems like you're on
the same wavelength.

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:59.594
I think assigning Denji to
your squad is the right choice.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:00.720
Squad?

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.805
This punk in my unit?

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.058
I've got enough
troublemakers as it is.

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:08.228
Adding another weirdo to
the mix would... I don't know...

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.813
Remember when I
put your team together?

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.690
I said that you'd be
operating differently

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.067
as a sort of experiment.

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:17.654
[DENJI yawns]

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:20.281
Please, ma'am,
what's the deal with this guy?

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:21.824
[MAKIMA]
Denji here is a human,

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.035
however he can also
turn into a devil.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:25.912
Damn straight! Pretty sick, huh?

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:29.165
Are you being completely
serious? Kind of a shock.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:32.126
I never took those cases for
more than baseless rumors.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.088
[MAKIMA]
This case is special.

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:37.215
Thus, Denji is going to be

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:40.009
receiving special
treatment from us.

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:43.721
Should he attempt to resign,
or ever disobey orders,

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:47.642
he'll be disposed of
as a devil on the spot.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:48.893
[DENJI]
Hm?

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:52.438
Wait a sec. What does that mean?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.067
We're colleagues,
until death do us part.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:02.699
You'll be living with me now.
Makes watching you easier.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.703
FYI, I've been instructed
to kill you should you run.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:16.546
Hey, you think
Miss Makima is bad?

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:19.590
If you're that unsure, then you
should just give up on her.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.301
You are a devil.

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:23.428
Be grateful that you're alive.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:26.431
Hunting your kind is what we do.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.683
Then, Miss Makima's good.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.686
[AKI]
That should go without saying.

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:35.315
How can she be anything less
when she saved my life?

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.742
Yeah, she's good.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.786
Hope I can hug her
again someday.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.705
Huh?!

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:59.047
[DENJI] Got strawberry jam,
plum jam, orange marmalade.

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.715
Butter and honey were
a nice touch, too,

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.426
but let's spice it up
with cinnamon.

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:07.972
[DENJI] I have created
the ultimate toast!

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.893
Whoa!

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.313
[DENJI]
It's fan-friggin-tastic!

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:19.150
♪ Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. ♪

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:22.195
♪ Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. ♪

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.989
♪ Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow... ♪

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.366
Finish it up in there!

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:27.450
[snoring]

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.868
[knocking]

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.745
[AKI]
Don't sleep on the toilet!

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.705
[DENJI yawns]

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.040
[sighs]

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.005
[sirens blaring]

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.215
[POLICE A]
A Fiend's been reported in an

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:44.175
east Nerima residence.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.635
All civilians have evacuated

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:48.888
and the area is
fully cordoned off.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.181
[POLICE B]
So, the Fiend in question is

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.058
holed up in a second story room.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.268
We'll let you Devil Hunters
take it from here.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.729
[POLICE C] Got a rookie
taggin' along, Hayakawa?

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.945
So, what's this Fiend thing?

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:07.323
[AKI sighs] Please.
They cover Fiends in school.

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:09.784
Well, I didn't go to school.

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:15.331
Devils who take control
of corpses are Fiends.

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:20.002
[gasps] Wait,
that would make me one.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:23.798
[AKI] No. Their heads have
very distinctive features.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.050
You'll see what I mean
soon enough.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.391
[hisses]

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.852
Fiends have the
devil's personality,

00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:38.187
and you're gonna kill this one.

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:40.690
Turn devil and show me
what you can do.

00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:43.609
That'll help me determine
how useful you are.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:44.861
[FIEND A]
Don't look.

00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.989
I'll poke out your eyes
before I kill you!

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.616
Damn Devil Hunters
to hell and back!

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:51.868
[FIEND A yells]

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.161
[FIEND A groans]

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:01.878
Hey. Why didn't you
transform into a devil?

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:05.256
Well, uh, when I kill
things with my powers,

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:06.966
it's messed up.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.509
Like, super cruel.

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:11.179
And I was thinkin', yikes.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.972
How stupidly close
was I to ending up

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:15.266
like beetle-face over here?

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:19.353
Bottom line is, I wanted to
make it painless if I could.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.899
You know the real bottom line?

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.318
Fiends are bona fide devils.

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:28.321
No place for sympathy
if you're hunting them.

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:29.697
Know what else?

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.783
I witnessed a devil
kill my whole family.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.411
I've had drinks
with those cops outside.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:36.621
They're risking their lives

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:40.291
to protect the people
they hold most dear.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:43.085
Everyone's serious
about this but you.

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:47.173
I want any devil I slaughter
to suffer as much as possible.

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:50.927
Then there's you, the sap who
wants to be buddies with them.

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:54.263
[gasps] I'll gladly
be a devil's friend

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:56.224
if they ever made the offer.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.559
Cuz I don't have any friends.

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.733
[AKI]
I'll remember that. Believe me.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.577
[DENJI]
Guess I pissed 'im off.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:20.414
Truth is, I was just trying to
keep blood off the merchandise.

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:21.958
Gets gory real fast when

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:24.710
the chainsaws are
revved and raring.

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:28.839
I made it quick 'n' easy,
so these are my reward!

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:36.305
All right. The porn is secured.

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:39.267
Show me your dreams.
That's all I ask of you.

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:42.395
You know I'm serious,
right? Pochita?

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:43.563
I'm livin' the dream.

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:46.566
My end of the bargain
is being fulfilled.

00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:49.026
I'll remember that. Believe me.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.278
[DENJI]
Bet we don't see eye-to-eye

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.530
cuz he's still
chasing his dream,

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:55.241
while I already nabbed
mine and then some.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:18:00.538
[DENJI] I take daily baths,
eat awesome food,

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.708
hang around a sexy chick
who doesn't mind me.

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.626
My life's a ten outta ten,

00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:08.462
so why's it feel like
something's missing?

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.172
Is something missing?

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:12.550
Did I space on my true goal?

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.219
His goal's gotta be
some revenge shit,

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.972
and they're trying to
protect their families.

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:23.686
[DENJI] Is she running
for a finish line, too?

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:30.109
Oh, Miss Makima. I really
wanna touch her boobs.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:37.908
[gasps] I gave up on the feel-up
thing forever and a day ago,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.286
but I've got a big-boy job now,

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.622
so maybe I can pull it off!

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:45.625
I doubt I could go
all the way with a girl,

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.336
but second base?

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:49.795
Where there's a will,
there's a way,

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:52.214
and there's definitely a will!

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:54.592
Everyone's serious
about this but you.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.802
[DENJI]
I understand what he meant now!

00:18:56.844 --> 00:19:00.222
And I found one, or two
things I'm serious about!

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:03.434
The goal to give
my life purpose...

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.019
...is melons!

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:06.270
As in the fruit?

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:09.065
Idiot! At least try
to pay attention!

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:10.191
To what?

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:11.651
Some exciting news.

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:13.819
Starting today,
you'll have a partner.

00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.154
Who, me?

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.572
[MAKIMA]
Yes, you.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:19.325
As a precaution,
Public Safety executes patrols,

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:23.412
small-scale missions, and
whatnot with two-person teams.

00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:26.832
Ah, perfect timing. She's here.

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.751
Do watch your back, though.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:31.671
She's a bit on
the Fiendish side.

00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:34.465
[POWER] All right,
on your knees, mortal scum!

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.217
Including so-called partners!

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:39.053
You stand in
the presence of Power!

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.430
Power? That's your name?

00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:42.848
Those horns! Wait, hold up!

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.310
A Fiend Devil Hunter's gotta be
breakin' some kinda rule!

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:47.395
Uh--

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.441
Eh, guess it's fine.
Great to meetcha!

00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:53.275
[AKI]
Hm?

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:56.904
Fiends are just as much targets
for elimination as devils.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.739
But since Power
is highly rational,

00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:01.784
I appointed her
to Hayakawa's squad.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.619
Public Safety
Devil Extermination

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.956
Special Division Four
is experimental, after all.

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:08.749
Because of that,
the higher ups will be

00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:10.376
looking to swiftly
dissolve your team

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.712
if you can't get results.

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:14.630
You're both aware of
what's in store for you

00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:17.508
should that prove
to be the case, yes?

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.808
[MAKIMA] Power's horns will
attract unwanted attention,

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.729
so the fewer pedestrians in the
areas you patrol, the better.

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:39.530
[POWER grunts]

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:42.450
Human! Supply prey
for me, post haste!

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.910
I yearn for the savor of blood!

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.872
[meows]

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.290
[DENJI]
I can put up with crazy

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.418
as long as the crazy's
hot enough.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.880
How do I get my hands on
those boobs, though?

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.256
[gasps]

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:00.676
[MAKIMA] If you run into
any civilian Devil Hunters,

00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:04.263
or the police question you about
what your intentions are...

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:07.391
We're Public Safety
Devil Hunters, sirs.

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:09.518
[MAKIMA] They might give you
a sour expression,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.104
but they should leave
you alone after that.

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.525
Where're all the
devils tucked away?

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:19.403
The blame likely lies with me.

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.155
Before I took up
the life of a Fiend,

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:23.783
I was a formidable devil,
feared by all!

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.409
I'm sure my scent
alone is enough

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:26.869
to scare demonic peons away!

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:27.870
You for real?

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:31.373
How do we hunt devils with
no devils to hunt? [gasps]

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.417
Should you have questions
about this change,

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:35.461
just ask Hayakawa.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:37.963
He's the one who
paired you two together.

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:41.592
[DENJI] That grade-A asshole!
He set me up!

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.177
Stuck me with
this devil-repellent

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:44.845
so I can't do anything cool!

00:21:44.887 --> 00:21:48.307
Some weak attempt
to get me fired!

00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:52.770
[gasps] I smell blood!

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:56.524
Hey! What's the rush, crazy?
Get back here!

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:03.906
Time to fight, time to fight!
Time to take you out!

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:04.949
Damn, she's fast!

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.242
Yes, that's correct, sir.

00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:09.036
The scene's evacuated
and blocked as of now.

00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:11.163
It's the Sea Cucumber Devil.

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:14.208
Requesting backup
in front of Nerima Station.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.876
Yeah, "Sea Cucumber."

00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:18.254
Uh, animal, technically.

00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:21.257
Uh-- Look! What I'm
trying to say--

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:22.591
[CIVILIAN DEVIL HUNTER A gasps]

00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:27.179
Holy shit.

00:22:27.221 --> 00:22:30.808
Mortals, behold!
The glory of the kill is mine!

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:37.898
