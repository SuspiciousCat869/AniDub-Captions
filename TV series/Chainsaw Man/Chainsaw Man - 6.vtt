WEBVTT

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:14.681
What the--?

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.017
[HIMENO]
What in the world?

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:21.980
Arai. You went down,
so why are you up?

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.108
Oh, no! No, no! No, no, no!

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:27.402
Hey! Kobeni!

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.154
Put up double peace signs
'n' stay right there.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.364
[KOBENI]
Huh?!

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:37.955
You're shitting me.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.791
[gasps]

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.085
[KOBENI screams]

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.338
Whatcha think?
Got any clue, Aki?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.217
Looks like the work
of a devil. Has to be.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.094
Don't move a muscle, Kobeni.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.387
[KOBENI whimpers]

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.186
Huh?

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:03.647
[AKI]
Huh?

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:07.985
Why is a room on the other
side of those windows?

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.082
--[door opens]
--[KOBENI gasps]

00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:25.919
[screams]

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.463
Hey, guys, the windows
are a total bust!

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.508
All of 'em lead to
the room across the hall!

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.385
Apparently so.

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:38.599
[AKI] We're stuck.
Trapped on the eighth floor.

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:22.160
So, just to recap,

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.037
we're currently bound
to the eighth floor,

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.081
no matter how many
times we try to leave,

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:27.207
and it's likely due to a devil.

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:28.917
[yawns]

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.836
[AKI]
The elevators are inoperable,

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:34.423
and there's no way out
via the rooms or windows.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:35.674
Even climbing
through the ceiling

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.176
led right back to
the eighth floor.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.887
[DENJI] Maybe this is
happening cuz Power

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.432
went and killed that one devil.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.226
Coulda been using an ability
to trap us here when it died.

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:47.394
So it never turned off its--

00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:48.979
You commanded me
to kill it, fool!

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.896
Nuh-uh!

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.607
When a devil dies,
its powers are undone as well.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.109
That can't be it.

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:56.945
Speaking of which,
is the flesh piece reacting?

00:03:56.987 --> 00:04:01.450
Not at all. In fact,
it's gone completely still.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.952
Meaning the devil that crossed
our paths earlier was bait,

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:05.704
and we bit it hard.

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:08.290
Whatever's doing this has got
some tricks up its sleeve.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.666
Fresh ones, too.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.669
Okay, but if HQ doesn't
hear from us in a while,

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.045
won't they send
other Devil Hunters

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.298
as a type of search party?

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:18.967
Better cross all your
fingers and toes

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.135
and hope they
don't find themselves

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:22.596
in the same predicament as us.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.183
Since they can't get in
and we can't get out,

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.393
everybody here is gonna die.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.270
We'll slowly starve to death.

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.481
Stay strong, okay?
Happy thoughts!

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.982
Gotta keep living
as a Devil Hunter

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.359
to put your brother
through school, don't you?

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.695
[KOBENI] I'm not doing it
'cause I want to.

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.030
My older brother's
the gifted one

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.991
so his education is all that
matters to my parents,

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.702
which is why they
made me get a job.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:49.873
It was either become
a Devil Hunter or a sex worker!

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:56.922
[sobs] I--I wanted
to go to college,

00:04:56.963 --> 00:05:00.967
but I'm just going to my grave!

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.011
[POWER chuckles]

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:07.891
[laughs] Her face
is so priceless!

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.643
[POWER laughing]

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:13.730
Stop laughing! This isn't funny!

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:18.276
[HIMENO] Kobeni, sweetheart.
Fear is a devil's favorite food.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.780
Be brave, or you'll
be their dinner.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:25.992
But... I can't help it! [cries]

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.328
[HIMENO]
Something eating you, too, Aki?

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.499
Notice the clock?

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:35.669
It's read 8:18 for
a lot longer than a minute.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.254
And it's not the only one.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:40.590
All the clocks on
this floor say 8:18.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.969
[AKI]
Based on that fact,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.720
I think it's possible
time on the eighth floor

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.889
has been frozen
by a devil's power.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.976
And if that's the case,
we won't be receiving any help.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.561
[HIMENO gasps]

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.774
[DENJI] No shit?
We can sleep all we want now!

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.443
Exactly how stupid are you?

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.279
Do you not get
the gravity of our situation,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.198
or do you just not care if
we're trapped in here forever?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.908
What's gravity
got to do with it?

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.453
No one knows anything for sure.
When ya do, wake me up.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:14.040
This bed's dope as hell.
Shouldn't waste it.

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:17.335
I'mma 'preciate this
devil 'n' have a nap.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.764
[AKI]
He really fell asleep.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:37.314
[HIMENO] Denji. Come on.
Out of bed, sleepyhead.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:40.650
[yawns]

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.445
[DENJI]
Hm?

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:46.406
You guys actually manage to find
a way offa the eighth floor?

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:49.451
[HIMENO] Hate to break it to ya,
cupcake, but not yet.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.953
We did learn the water and
electricity work like normal

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.538
while you were passed out.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.749
Though, our greatest discovery
has to be the food

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.877
we found in the luggage
some guests left behind.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.089
I won't lie, everyone's
pretty much at their wits' end.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.551
Aki's grit has him searching
for the devil nonstop.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.802
I told him to take a break,

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.430
but I might as well
have lectured a wall.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.307
Arai was helping Aki at first,

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.267
but then got hit
by a panic attack.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.938
Now, he's bundled up and
shut down in another room.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.147
Kobeni freaked to the point of

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:22.859
trying to drink from a toilet
bowl, so I knocked her out.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.654
And of course, the Fiend
you brought with you.

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:27.364
Is she okay?
Did something happen?

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.074
I'm thinking of ways to
win the Nobel Prize

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.784
in order to battle my boredom!

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.827
For once I have earned
such glorious esteem,

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.538
all you humans
will kowtow to me!

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.165
I'll then make
a steppingstone out of that

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.960
gilded coin and snatch
the prime minister's throne!

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.963
What better way to ensure
the suffering of lowly mortals?

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.673
And my first act
shall be to implement

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:48.385
a one-hundred percent sales tax!

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:49.844
[DENJI]
Nah, she's always like that.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:53.264
[HIMENO]
Oh. Then no worries.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.517
Let's take turns
guarding Arai and Kobeni.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.520
I can't even take potty breaks
when it's just me.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:19.416
Bummer. Down to my last cig.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.793
I'm quite disappointed
by your calm demeanor.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:24.254
I'd be much more uptight
if Aki weren't on the case.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:27.090
Though there's one other factor
for my stress-free mood.

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.300
The power of nicotine!

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:33.221
[sighs] Gotta take the edge
off somehow, you know?

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:34.931
A good addiction
is about the only thing

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.058
you can depend on in life.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.728
You smoke the same
brand that he does.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:43.440
'Course he has these cigarettes!

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.151
The one who taught 'im
to savor the flavor was me!

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.153
And I'm a good teacher.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.242
You not gonna join me
for a smoke?

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.494
[AKI]
No. Smoking rots your bones.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.414
Great for socializing, though,
so that's an even trade.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:02.000
[AKI]
I'm not looking to make friends.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.922
I know why you joined
Public Safety.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.633
Set on killing
the Gun Devil, right?

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.511
All of you dark and
broody types are

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.764
an open book with the same plot.

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.140
You want a piece of
that damn Gun

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.851
and we're the only ones
with actual pieces.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.395
Us Hunters aren't long
for this world anyway.

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:24.647
Not like smoking's
gonna kill you.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.233
Well, I'm not biting it
anytime soon.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.902
[HIMENO]
I'll hold you to that.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.738
It's a giant pain in the
you-know-what to lose a partner.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.697
[thud]

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.664
[AKI]
The hell was that?

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:45.502
A smack from my old
partner's girlfriend.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.795
Stuff like this is common with

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.172
the family and friends
of late partners.

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:50.924
They can't do anything
to get back at the devils,

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.176
so they take it out on us.

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.095
Sucks, but I just
consider it something

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:58.556
that comes with the territory.
What else can I do?

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.317
[HIMENO]
Where did you go?

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.697
I snuck up to the girl
who hit you

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.950
and stuck gum on her clothes.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.994
Huh?

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.955
You shouldn't just
take crap like that.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.581
And don't feel guilty either.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.835
I was pissed, so I set out
for some payback.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.294
It serves her right.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.963
She's gonna waltz
around all day,

00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:32.507
oblivious that
there's gum on her.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:39.931
[HIMENO laughs]

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.684
[HIMENO] You reminded me of
something my master always said.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:45.019
The kind of Hunter
a devil fears most of all

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.231
doesn't have to be strong,
or even brave for that matter.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:49.607
They're the ones
with some screws loose

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.109
and no screwdrivers.

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.112
Which is why I believe you
when you say you won't die.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.323
Was that an insult?

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:58.825
And more importantly,
if you aren't gonna

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.619
eat your almond tofu,
then I'm taking it.

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:05.081
[HIMENO]
Take this instead.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.084
It rots your bones,
and I need mine.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:11.796
Aww. I have a hunch this is
gonna be a long partnership,

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.299
so it'd be awesome
if you smoked.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.226
I'm only smoking one.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:28.688
This is the first and last
cigarette I'll ever light up.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:33.484
Could really go for a smoke.
Please tell me you have some.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.362
I'm sorry. This is
the last one I've got.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.740
Oh, yeah? Then I get
the rest of it.

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:43.077
[HIMENO sighs]
Well, If you insist, you addict.

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.248
Ch-Cheater! You got an
indirect kiss for free!

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.750
Shut up.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.631
I've got some bad news.

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:56.841
Remember the freak of nature
that we killed?

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.093
You mean the freak of
nature that I killed!

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:03.014
Well, it got bigger.
A lot bigger.

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:10.355
[ETERNITY DEVIL groaning]

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:16.361
[POWER] I could've sworn
I sliced it in twain.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:20.114
It traps us in a hotel
and assumes a form like that?

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.533
What the hell kinda devil is it?

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:26.704
Hear me. Foolish as you are,

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.792
I pray you'll be wise enough
to accept this contract I offer.

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.043
The blob can talk?

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:33.711
And wants a contract, huh?

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.631
[ETERNITY DEVIL] Feed me
the human known as Denji.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:40.468
Dead or alive.
Just let me eat him.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.263
Do so, and I shall allow
the rest of you Devil Hunters

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.181
to leave here unscathed.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.933
I won't harm
a hair on your heads

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.894
if you accept the contract!

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:04.367
Denji, let it eat you.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:11.374
[ETERNITY DEVIL groaning]

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:17.171
[screams]

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.425
[gasps]

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.553
[coughs]

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:32.437
[ETERNITY DEVIL cackling]

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.230
Ugh, you're obnoxious.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.190
All right, Aki. Swallow it
with your Fox Devil

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.525
and let's put an end to this.

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:38.359
[ETERNITY DEVIL cackles]

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.610
[AKI]
Kon.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.656
[AKI] I had a feeling
it wouldn't show.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.284
We're cut off from the rest
of the world, after all.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.495
And the Fox Devil's
somewhere chilling in Kyoto.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.665
That's fine.
My Ghost can handle this.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:14:01.632
[ETERNITY DEVIL screams]

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:07.847
[gasps] It got even bigger!

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.141
[ETERNITY DEVIL]
It's futile!

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:13.394
The form you're attacking
is not my main body.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:16.272
My heart's not even close,

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.483
because you're
inside of my stomach.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:22.195
I'm practically invulnerable
on the eighth floor.

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:26.240
You have to make a contract
with me if you want to leave.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.993
Liar. You ain't lettin'
anyone outta here.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.079
Talk, talk, talk,
with no follow through.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.789
It has to follow through.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.958
The devil specifically said it
would be a "contract," right?

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.835
Devils are very selective
with such words

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.254
because of how much
sway they hold for them.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.548
So if one party
makes good on the deal,

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.384
the other has no choice
but to honor it,

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:46.010
or else they'll perish.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:48.346
It's not just shooting
off its many mouths.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.639
We could murder you right now

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.141
and leave less than
a minute later.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:55.937
[ARAI] We should kill him,
don't you think, Miss Himeno?

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.313
It would leave us down a hunter,

00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.108
but at least we would be outside
where we can regroup.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:03.444
If we don't, we'll end up
starving, like Kobeni said.

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.946
Hunters are legally
allowed to make

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.365
contracts with devils,
and you know it.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:10.118
The wisest course of action
is to accept the offer!

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.703
Meeting a devil's demands
really strikes you as wise?

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.247
Look, it's unclear,

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.998
but a dead Denji
helps that thing somehow,

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.000
which is why we're
turning down the contract.

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:20.378
Welp, there ya have it, Arai.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.504
Come on.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:23.214
I am all for Team Kill Denji!

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.549
Hey!

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.717
My Nobel Prize will remain
forever out of reach

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.011
if I am unable to depart
this warped hotel!

00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:31.055
Die for my award-winning idea!

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.641
Fiends can't make
legitimate pacts with devils.

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:35.768
Even if you did feed it Denji,

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.396
it wouldn't be compelled
to let us escape.

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:40.940
So "Team Kill Denji"
is disbanded.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:45.111
We're Devil Hunters.
We only kill devils.

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:49.365
Ugh. Shall we wrestle
to cure our boredom?

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:52.493
I'm not wrestling the captain
of "Team Kill Denji"!

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.374
[ETERNITY DEVIL groaning]

00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:59.750
[DENJI]
So hungry.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.711
[HIMENO] Do you have
the vaguest idea for a plan

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:04.213
to actually get us
out of here, Aki?

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:06.340
If what the devil
told us is accurate,

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:08.593
then killing it
is off the table.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.721
But Denji isn't dying, either.

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:14.682
[HIMENO] So the plan's
to sit around and starve?

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:19.937
I'll use the sword, should
worse really come to worst.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.647
Like hell you will.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.609
If a couple swipes from
your sword can fix this,

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.778
then use it. Am I right?

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.779
Nope. We aren't using it,

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.157
even if we have
no other alternatives.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.701
I'm sorry to say this, Denji,

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.786
but you're toast
if it comes to that.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.164
Huh?

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.917
[ARAI]
It's gone? All of it?

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:46.339
Our one blessing was finding
food, and now it's gone. How?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.971
You just ate everything?
Gobbled it all up in one go?

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:56.599
'Twas not me.
It's Denji's doing.

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.559
Why tell me a lie
that's so obvious?

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.186
[KOBENI]
I figured it out.

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:03.981
I get it. I understand now.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.859
The Fiend! Her ability is
keeping us on the eighth floor!

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.820
Right? That just has to be why!

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:10.696
Incorrect.

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.031
You aren't making any sense!

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.033
This is the Blood Fiend,
so calm down!

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:15.451
[KOBENI]
You're taking her side?

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.954
And you call yourself
a Devil Hunter?

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.706
You've been conspiring with them
all along, haven't you?

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:22.959
You're Arai the spy!

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.126
Ooh. There's pie?

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:27.755
I wouldn't work with
the devils as a spy, ever!

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:30.633
I know what you are!

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.678
[screams]

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:34.971
[ALL gasp]

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:35.972
Who's screaming?

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:37.723
[AKI]
Run! Now!

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:45.523
[ALL panting]

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:48.276
[ETERNITY DEVIL]
Kill Denji.

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:50.069
Give me his heart.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.779
Give it!

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.365
I grow as your fear grows.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.535
Your own trepidation
will be your undoing!

00:17:57.577 --> 00:18:00.246
Let your terrors take hold!

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.206
Dread your death!

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.500
Dread everything.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.962
The one who succeeds in
killing the Chainsaw

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:09.505
will be me!

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:12.508
The one and only Eternity Devil!

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.262
[ETERNITY DEVIL cackling]

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:18.889
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.641
[AKI]
The hall's tilting!

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:24.979
[KOBENI gasps]

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.525
[gasps]

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:36.365
[ETERNITY DEVIL cackling]

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:39.076
Relinquish Denji's heart to me!

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.661
[KOBENI]
Someone, please!

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:43.080
Anyone, just hurry up
and kill him!

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.582
Either he dies or we all do!

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.208
Deliberation time's
come and gone!

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.128
Feed him to the devil
and get it over with!

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:52.256
[AKI]
I'm using the sword.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:54.383
Are you okay with that, Himeno?

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:58.346
[AKI]
No! Don't!

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:01.015
Whoa! Not cool!
What's the deal here, lady?

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.266
The sword is very handy,

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.144
and yes, we probably could
escape if he used its power.

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.063
But it cuts Aki's lifespan.

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.899
Every use shaves off
a huge chunk of it.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.567
He's got way too much
to live for

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.694
to get shortchanged like that.

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:16.322
So I'm sorry. I really am.

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:18.240
[ARAI grunts]
Me, too!

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.660
Yeah? Then, get off!

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:23.371
[DENJI]
C'mon, man!

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:26.707
[POWER laughs]

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:28.459
Die!

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.127
[cackles]

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.296
[yells]

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:39.512
[gasps]

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:41.222
Huh?

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.849
[KOBENI gasps]

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.154
[AKI]
Sure, he's a prick,

00:19:57.196 --> 00:20:00.741
and maybe he deserves
a good stab or two.

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:04.870
But this stab-worthy piece of
shit wants the Gun Devil dead.

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:09.375
So I need him, because I can't
end that thing by myself.

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:11.377
To actually pull off the kill,

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:14.171
I need Devil Hunters
with the guts to fight it.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.674
As many as I can get!

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:21.053
If the price for that is some of
my own life, I'll pay it.

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:24.432
The point is I'm not
letting Denji die here!

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:28.102
Power! Since you're
the Blood Fiend,

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.771
can you keep him
from bleeding out?

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.732
I have total control
over my own blood,

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:34.442
not the blood of others.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:37.236
I'm doubtful I could achieve it.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.154
[AKI groans]

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:39.947
Though, if topknot
succumbs to his injury,

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:42.908
I suppose I'll be in need
of a new cook, yes?

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.162
Thus, I'm obligated
to try, at least.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.085
What do we do?

00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:55.171
What do we do now?

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:58.758
Aki, please tell me.
What do we do?

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.719
[gasps] It's not my fault, okay?

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:04.805
None of this would've happened
if it weren't for him!

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:07.308
You should've been good
and let it eat you!

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:09.894
Then everything would be fine!

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.062
Jeez. Enough already.

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.774
Guess it's snack-o-clock.

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.485
[KOBENI]
Oh, thank goodness.

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:21.322
But I ain't about to slide down
its throat without a fight.

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:24.116
So if I manage to take out
this king-sized fuckface,

00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:26.410
I better still get my kiss.

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:29.580
You promised that'd
be the reward!

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:32.166
Have you a strategy
in mind to win?

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:36.045
[DENJI] It'll hurt real bad,
but I'mma use my chainsaws.

00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:37.963
[KOBENI]
Ch-Chainsaws?

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:39.882
[DENJI]
Yeah, that's right.

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:43.344
I figured this nightmare fuel is
scared of 'em for some reason.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.846
That's why it hasn't
messed with me head-on yet.

00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:48.182
It wants you guys
to do it instead.

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.684
Its heart might not be here,

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:54.104
but it still cried out in pain
when it got attacked earlier.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.482
Invulnerable my butt.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.902
I'm tearin' this whiny wimp up
till it can't take it no more.

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:02.321
Till it wants to kill itself!

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.700
An incredibly devilish
notion, indeed.

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:12.331
[DENJI] I can't believe
you covered me.

00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:15.125
Mind your own business
next time, dickhead.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.837
I'm through owing
anybody anything.

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:20.840
No more debts for me.

00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:24.468
We're even-steven
the second you're outta here!

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:28.222
[ETERNITY DEVIL groaning]

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:35.271
[ETERNITY DEVIL cackling]
