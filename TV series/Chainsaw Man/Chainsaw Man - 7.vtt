00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.594
[ETERNITY DEVIL chuckling]

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:13.639
[AKI groans]

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.558
[DENJI] I can't believe
you covered me.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.103
Mind your own business
next time, dickhead.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.981
I'm through owing
anybody anything.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.359
No more debts for me.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.488
Once you're outta here,
you 'n' me are even-steven!

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.825
[ETERNITY DEVIL cackling]

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:39.665
[KOBENI]
He did it.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:44.795
[ETERNITY DEVIL cackling]

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:48.715
[DENJI yelling]

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:49.591
[gasps]

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:50.968
[DENJI]
You want some?

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:55.472
[DENJI grunting]

00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:01.687
Ha! I knew you were alive,
Chainsaw! I just knew it!

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.483
[DENJI groaning]

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:10.821
[DENJI screaming]

00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:13.865
[DENJI]
All better!

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:17.202
[ETERNITY DEVIL] Your endeavor
is completely meaningless!

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.121
[ETERNITY DEVIL screams]

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.539
[ETERNITY DEVIL]
You won't find my heart

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.291
no matter where you slice!

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.668
You can't kill me!

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.712
[DENJI]
Watch me!

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:30.716
[gasps]

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:35.929
He's a devil?

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.097
[POWER]
This does not bode well.

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.223
[HIMENO gasps]

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.601
He's paying little mind
to his blood loss.

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:44.605
His chainsaws require blood
to work, or they retract.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.027
[DENJI groans]

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:52.863
Is it just me, or are you even
weaker than you were before?

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:57.159
How far you have
fallen, Chainsaw!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.369
[DENJI screams]

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:39.511
[DENJI screaming]

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.557
My chainsaws went in on me!

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.434
I need more blood!

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.102
You need to accept that

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:47.978
you failed!

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.187
And die!

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:54.401
[DENJI screams]

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.194
[ETERNITY DEVIL screams]

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.363
[ETERNITY DEVIL groans]

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.950
Your blood might be the grossest
thing I've ever swallowed.

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:05.787
But hearin' your shrieks and
seein' you bent all outta shape

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.541
makes this shit as sweet
as strawberry jam!

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.626
[DENJI cackles]

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:15.130
[KISHIBE] Know the kind of
hunters a devil fears most?

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.845
Ones with a few screws loose
and no screwdriver.

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:28.602
[KISHIBE]
Sahara's sanity was his demise.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.729
Head was on too straight.

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:36.318
Same goes for Kinouchi,
and Subaru, and Sasaki.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.905
They were all reasonable enough
to be afraid when devils struck.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:43.241
Every devil they faced
was stronger because of it.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.619
You've worked with
Aki long enough

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.663
to form an opinion of him, yeah?

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.081
Head on straight?

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.667
Well, he has it out
for you know what.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.170
No sane person is after the Gun.

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.922
Could've sworn you
joined Public Safety

00:04:56.963 --> 00:05:00.133
so you'd have a shot at
killin' that thing, too.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:03.678
You sayin' you got some
screws loose up there?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.180
No, sir, I'm not.

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:09.059
Exactly. Most hunters dream
of finding the Gun Devil

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.063
and personally dismantling it,
and you're no exception.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.190
They're earnest. Honest.

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:16.483
Straightforward.

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:20.195
Which means devils know
just how to fuck with them.

00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:21.905
Hunters who are
off their rockers

00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:25.367
leave 'em guessing, though,
and they aren't fans of that.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:29.538
Like us, devils have a fear of
anything they don't understand.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.834
Master, you're
drinking too much.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.877
There you go being sensible.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.631
Knock your screws loose
every day to be unhinged.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.678
[KISHIBE sighs]

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.721
[KISHIBE] Safe to assume
yours are in tight if you're

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:50.225
visiting your partners'
graves every month.

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:51.810
I'm headed home.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:55.772
Aki's still a punk,
so make sure to train 'im up.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:58.275
One step at a time, sir.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.360
[KISHIBE] You can't
take your time, though.

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:01.486
The kid's serious about

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.155
following that trail of
meat chunks, ain't he?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.450
Eventually, he's gonna
make it to the Gun.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.845
[HIMENO] No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no--!

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:28.722
[gasps]

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.307
[HIMENO]
No.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.225
I've been thinkin',
what if you and I

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:35.478
became private sector hunters?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.523
I already got an offer,
and it's pretty good pay.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.026
Plus, the best perk is
no wild Gun chase!

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.445
We could go out for lunch
whenever we wanted.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.864
Catch a movie
after work sometimes.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.366
Really enjoy ourselves
for a change.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.828
[AKI] I'll get drinks with you
as often as you want.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.123
But I've no intent of
going private at all.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.375
And I'm taking your almond tofu.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:01.254
Fine. I'll trade it
for a cigarette.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.889
[HIMENO] If Aki actually
fights the Gun Devil,

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.516
his death's a guarantee.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.269
Not because we aren't
strong enough to take it on,

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.188
or because that
monster is capable of

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:21.316
killing hundreds in an instant.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:26.988
It's because Aki's cool,
and serious, and kind,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.742
and normal, like most people.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:31.701
But...

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:35.288
[DENJI yells]
Take this!

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.793
[DENJI groans]

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.297
There.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:46.341
It is done.

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.681
[HIMENO]
But this guy right here?

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.685
Dude, eureka!

00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:00.105
Fountains of blood explode
from you with every slice.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:03.608
I chug it like it's soda
and I'm good as new!

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.738
I could do this
for fucking ever!

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.076
With such a dope concept,
that Nobel Prize is mine!

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.829
[DENJI cackles]

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.249
[HIMENO] His screws aren't
just loose. They fell out.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.918
He might really be able
to kill that damn Gun!

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.382
[DENJI grunting, cackling]

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:35.932
[ETERNITY DEVIL groaning]

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:41.396
[sighs]

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:52.490
Aki, you didn't
die on me, did ya?

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.286
Nope, not yet.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:59.122
How long have we been
stuck here, anyway?

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.959
Since you got stabbed, it's been
about three days, I think?

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.336
[POWER]
Meowy.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.421
[HIMENO]
It's all but over,

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:09.007
so let's grab some drinks
when we get out.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:13.762
For now, I'm gonna
grab a little shuteye.

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.513
It's really over?

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.392
[ETERNITY DEVIL groaning]

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.728
[ETERNITY DEVIL]
I can't take any more pain.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.896
This is my heart,
ergo my weakness.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.231
Please, hurry up and kill me.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.025
--I'm sorry.
--Kill me and end my suffering.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.486
What? You're quittin' already?

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:32.113
I was havin' fun
splashin' round this bloodbath

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:34.824
like a kid in a pool!

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.034
[DENJI grunts]

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.212
[DENJI]
We made it.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:52.342
And we're walkin' away with
a piece of the Gun Devil.

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:53.718
The sky's clear.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.346
Feels like I just took
a giant shit or something.

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:59.140
Floatin' on air with every step.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.851
[HIMENO]
Easy.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.188
[HIMENO]
He's out.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.775
I'd be wiped, too, if I fought
for three days without sleep.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.820
They need a hospital, stat,

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:14.072
so we'll make sure that
they both get to one.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:17.325
You two head back to the office
and report what went down.

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:26.543
Newbie welcome party, huh?

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.753
[HIMENO] Yep. The members
of Division Four

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.380
should get to know each other.

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.132
We're a fully assembled group.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.510
So let's tackle our latest fix
while bonding as a team.

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:36.594
What fix?

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.804
[HIMENO]
Haven't you heard?

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.013
Arai and Kobeni have said

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.891
they're gonna
ditch Public Safety.

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:44.394
Not only are they more
petrified of devils than ever,

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:45.687
they've got a bucket
load of guilt

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:48.064
for trying to kill
their teammate, too.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.817
[AKI] For a minute, you were
also on Team Kill Denji.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.569
Right? They're sensitive enough

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.113
to quit over the
most trivial thing!

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:58.825
I'm on team "Kill the Shame
and Live Bolder" now.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.743
But, yeah. Apologizing to Denji

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.328
and talking the other
two into staying

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.455
will both be easier
if done over drinks.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.208
Or you just wanna get wasted.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.543
[chuckles]

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.296
[AKI] Though it's tiny,
I found a Gun chunk.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.007
As for your party idea,
it has to be this week.

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:16.050
Huh? Um. Why?

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.762
If I'm gonna go out,
then I wanna invite Miss Makima.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.980
She'll be on a business trip
to Kyoto next week.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.191
Denji is a target
for a lot of devils,

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.526
so she's procuring some backup.

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:36.070
Let's do this party thing
before she goes.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:42.660
Be honest with me.
What do you think Denji is?

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.164
Never seen anything
even remotely close

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.790
to his chainsaw form,

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.959
but that devil
seemed to recognize it.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.628
Then the biggest mystery of all.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.171
Why does somebody
like Miss Makima

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.340
give a damn about this boy?

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:57.592
Think for a sec.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.637
She usually likes to travel, but
she's stayed in Tokyo lately.

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.972
It's because Denji's here, yeah?

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.224
So, has she cracked his code

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.684
and learned all
his secrets, or what?

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.857
Shall we get her hammered
and ask for details?

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.152
[ALL]
Cheers!

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.780
[DENJI] Man, this whole
spread smells awesome!

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:23.159
I mean, there's enough here to
last me five entire lifetimes!

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.375
[AGENT A]
Oh, here we go.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.586
[DENJI] This is nuts!
Where do I even start?

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:34.671
[FUSHI, AKI sigh]

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:37.924
Oh that's good. Haven't had
a drink in six months.

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:38.800
That a fact?

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.677
Don't really go out,
but I'll drink at home.

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:44.180
Away with you!
The sashimi shall all be mine!

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:47.517
Whatever this is,
it looks real good!

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:51.354
[KOBENI] Sorry. Would've been
here sooner, but I got lost.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:54.357
Ay, you made it.
Sit by me, Kobe.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.234
Oh, that reminds me, guys.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.111
Miss Makima'll be late, too.

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:03.950
Let's get parfaits along with
dumpling trays. Three of each.

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.869
Oh, wow, that's good!
Never had something so tasty.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:10.206
Right, because you give most of
your paycheck to your family.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.416
Eat your fill, okay?

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.834
[POWER]
Not off my plate!

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.712
The chicken's mine and
mine alone, scoundrel!

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:16.921
Fiends were invited as well,

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.715
so why didn't you
bring your partner?

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:21.467
I think they're a little
too scary for this joint.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.594
I'm jealous of
how tactful yours is.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.596
Must be nice to have
a smart Fiend.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.140
Go on. Get whatever you want

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:29.100
and put some meat
on those young bones!

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:32.937
I sure would like to,
but I can't read most of this.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.319
So, uh, about that
kissing reward.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.030
Hmm? Ohh.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.657
I'm too shy and sober
to kiss you right now.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:47.118
But I'll do it when I'm drunker?

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:51.664
I'll be sure to make it
extra juicy and intense!

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.124
So please forgive us for trying

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.335
to feed you to that
stupid ol' devil.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:59.088
All is forgiven,
like, majorly! You're good!

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.965
It's a welcome party,
so let's have the rookies

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.176
stand up and
introduce themselves.

00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:06.346
State your name, age, and what
devils you've contracted!

00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:07.555
Cool, except no one should say

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.432
what devils they've
contracted with.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.267
Only reveal your hand
to those you trust,

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.852
and don't do so in public.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:15.521
[AGENT A] Jeez, you ever take
that stick outta your ass?

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:19.150
[HIMENO] Relax! It's fine!
Aren't we all friends?

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.361
Ooh. I wanna know
their hobbies, too.

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:23.571
Those can tell you
a lot about a person.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:27.116
All right, well, I'm Denji,
and I'm pretty sure I'm 16.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:31.204
As for hobbies,
I like eating and naps!

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.331
Sixteen? That's young.

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.583
What've you been drinking
this whole time?

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:36.626
Just tea.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.879
Hi, my name is Hirokazu Arai,
and I'm 22!

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:44.050
My contract is with the Fox
Devil, and I write haikus!

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.928
Ain't that the same devil
Hayakaptain's pals with?

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.847
The Fox Devil is very
companionable with humankind.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.183
As such, it's formed many
contracts with hunters.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.644
'Cept the fox is also
a sucker for a pretty face,

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:55.978
and it won't let
anyone use its head

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.356
unless it thinks
they're super hot!

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.360
I'm Kobeni Higashiyama.
Twenty years old.

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:05.738
The devil I have
a contract with is secret.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.158
And my hobby is finding
and eating yummy things.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.618
Isn't her outfit cute?

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.619
Yeah.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.830
It's a hand-me-down
from my older sister.

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.748
Wait a minute here.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.875
Where the heck is
Fushi's rookie at?

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:21.838
Unfortunately, they were
killed yesterday.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.132
[HIMENO]
Welp, only the young die good!

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.969
They'll be missed
and pissed. R. I. Pissed?

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.263
Whatever you "R,"
it isn't sober.

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.016
Do new recruits really
die so easily?

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:35.601
Public Safety gets
all the threats

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.020
too tough for civilian hunters.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:40.106
Yep. Always droppin' like flies.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:43.025
I'm the only one who's left
from my orientation group.

00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:45.278
The power of kisses
keeps Denji going,

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.989
so we know he won't die!

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.157
Right!

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:51.576
Himeno gets really friendly
when she's drunk.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:52.452
Oh, yeah?

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:54.495
Yeah, and apart from
you greenhorns,

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.789
I think she's kissed
everyone here.

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:59.083
There's no escaping her.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.129
[DENJI]
Then it's in the bag!

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:04.964
[sighs]

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.549
Oh my god.

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:09.594
Today, I am gonna get
my first kiss ever.

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.262
--Kiss?
--[DENJI gasps]

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.347
Miss Makima!

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:16.601
Pardon me. One draft beer,
when you get a chance.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:19.562
Please, have a seat. I insist.

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:24.901
I've never seen Miss Makima
in the flesh before.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.821
Denji, are you going to
kiss somebody?

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:29.655
Oh, hell no!

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:33.117
What a shame. You don't
wanna kish me anymore?

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.327
Hell, yeah!

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:37.288
[POWER giggling]

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.625
Excuse me, sir.
Another round for me.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.045
So who's kissing who now?

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:45.880
[DENJI] I don't want
Miss Makima to see me

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:48.132
makin' out with Himeno.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.092
Canoodling is out for you?

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:51.260
[DENJI]
But, on the other hand,

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:54.555
I really want that kiss
with tongue just as bad!

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.266
I'll hafta try and
change the subject for now!

00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:59.143
Hey, um! Guess what?

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:00.645
I found a chunky
thinga-ma-bobber

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:01.771
and snatched it up!

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:03.648
[MAKIMA]
I heard. Wonderfully done.

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.691
Keep up the great work, Denji.

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.652
Since we're on the topic
of the Gun Devil,

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:10.613
more devils with its flesh have
been cropping up as of late.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.199
And our most recent foe
expressly wanted Denji.

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.450
Can't be mere coincidence.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.327
Something has to be
going on here.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.329
Somehow, Denji is at
the crux of it,

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:22.291
and you know precisely why
that is, don't you, ma'am?

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.793
[POWER]
Relinquish that!

00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:27.380
[POWER]
That, too, 'tis mine!

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:33.511
If you manage to outdrink me,
then I'll tell you.

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.265
Excuse me, sir.
Two more beers, please.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:40.434
[HIMENO giggles]
Hey! Why not make it three?

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:42.186
I'm playing the game, too!

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.522
More! More horse meat
and chicken!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.982
Fried chicken!

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.152

I claim that as well.

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:55.700
Excuse me. I'll take
another beer, please.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.785
[LADY AGENT A] I'm still
in disbelief, Power.

00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.454
Not many Fiends suppress
their homicidal desires,

00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:01.581
but you do it with ease.

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:04.458
My excellent IQ is to
thank for that marvel.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.295
Your urge to kill is
determined by your IQ?

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.130
Then just how advanced is yours?

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:10.923
[POWER]
Um, one hundred?

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.758
[LADY AGENT A]
Is that really so high?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.428
I think I may have scored
around a hundred.

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:16.971
'Tis 120, then.

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.682
[LADY AGENT A] Fushi's also
got a high IQ. Doncha?

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.475
Specifically, 134.

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:22.977
[LADY AGENT A]
You're a little too proud if you

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.229
remember it so well.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:29.066
Mine's somewhere between
500 and a thousand. Yes!

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:31.861
You okay?

00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:35.114
Oh, my.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.657
[LADY AGENT A]
All right.

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:38.492
[POWER laughs]

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.622
[DENJI] She's watching!
And she has a front row seat!

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:45.750
Hang on. Is that
her tongue I'm feeling?

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:48.044
Feels good. It's so soft!

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:49.086
What the hell?

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:52.173
Her tongue.
It's melting in my mouth!

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:54.675
Wait. I think that's--!

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:56.802
Puke!

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:58.471
[laughs]

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:00.556
Well, that's gonna
leave some trauma.

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:01.557
Oh, gracious.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.685
Could we get a towel over here?
Or anything to wipe this up?

00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:05.519
Just watch!

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:09.023
This entire fiasco is
about to get way worse!

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.317
If it holds nutritional value
and enters his mouth,

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.653
he's prone to swallow
no matter what!

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:15.988
[POWER laughing]

00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:22.370

Dinner is served!

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:33.214
[DENJI laughs]
Check it out, Pochita!

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:36.467
Gross! They're just chowin' down
on some drunk's puke!

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:39.136
Never mind how it didn't agree
with someone else's stomach!

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.431
As a fellow mammal,
I feel sorry for 'em!

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.351
[DENJI retching]

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.602
Unbelievable.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:50.189
Himeno has no self-restraint,
huh? None at all.

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.904
I'm glad my method's
helping you.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.322
Picked it up taking
care of my mom

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:01.158
when she'd come home
after work, drunk.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.743
Although, I'd much
rather my talents

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:05.371
be related to Devil
Hunting, like yours.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.289
I'm pretty envious.

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:12.211
[DENJI] You think you wanna be
in my shoes? Seriously?

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.672
I waited 16 years
for my first kiss,

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.174
only for it to taste like b--

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.884
[DENJI retches]

00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:20.386
True.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:23.806
--[DENJI retching]
--[ARAI chuckles]

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.894
[MAKIMA] I'll escort
the Hayakawa trio home.

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:31.439
And then we'll have
Arai look after Himeno.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.941
Hey, guys, don't forget
to thank Miss Makima.

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:35.651
She covered the whole tab!

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:37.111
The best tasting alcohol, to me,

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:39.196
is the kind
someone else paid for.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.114
Right?

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:44.827
[gasps] Hold on.
Where'd Denji go?

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.162
He's with Himeno.

00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:49.749
She scooped him up and carried
'im piggyback style somewhere.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:56.839
[DENJI]
It's dark. Too dark.

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:59.175
Where am I, anyway?

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:02.928
Water. I need water.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.389
[DENJI]
Wait, that's right!

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:09.185
I got barf kissed by
Princess Pukes-a-lot.

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:14.565
Damn it! I really
need some water!

00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:32.208
That's weird.

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:34.418
Why is Den-Den-Denji here?

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.838
This is my place, silly boy.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.801
Oh. You might be here
because I brought you.

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:44.678
I'm not sure.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.474
The room's spinning.
What the hell's going on?

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.562
Oh, sweet Denji.

00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:56.190
You're crazy about
Miss Makima, aren'tchoo?

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:59.610
Dude. I'm so dizzy.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.822
You could do a million times
better than that selfish bitch.

00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:06.242
Open your eyes! Aki, too!

00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:08.536
Give up and stop
fawning over her!

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:10.162
Move on.

00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:12.790
Moo, like cows!

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:15.626
[laughs]

00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:38.983
[HIMENO]
Wanna do it?
