along with both their eyes.

[FUTURE DEVIL] I can tell you
about it if you like.

[AKI]
Don't bother.

00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.880
I couldn't give a damn
about the way I die.

Only thing that matters is that
I kill who I need to kill.

You've gotten to a point where
we don't have to do this daily.

But I also realize
that the only way

poppin' caps out in Tokyo.

I don't think any of us
want that kinda trouble.

I need you to understand

that those boys weren't
acting on my orders.

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:54.112
I've been asking around,
and from what I hear,

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.323
this Sawatari woman
put 'em up to it.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:00.535
Seems she got her hooks into
a bunch of our low-level guys.

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:01.744
The knuckleheads all ended up

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.455
signing contracts
with the Gun Devil.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.541
What were the terms
of their contracts?

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.836
They say the buy-in fee
was a flat 20,000 yen.

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:13.423
That payment would get you
at least one gun and some ammo.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:17.093
Who would've figured that
devils want money, too, right?

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:20.180
Guess they're not so different
from us after all.

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:23.141
I'd like the names of
everyone in your organization

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.726
who signed one of
those contracts.
