WEBVTT

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:32.991
Oh, wow! That feels nice!

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:37.996
[gasps]

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.000
[gasps]

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.464
What's this thing?

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.466
'Tis a pad of the bra.

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:53.262
Bosoms appear larger when
this wondrous item's applied.

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:59.226
Come! Claim thy second feel!

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:00.561
[DENJI gulps]

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.402
Ooh.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.863
[POWER]
Now! The final fondling!

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.619
And that's it!
Squeezing complete!

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:20.789
Was it not the most
splendid experience?

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.251
Stunned by just how
fortunate you are?

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:26.420
Now, 'tis fair to call us even.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.005
With Meowy back in my custody...

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:33.385
[DENJI] There's so much
I could say, but... Huh?

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:36.013
Which is why I shall
continue to help you lot.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:39.975
I'm sure the pleasure
is all yours! [laughs]

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:41.560
To bed we go, Meowy, my dearest!

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:42.853
[MEOWY meows]

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.027
[DENJI]
That's it?

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.336
[POWER]
Mm! Delectable!

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.130
[POWER chewing]

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.215
Ahh! Another serving
would be grand.

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.049
Yours will do!

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.676
[AKI gasps]
You little!

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:40.512
[POWER] Where shall we
slaughter devils today?

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:45.934
Hey. Answer!

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:49.604
Right now!

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:54.818
[MAKIMA] This is the
property damage report.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.654
This verifies the disposal
of the devils' bodies

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.322
while this form is
from the Ministry of

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.117
Land, Infrastructure,
Transport, and Tourism.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.203
Stamp it here and over
in this corner as well.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.045
[MAKIMA] I hate making you do
this mountain of paperwork.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.505
It's almost like
you're being punished

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.591
for killing the Bat Devil.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.846
[MAKIMA] Denji? Is there
something on your mind?

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:29.936
[DENJI] So, um. I finally got
a hold of this longtime dream

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.397
I've been chasin', right?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.734
But once it was sittin'
in the palm of my hand,

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:39.362
it was way less life changing
than I thought it'd be.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.491
And now I'm all,
if I go after something else

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:46.036
and eventually manage
to nab that, too,

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.954
am I just gonna
realize I was happier

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:51.666
chasing the thing than
I am actually having it?

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.630
[DENJI] That's, like,
total bullshit, isn't it?

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.968
Can you be more specific about
the goal that you achieved?

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.930
Well. I touched some boobs
for the very first time,

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:08.099
but it turns out second base
is no big whoop.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.476
[MAKIMA]
Hm.

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:12.103
[DENJI gasps]

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.653
Listen, Denji.

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:22.906
I believe that when it
comes to sexual matters,

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:27.494
the better you understand your
partner, the better you'll feel.

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.706
[MAKIMA] But understanding
another's heart

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:35.460
is easier said than done,
so start small.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.003
Perhaps with hands.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.840
Take your time and
carefully study them.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:44.678
[MAKIMA]
How long are their fingers?

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.596
[gasps]

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:51.643
[MAKIMA]
And their palms. Are they cold?

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.354
Or are they warm?

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.274
What's the shape of their ears?

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:03.488
Has anyone bitten
your finger before?

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.698
[DENJI]
B-Bi--?

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.533
Pay attention.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:10.829
Remember this so that
even if you lost your vision,

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:15.917
you'd still recognize me
just from how hard I bite.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.045
Memorize it.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.766
I think I got it.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:45.030
[DENJI gasps]

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:51.328
[DENJI gasping]

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:08.303
Denji, dear. There's a
favor I'd like to ask.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.430
If that's all right.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.725
[DENJI]
Sure.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.942
I want you to bring down
the Gun Devil for me.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.444
[DENJI]
The Gun Devil?

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:28.031
Thirteen years ago,
it first appeared in America.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:31.159
Its current location is unknown.

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.453
This particular devil
is very strong

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.915
and I've yet to meet a hunter
who didn't want to slay it.

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:39.626
But while most are all talk,

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:43.213
I think you could actually
pull off the kill.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.714
You're special.

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:48.510
More so than any of
the other Devil Hunters.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:52.222
So if you prove me right
and execute the Gun Devil,

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.641
you may tell me
any wish you have,

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.143
and I'll ensure
that it comes true.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.440
You're saying if I'm able to
find and murderize this thing,

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.068
then you'll see to it that
my wish comes true?

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.862
No matter what
the wish is, you'll do it?

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.614
[MAKIMA]
Mm-hmm.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:13.118
Hang on. I'm not sure
I understand.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.453
If I figure out a way
to kill the Gun Devil,

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.247
you, Miss Makima,
are gonna personally

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.749
grant any wish that
pops into my head?

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.042
[MAKIMA]
Mm-hmm.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.340
Anything, though?
Like, even se--?

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.218
[MAKIMA]
Yes, Denji, any wish.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.472
[DENJI] Holy shit! And that
ain't breakin' the rules?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.391
[MAKIMA] It's only permissible
because this target

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.227
is such a threat, mind you.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.354
To counter devils,
humans need weapons,

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.815
and for a time,
they tried to cash in on guns.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:48.194
Crime and conflict increased
worldwide as a result of that.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:51.197
The news focused on
firearms nonstop.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.574
Fear of gun violence reached

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.201
an all-time high
in every country.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.456
[MAKIMA] Then, there was a
devastating terrorist attack

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.750
involving guns in America.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.545
That same day,
the Gun Devil appeared.

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:11.176
[AKI'S MOM] "This is where
I live," said the city mouse.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.678
He seemed rather
proud of his home.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.473
"That's quite a big house
for one mouse!"

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.099
exclaimed the country mouse.

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:19.392
He didn't know
the city mouse's family--

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:22.896
[AKI] Dad! Come outside
and play catch with me.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.898
[AKI'S DAD]
Taiyo isn't feeling well.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.399
Find something
you can play by yourself.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:29.360
[sighs] That excuse again?

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.488
When has Taiyo
ever not felt bad?

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.239
Hey, that's not very brotherly.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.950
Be good and play
by yourself for now.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.040
[TAIYO] No... I-I'm well
enough to play outside.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.375
[AKI'S PARENTS gasp]

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.062
[AKI]
Don't follow me.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.734
[AKI] Beat it! You're getting
on my nerves, Taiyo!

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.027
[gasps]

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.990
I was fine playing by myself.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.492
[gasps]

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:25.667
[TAIYO laughing]
Take that!

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.919
Cut it out, before I make you!

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:34.092
--[AKI grunting]
--[TAIYO laughing]

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.846
[TAIYO]
It's freezing.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:44.185
[AKI, TAIYO panting]

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:48.231
[AKI] If you catch a cold,
I'll be the one in trouble.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.529
[AKI] Playing catch should
keep your hands warmer.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.699
Go grab our gloves
from the house.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.452
[TAIYO laughs]
Woohoo!

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.545
[giggles]

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:23.183
[MAKIMA]
In a little under five minutes,

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:26.603
one point two million
people were annihilated.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.230
The Gun Devil then
fell off the face of the earth

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.733
and hasn't been seen since.

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.571
[MAKIMA]
After the incident,

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.032
fear of devils as
a whole skyrocketed,

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:42.368
and as you know,
fear only bolsters them.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.748
Thus, devils across the board
gained record strength.

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:49.751
In an attempt to weaken the
Gun Devil even the slightest,

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:52.378
gun control laws got
a lot more severe,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.756
and news coverage on
violent crime and disasters

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:57.217
saw a surge in censorship.

00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.386
Uh... Summa that
went over my head,

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:03.890
but it seems this thing's
too strong to comprehend.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.851
Does destroying it
sound plausible to you?

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.562
[DENJI] Well, couldn't say
for sure, but...

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:13.107
I bet if I pull out all
the stops and try super hard,

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:16.152
it'll be a peace of cake!

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.779
[MAKIMA]
In that case,

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.990
we'll begin by
pinpointing its location.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.536
And just how are we
supposed to do that?

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.414
[MAKIMA] These are pieces of
the Gun Devil we've collected.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.124
Apparently it's so fast,

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.336
bits of its body burn off
when it moves.

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.088
If a devil consumes
some of this,

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:38.258
their power is enhanced,
regardless of their nature.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:41.886
And if the pieces are close
enough, they attach, like so.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.179
Badass.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.516
In case it hasn't sunk in yet,
this devil's incredibly strong,

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:49.435
as is the force that draws
its chunks of flesh together.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:52.939
Once big enough, they'll be
attracted to the original body.

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.524
So, if we manage to make

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:57.235
the fragment in our
possession bigger,

00:12:57.277 --> 00:13:00.446
it'll lead us straight
to the Gun Devil.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:01.990
[AKI]
I found one.

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:08.413
[HIMENO] I figured it must've
snacked on a damn Gun chunk.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.039
Explains how
a small-fry like this

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.001
got to be such a heavyweight.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:17.463
But did it find that
or was it fed that?

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:18.548
It doesn't matter.

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:23.886
Our job remains the same.
We keep killing devils.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:28.224
They'll guide us to that thing
sooner or later.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.105
[MAKIMA] We received an
extermination request.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:37.358
There was a devil sighting
inside of a hotel.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.611
No confirmation on the
status of hotel guests.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.114
But several civilian hunters
who initially went in

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.949
have been found dead.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.201
There was movement
from a Gun Devil piece,

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.871
so it's likely the target
ingested another.

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:54.667
Six agents are to be dispatched,
all from Special Division Four.

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:03.468
[AKI] It's lurking somewhere
within those walls.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:06.429
And since it probably ate
a piece of the Gun Devil,

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:09.057
this sucker won't be
your garden variety.

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:13.269
[DENJI] What if it's, like,
the actual Gun Devil in there?

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:16.272
[AKI] The more flesh there is,
the more pull there is.

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:17.940
The reaction's too small.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.860
Aww. Low-key sucks.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.781
Yield up the chunk!
It amuses me!

00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:27.575
[AKI] Thought I told both of you
to work on your manners.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.452
--And?
--Your point?

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:30.286
That won't get me anywhere...

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:33.706
Pretentious half-witted
humans don't command me!

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.045
Hayakawa, sir.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.338
My liege.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.339
Better.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.215
Sweetness!

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:44.258
Huzzah! Mine!

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.968
May I have a word, sir?

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.138
Can we really entrust our
backs to the two newcomers,

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.475
considering we'll soon
fight one devil, if not more?

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:55.478
One's a Fiend,
and the other's some hoodlum.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.980
I'm having serious doubts.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.776
We aren't trusting them
to watch our backs.

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:02.985
They'll generally take point

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:05.405
when we're on
extermination missions.

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.824
If either tries to
run or double cross us,

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:09.659
then they die on the spot.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.161
Boo, you're treating us
like we're livestock!

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.455
Cuz you don't get human rights.

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:18.126
You think he's still pissed
about this morning?

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.502
That's gotta be it, right?

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:22.046
In hindsight, it's clear
our prank went too far.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.132
Pranks aren't anywhere
near that vile!

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:25.383
Go to hell!

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.802
Come on. What'd they do?

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.930
At any rate, you can't be strict
with them all the time, Aki.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.014
[DENJI]
She's right!

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:35.226
That bat almost killed me, but I
went straight back to the grind!

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.019
I want a reward!

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.855
Oho!

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:41.941
If it's a prize you're after,
I'll take one for the team!

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.735
The lucky hunter who
sends this devil to its grave

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:48.656
wins an amazingly sweet
smooch-a-roo from moi!

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.366
--Bwuh!
--What?

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.369
Unthinkable! That's just wrong!

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.830
An unmarried woman
shouldn't be so lewd!

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.666
Why? Rewards boost morale!

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:02.086
Who cares if
they're lewd? Right?

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:13.347
Yeah, I'll have to pass, too.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:16.392
But don't worry.
I got plenty of morale.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:17.310
Huh?

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:21.105
Already got my first kiss
in mind, and it ain't with you.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.441
She asked me to find these
meat chunks or whatever,

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:25.193
so that's the plan for now.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.903
Once the Gun Devil's
dead and buried,

00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:29.197
I'll get lotsa "smooch-a-roos."

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:32.992
Wow. That is a bold thing
to say in front of Aki!

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:36.204
And besides, I learned
a lesson I took to heart.

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.831
When it comes to naughty stuff,
it feels way better

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.501
when it's with someone
you know, right?

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:42.710
I don't even know your name,

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:45.296
so I couldn't be less
interested in your lips.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:48.299
Huh?

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:54.680
[HIMENO] Then, if the winner
happens to be you, Denji,

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:57.767
your reward will have
a little tongue in it.

00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.810
[DENJI gasps]

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:06.817
[DENJI panting]

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.778
[ARAI]
Hey! Slow down!

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.281
Don't go off on your own!
It's dangerous!

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:15.910
[HIMENO] Damn, do I get the
best kick outta teasing boys!

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:18.162
Do we have some kind
of plan here, or...?

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.747
I yearn for blood.

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:23.626
For the last time!
Stop right where you are!

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.338
[ARAI] Himeno was
nice enough t' train me

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.507
for half a year
and I'm in her debt!

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.300
So if a ruffian
from who knows where

00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:32.843
is going to steal her lips,

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.762
then I'll take that
kiss on the cheek!

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:38.641
Go away! Think I want some dude
pressin' up against me?

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:39.642
[ARAI]
What? I'm not--?

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:40.518
[DENJI]
Just get off!

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.229
[POWER] I wish to take part
in this altercation!

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.814
[DENJI]
...bigger than yours!

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:46.607
So, Himeno,
what're your thoughts

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.776
on your two rookie hunters?

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.528
[POWER, ARAI, DENJI yelling]

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.280
[HIMENO]
Well, what Arai lacks in ability

00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.907
he makes up for in motivation.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.742
Meanwhile,
Kobeni's got the moves,

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:59.036
but she's extremely timid.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.289
Will those four survive
to see another day?

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.291
Or should we call the coroner?

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:04.959
[ARAI]
I'm gonna let go.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:09.422
[AKI] Doesn't matter if I think
a beginner is strong or weak.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:12.675
Most end up dead
or go private after a year.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.178
[HIMENO] Boy, you sure
dodged that question.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.430
[POWER laughs]

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.182
You best not die on me, Aki.

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:22.977
[POWER laughs]

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:41.954
[KISHIBE] Himeno, allow me to
introduce your new partner.

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:45.458
He's rude, but I trained him
to be of some use.

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:47.251
Try 'n' play nice.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:55.092
Name's Aki. How goes?

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.975
You're actually useful?

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:08.481
Yeah. Sure.

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:11.817
Though I'm your first,
you're my sixth partner.

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:14.195
Everyone else is gone.

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:17.365
All dead because they
were utterly useless.

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:18.866
[gasps]

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.495
You best not die on me, Aki.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.414
[DENJI] I'm startin' to think
the devils that were here

00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.792
musta had an early checkout.

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:31.253
[DENJI] You sure that
dangly meat chunk of yours

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:32.713
ain't busted?

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:37.093
[DENJI sighs]
So tired.

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:41.222
Stay sharp. It's coming.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.077
[growls]

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.453
[gasps]

00:20:04.495 --> 00:20:05.913
[roars]

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.124
Easy, I've got it.

00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:09.750
It's floating!

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:11.127
[POWER]
Have at thee!

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:12.253
[grunts]

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:18.092
[KOBENI screams]

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:19.802
[gasps]

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:23.389
Cowardly rogue! It froze
in midair when it saw me!

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:24.640
[laughs]

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:26.767
[HIMENO]
No, no, no! That was all me.

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:27.768
[POWER]
How so?

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.313
Not to brag, but I'm locked in
a contract with the Ghost Devil.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:33.691
Gave up my eye for
the hand of a ghost.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.777
Spooky powers at my command.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:40.906
Packs a mean punch and it's
invisible, so it's pretty nifty.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:45.119
How 'bout it, Aki?
Any Gun flesh detected there?

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:48.622
No strong reaction.
This isn't our devil.

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:52.376
I see. Then let's
keep heading up.

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:55.921
[POWER] Is it wise to
blather on about your powers

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:58.382
in my presence,
oh confident one?

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:01.510
Are you naked apes
not meant to hold my reins?

00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:02.803
[HIMENO]
We'll work better as a team

00:21:02.845 --> 00:21:04.889
if we know what everyone can do.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.184
Plus, I've got a few tricks up
my sleeve, so I'm not stressin'.

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:10.394
[POWER]
Do you speak true?

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:13.606
What trick would you pull
if I aimed to kill her?

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:14.732
[groans]

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.400
Put away your pointy toy.

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:18.068
I'd prefer you not make me
choke you to death

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.196
because you can't behave.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.200
'Tis untouchable!

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:30.331
[gasps, coughs]

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:33.167
[HIMENO] It's easier if we
get along, so I hope we do!

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:34.919
[DENJI chuckles]

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.505
[POWER groans]
I shall devour you in time!

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:40.466
[DENJI] Don't you dare,
I'm tryin' to score a kiss.

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:41.467
[ARAI]
Have either of you realized

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.177
our target is still at large?

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:45.054
Less talking, and mo--

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:49.934
[ARAI]
Huh?

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:56.565
[POWER] She does seem like
she'd be unpleasant raw.

00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.150
Is there a problem?

00:21:58.192 --> 00:21:59.568
I'm not really sure.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.529
Were we on our way to the
ninth floor from the eighth,

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.447
or am I just losing it?

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:04.824
[AKI]
We were.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.661
[ARAI]
But this is the eighth floor.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.288
[DENJI] There a chance
you read it wrong?

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.666
'Course not!
Something's going on here.

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:15.125
I'll double-check!

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.378
[POWER]
I know! Grilled like a steak!

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:20.005
[DENJI] Steak? I could
go for summa that!

00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:21.090
[AKI]
Huh?

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:22.591
[DENJI, POWER]
Hm?

00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.344
Wha?

00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:28.848
Arai, hold up.

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:32.476
Just now, we watched you
go down the stairs.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.858
No, no, no--!
