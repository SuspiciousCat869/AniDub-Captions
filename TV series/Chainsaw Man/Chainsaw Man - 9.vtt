00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:32.088
[KOBENI]
This is bad. I'm losing it.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.981
[KOBENI]
He protected me.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.733
It's my fault.

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:56.195
It's all my fault.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:59.115
I... I just...

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:03.577
[KOBENI crying]

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.788
[KOBENI]
I can't take it.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.583
This job is going to
drive me crazy.

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:14.296
[KOBENI] I'll tell
Miss Himeno I'm quitting

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.090
next time I see her.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.856
[PEDESTRIAN C gasps]

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:35.109
Madoka. Glad to see
you're alive.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.403
How much of the
Special Division's left?

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:38.654
We got hit bad.

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:40.531
All teams, one through four.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.366
Heavy casualties.

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:45.911
They're mostly dead,
aside from non-human members.

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:49.749
Utilizing firearms to
dispose of Special Divisions.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.918
The odds of the Gun Devil
being involved are high.

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:56.005
I have a message for you.

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:58.799
The brass wants to merge
divisions one, two, and three

00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:01.844
into four due to
personnel shortage.

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:04.972
They said going forward,
that unified team

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:07.892
will be under your
command, Makima.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.685
[KUROSE, TENDO gasp]

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:17.860
[MADOKA]
There's this, too.

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.445
[MAKIMA]
What is it?

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.697
My resignation letter.

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.574
Wait, you're quitting?

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.410
I just feel the Special
Division's trouble.

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:27.870
If I don't quit while
I have the chance,

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.206
I'll likely be killed.

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.791
I see.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.178
[MADOKA]
I do have one last question.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.556
Today was brutal,
and I'm curious now.

00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:49.934
How much of it
did you anticipate?

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.771
[MAKIMA] I'm not at liberty
to discuss Public Safety

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:56.565
intel with private citizens.

00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.901
Thank you for
your service, Madoka.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:02.071
I'll be sure to pass this on
to where it needs to go.

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:21.090
Uh, to be clear, neither of us

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:24.093
have any intention of
joining your special force.

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:26.595
[TENDO] We only came to Tokyo
to help with training.

00:22:26.637 --> 00:22:27.680
[KUROSE]
One week from now,

00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:30.349
we'll be heading
right back to Kyoto.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.728
[MAKIMA]
Such a shame.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.399
The dining in this city
is absolutely to die for.
