WEBVTT

00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:16.308
[HIMENO] Oof. Where's my key?
Now we're in business.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.025
[HIMENO]
Upsy-daisy.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.658
[HIMENO groans]

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.953
[HIMENO]
Aww, man.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:41.333
[HIMENO]
And down.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.256
[sighs]

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:58.600
[HIMENO]
Off you go. Both of you.

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:08.360
[HIMENO humming]

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:16.034
[HIMENO humming]

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.203
[HIMENO chuckles]

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:32.801
[HIMENO humming]

[groaning]

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.880
[sighs] Good stuff.

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.968
We didn't learn a damn thing
about Miss Makima.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.013
Like, what even is
her deal? [hiccups]

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:19.806
But, hey, what're you gonna do?

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.224
[DENJI groans]

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.768
What was that?

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:27.272
I need some water.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.521
That's weird.
Why is Den-Den-Denji here?

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:10.565
This is my place, silly boy.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:16.238
Oh. You might be here
because I brought you.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.781
Not sure.

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:21.952
The room is spinning.
The hell's going on?

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.664
Sweet Denji.

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:29.126
You're crazy about
Miss Makima, aren't you?

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.378
So dizzy.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.631
You could do a million times
better than that selfish bitch.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.592
Open your eyes! Aki, too!

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.095
Give up and stop
fawning over her!

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:43.932
Move on! Moo! Like cows!

00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:49.855
[laughs]

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.592
[HIMENO]
Wanna do it?

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:02.779
[DENJI]
D-Do what?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.782
Fuck.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:11.955
Stick 'em up.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.342
[HIMENO]
Thash right. Good boy.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.678
[DENJI]
Should I be doing this?

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:31.057
[DENJI] I was supposed to have
my first kiss with Miss Makima.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.311
But this chick blew
chunks all over that.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:37.731
Do I really want my first time
to be with her, too?

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.777
Yes!

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.575
[gasps]

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.912
There we go.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.500
Your pants.
Let's get 'em off, kay?

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.802
[HIMENO]
Huh?

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:13.141
[HIMENO] You got shumthin'
in your pocket.

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:17.854
[HIMENO]
A Chupa Chups lollipop?

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:18.897
And it's dirty!

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:20.482
[gasps]

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.568
[MAKIMA]
Denji. Denjii?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.821
Hello? Are you okay?

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.990
Would you like to
get some fresh air?

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:42.879
I got you nausea medicine
from the supermarket.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.924
Wash it down with
a glass of water before bed.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:54.391
Tonight, I-I had probably
the shittiest first kiss ever.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:59.354
So even if I kiss a bunch
of girls from here on out...

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:05.860
...will they all
taste like vomit?

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.365
Open your mouth.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.202
[DENJI gasps]

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:25.046
[MAKIMA] I doubt you'll ever
forget how that vomit tasted.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.633
Don't worry, though.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.177
Life comes in a wide
variety of flavors.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.097
With each passing day, you'll
experience different ones.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.890
And every new experience
will make it

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:38.810
that much harder
to recall that puke.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:42.439
For example, you just had
your first indirect kiss,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.817
and it tastes like Cola-flavored
Chupa Chups.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.035
Pochita. Listen.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.787
You pro'ly wanted
to do that, but...

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:02.876
I'm sorry. I want Miss Makima
to be my first.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:09.049
So sex is gonna have to wait
till I kill the Gun Devil.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.017
[snoring]

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.561
[HIMENO]
Good morning, Denji.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.773
[yawns]

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.317
You hungry? 'Cause I am.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.073
[DENJI] Lookin' down on
people while you eat

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.658
makes grub taste
a million times better.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.704
[HIMENO] Okay, so. I drank my
weight in alcohol last night,

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.457
and now I'm blanking
on everything.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.918
Did I happen to
take advantage of you?

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.337
Think I'd do it with gag-zilla?

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:50.381
I'm savin' my first time
for Miss Makima.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.427
Phew, thank god,
that's a relief.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:55.637
My ass would be in jail

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.723
for doing that with
a minor, super quick.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.069
You are "strange" personified.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.029
Most guys would've
bailed out on a situation

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.156
as awkward as this one.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:19.536
Why? Be stranger to leave
and turn down a free breakfast.

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:23.456
So, you're serious about
getting with Miss Makima?

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.250
Yes.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.751
What if you learned
her true character's

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.378
as shitty as a septic tank?

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:29.963
I love shit.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.427
Cool! Then I'll act as
your matchmaker

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.221
and help hook you guys up.

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.431
[gasps] Yeah?

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.725
Totally! Why not?

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.770
In fact, let's form a secret
alliance, you and I.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.857
I'll work my wingwoman magic
on you and Makima,

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.359
and you help me lock down Aki.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.202
[DENJI] What do you like
about him, anyway?

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.203
He's hot.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:05.957
Heh. Well...

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:10.378
Sure. You're on.
Let's alliance up.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.797
Glad to have you aboard,
fellow matchmaker.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.426
From this point on, we're
colleagues, and friends, too.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.391
Come have breakfast
once in a while,

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.810
and bring your
roommates with you.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.736
[DENJI] D'you think Miss Makima
would join us?

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:49.918
[MAKIMA] How long do we have
before we arrive in Kyoto?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.086
[SUBORDINATE A]
Hmm. Thirty minutes.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.339
[MAKIMA]
I'll eat at the station, then.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.424
Don't forget you have
a one o'clock luncheon.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:57.508
[MAKIMA]
I'll just have to make sure

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.094
I leave a little bit
of room, won't I?

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.347
I can't think of
anything worse than

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.724
meeting with the Kyoto bigwigs.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.684
They're so intimidating.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:10.396
Refreshments are hardly
refreshing when you can't relax.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:15.485
But last night's drinks.
Those were great.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:46.683
[PASSENGERS whispering]

[MAN A]
This is Team C. Do you copy?

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.357
We are a go.

[gunshots]

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.423
[DENJI]
Hm? What wassat?

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.759
[POWER] Need you ask,
O idle-headed oaf?

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.344
'Twas a taiko drum.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:05.511
There a festival?

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:06.596
Speak, harlot.

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:10.558
Either you and Denji copulated
yestereve or you're lying.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.437
Denji is quite the gentleman
when he wants to be. No lie.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.733
[MAN] I'm amazed you
can stomach this joint's ramen.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.860
The taste don't bug you?

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:25.615
Who's he?

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.283
This ramen's mighty tasty to me.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:30.620
Don't converse with me
so casually, mortal!

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:33.748
[MAN] You can't tell
good food from bad, huh?

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.958
I guess it sorta figures.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.128
If your diet consists of nothing
but crap from an early age,

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.757
then you're bound to have
crap taste when you're grown.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.510
Bad taste makes it
hard to find happiness, too.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.387
[POWER]
I am perfectly happy!

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:48.596
Do you wanna leave?

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:52.225
Grandad had exquisite taste
and a heart o' gold.

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:55.186
He would take me to
the best restaurants.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:00.817
So what if he was a yakuza guy?
He still had principles.

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:06.322
Ever hear of "necessary evil"?
Because that's what he was.

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:09.200
He only killed a handful
of women and children,

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.411
and I know he liked kids
well enough since he

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:14.664
spoiled me rotten with the money
he made from dealing.

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.417
He was what you'd call
a real Tokyoite,

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:19.627
and everybody loved him.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.800
Denji. You loved him
as well, didn't you?

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.678
All right. The fuck do you want?

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:30.138
You know him?

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.681
What you should know

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:35.768
is that the Gun Devil
is after your heart.

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.823
How's Himeno?

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.994
She requires
a medical practitioner.

00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:01.914
[AKI]
Damn it. That bastard had a gun.

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.791
Ought to only be possible
for Devil Hunters

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.419
and cops to obtain
them in Japan.

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:08.963
[SAMURAI SWORD]
What you should know

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:11.882
is that the Gun Devil
is after your heart.

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:15.595
[gasps] First of all, we have to
get Himeno to a doctor!

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:17.430
[SAWATARI]
The Curse Devil, huh?

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.850
Stab someone with that oversized
nail enough times and they die.

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:23.311
Is that the gist of it?

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:26.147
You've got some
pretty impressive moves.

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.107
Where'd you come from?

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.692
You in league with him?

00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:40.244
[SAMURAI SWORD groans]

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.046
D'you know why you lost?

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:53.090
I had my guard down.
Like, all the way.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.508
Better kill 'im this time, then.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.429
[SAMURAI SWORD growls]

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:13.778
[groans]

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.753
[SAWATARI] You know he's
still alive, right?

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:34.131
Those Devil Hunter suits
are surprisingly durable.

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:37.301
Don't underestimate him again.

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:40.971
Aki needs you.
Leave me and save him.

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.307
Nay. I can't follow him.

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:45.726
He moves too quickly.

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:47.728
Ghost, go!

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:52.525
I will not. Awful girl.
I don't like her.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.238
[gasps]

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.421
I'll give you everything
that I've got in exchange.

00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:17.341
So give me everything
you've got, too.

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:39.697
[HIMENO]
Aki is still capable of crying.

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:45.327
[HIMENO] People die
so often in this field

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:49.206
that most Devil Hunters don't
have any tears left to shed.

00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:52.042
[HIMENO]
Not Aki, though.

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:54.044
I remember thinking
how odd he was,

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.213
going off to bawl
like a baby in private

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:59.508
when the rookies he was
looking after bit the dust.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:05.723
[HIMENO] Having someone care
for you enough to cry like that

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.725
must be nice.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.818
Hey! Little help here?

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:25.242
[SAMURAI SWORD groaning]

00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:42.802
Best not die. Got that, Aki?

00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:46.722
Because, when I finally go...

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:54.146
...you can cry for me.

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:56.440
Snake. Swallow it.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.453
Return.
