[BAT DEVIL] Lest you want to
end all nine lives of this cat,

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.937
bring me a human being.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.069
[POWER]
Every life is equally trivial.

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.947
And 'tis merely a cat.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:16.451
So why do I run,
in search of a human?

[POWER gasps]

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:20.914

Simply to save Meowy?

[POWER gasps]

[POWER]
Such a foolish reason.

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.428
[POWER]
I love blood.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.558
The taste, the smell,
the sense of mortality.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.229
And then, I happened upon
a more recent discovery.

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:48.317
[POWER]
Blood is nice and warm.

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.611
It feels pleasant.

[POWER]
Why did you save me?

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.263
I attempted to kill you.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:32.944
[POWER]
Such a foolish reason.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.748
Please, forgive my deceit.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.668
Since Meowy is safe,

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.212
you may touch my chest.

Not so much as a finger.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:18.527
Take Meowy and run
as fast as you can.

Huh?

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.206

[DENJI]
Must not have enough blood.

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:40.882
You're the one who
killed Batty, right?

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:44.469
Just when I finally managed
to track down my man.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.848
I find him gutted open
by a shrimp!

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.062
Oh-ho. You're pretty
easy on the eyes, too.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.273
It'd be a tragedy
to kill such a stud,

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.942
so you're free to go!

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:01.069
[DENJI]
What about those two?

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:05.574
[chuckles] They're going to die.

[LEECH DEVIL]
You've got to be kidding me.

How'd a pupper like you make
mincemeat of my Batty-baby?

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.898
We both dreamed of
filling our stomachs

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.109
with every insufferable human
that ever walked the earth.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.402
An impossible dream,

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:30.951
And some yippy little
lapdog went and ruined it.

have one less head-turner,

No way I'm dyin' till

It's revenge this,

Save my stupid kitty!
Blah, blah, blah!

You really are like a devil.

The one I was "chummy" with

As per our contract,
I feed it part of my body

Ahh. Sounds painful.

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.529
[knocking]

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:49.282
Yes, come in.

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:50.950
[AKI]
Pardon the intrusion.

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.334
[AKI] They were outside
the patrol zone

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:03.671
before they knew it,
or so Denji claims.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.047
Their extended
stroll led them to

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:07.800
a house that appeared,
quote, "super sketch."

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:10.887
And, upon investigating,
they found the bat.

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:14.307
Denji used his chainsaws
to destroy the Bat Devil.

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:17.143
Then, the Leech Devil
instigated a counterattack.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.979
Special Division Four
handled that threat.

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:22.231
We examined both of
the targets' heads.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:25.026
Neither held any
traces of Gun flesh.

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:27.069
That concludes my report.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.574
Excellent work.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.785
But I do have a concern.

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.412
Denji and Power got rather far

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.290
before anyone noticed
they had left.

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:42.210
No one had fully accounted
for how stupid they are.

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.879
They just abandoned
their preapproved area.

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.964
Big breach of conduct.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.258
I believe it's worth overlooking
on this occasion.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.178
Because of them, we were able
to exterminate two devils.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.472
Without a single casualty.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.771
Very well, then.

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.232
Thank you. Evening, ma'am.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:08.861
I can't help but notice you seem
more flexible these days.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:14.283
Makes me wonder if Denji's
influence is responsible.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:15.785
[AKI]
Doubtful.

00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:18.579
I'm the exact same guy
I've always been.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.456
Nothing's changed.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:42.770
[alarm beeping]

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:48.919
[DENJI yawns]

00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:55.217
How is he up so friggin' early?

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.663
Whatcha makin' for lunch?

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:24.872
Curry.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:25.790
Yeah!

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.249
[knocking]

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:28.250
[AKI]
Hm?

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.585
[banging]

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.505
The hell?
Devils do house calls?

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.095
[POWER]
Well, well, well!

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:41.514
What a dismal abode
you have here!

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:43.641
[MEOWY meows]

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.728
Your apartment can comfortably
house three people,

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.398
and I'd like it if Power
was one of them.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:53.275
Denji and Power are still
a little too untamed.

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:55.403
They could use
a good leash like you.

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:59.031
I won't argue that, but why's
my place psycho central?

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:00.866
Because I know that
space is secure enough.

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:03.494
And I also trust you
more than anybody else.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.620
[POWER]
'Tis mine now!

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.164
[DENJI]
Gimme my super toast back!

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.542
Oh. Great.

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:10.793
It'd be a little odd to have her

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.879
staying at the
office indefinitely.

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:18.259
Yes. I see.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.218
Power assured me that

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.053
she would be on
her best behavior,

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:24.014
so there's really
no reason to worry.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.599
It'll be fine.

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.770
[POWER]
Foul vegetables! Begone!

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:31.063
[AKI, DENJI gasp]

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:33.774
Hey! Do not throw your food!

00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:35.109
What he said!

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:38.320
Respect the farmers who took
the time to grow these veggies!

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:39.989
Damn devil!

00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:42.283
[POWER]
The toilet?

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.869
I'm the type who
seldom flushes my feces.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.953
Not in this house!

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.580
That's nasty.

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:49.707
I'm the type who
seldom chooses to bathe.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:50.708
Get your butt in there!

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.418
You totally reek!

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.378
Humans are so delicate.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.922
Far too obsessed
with remaining clean.

00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:58.299
Aren't they, Meowy-wowy?

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.342
[MEOWY meows]

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:09.310
[DENJI]
Can't believe she just shows up

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.479
and starts raisin' hell.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.106
Even devils should flush!

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.941
Didn't eat 'er veggies either.

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:17.693
[POWER]
You there.

00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:20.613
Ah! Well, if it isn't
the Shit Devil

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:23.949
whose turds turn to cement
and stick to the bowl!

00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:30.164
Huh?

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:32.041
[POWER]
We had a deal, did we not?

00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:36.045
My chest is yours for
the fondling. Fondle away!

00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:38.255
[gasps]

00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:54.772
[POWER] What's the matter?
Aren't you exhilarated?

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.982
Commence your caressing.

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:04.615
[POWER]
You are thrice blessed.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:05.783
Which means you've
earned the honor

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:08.452
of squeezing my chest
three times.

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:10.996
Why'd I get three?

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:13.624
One's for safely
rescuing my cat.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:16.210
Slaying the Bat Devil
got you a second one.

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:18.295
And your third is
for protecting me

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.923
even when topknot
was interrogating you!

00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:24.176
I had no intention of
letting you do this at first,

00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:26.262
but I should repay you, yes?

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:27.471
Somehow.

00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:29.765
So squeeze them gratefully.

00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:36.814
[DENJI panting]

00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:38.983
[DENJI]
She's an angel!
