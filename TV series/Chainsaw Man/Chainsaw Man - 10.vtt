WEBVTT

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.683
It's troubling times.
If you're just tuning in,

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.686
I'm here in Nerima ward,
where, yesterday afternoon,

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:23.065
Public Safety Devil Hunters
engaged in a large-scale battle.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.234
But, according to several
eyewitness accounts,

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.277
devils weren't
their only opponents.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.239
Many claim to have also
seen armed humans fight--

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.157
[POWER]
Be silent.

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:53.554
[POWER gasps]

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.430
[POWER yells]

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.932
Relinquish thine
apple so that I may

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:59.059
feast upon its succulent flesh!

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.562
Yeah, not happening.
These are all mine!

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:04.815
You ran like a little bitch,
so no apples for you!

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:07.067
And that's where you're wrong,
for I did not run!

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:08.443
I went home because
I grew hungry!

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.153
[DENJI]
Stop lying, you scaredy-Fiend!

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.989
[POWER] You are the one
fabricating here!

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.616
Don't change the subject
to fabrics all of a sudden!

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:16.618
[AKI]
Who else?

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.869
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.665
Who lived from Division Four?

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.379
That runt, Kobeni.

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.382
Guess the quiet guy with
the glasses also counts,

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.759
'cept he quit Public Safety.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.642
[DENJI] Miss Makima was
askin' for me and Powy,

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:42.019
so we're gonna bounce.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.689
We came to eat your get-well
fruit, nothing more. [chuckles]

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:56.366
[DENJI]
Here. I can be a nice guy, too.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:57.784
See ya.

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:33.487
Curse, how many years
do I have left?

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:39.368
[CURSE DEVIL]
Two.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:49.646
[AKI crying]

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.941
[DENJI] I come back for my manga
and the dude's cryin'.

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:55.235
[AKI crying]

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.404
[DENJI] I can't really
blame him, though.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:04:00.323
A bunch of his work pals
ate it yesterday,

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:04.119
and that death toll
included his partner.

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:06.830
[gasps]

00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:08.331
[DENJI]
Wait.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.917
[DENJI]
Huh?

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.841
[DENJI]
I haven't, like, cried at all.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:23.263
[DENJI] I was pretty damn sad
when Pochita died.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.479
[DENJI] But I don't feel
nothin' for Himeno. Huh.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.730
She was the first person ever

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:34.316
who called herself
my friend, too.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.402
Am I a stone-cold piece of shit?

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.363
Would I cry if Power died?

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.658
Nah. I don't think so.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.243
Can't see myself
gettin' teary-eyed

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.621
over Hayakaptain either.

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:52.793
[DENJI]
What if Miss Makima died?

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:03.512
[DENJI]
That one might actually sting.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.680
Bet I'd be bummin' for a while.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:09.309
Like, it'd take three days
before I'd snap back to happy.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.894
But that's just it.

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:12.896
If I've got warm baths,
good sleep,

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:15.857
breakfast, lunch,
'n' dinner, I'm golden.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.484
[gasps]

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:22.113
[DENJI] Maybe when I
lost my human heart,

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.283
I also lost my human emotions.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.832
[DENJI] Eh, no point in
takin' it so seriously.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.291
Huh?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.001
This stuff's no fun,
so thinking 'bout it's

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.586
bound to be a buzzkill!

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.922
We're better off seein'
what Miss Makima wants.

00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:41.299
[POWER]
Such melancholy.

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:45.345
[knocking]

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:47.305
[TENDO]
Pardon the intrusion.

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:53.353
Hey there. Were you just crying?

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.397
Should we step out a moment?

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.941
Do I know you guys?

00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:00.735
No, not yet.
We're agents from Kyoto

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.780
here to coach your squad
at Makima's personal request.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:06.616
Nice apple there. Can I have it?

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.995
[AKI]
"Coach"?

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.550
[MAKIMA] Given the hotel
incident and this latest attack,

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:51.471
it's become evident the enemy
forces are targeting Denji.

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:53.431
My intention was to
strengthen Division Four

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:57.143
as a countermeasure,
then most of you died.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.854
Are you sayin' you're
gonna train us yourself?

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:03.191
Sadly, my plate's a bit too full
to add in training sessions.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.986
But that's why we're
in this cemetery.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:09.406
I'm introducing you to
someone ideal for the job.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.586
--This gentleman's name is--
--[KISHIBE] Shh.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.088
Shut it.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:29.426
[KISHIBE] All I wanna hear
are your answers.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.970
How'd you feel about
your comrades dying?

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:32.804
It's whatever.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.098
I thought, "Oh, they're
all dead now."

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.475
[KISHIBE]
Do either of you want revenge?

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.811
That ain't my scene.
Shit's super depressing.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.354
Verily.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:45.275
[KISHIBE] Humans or devils.
Which side are you on?

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:49.112
The side that's gonna
take the best care of me.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.655
The one that's winning.

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:03.501
[KISHIBE] Know what you
just got? Perfect scores.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.211
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:08.256
Types like you two are
few and far between.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:12.719
This is great. I love it.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.180
Scary.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.849
[KISHIBE] Go if you got
somewhere to be, Makima.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:21.603
I'm starting with them
right here and now.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.063
I'll leave you to it, then.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.773
You're leaving?

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:29.277
I'm a Public Safety Hunter
from Special Division One.

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.571
I get a real kick outta
being called "master,"

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.741
so that's how you're
gonna refer to me.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.368
Hobbies include
drinkin' booze, gettin' ladies,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.287
and makin' devils dead.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:40.330
Huh?

00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:42.248
Awkward.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:44.709
[cracking]

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:51.132
[DENJI, POWER groaning]

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.106
Holy shit.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.650
My legs fail me.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.446
Biologically, your skeletal
and muscle structures

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.323
are like any human's.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.701
A broken neck leaves
both of our kinds paralyzed.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.287
What sets you
devils apart, though...

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.206
I smell blood!

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.712
[KISHIBE] With a little blood,
you're right as rain again.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:37.929
[DENJI] Damn it. What the hell
was that, grandpa?

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:40.932
That was just me
training you kiddos up,

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.893
like Makima asked.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.687
Not sure why, but the Gun Devil

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:47.981
has its sights set
on your heart,

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:50.233
so the fact that you're
a scrub who consistently

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:53.361
gets his ass handed
to him is a problem.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:56.114
Crushing pupils
qualifies as training?

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:59.117
If said pupils were
normal humans, then no.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.495
Teachin' devils is a whole
new ballgame for me.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:05.999
Tried mulling over my strategy
while knocking back some drinks,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.834
and it hit me.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:12.046
Giant light bulb went off and
illuminated this boozy brain.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.716
See, I'm the best
Devil Hunter in the world.

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:17.135
Any devil that can take down
a powerhouse like me'd

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:19.470
be a powerhouse, too.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.849
So until you're strong enough
to make me beg for mercy,

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:26.186
it's open season
on both your asses.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.898
A plague afflicts
this fusty sir's mind!

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.357
Duh.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.695
[KISHIBE]
Where were we?

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:39.616
He's a drunk geezer, but they'll
arrest us if we kill 'im.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.867
[POWER]
Denji!

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.010
[DENJI gasps]

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:18.738
[POWER groans]

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.407
[KISHIBE]
The boy is straight-up immortal.

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:24.535
We can call the Fiend
semi-immortal, I guess.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.663
And neither of you showed
a single hint of hesitation

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:29.082
about bashing someone's head in.

00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:32.502
In short, you have
no human rights.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:34.879
Didn't know my own strength
when I was a tyke,

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.715
so I used to break
my toys a lot.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:41.803
Always wanted playthings
that could take a beating.

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:42.929
Just you wait.

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:44.514
By the time I'm
finished with you two,

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:47.684
you'll be a pair of
serious badasses.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:54.983
Kon.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.700
See? It won't answer you.

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:06.744
You had the Fox bite off more
than either of you could chew

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.454
and got so far on
its bad side that

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:11.082
I doubt it'll ever
help you again.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:14.294
And that sword of yours
is from the Curse Devil, right?

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.754
How many more times
can you use it?

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.508
So is this what you
meant by "coaching"?

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.719
Glad you're so quick
on the uptake.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.929
[TENDO] As you surmised,
we're consulting the humans

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.932
in the Special Division
about their careers.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.517
Rude as this may sound,

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.352
don't you think it's a good time
to hang up the suit

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:32.895
and call it quits?

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.772
Someone else from
Squad Four thought as much

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.317
and already went private.

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.402
If you're set on stayin'
in the game, though,

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.780
then you'll need to be
sufficiently prepared to play.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.157
Prepared?

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:46.492
Yep. Prepared.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.286
[TENDO] The only way
I see you sticking around

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.204
is if you contract
with stronger devils

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:53.624
so you can actually
contribute to your team.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:54.834
[KUROSE]
Will you resign and enjoy

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.794
what life you've
got left to live,

00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:00.381
or stay and learn the true
meaning of the word hell?

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:06.554
The devils that killed
my family and my partner

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.765
are still out there.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.602
How can I quit
knowing that they're alive?

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:18.274
[KUROSE]
Okay. I gotcha.

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.611
[KUROSE]
Since it's getting pretty late,

00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:22.945
let's call it a day.

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:25.865
We'll be back tomorrow with
the paperwork and whatnot.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:31.579
[KUROSE] Looks like what they
told us in Kyoto was spot on.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.416
They said, "Everybody who works
in the Special Division

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:39.587
is outta their minds,
so watch yourself."

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.381
Maybe try to take
a more objective look

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.091
at where you're standing.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.182
You have yet another visitor.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:53.434
Please, excuse us, miss.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.871
[gasps]

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:25.800
[KISHIBE] It's past my bedtime,
so I'm headin' home.

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:28.803
I'll pick you kids up
from your place tomorrow.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:50.867
[DENJI groaning]

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.915
[groans]

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.626
Has your feeble brain
broken again?

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:04.881
Heal! Heal! Heal!
Heal! Heal! Heal!

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.757
Heal!

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.013
[gasps]

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:19.061
Powy? How many times did I die?

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:21.606
At least 20 that I witnessed.

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.065
Whenever you were slain,

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:25.067
I was usually
unconscious, as well,

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:27.278
so there's really no telling.

00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:34.535
[POWER]
The old coot is too fearsome.

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:38.247
[DENJI] S'gonna suck all the fun
outta life if this keeps up.

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:41.125
I was workin' hard cuz
I wanted to enjoy living,

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:44.337
so dealin' with this is
a steaming pile of bullshit.

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:46.297
Then shall we flee together?

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:49.133
If we do, Public Safety's
gonna be hot on our tail,

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.218
and when they catch us,

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:53.012
we'll get the real devil
treatment this time.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.899
[DENJI]
That crusty, plastered bastard.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.067
Can't believe he's treating us

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:08.152
like we're just
a couple of his toys!

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.613
It's pissin' me off so bad,
you don't even know!

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.406
But I do know!

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:13.533
Know what?

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.993
[POWER] A scheme to defeat
the heinous tosspot!

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.079
He's a mighty foe, to be sure.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.541
However, the dram he consumes
rots away his intellect!

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:24.835
Hence, we should make use of
ours to overcome the lush. Yes?

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.837
Yeah, okay, I feel that.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.007
The timing of this actually
couldn't be more perfect.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.842
Lately I been thinkin'
about how sweet it'd be

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.387
to fight like a brainy
character in a manga!

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:37.765
We shall completely
trounce him in a war of wits!

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.267
[DENJI]
Damn. I'm feeling smarter

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:41.269
just from talkin'
about being smarter!

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.437
[POWER chuckles]
Et tu, Denji?

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:45.940
I have invented
100 stratagems already!

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.067
[DENJI] All I know is two heads
are better than one,

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.443
so puttin' ours
together has gotta

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.112
make it harder for us to lose.

00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:53.864
[POWER] Thus, the player
becomes the plaything!

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.499
[KISHIBE] They live in one of
these apartments, I think.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.459
This blood's scent is familiar.

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.295
The souse, he approacheth!

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:11.507
Gotta ante up his life if he's
willing to ruin ours, right?

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:18.889
Let the cerebral
warfare commence.

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:35.281
Nice blood weapon.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:38.451
Aimed straight at my head, too.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.411
So, it's an ambush, is it?

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:43.956
A role reversal of
the hunter and the hunted.

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:20.117
Ow.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.162
Most solid attempt at
getting me thus far.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:27.583
Just shows all manner of prey
will use its head when cornered.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.543
Keep at it, kid.

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:36.467
You guys botched this
attack for two reasons.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.135
Your arsenal, while impressive,

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:42.556
was made entirely of blood
weapons and left Power anemic.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.600
Whereas you weren't
the slightest bit prepared

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.143
for a counterattack.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.145
[DENJI groans]

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:51.232
[KISHIBE] But, all in all,
a good try, so let's call it.

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.734
S'five o'clock somewhere.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.783
Hey, Powy. He said
we're done for today.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.493
Lucky us.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:03.828
[chuckles]

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:14.880
Wh-Wha?

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:18.759
Beasts should
know better than to

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.512
trust anything a hunter
says to them.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.319
Brace yourself, 'cause I
bet this new contract's

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:38.738
gonna be pretty rough.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:42.533
Strong devils cut demanding
deals more often than not.

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.285
You're aware we aren't
making you do this

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:47.538
out of cruelty or as some
twisted joke, right, Aki?

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.582
The minute you're ready
to get back to work,

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:52.209
you'll be jumping
into a lion's den.

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.879
You'll need a weapon
to protect yourself.

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.433
[KUROSE] When Public Safety
captures a devil alive,

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.311
they lock 'em up down here.

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:12.688
Let's find you a fitting weapon.

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:23.240
So about that pretty girl
from the hospital.

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.784
You two an item, or what?

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:28.662
Prying into private
lives again? Give it a rest.

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:37.296
[AKI] She was my partner's
younger sister.

00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:40.424
That's rough.
Hike up your hospital bill?

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:44.762
[AKI]
No. She had letters to give me.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.430
What letters?

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:57.441
[HIMENO'S SISTER]
So, um, these are letters

00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:00.402
Sis sent me over
the past few years.

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:02.238
You should read them.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:04.365
I think so, at least.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.939
[gasps]

00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:59.503
[KUROSE] Let's hope
108's your lucky number,

00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:01.839
'cause this is the devil
we picked for you.

00:23:03.007 --> 00:23:05.467
And we chose the Future Devil.

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:09.555
Currently has contracts with
two Public Safety agents.

00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:11.557
One gave half their lifespan.

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.184
The other gave their senses
of taste and smell,

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.437
along with both their eyes.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.900
[KUROSE] Hopefully it likes you
and you'll get a bargain.

00:23:23.193 --> 00:23:25.613
[KUROSE]
Well, then. After you.
