00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:13.750 align:middle
[NINO]
You fell into a pond?

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:16.667 align:middle
No wonder you smell so awful.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle
By the way, you'd better
be using treatment, too,

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:20.958 align:middle
not just shampoo.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.583 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Fine.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:24.625 align:middle
Damn it, this is such a pain.

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:28.042 align:middle
It must be tough to
maintain all your hair.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.042 align:middle
Oh. Yeah, kind of.

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.458 align:middle
I do have to wash
mine every day.

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:35.042 align:middle
You probably couldn't
handle this much hair.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.750 align:middle
I wouldn't let it grow
enough to find out.

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:38.792 align:middle
[NINO]
Ugh.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:40.083 align:middle
I just imagined you
with long hair,

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle
and now I feel nauseous.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.833 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh? Hey, you don't know!

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:46.917 align:middle
You're underestimating
my potential!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.625 align:middle
Ugh.

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:49.917 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Wait.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle
Am I actually having a
conversation with Nino?

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:56.667 align:middle
Honestly, I don't really
care about my hairstyle.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle
Yeah, well, the rest of us
still have to look at it.

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I guess it's a little easier

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:03.292 align:middle
when it's one-on-one like this.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.167 align:middle
[NINO] You have your
relatives cut your hair?

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.708 align:middle
You could do the same thing.
Get Yotsuba to.

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:09.042 align:middle
Yeah, no thanks.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:12.292 align:middle
[FUTARO] Maybe I don't fully
understand Nino yet.

00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:16.333 align:middle
[NINO]
So, what happened?

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:19.625 align:middle
You know, at the pond.
Why'd you fall in?

00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:20.917 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh, it's nothing.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle
Yeah, right!

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.708 align:middle
That's the first time I've
seen you look so gloomy.

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I wasn't gloomy!

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:28.333 align:middle
[NINO]
Just tell me already.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:32.125 align:middle
I like being alone, but I get
bored with no one to talk to.

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:34.542 align:middle
[sighs]

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:39.167 align:middle
[FUTARO] Okay, fine.
I met a girl five years ago.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.583 align:middle
Hey, Futaro Uesugi.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.708 align:middle
[gasps]

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.708 align:middle
[GIRL]
It's been a while.

00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:30.333 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Are you... the girl from Kyoto?

00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle
Uh, hey there. You look
like you're doing well.

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:36.792 align:middle
[GIRL gasps]

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:38.125 align:middle
Where are you going?

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:40.417 align:middle
I can't meet you
again yet, okay?

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle
Why not?

00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:42.333 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:03:42.417 --> 00:03:43.500 align:middle
Fine, if you want this back,

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:45.833 align:middle
then you'll have to
talk to me first!

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:47.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
No fair!

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:48.792 align:middle
Let's see.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.167 align:middle
How to keep you from running?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle
Hey, look!

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:54.625 align:middle
That'll work!

00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle
Uh.

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:10.417 align:middle
[FUTARO]
So, I never got your name.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.708 align:middle
Call me Rena.

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:13.542 align:middle
Wow, five whole years.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:17.167 align:middle
Rena... Why are you here?

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.833 align:middle
So I could check out
the new you.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:22.167 align:middle
Let's catch up!

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle
I heard that you've been
studying hard since we met,

00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:26.042 align:middle
and now you're at the
top of your class!

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:29.042 align:middle
Plus, you got a job as a
tutor, isn't that right?

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle
That's great!

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:32.333 align:middle
[grunts]

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:33.667 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Who told you that?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.208 align:middle
Uh, don't worry about
all the details!

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:39.208 align:middle
What're your students like?

00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:41.708 align:middle
[FUTARO] Uh, well, this'll
probably sound crazy,

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle
but they're a set of quintuplets
who are in the same class as me.

00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:46.917 align:middle
[RENA]
Uh-huh!

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.583 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I thought you'd be shocked.

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:51.167 align:middle
Oh! Quintuplets, that's weird.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle
I thought those only
existed on TV!

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.458 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:04:55.542 --> 00:04:57.583 align:middle
[FUTARO]
There's one problem though.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:04:59.958 align:middle
They're all as dumb as rocks.

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:02.125 align:middle
The oldest dummy is an actress.

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:03.792 align:middle
She doesn't believe her
dream'll work out,

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:05.792 align:middle
but she's still got
the courage to try,

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:08.083 align:middle
which I guess is
pretty admirable.

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle
And stupid.

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:11.250 align:middle
Then there's dummy number two.

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:13.333 align:middle
She puts her sisters
above everything else,

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:16.375 align:middle
so she's always getting
wrapped up in arguments.

00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle
I thought that's all
there was to her,

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.917 align:middle
but now I'm not so sure.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle
Oh, and she's stupid.

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:23.542 align:middle
The third dummy's quiet.

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:25.583 align:middle
When I first met her,
she was so gloomy

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:27.833 align:middle
and had some self-esteem issues,

00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:29.792 align:middle
but lately, she's been
starting to liven up a bit,

00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:31.542 align:middle
so that's a relief.

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:34.167 align:middle
Still stupid, though.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.125 align:middle
One dummy's a meathead.

00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:38.417 align:middle
On the bright side,
she's cheery and dependable,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.208 align:middle
but she also gives me
the most headaches.

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:44.417 align:middle
Also-- Well, that part's
probably just in my head.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle
Anyway, she's stupid.

00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle
Last but not least,
the baby dummy.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle
We pretty much never get along.
However, she's a capable person.

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:55.792 align:middle
I'd hate to see her
abilities go to waste,

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:58.292 align:middle
but she's so stupid!

00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:00.708 align:middle
Okay, I think that
about covers it.

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:02.958 align:middle
Hm?

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:04.167 align:middle
What's up?

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.792 align:middle
Nothing. Everything's fine.

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:09.542 align:middle
I'm just a bit
surprised, I guess.

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:13.333 align:middle
You face your problems head-on
now, like an adult would.

00:06:13.417 --> 00:06:16.042 align:middle
You're the kind of
person people need.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:19.875 align:middle
That's interesting.
Itsuki said the same thing.

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.875 align:middle
[NINO] You should've never
barged into our lives!

00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:27.583 align:middle
[FUTARO] But, no. Actually,
I haven't changed at all.

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:30.542 align:middle
[RENA]
Oh. Well.

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:33.167 align:middle
If I'm bringing you down,
I should leave.

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:37.542 align:middle
[RENA] I'll give this
back like I promised.

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:39.042 align:middle
Thanks.

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle
But this... is coming with me.

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:45.333 align:middle
Huh? But why?

00:06:45.417 --> 00:06:48.333 align:middle
Because... I'm not going
to see you again.

00:06:48.417 --> 00:06:51.042 align:middle
You aren't? What do you mean?

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:53.542 align:middle
Hey, wait up! Don't go!

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:56.583 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:06:56.667 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle
[RENA] Don't open that until you
learn how to accept yourself.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hang on, we're not done!

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:04.625 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:10.083 align:middle
Bye for good.

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle
[FUTARO]
And that was it.

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle
She just kind of vanished.
Weird, huh?

00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:21.625 align:middle
Nino?

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:24.583 align:middle
What? Did my story
make you fall asleep?

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:25.917 align:middle
[grunts]

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:32.458 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Why are you crying?

00:07:32.542 --> 00:07:33.792 align:middle
[NINO]
'Cause!

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.083 align:middle
You've had feelings
for this girl

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:37.208 align:middle
for five whole years,
haven't you?

00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:39.583 align:middle
That's really sad.

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.792 align:middle
No. Not feelings.

00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle
I was just glad to have
had her in my life.

00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:45.833 align:middle
[NINO]
That's what feelings are!

00:07:45.917 --> 00:07:47.542 align:middle
Look, it's not like that.

00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:49.708 align:middle
Either way, you don't
have to pity me.

00:07:49.792 --> 00:07:51.958 align:middle
Well, anyway, thanks
for the sob story!

00:07:52.042 --> 00:07:53.292 align:middle
Just what I needed!

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:55.042 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Wow, rude.

00:07:55.125 --> 00:07:57.667 align:middle
Believe me. You'll be all right.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.542 align:middle
You may be an insensitive,
disgusting jerk,

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle
but I'm sure there's at least
one poor sap on Earth

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:04.875 align:middle
who could fall in love with you.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.417 align:middle
Hey! Why are you flashing
me, you pervert?

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.917 align:middle
It's not like we haven't
seen each other naked before.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.333 align:middle
Forget about that!

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh. What's this?

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle
You've worked on these?

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.333 align:middle
[NINO] You picked out
different problems

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:24.458 align:middle
for each of us, didn't you?

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:26.542 align:middle
I knew that,
somewhere deep down,

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:30.333 align:middle
I really do feel bad
about what happened.

00:08:30.417 --> 00:08:32.875 align:middle
Sorry.

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.792 align:middle
Don't worry about it.

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:36.375 align:middle
Go apologize to Itsuki.

00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:37.417 align:middle
Nope, never!

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.833 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Why not?

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:41.583 align:middle
What, are you still pissed off
about her slapping you?

00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle
I mean, yeah, she's never
done anything like that,

00:08:44.833 --> 00:08:49.042 align:middle
so it almost feels as if...
I don't know her anymore.

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.417 align:middle
Nino really apologized?

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.542 align:middle
I'm finding that
hard to believe.

00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:54.917 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Well, it's true.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.792 align:middle
You're just as obstinate
as she is, you know.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle
Oh, wow! Your hair's
so shiny today!

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:02.875 align:middle
What happened with you two?

00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:03.792 align:middle
Not important.

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:04.792 align:middle
I'm just saying,
maybe you should

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:06.792 align:middle
go to lunch with her again soon.

00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle
Once you clear the air,

00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:10.417 align:middle
you can get back to
being two peas in a pod!

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.417 align:middle
I wouldn't say that we
were "two peas in a pod."

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.458 align:middle
Like, when we went to
the movies recently.

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:18.333 align:middle
Yikes. That was scary!

00:09:18.417 --> 00:09:21.625 align:middle
I dunno, it got pretty boring
after they killed Ichika.

00:09:21.708 --> 00:09:25.375 align:middle
Oh, but that one trailer they
played? That looked interesting!

00:09:25.458 --> 00:09:26.875 align:middle
I thought so, too!

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.625 align:middle
-- <i>Origins of Life:</i>
-- <i>Love of Summer Vacation!</i>

00:09:28.708 --> 00:09:30.542 align:middle
<i>Unknown Mysteries!</i>

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:31.875 align:middle
[NINO]
Ew, that sounds awful.

00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.792 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Well, I thought it looked good.

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:35.125 align:middle
[NINO]
Then you have bad taste.

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:36.792 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
And you don't?

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:38.042 align:middle
See what I mean?

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:39.542 align:middle
Over the years,
our shared interests

00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:42.042 align:middle
have gotten fewer
and farther in between.

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:45.083 align:middle
Both of those movies sounded
pretty terrible to me though.

00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:46.292 align:middle
But that doesn't mean
you can't like--

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:48.333 align:middle
I have to get the trash ready!

00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:50.542 align:middle
Tomorrow is
non-combustibles, right?

00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle
I can take care of all
that in the morning.

00:09:52.583 --> 00:09:55.625 align:middle
Thank you so much, Itsuki!

00:09:55.708 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle
Uh-oh. Where did my watch go?

00:09:57.833 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle
I have it here, sir.

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:00.208 align:middle
Ah.

00:10:00.292 --> 00:10:03.042 align:middle
[RAIHA] Itsuki, where do
the rubber bands go?

00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:04.958 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
They count as combustible.

00:10:05.042 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle
[ISANARI] Man, you're
handy to have around!

00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:12.750 align:middle
You always acted so annoyed
when I would come to your house,

00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:15.833 align:middle
and now I think I'm beginning
to understand why.

00:10:15.917 --> 00:10:17.375 align:middle
[NINO]
Oh, yeah?

00:10:17.458 --> 00:10:20.208 align:middle
Hey, do you want me to get you
something from room service?

00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle
[FUTARO]
A drink would be nice.

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:26.042 align:middle
Okay. I'll just order you
whatever sounds good then.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle
Hold on, why are you still
hanging around in my suite?

00:10:29.083 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle
Is that a no on the drink?

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:31.958 align:middle
[NINO]
You've got some real nerve!

00:10:32.042 --> 00:10:34.417 align:middle
Make yourself at home,
why don't you?

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.125 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Forget about that.

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle
We have a bigger problem
to deal with.

00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:40.125 align:middle
A bigger problem?

00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:42.167 align:middle
Oh, do you mean
passing the finals?

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.792 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh. Right.

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:46.208 align:middle
Yeah, that's what
I came here for.

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:48.167 align:middle
I hit today's quota!

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.208 align:middle
You're so smart!

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:50.292 align:middle
[MIKU]
Genius.

00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:53.542 align:middle
[giggles] We're
almost finished, huh?

00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:56.833 align:middle
I wonder if Nino and Itsuki
have been working hard, too.

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.792 align:middle
At least we know where
they're staying now.

00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle
They'll probably be home soon.

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:03.167 align:middle
Ah! My phone!

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.917 align:middle
Maybe they're finally
coming back home!

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.875 align:middle
Sorry, guys, it's just the
captain of the track team.

00:11:12.417 --> 00:11:15.833 align:middle
What happened yesterday
came as a total surprise.

00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:21.042 align:middle
I have no idea why Rena decided
to show up now of all times.

00:11:21.125 --> 00:11:24.458 align:middle
But I did learn something
important from her.

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:27.208 align:middle
You can't stop people
from changing.

00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:30.667 align:middle
You have to forget the past
and accept what comes.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.417 align:middle
So make up with your
sisters and go home.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle
[NINO]
"Forget the past"?

00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:39.500 align:middle
That's a lot easier
said than done.

00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:44.167 align:middle
Anyway, it's my
room, so I'll talk.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.333 align:middle
When we were younger,

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:48.042 align:middle
we looked and acted
completely the same.

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:51.167 align:middle
I felt like all of our thoughts
and feelings were shared.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.583 align:middle
It was comfortable then.

00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:57.833 align:middle
But five years ago,
that changed.

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.583 align:middle
We slowly started
drifting apart.

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:03.542 align:middle
It was like they left
the quintuplet nest,

00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:05.958 align:middle
and me along with it.

00:12:06.042 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle
I was the only one who
wasn't able to move on.

00:12:09.083 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle
I can't even change my hair.

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:14.208 align:middle
That's why... I need to
leave the nest now.

00:12:14.292 --> 00:12:17.167 align:middle
Otherwise, I'll end
up all alone.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.833 align:middle
[FUTARO] This is what
I didn't get before.

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:21.875 align:middle
She acts that way
because of how much

00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958 align:middle
she cares about her sisters.

00:12:24.042 --> 00:12:25.458 align:middle
Your mind's made up?

00:12:25.542 --> 00:12:26.708 align:middle
Yes, it is.

00:12:26.792 --> 00:12:29.792 align:middle
I have to leave the past
behind and move forward.

00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:32.875 align:middle
Besides that,
there's still one thing

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.375 align:middle
that's been weighing on my mind.

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:37.167 align:middle
That trip.

00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle
[NINO]
Kintaro.

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:47.208 align:middle
Maybe it's because I never
got to tell him goodbye.

00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:48.792 align:middle
I feel like I could
get some closure

00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:51.375 align:middle
if I had one more
chance to see him,

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:53.542 align:middle
because he won't
get out of my head.

00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:56.583 align:middle
Um... Hm.

00:12:56.667 --> 00:12:59.375 align:middle
What if I said
you could see him?

00:12:59.458 --> 00:13:00.875 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:05.667 align:middle
[humming]

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.083 align:middle
[knocking]

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:08.708 align:middle
Coming!

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:11.083 align:middle
Uh, hey.

00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:13.875 align:middle
Hi. Come in, get comfortable!

00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.167 align:middle
Sure, thanks a lot.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.667 align:middle
[FUTARO] Okay,
I've got two options here.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.292 align:middle
A: Pretend to be
Kintaro for a while

00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:24.833 align:middle
and play along until she
eventually gets over him.

00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle
I'm over you!

00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:28.292 align:middle
[FUTARO]
B: Confess everything now

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:30.042 align:middle
and beg her to forgive me.

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.542 align:middle
It's fine!

00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:35.292 align:middle
[FUTARO] Option A's probably
best in the long run, but...

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:37.542 align:middle
[NINO]
So, Kintaro.

00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:39.875 align:middle
Do you have something
you wanna say to me?

00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle
[FUTARO]
This could get hairy.

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:45.708 align:middle
Of course.
It's kinda important.

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:48.042 align:middle
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have--

00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle
[NINO]
Don't worry.

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:51.625 align:middle
I forgive you for when you
stood me up at the campfire,

00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:53.583 align:middle
so there's no reason
to apologize.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:54.917 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.958 align:middle
Plus, I was a little
aggressive about asking you

00:13:57.042 --> 00:13:58.833 align:middle
to come in the first
place, wasn't I?

00:13:58.917 --> 00:14:00.292 align:middle
Wait. What I meant was--

00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:02.875 align:middle
Okay, good, I'm glad we
got that out of the way.

00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.375 align:middle
You can take this.

00:14:04.458 --> 00:14:06.917 align:middle
You promised to hang out with me
for the whole day, right?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.667 align:middle
And this time, you're not
allowed to break your word.

00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:18.625 align:middle
Actually, I--

00:14:18.708 --> 00:14:21.667 align:middle
[NINO] Sorry, hang on a second!
I'm concentrating.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.667 align:middle
[FUTARO] This probably isn't
a good time to come clean.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.583 align:middle
Fine.

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:29.583 align:middle
Let's speed things up.
What are we trying to make?

00:14:29.667 --> 00:14:30.708 align:middle
[gasps]

00:14:30.792 --> 00:14:32.958 align:middle
Excuse me. I need to
make a phone call.

00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:34.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle
[phone buzzing]

00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:41.917 align:middle
Uesugi, help me! Kintaro's
sweeter than I expected!

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.125 align:middle
He makes me so nervous,

00:14:43.208 --> 00:14:45.125 align:middle
I can't even stand to
look him in the eye!

00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:46.833 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Is that a problem?

00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:48.417 align:middle
Uh, I guess it isn't.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.167 align:middle
But hey, would you happen
to know whether or not

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.917 align:middle
he cares for cream puffs?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.833 align:middle
[FUTARO] Oh, yeah, he loves
cream puffs! I think.

00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:56.333 align:middle
Perfect!

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.458 align:middle
I was thinking of
making cream puffs.

00:15:00.542 --> 00:15:03.667 align:middle
Awesome. I love those.

00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:06.292 align:middle
Uh! No.

00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle
It's not like you to screw
up a baking project, Nino.

00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:10.708 align:middle
Did you--? Wait a minute.

00:15:10.792 --> 00:15:15.208 align:middle
Oops, I mean, uh-- Futaro told
me you're good at this stuff.

00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:17.417 align:middle
I didn't mean that.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.333 align:middle
Oh my gosh. Kintaro addressed
me by my first name!

00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:25.375 align:middle
[FUTARO] Quit calling me
for asinine reasons!

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:29.792 align:middle
Go on, have some.
I made plenty of them!

00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:32.083 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I can see that.

00:15:32.167 --> 00:15:34.292 align:middle
This sure is a lot of food.

00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:36.917 align:middle
Let's invite your sisters
over to help us eat it.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.542 align:middle
[gasps]

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:40.875 align:middle
[NINO]
Please don't say that.

00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.417 align:middle
You and I are finally alone now.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.458 align:middle
They would all just
be in the way.

00:15:45.542 --> 00:15:48.208 align:middle
Kintaro...

00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:52.542 align:middle
I only want you to
be here with me.

00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:54.375 align:middle
Uesugi would say that, too.

00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:56.583 align:middle
You guys are definitely cousins.

00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle
He must be mad that
I threw a wrench

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:00.083 align:middle
in his tutoring plans
by moving out.

00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:01.292 align:middle
[FUTARO]
It's not that.

00:16:01.375 --> 00:16:02.792 align:middle
Why wouldn't it be that?

00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:04.083 align:middle
All he talks about is those--

00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:06.083 align:middle
I don't care about the exams!

00:16:06.167 --> 00:16:09.333 align:middle
I just want you girls
to be together!

00:16:12.542 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle
I have to tell you something.
The truth is that Kintaro--

00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:18.833 align:middle
[NINO] Uh, wait, wait, wait,
hold on a second.

00:16:18.917 --> 00:16:20.542 align:middle
This sounds like
it might run long.

00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:22.542 align:middle
Let me use the restroom first.

00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle
Huh? Okay.

00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:30.958 align:middle
[phone buzzing]

00:16:31.042 --> 00:16:32.167 align:middle
What's up?

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.958 align:middle
[NINO] Are you close to
the hotel right now?

00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:36.833 align:middle
I guess you could say
I'm in the neighborhood.

00:16:36.917 --> 00:16:39.208 align:middle
[NINO]
Come to the first-floor café.

00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle
Where's the fire?

00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:45.875 align:middle
Why are you so sweaty?

00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958 align:middle
I hope iced coffee's okay.

00:16:48.042 --> 00:16:50.292 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Yeah.

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.375 align:middle
[NINO] I think Kintaro
might ask me out.

00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:53.375 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh...?

00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:54.792 align:middle
[NINO]
He looked at me all serious

00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:57.375 align:middle
and said he had to
tell me something!

00:16:57.458 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle
Hey! There he is now!

00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?!

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:02.833 align:middle
Wow. You fell for that?

00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:04.583 align:middle
Guess so.

00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle
Thanks for letting me
talk to him one more time.

00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.917 align:middle
Nino. What's with you?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.375 align:middle
[NINO] No matter what
happens between us,

00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle
I'm going to put an end to
the relationship we have now.

00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:21.667 align:middle
Really? I'm sorry that
I couldn't help you more.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.125 align:middle
Good luck.

00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:31.083 align:middle
I knew it.

00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle
I can explain! Hear me out!

00:17:33.583 --> 00:17:34.833 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:34.917 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle
I made it perfectly clear

00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:38.833 align:middle
that you shouldn't break
your word to me.

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:40.667 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.042 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Did you...?

00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:48.583 align:middle
[NINO] You thought that
disguise would work?

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:52.458 align:middle
It's not like you're twins
or anything. Bye now.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.417 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Nino! Open the door!

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.333 align:middle
I'm sorry, sir.

00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:02.292 align:middle
The customer who was
staying here checked out

00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:04.208 align:middle
a short while ago.

00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle
[FUTARO]
It's morning. Wake up, Itsuki.

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Aw... not yet.

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:23.375 align:middle
[FUTARO]
We're leaving early today.

00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Just five more minutes.

00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:26.667 align:middle
[FUTARO]
No, get up now.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.083 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Don't be such a jerk, Nino.

00:18:31.833 --> 00:18:35.708 align:middle
Oh. Gosh. Well, good
morning, I guess.

00:18:35.792 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle
Uh-huh. Good morning.

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Hm?

00:18:39.833 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle
[STUDENT B] Pretty sure
Nino took the day off.

00:18:42.583 --> 00:18:43.292 align:middle
What?

00:18:43.375 --> 00:18:44.833 align:middle
I thought so.

00:18:44.917 --> 00:18:47.375 align:middle
Maybe we should both go
over there and talk to her.

00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:48.792 align:middle
Hate to say it,

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:51.125 align:middle
but I don't think that'll
change much at this point.

00:18:51.208 --> 00:18:54.875 align:middle
It's too late. All we can
do now is believe in her.

00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:58.333 align:middle
You're acting weird today.
Did something bad happen?

00:18:58.417 --> 00:18:59.917 align:middle
Not exactly.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.333 align:middle
Come on, let's go find
the other problem child.

00:19:04.417 --> 00:19:06.542 align:middle
It's all because of you
and your amazing running

00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:08.542 align:middle
that we made it
into the marathon!

00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:09.833 align:middle
So we're all counting on you

00:19:09.917 --> 00:19:12.667 align:middle
to help us win this,
okay, Nakano?

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.333 align:middle
[FUTARO] You know it's bad when
you're counting on this dork.

00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:17.042 align:middle
Huh? Uesugi?

00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:17.917 align:middle
Sorry?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.542 align:middle
I guess you're the captain?

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:20.917 align:middle
You must be pretty serious

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.542 align:middle
if you're practicing right
before the final exams.

00:19:23.625 --> 00:19:25.917 align:middle
Yup! This meet is important!

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.083 align:middle
We don't have any time
to worry about tests.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.542 align:middle
What? What's wrong with you?

00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:32.458 align:middle
Don't worry, guys!
I can handle both!

00:19:32.542 --> 00:19:34.625 align:middle
Yotsuba, don't push too hard.

00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:36.208 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
I'm fine, I swear.

00:19:36.292 --> 00:19:40.667 align:middle
Well, I wouldn't wanna take you
away from your commitments...

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.583 align:middle
...so I'll just
have to join you!

00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:45.083 align:middle
That's not a problem, is it?

00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle
[EBA]
Five more laps!

00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:51.792 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I'm dying!

00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:54.708 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uesugi! You should stop.

00:19:54.792 --> 00:19:56.417 align:middle
Not yet!

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.083 align:middle
Which famous palace was built
by Louis XIV of France?

00:20:00.167 --> 00:20:02.083 align:middle
Oh, that's Berlin Palace!

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:03.875 align:middle
And who wrote <i>Run, Melos</i> ?

00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.667 align:middle
Ryunosuke Dazai!

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.167 align:middle
The fourth element on
the periodic table?

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.958 align:middle
Lithio. Hydro. Barium!

00:20:13.042 --> 00:20:15.917 align:middle
[FUTARO] All of those were
just barely off the mark!

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.875 align:middle
But she has learned more
than I expected she would.

00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.042 align:middle
Maybe she can do both.

00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:26.792 align:middle
You're way overdoing it.
Go take a breather, okay?

00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:29.042 align:middle
I promise, I'm good.

00:20:30.042 --> 00:20:32.375 align:middle
[EBA]
This weekend: Training camp!

00:20:32.458 --> 00:20:34.292 align:middle
Uh. Do we have to?

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:37.167 align:middle
But, Captain, I thought you said
we could take the weekend off.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.583 align:middle
Oh, yeah?

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:41.417 align:middle
Listen, first-year, if we
wanna two-peat this event,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.208 align:middle
then we gotta go hard!

00:20:43.292 --> 00:20:44.458 align:middle
[TRACK TEAM]
Right!

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:52.292 align:middle
[sighs]

00:20:52.375 --> 00:20:53.292 align:middle
Just hit send!

00:20:53.375 --> 00:20:54.708 align:middle
[YOTSUBA squeals]

00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:57.833 align:middle
Ichika! Don't sneak up on me.

00:20:57.917 --> 00:20:59.125 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I need to brush, too!

00:20:59.208 --> 00:21:00.583 align:middle
Let me gargle first.

00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:01.625 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Wait.

00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:02.625 align:middle
I knew it!

00:21:02.708 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle
You were holding your toothbrush

00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:06.917 align:middle
without actually brushing
again, weren't you?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.708 align:middle
Hand it here. I'll help you.

00:21:10.792 --> 00:21:12.625 align:middle
See, it's like old times!

00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:13.792 align:middle
I'm not a kid anymore!

00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:16.417 align:middle
Open up, Yotsuba!

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Ah! It's nasty.

00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:20.583 align:middle
That's 'cause it's
my toothpaste.

00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:22.792 align:middle
This is the stuff
that adults use.

00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:24.333 align:middle
I guess you're still
too young for it.

00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:26.750 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Nuh-uh! I'm a grown-up, too!

00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:28.292 align:middle
[ICHIKA chuckles]

00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:30.542 align:middle
[ICHIKA] You may have gotten
bigger, but you haven't changed.

00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle
Look, you've been working so
hard, you have canker sores!

00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:35.375 align:middle
Uh! Come on,
you don't need to--!

00:21:35.458 --> 00:21:37.667 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Aw, don't get fussy.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle
No matter how old we get,

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:41.417 align:middle
you're always gonna
be my little sister.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle
I really wish you would
depend on me more.

00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:50.917 align:middle
Is it bad if I wanna
quit the track team?

00:21:52.042 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
You can if you want.

00:21:53.833 --> 00:21:55.167 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.333 align:middle
No way, I can't do that.
It would cause people trouble!

00:21:57.417 --> 00:22:00.875 align:middle
Stop giving me bad advice if you
wanna act like the big sister.

00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:01.958 align:middle
You're still not, though.

00:22:02.042 --> 00:22:03.083 align:middle
[ICHIKA chuckles]

00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:04.458 align:middle
You don't get to pretend
you're grown-up

00:22:04.542 --> 00:22:05.625 align:middle
if you wear panties like these.

00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:07.625 align:middle
[YOTSUBA screams]

00:22:07.708 --> 00:22:09.042 align:middle
Stop teasing!

00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:11.542 align:middle
And never leave those out when
Uesugi's around! Got it?

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:13.292 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Fine.

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:17.417 align:middle
Right, did you get all that?

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.833 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Yep, everything.

00:22:18.917 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle
Perfect.

00:22:21.083 --> 00:22:25.208 align:middle
I'll be at the track meet
tomorrow. Are you going?

00:22:25.292 --> 00:22:29.833 align:middle
Yeah, absolutely!
We have to free Yotsuba.

00:22:34.625 --> 00:22:36.542 align:middle
Hey there, Nino.

00:22:36.625 --> 00:22:39.875 align:middle
I'm never gonna get
any privacy, am I?

00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:14.208 align:middle
[MIKU]
"Seven Goodbyes. Part Three."
