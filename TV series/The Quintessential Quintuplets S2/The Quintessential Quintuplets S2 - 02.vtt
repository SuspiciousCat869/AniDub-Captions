[FUTARO]
One more week until the final.

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:24.375 align:middle
Their average on the
first test was a 20.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:28.542 align:middle
And on the midterm,
they averaged a 26.

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:31.542 align:middle
Which means that at this rate...

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:34.333 align:middle
...if nothing goes wrong,
we can make it!

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:37.833 align:middle
Right, if nothing goes wrong!

00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:42.125 align:middle
Looks like he's late.
Saturday is our tutoring day.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.458 align:middle
Everybody's waiting for him,
what the heck is taking so long?

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:46.542 align:middle
Huh?

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.208 align:middle
Uesugi?!

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:51.583 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Dead!

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.875 align:middle
Never mind, he's asleep.

00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.875 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I did it again.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.208 align:middle
I always get so into my studying
the night just flies by.

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:04.458 align:middle
[ITSUKI] Well, we waited
for a long time,

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:07.292 align:middle
but then we had to
start without you.

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle
Um, sorry.

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:12.875 align:middle
But, anyway, I'm determined
to make you pass this time.

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:13.917 align:middle
Huh?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.708 align:middle
Which is why...
I've prepared this.

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:18.292 align:middle
[gasps]

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:20.583 align:middle
It's a problem set that
covers all the topics

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.167 align:middle
we can expect to come up.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle
If you guys do well on this, you
might have a fighting chance!

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:27.333 align:middle
I dunno, we've already
lost so much time.

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:28.667 align:middle
Let's just call it a day!

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.625 align:middle
No way! You're going to
do them, and that's that!

00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:33.125 align:middle
[grumbles]

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:35.542 align:middle
It's massive.

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.458 align:middle
Wait a second,
were you up all night

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle
because you were working
on all of this?

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.667 align:middle
Maybe, but what difference
does that make?

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.208 align:middle
I can't expect you five
to put in all the effort.

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:46.417 align:middle
I have to be an example as well.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.292 align:middle
An example, huh?

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.208 align:middle
Now, come on. Let's start
before someone flakes.

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:54.583 align:middle
Uh. Okay. I'm right behind you.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.125 align:middle
Uh...

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.083 align:middle
[NINO]
Let go of the remote, Miku!

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:32.333 align:middle
[MIKU]
No, you let go.

00:03:32.417 --> 00:03:34.542 align:middle
[NINO]
What? But I need it!

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:36.833 align:middle
My favorite actor is on
that variety show today

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.667 align:middle
and it's on right now!

00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:40.625 align:middle
Who cares?

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:42.417 align:middle
There's a documentary
I wanna watch

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.708 align:middle
and I can't miss this episode.

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.875 align:middle
No TV at study time.

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.833 align:middle
[BOTH]
Hey!

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:56.333 align:middle
Those two always argue.
Do they just hate each other?

00:03:56.417 --> 00:04:00.375 align:middle
Eh. It's more like
they're a cat and a dog.

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:01.708 align:middle
I mean, look at Nino.

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:03.208 align:middle
She's got a rough exterior,

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle
but she's actually the
most sensitive one,

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:07.583 align:middle
so she's always in a fight.

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:11.167 align:middle
'Kay! Let's get back to work!

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.542 align:middle
Are you ready, Futaro?

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:13.333 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:14.958 align:middle
We have seven days to go.

00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:17.792 align:middle
So we're all depending
on you, all right?

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle
Yeah. This time we'll crush it!

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:27.417 align:middle
[NINO]
Hey! You stole my eraser!

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.792 align:middle
I just borrowed it.

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.208 align:middle
Oh, yeah?

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:32.625 align:middle
Nino, that's my drink.

00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:34.625 align:middle
I'm borrowing it.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.708 align:middle
Ugh, gross.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle
[FUTARO] I'm glad everyone
showed up to study,

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.708 align:middle
but now we have a new problem.

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle
What am I gonna do?

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Hey! I think I have an idea!

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:53.875 align:middle
Operation Get-Along!

00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle
If you can find a way to put
these two in a good mood,

00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:57.333 align:middle
they should stop fighting!

00:04:57.417 --> 00:04:59.458 align:middle
Trust me, it's
totally foolproof!

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:00.792 align:middle
[laughing]

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.333 align:middle
Wow, you're amazing! Great work!

00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:04.375 align:middle
[NINO]
Hm?

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:05.542 align:middle
You're making progress.

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:08.542 align:middle
Both of you are,
so, uh, studious!

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:14.125 align:middle
What I mean is your work
is... uh, good! So...

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:14.958 align:middle
Yeah!

00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle
Man, was it that hard?!

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:19.167 align:middle
Futaro, what's wrong?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.083 align:middle
Yeah, you're creeping me out.

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:21.875 align:middle
[grunts]

00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.625 align:middle
He isn't creepy, Nino.

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.583 align:middle
I'm just saying what
we're all thinking.

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle
Take it back. You're
going way too far.

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:28.833 align:middle
Too far?

00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:31.875 align:middle
So you did think it was
a little bit creepy, huh?

00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.833 align:middle
[grumbles]

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.458 align:middle
[growls]

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:38.583 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Nope. What else you got?

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:40.208 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Maybe this'll work.

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:42.542 align:middle
Operation Third Force!

00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:44.542 align:middle
You need to be extremely
strict with them.

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:46.167 align:middle
And that way they get
a chance to bond

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.833 align:middle
over having a common enemy.

00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:50.792 align:middle
There's nothing like shared
hatred to bring people closer!

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:52.458 align:middle
[sighs]

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:53.792 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
What's wrong?

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle
I dunno. They're doing the
best they can, for once,

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle
so I wouldn't feel right
about punishing them.

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:01.917 align:middle
That might be the most human
thing I've ever heard you say.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Come on, is that all you slugs

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:06.333 align:middle
have managed to do so far?

00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:07.958 align:middle
Whatever, I shouldn't
have expected much

00:06:08.042 --> 00:06:10.792 align:middle
from a couple of halfwits like
you, so why am I so surprised?

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:12.375 align:middle
Oh, wait, no,
you're not halfwits,

00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle
it's more like you're sharing
a single brain cell!

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.542 align:middle
[ICHIKA] I kinda feel like
he's enjoying this.

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:19.167 align:middle
[NINO]
Don't bother barking at me.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.667 align:middle
I'm almost done. See?

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.917 align:middle
Uh. That part's not on the test.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.458 align:middle
Really? Oh, shoot!

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:31.833 align:middle
Nino, I wish you'd
take this seriously.

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:35.375 align:middle
Oh, yeah. Well, I would if
I could. But it's so boring!

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle
I'll go study in my room.

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:38.458 align:middle
Hey! Wait!

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle
[FUTARO growls]

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.667 align:middle
[FUTARO]
A whole copy gone to waste.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.083 align:middle
Try not to lose your
patience, okay?

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle
You're setting an example.

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:50.833 align:middle
We'll flunk without you.

00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:52.542 align:middle
Yeah.

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle
Hang on, Nino.

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle
Our day's just started.
Stick around for a bit.

00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:03.708 align:middle
Everyone's behind, so don't put
yourself even further behind.

00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:05.667 align:middle
Don't speak to me.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.792 align:middle
You don't know anything!

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:10.042 align:middle
I'm not taking this from you!

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:13.083 align:middle
You're just a tutor
that our father hired!

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:15.583 align:middle
An outsider!

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:16.792 align:middle
[MIKU]
Here.

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:20.625 align:middle
Futaro was nice enough
to make this for us.

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:22.792 align:middle
So please take it.

00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:24.875 align:middle
[NINO]
Why should I care

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.208 align:middle
if he made some
stupid worksheets?

00:07:27.292 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle
It's not like I need them!

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:31.417 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:39.292 align:middle
Whoa. Hey. Let's all
take a step back.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.708 align:middle
Yeah, guys. Just relax.

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:44.958 align:middle
[MIKU]
Nino, pick those up.

00:07:45.042 --> 00:07:46.292 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:49.208 align:middle
[NINO] Why are you so obsessed
with these papers?

00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:51.542 align:middle
He showed up late, too.

00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:53.083 align:middle
You're just a loser!

00:07:53.167 --> 00:07:56.833 align:middle
You think you're helping
us learn? Get a grip!

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle
Nino.

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:03.667 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh, don't worry about me!

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle
[slap]

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:14.708 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Nino.

00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle
Tell him you're sorry.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Do it. You owe him.

00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:28.000 align:middle
Come on. Since when are
you siding with this idiot?

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:31.375 align:middle
He's got you guys wrapped around
his little finger, Itsuki!

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:33.708 align:middle
And over what, a bunch of trash?

00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:36.708 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
No. It's not trash.

00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:39.667 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.958 align:middle
He doesn't have a printer
or a copier at his place.

00:08:43.042 --> 00:08:47.208 align:middle
He wrote this by hand.
All five copies.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.292 align:middle
[NINO]
Yeah, so what?

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:52.833 align:middle
So we should put in just
as much effort as he did.

00:08:52.917 --> 00:08:55.667 align:middle
Please, it's the least
we can do, Nino.

00:08:56.917 --> 00:08:58.917 align:middle
It's not like I--

00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle
Nino.

00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:07.292 align:middle
Just accept it, already.

00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle
[NINO]
I get it.

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:13.125 align:middle
All of you are gonna
choose him over me.

00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle
Okay, then I'm
going to move out!

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:19.792 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What are you talking about?

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:22.083 align:middle
[NINO] I've been planning
on it for a while now.

00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:23.667 align:middle
This place is getting
on my nerves!

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.917 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Nino!

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle
Stop and think about how
our mother would feel!

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:29.792 align:middle
Don't do this!

00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:31.167 align:middle
Our mom's gone, Itsuki,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.833 align:middle
so stop trying to be
a replacement for her!

00:09:34.917 --> 00:09:36.167 align:middle
Huh?

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.083 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Think about what you're doing!

00:09:38.167 --> 00:09:40.583 align:middle
[ICHIKA] She's right,
we can talk this out!

00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:43.083 align:middle
She was the one who
hit me first, remember?

00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:45.458 align:middle
You expect me to sit here
and take domestic abuse

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:47.542 align:middle
from this evil meat monster?

00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:51.167 align:middle
Meat monster? Really?

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.833 align:middle
Fine, if I'm so terrible,
then I'll move out, too!

00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle
[NINO]
Perfect! The door's that way.

00:09:56.083 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle
Crap, what do I do?

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:00.333 align:middle
[FUTARO] I didn't hear
anything else from them

00:10:00.417 --> 00:10:03.292 align:middle
until the next day
when Miku let me know

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:06.583 align:middle
that both of them
actually had left home.

00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:11.667 align:middle
So, does this happen a lot?

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.792 align:middle
We're sisters. It's not rare.

00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:20.042 align:middle
But this time it feels kinda
different, for some reason.

00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:22.958 align:middle
Ichika and Yotsuba tried to
talk some sense into them,

00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle
but it didn't work.

00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:27.417 align:middle
It's like they think whoever
comes home first is the loser.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.583 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Sounds about right.

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:32.417 align:middle
Are they out searching?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.833 align:middle
[MIKU] No, they said
they had stuff to do.

00:10:34.917 --> 00:10:37.292 align:middle
I think Ichika has
to go to work.

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:38.958 align:middle
[FUTARO] So it's up to
you and me to track down

00:10:39.042 --> 00:10:41.542 align:middle
the runaways, huh?

00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:43.667 align:middle
We can do this, Futaro.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:44.958 align:middle
Yeah!

00:10:45.042 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle
[BOTH panting]

00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle
I'm so tired already!

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:53.958 align:middle
[FUTARO] Well, you and I are
the weakest ones in the group.

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:56.333 align:middle
I've got this!

00:10:56.417 --> 00:10:59.042 align:middle
Have you seen a girl
with this face come by?

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle
[FUTARO] Sometimes being
identical comes in handy.

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:05.583 align:middle
Yes! I think I saw her
at the hotel I'm staying at.

00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:06.375 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.542 align:middle
It must be Nino!

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:13.500 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:11:13.583 --> 00:11:16.708 align:middle
Hey! Why are you here?
Who let you guys in?

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:18.833 align:middle
I told them I forgot
my keys in my room

00:11:18.917 --> 00:11:20.708 align:middle
and they opened it for me.

00:11:20.792 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle
So much for security!

00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:25.542 align:middle
Nino. About yesterday--

00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:29.583 align:middle
Go away! I've nothing left
to say to either of you two!

00:11:32.042 --> 00:11:34.125 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Agh! What's the matter with you?

00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:37.083 align:middle
You were the one who cared
the most about your sisters!

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:39.042 align:middle
About your home!

00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:43.708 align:middle
I told you, stop talking
like you understand us!

00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:46.333 align:middle
You don't get a say in this.

00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:49.042 align:middle
Especially because this
is all your fault!

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.167 align:middle
You should've never
barged into our lives!

00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:54.792 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.333 align:middle
[NINO]
Give that back! It's mine!

00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hey!

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:15.333 align:middle
Oh, Kintaro.

00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle
[FUTARO]
We know where Nino is.

00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:23.958 align:middle
But no luck with Itsuki.

00:12:24.042 --> 00:12:26.000 align:middle
There's not much more
we can do today.

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle
Might as well call it a night.

00:12:27.583 --> 00:12:30.542 align:middle
I'm sure she's fine.
Probably did the same thing.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.333 align:middle
[MIKU]
Actually, I doubt that.

00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:33.667 align:middle
Hm?

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.875 align:middle
[MIKU] She forgot her
purse back at our place.

00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.167 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Seriously?

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.792 align:middle
I'm home.

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:43.375 align:middle
Hey, welcome back, Big Brother!

00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:45.917 align:middle
Mmm. It smells good
in here. Curry, right?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.708 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Yup! We just started eating!

00:12:48.792 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle
--[stomach growls]
--I'm so hungry.

00:12:51.833 --> 00:12:54.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I bet she is, too.

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.833 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Raiha!

00:12:57.917 --> 00:13:00.333 align:middle
Do you mind if I get seconds?

00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:04.458 align:middle
Go for it!

00:13:04.542 --> 00:13:06.708 align:middle
Thanks for having me.

00:13:07.833 --> 00:13:10.708 align:middle
[water splashes]

00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle
I'm all clean.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:15.167 align:middle
I appreciate you letting
me take mine first.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.167 align:middle
[ISANARI] What do you think of
our nice, big bath, Itsuki?

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.417 align:middle
It's so tiny--

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.125 align:middle
I mean, it's very cozy
and relaxing, thank you!

00:13:23.208 --> 00:13:24.833 align:middle
[ISANARI laughs]

00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:26.042 align:middle
[ISANARI]
Isn't it?

00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:28.083 align:middle
All right, Raiha, you
ready for your bath?

00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:29.917 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Yeah!

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle
[ISANARI, RAIHA]
Bath time! Bath time! Bath time!

00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:36.458 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:36.542 --> 00:13:37.958 align:middle
--Listen!
--Itsuki!

00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:41.125 align:middle
Um, you first.

00:13:43.167 --> 00:13:45.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What is she doing here?

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:47.125 align:middle
This is an invasion of privacy!

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle
I kind of understand
how Nino feels.

00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:53.958 align:middle
[RAIHA] Big Brother, can you
bring out the bedding?

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle
Oh! I'll get it myself!

00:13:58.292 --> 00:14:00.625 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Is she seriously staying over?

00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:02.125 align:middle
Wait a second!

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle
I just remembered. Dad's gonna
be leaving for work soon!

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.792 align:middle
[RAIHA] I know! Let's
all sleep side by side!

00:14:10.875 --> 00:14:13.458 align:middle
[FUTARO]
We can't go on like this.

00:14:13.542 --> 00:14:14.958 align:middle
What do I say?

00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:17.083 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Uesugi, can you hear me?

00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:20.792 align:middle
Uh. Um, yeah. I'm still awake.

00:14:20.875 --> 00:14:25.833 align:middle
[ITSUKI] I'm sorry for dropping
in on you, and for yesterday.

00:14:25.917 --> 00:14:28.750 align:middle
I have something I need
to talk to you about.

00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:41.542 align:middle
Come on. We should take a walk.

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:43.292 align:middle
Wow, look at that!

00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle
The moon's especially
bright tonight, isn't it?

00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:48.958 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Eh, looks like a moon.

00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:51.583 align:middle
Sheesh. Have a little class.

00:14:51.667 --> 00:14:54.208 align:middle
I don't need to hear about
class from you, Itsuki.

00:14:54.292 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle
I saw you inhale that curry.

00:14:56.083 --> 00:15:01.375 align:middle
Ah! Hey, don't judge me!
I hadn't eaten in a whole day!

00:15:01.458 --> 00:15:03.125 align:middle
[FUTARO]
You should go home tomorrow.

00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:05.292 align:middle
Miku's worried sick.

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:07.292 align:middle
I can't this time.

00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:11.542 align:middle
I'm going to stand my ground
until Nino apologizes.

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:14.917 align:middle
Then again, I can't keep
burdening your family, either.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.917 align:middle
I'll be gone in the
morning, I promise.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.833 align:middle
Okay, you'll leave
and then go where?

00:15:19.917 --> 00:15:21.542 align:middle
You don't even have
your purse with you.

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:23.083 align:middle
[ITSUKI gasps]

00:15:23.167 --> 00:15:25.042 align:middle
You're right, please let me
stay with you a little longer!

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.375 align:middle
I'll help out however I can!

00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:29.125 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Forget it, just go home!

00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:31.417 align:middle
Besides, I don't think a
well-to-do princess like you

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.042 align:middle
could handle the way we live!

00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:37.292 align:middle
[ITSUKI] It's not like
I've always been rich.

00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:39.417 align:middle
Up until a few years ago,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.667 align:middle
our family's way of life was
pretty similar to yours.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.167 align:middle
Uh. Wait, for real?

00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:50.333 align:middle
[ITSUKI] Before our mom
married our stepfather,

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.958 align:middle
we were living in poverty.

00:15:53.042 --> 00:15:54.458 align:middle
How could we not?

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle
She was raising five little
girls completely on her own.

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:01.125 align:middle
[RENA] Nothing in the whole
world would make me happier

00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:02.917 align:middle
than for the five
of you to grow up

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.875 align:middle
healthy and taken care of.

00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:08.083 align:middle
[ITSUKI] She worked so hard
to provide for all of us.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle
Until one day,
when she fell terribly ill.

00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:14.958 align:middle
She inspired me to look after
my sisters in her place,

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:17.667 align:middle
and that's what I've
always tried to do.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.375 align:middle
But lately, it hasn't worked
out the way I planned.

00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:24.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I see.

00:16:24.292 --> 00:16:28.583 align:middle
She was stern with Nino because
she was acting like a parent.

00:16:28.667 --> 00:16:30.875 align:middle
[FUTARO]
So you're playing mom, huh?

00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.875 align:middle
All right, then I guess
I'll play the dad role.

00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.792 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:38.667 align:middle
What are you saying?

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.083 align:middle
Well, I mean, what the
hell has your stepfather

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.375 align:middle
been up to during
all this drama?

00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:46.375 align:middle
He should've been involved
in this from the beginning!

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.083 align:middle
I'll just think of it as
part of my tutoring job.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Back then, when I met that girl,

00:16:57.333 --> 00:17:01.708 align:middle
I decided I wanted to become
the kind of guy who was needed.

00:17:01.792 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle
That's my real
reason for studying.

00:17:07.083 --> 00:17:09.917 align:middle
Okay, but having
you as our father?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.167 align:middle
Shut up, don't be a brat!

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.792 align:middle
[ITSUKI] Anyway, the full moon
really is gorgeous tonight.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.958 align:middle
[FUTARO] Look, you still have
a ton of studying to do.

00:17:25.042 --> 00:17:27.125 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Don't bring that up now!

00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:29.792 align:middle
What happened?

00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:32.125 align:middle
I get the feeling
we're not alone here.

00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:35.083 align:middle
[ITSUKI] What?! Don't talk like
that, you're scaring me!

00:17:35.167 --> 00:17:36.792 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Itsuki, go see who's there!

00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:38.583 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
This isn't very fatherly of you!

00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:40.375 align:middle
[FUTARO]
That's irrelevant!

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle
Itsuki. You're being weird.

00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:49.417 align:middle
Stop it, you can't talk
to me out in public!

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.625 align:middle
What if someone sees us

00:17:50.708 --> 00:17:52.458 align:middle
and thinks we're walking
to school together?

00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:55.375 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Wow. You're the worst.

00:17:55.458 --> 00:17:58.208 align:middle
I don't mind you going straight
there from my place,

00:17:58.292 --> 00:17:59.833 align:middle
but what about your books?

00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:00.917 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Not a problem!

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle
I bumped into Yotsuba yesterday,

00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:04.708 align:middle
so I just asked her
to bring them to me!

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle
And you didn't think to ask
her to bring your purse?

00:18:08.083 --> 00:18:10.458 align:middle
Well, I did think about
that after the fact,

00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:12.958 align:middle
but I got the feeling
she was too busy.

00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:15.792 align:middle
Oh, yeah, she wasn't at
the house yesterday, either.

00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:17.292 align:middle
I wonder what's up.

00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:19.208 align:middle
Uh. Wait, you don't know?

00:18:19.292 --> 00:18:20.417 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:23.375 --> 00:18:26.083 align:middle
What do you mean you agreed
to help out the track team?!

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:27.958 align:middle
It's crunch time, remember?!

00:18:28.042 --> 00:18:29.917 align:middle
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.083 align:middle
I turned them down the
first time they asked me,

00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:34.042 align:middle
but then they said they wouldn't
make it to the marathon

00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:35.417 align:middle
if I didn't step in.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Helpful to a fault, as always.

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:39.583 align:middle
Go tell them you quit.

00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle
You might as well nip this
in the bud now, right?

00:18:42.083 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle
I'm sorry for
keeping it a secret.

00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:46.333 align:middle
But, I swear, I've been working

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:48.375 align:middle
on your problem set
in my free time!

00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:49.458 align:middle
[EBA]
Hey, Nakano!

00:18:49.542 --> 00:18:51.375 align:middle
We're getting back
to practice now!

00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:52.583 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Cool!

00:18:52.667 --> 00:18:55.042 align:middle
I promise I'll give it
my best shot, 'kay?

00:18:55.125 --> 00:18:58.625 align:middle
Wait, I'm not done talkin'
to you! Don't run away!

00:18:58.708 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle
[panting]

00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:03.542 align:middle
[FUTARO]
She's gone.

00:19:07.167 --> 00:19:08.208 align:middle
Huh?

00:19:08.292 --> 00:19:10.917 align:middle
Nino! Thank goodness
I found you!

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.708 align:middle
Listen, I'm not mad
about what happened.

00:19:12.792 --> 00:19:15.042 align:middle
Just go home, all right?

00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:17.417 align:middle
You can patch things up
with your sisters.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.667 align:middle
It'll be like old times!

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.833 align:middle
Okay, fine. I'll go home.

00:19:21.917 --> 00:19:26.083 align:middle
I'm so glad!
Dammit, not the hotel!

00:19:26.167 --> 00:19:27.958 align:middle
Nino!

00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:30.458 align:middle
What are you gonna
do about your exams?

00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:31.833 align:middle
[GUARD A]
Calm down, sir.

00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:33.208 align:middle
[GUARD B] If you're not
a guest, you need to leave!

00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:35.625 align:middle
You'll pass them if you
just let me help you!

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:38.083 align:middle
Call these guys off!

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:40.667 align:middle
[NINO] Who cares whether
I pass the exams?

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.875 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh?

00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle
I certainly don't.

00:19:47.917 --> 00:19:50.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I'm not giving up.

00:19:52.542 --> 00:19:56.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I'm not giving up!

00:19:56.292 --> 00:19:59.042 align:middle
Nino! Come on, talk to me!

00:19:59.125 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle
I'll be back!

00:20:00.583 --> 00:20:03.167 align:middle
I'm not giving up on you!

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.833 align:middle
[sighs]

00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle
Four days till the exams.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:12.625 align:middle
What can I do to make all of
the girls get along again?

00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:14.583 align:middle
If I was drowning,

00:20:14.667 --> 00:20:18.833 align:middle
would they panic and start
cooperating to try and save me?

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:22.208 align:middle
Yikes. That's a dangerous
thought to have.

00:20:22.292 --> 00:20:25.042 align:middle
But hey, it does
beg the question.

00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:30.833 align:middle
Yeah, no. Awful idea.
That would turn out terribly.

00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:34.125 align:middle
Maybe I made a mistake here.

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:37.125 align:middle
I got the wrong idea because
they had started to trust me

00:20:37.208 --> 00:20:39.708 align:middle
and depend on me.

00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:42.042 align:middle
But that didn't necessarily
mean it was my place

00:20:42.125 --> 00:20:45.958 align:middle
to concern myself with
another family's problems.

00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:48.250 align:middle
No. In fact...

00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:51.583 align:middle
You should've never
barged into our lives!

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.792 align:middle
[FUTARO]
She's right.

00:20:53.875 --> 00:20:56.375 align:middle
This was doomed from the start.

00:20:56.458 --> 00:21:01.583 align:middle
All I've been doing is studying.
How does that help them?

00:21:01.667 --> 00:21:05.375 align:middle
Those girls don't
need me one bit.

00:21:10.042 --> 00:21:12.333 align:middle
Moping again, huh?

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.042 align:middle
You haven't changed
at all, have you?

00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:20.125 align:middle
Hey, Futaro Uesugi.

00:21:20.208 --> 00:21:22.417 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:26.292 --> 00:21:28.125 align:middle
[GIRL]
It's been a while.

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:33.667 align:middle
[splash]

00:21:38.833 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle
Ah!

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:44.208 align:middle
Whoa, Uesugi. What the
heck are you doing here?

00:21:44.292 --> 00:21:45.583 align:middle
Yotsuba.

00:21:45.667 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle
Um, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:51.333 align:middle
I'm sort of in the middle
of laps right now.

00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:55.083 align:middle
Please make sure Nino and
Itsuki are safe, though, okay?

00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle
Nino. Right.

00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:06.833 align:middle
[NINO] I can't believe
that creep is here again!

00:22:06.917 --> 00:22:09.500 align:middle
That's it. I'm about
to give him an earful!

00:22:09.583 --> 00:22:11.667 align:middle
No matter how many times
I turn him away,

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.417 align:middle
he just keeps coming back!

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.458 align:middle
What is it going to take?

00:22:16.542 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle
He's relentless.

00:22:24.292 --> 00:22:25.667 align:middle
[gasps]

00:22:29.083 --> 00:22:30.833 align:middle
[NINO] If you walk around
looking like that,

00:22:30.917 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle
the other guests will
think you're an eyesore.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle
[NINO]
You're a mess.

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:39.625 align:middle
Come up to my room.

00:24:11.208 --> 00:24:14.333 align:middle
