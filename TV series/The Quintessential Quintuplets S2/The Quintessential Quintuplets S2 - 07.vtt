00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.099 align:middle
[NINO]
Don't think about it.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.481 align:middle
[NINO]
Forget him!

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:28.987 align:middle
He doesn't think of me that way.
It's just how it is.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.991 align:middle
That's why I'm not going
to see him anymore.

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.827 align:middle
I see you're back, daughter.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.328 align:middle
Yeah, I am.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.955 align:middle
And I thought I told you to
stop calling me "daughter,"

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.749 align:middle
it totally creeps me out.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.584 align:middle
I'm sorry, Nino.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:46.463 align:middle
I just received word that all
five of you passed your exams.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.674 align:middle
It appears you succeeded,
in spite of everything.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:50.633 align:middle
Well done.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.552 align:middle
Um. Thanks a lot?

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.847 align:middle
And so, per the agreement
that I made with Uesugi,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.599 align:middle
I will allow him to return.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.642 align:middle
[NINO]
No, I'm done with him!

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.855 align:middle
Besides, we've decided to stay
at our new place for a while.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:05.023 align:middle
[MARUO]
Excuse me?

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.817 align:middle
I mean, we won't just
depend on Ichika.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.778 align:middle
I can get a job, too!

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.529 align:middle
We're still learning
to stand on our own,

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:14.699 align:middle
and maybe this isn't
the smartest move,

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.659 align:middle
but I think living this way

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.454 align:middle
is going to change
us for the better.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.624 align:middle
And I feel like we've already
made some good progress!

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:25.251 align:middle
Huh. You sound absurd.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:29.673 align:middle
Abstract ideas like "progress"
mean nothing in the real world.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:33.677 align:middle
And besides, I've seen that
hovel you call your new home.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.513 align:middle
I'd say you've taken
a step backwards.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:39.724 align:middle
Five years isn't
long enough to forget.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:45.563 align:middle
You don't wanna live that way.
Now, stop being selfish--

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.609 align:middle
[NINO]
What?

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.405 align:middle
[gasps]

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.951 align:middle
Nino. Hey. Time to go.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:01:59.411 align:middle
[NINO]
Huh?!

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.204 align:middle
Wait, what's going on here?

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.539 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Can't talk!

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.709 align:middle
I'll be late for my shift.
Just hop on the back.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle
[MARUO] Nino, you're headed
down a dangerous path.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.757 align:middle
It will not end well.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.927 align:middle
You will certainly regret
this in the future.

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.887 align:middle
Now, come with me.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle
[NINO]
Just wait.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.144 align:middle
We'll prove that you're wrong.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:26.771 align:middle
I'm ready.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:31.276 align:middle
Okay. Uh, goodnight, sir.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.404 align:middle
Don't mind me. Just taking
your little girl away.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:36.948 align:middle
[MARUO]
Ebata,

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle
all of my daughters have
passed their exams.

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.661 align:middle
I should be pleased
by that, yes?

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.621 align:middle
I'm smiling, am I not?

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.915 align:middle
Of course you are, sir.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:51.338 align:middle
Indeed. I'm their
father... after all.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.258 align:middle
[NINO] I thought I told you
I was done with you.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle
This might surprise you,

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.095 align:middle
but relationships involve
more than one person,

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle
and I say that this
isn't over yet.

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:04.017 align:middle
Are you crazy? And where'd
the bike come from?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.145 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I borrowed it from my boss.

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.939 align:middle
I told you that I used to do
deliveries, remember?

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.984 align:middle
That's when I got my license.

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:17.489 align:middle
[NINO] Well, you look kinda
tacky riding this thing.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.491 align:middle
Your exam results?

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.326 align:middle
Hey! That's private! Back off!

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.827 align:middle
Oh, who cares?

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.622 align:middle
I'm sure you got a hundred
points in every subject, anyway.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.415 align:middle
[gasps]

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.501 align:middle
[NINO]
What?

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.712 align:middle
[FUTARO] It's the biggest
embarrassment of my life.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle
Is this our fault?

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle
Of course not.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:39.511 align:middle
I'm about to floor it,
okay? So hold on tight.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.724 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Now that exams are done,

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:48.353 align:middle
my extended tutoring
assignment is completed.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.356 align:middle
She's right, they don't need me.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.776 align:middle
So our relationship's over, too.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.736 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I'm gonna miss it.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.949 align:middle
[NINO] Hey, what happened
to flooring it?

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.659 align:middle
You're going way too slow!

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.035 align:middle
What did you expect?

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.037 align:middle
A bike can only carry
so much weight.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:09.165 align:middle
[NINO] Excuse me?!
Did you just call me heavy?

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.002 align:middle
You're the worst. You know that?

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.254 align:middle
And you've been like this
from the beginning, too.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.132 align:middle
You're the biggest
jerk I've ever met.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.759 align:middle
And yet, somehow...

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.847 align:middle
...I love you.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.113 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uesugi!

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.323 align:middle
I'm so happy that
you found Nino!

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.908 align:middle
Come have a seat!

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.326 align:middle
[FUTARO]
'Kay.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.538 align:middle
[NINO]
I said it. I said it!

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.624 align:middle
How could I let myself
fall for this loser?

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.668 align:middle
That was my first confession.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle
Ugh, what the heck's
gotten into me?

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:23.425 align:middle
And the biggest question is...
why isn't he reacting at all?

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle
[GIRLS]
Cheers!

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Congrats on a job well done!

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:30.598 align:middle
[MIKU] To be honest, I still
can't believe we pulled it off.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.976 align:middle
I'm so proud,
I wanna frame our test papers

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.728 align:middle
and hang 'em up on the wall!

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:35.770 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Why don't we do that

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:38.023 align:middle
when our grades
get a little better?

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.232 align:middle
[NINO]
I know we're celebrating,

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.735 align:middle
but can we really
afford all this cake?

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.778 align:middle
The owner knows
how hard we worked,

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.947 align:middle
and so he's treating
us for today!

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.323 align:middle
Rate us five stars!

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.867 align:middle
Hey, I just realized.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.243 align:middle
When you look at
our dessert orders,

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle
they're really all over
the place, aren't they?

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.956 align:middle
I guess that's
pretty typical for us.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.082 align:middle
[MIKU]
Here, Yotsuba.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.084 align:middle
Huh? What's this for?

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:01.212 align:middle
The lit questions.
You predicted them perfectly.

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:02.672 align:middle
She totally did!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.382 align:middle
Yeah, that was a big help.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:05.508 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Have some of mine!

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:06.343 align:middle
[NINO]
Mine, too.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:06.885 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
And mine!

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.637 align:middle
Uh! Well, okay!

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle
[ALL chuckling]

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.352 align:middle
[giggles] So yummy!

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.436 align:middle
[YOTSUBA gasps]

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.771 align:middle
But you guys all
helped me out, too,

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.647 align:middle
so I'd better return the favor!

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.649 align:middle
True, it was a team effort.

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.027 align:middle
[ITSUKI] Then let's all share
a little of everything!

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.403 align:middle
That's what got us
through our exams

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.739 align:middle
in the first place, right?

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:31.076 align:middle
That way, we get to sample
every last flavor!

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.994 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
You just want extra cake.

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:35.705 align:middle
[MIKU]
Here, Ichika.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.917 align:middle
Thank you, and congrats.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.212 align:middle
I never thought that you
would get the highest grade.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle
[ICHIKA chuckles]

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.674 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Aw, I just got lucky.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.761 align:middle
I'll win next time.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.304 align:middle
Yeah.

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:55.058 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER]
I'm gonna take a little break.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.518 align:middle
Hold down the fort.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.061 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Oh, hey, boss.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle
Do you mind if I set
aside some pudding?

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.357 align:middle
Since when do you like pudding?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.442 align:middle
[FUTARO]
It's repayment for a Valentine.

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:05.985 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.863 align:middle
And all this time,
I thought you were one of us.

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:10.532 align:middle
You traitor.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:12.033 align:middle
It was from my sister.

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle
Love you, Big Bro!

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.328 align:middle
Oh, so that's all it is.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:19.124 align:middle
I thought it might've been
one of those quintuplet girls.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.585 align:middle
Like that would happen.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.963 align:middle
[FUTARO] Well, I have
been getting chocolates

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.882 align:middle
all the time since January.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.051 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Nah, that's silly.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.302 align:middle
[NINO]
You working hard?

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:32.095 align:middle
Huh?

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.430 align:middle
Hey, where'd the boss go?

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.015 align:middle
He's in the back.

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:38.727 align:middle
Oh, okay. I was gonna thank
him for the desserts.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.271 align:middle
I guess I can wait around a bit.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle
[ICHIKA sighs]

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.651 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I hope no one could tell.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:51.823 align:middle
I really was rooting
for Miku. I think.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle
Except for one moment.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:57.370 align:middle
Miku said she'd confess
if she scored the highest,

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.873 align:middle
but then I did better than her.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:04.961 align:middle
Does that mean... that I can?

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:09.132 align:middle
[FUTARO] Thanks for helping me
finish up the dishes, Nino.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.468 align:middle
[NINO]
Sure, it's the least I can do.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.596 align:middle
You can go. I'll thank
the boss for you.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:15.555 align:middle
Have some fun.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.473 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.184 align:middle
Oh. Okay, then.
Thanks, I guess.

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:24.356 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:28.026 align:middle
[NINO] I want you to forget
what I said on the bike.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.736 align:middle
I'm sure it was a burden
for you to hear

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.321 align:middle
something like that
out of nowhere

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle
and I was probably
moving too fast.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.409 align:middle
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.994 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Nino.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.289 align:middle
What did you say?

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:42.415 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.584 align:middle
I'm not sure what
you're referring to.

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle
Could you repeat it?

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.588 align:middle
It was so windy,
I must've missed it.

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:50.674 align:middle
Ah! How dare you!

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:51.591 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What did I do?

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.968 align:middle
[NINO]
Never mind!

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.346 align:middle
[NINO]
He didn't hear me say it.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.514 align:middle
Whatever, it's not like he sees

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.225 align:middle
any of us as
girlfriend material.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:04.396 align:middle
Miku's Valentine chocolates
went right over his head.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.982 align:middle
You know what?
I'm glad he didn't hear!

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.443 align:middle
I wonder what
she's so upset about.

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:13.697 align:middle
Oh. Hey, boss.
I'm done cleaning u-- Oh.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.324 align:middle
What I said was "I love you."

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.745 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh...? Wait, what--?

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:24.582 align:middle
I don't need a response from
you. You're such a pain!

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:29.421 align:middle
I'm a girl. And I'll make
you see me as one.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:30.839 align:middle
Remember how I said
there had to be

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle
at least one person
on this planet

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.926 align:middle
who's stupid enough
to fall for you?

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.803 align:middle
Well, turns out it's me!

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.097 align:middle
Sucks to be you, huh?

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.896 align:middle
[MIKU]
Um, Futaro.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.316 align:middle
Oh. Hey, Miku.
Doing some shopping?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.694 align:middle
Yeah, it's my turn today.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.155 align:middle
[FUTARO] This isn't the closest
shop to your place, is it?

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:56.197 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.907 align:middle
Well, I did remember
that this store

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.242 align:middle
is the most convenient
place for you

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.411 align:middle
to pick up your groceries,
but that's no big deal!

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.121 align:middle
It's only a coincidence
that I'm here.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:06.249 align:middle
I didn't purposely take a
detour to see you or anything!

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.585 align:middle
[FUTARO] This is the
most she's ever talked.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.378 align:middle
[MIKU]
Um.

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:12.881 align:middle
Right. I'm here to do this.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:15.967 align:middle
[FUTARO] Huh? I've never
noticed that sign.

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle
[MIKU] Yeah. This is the
only store that does it.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.847 align:middle
Oh, that hot spring
is pretty close

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.058 align:middle
to where our grandfather lives.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.059 align:middle
[FUTARO]
But you can't trade

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:25.518 align:middle
the hot spring
vouchers for money,

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:28.396 align:middle
so the gift coupons
are the best prize.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.108 align:middle
Wait. What could
you sell Prize B for?

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.652 align:middle
I feel like there'd be
no winning for you.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.655 align:middle
[FUTARO] Well, we might
as well try! Let's go pay.

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:40.742 align:middle
[MIKU] Not yet. Nino wanted
me to get something.

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh. Oh, right.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.872 align:middle
Has she said anything?

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:46.998 align:middle
What do you mean?

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.626 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh, nothing! Just forget it!

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.003 align:middle
By the way, Miku...

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:55.924 align:middle
Do you have a crush?

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.467 align:middle
Huh?!

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle
Of course not.
I've told you before!

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:01.513 align:middle
So, there's no one in your class

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.682 align:middle
you've developed
feelings for since then.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.809 align:middle
Let's talk dating!
Come on, spill!

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle
What are you doing?
This is weird!

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.563 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh, the thing is,

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle
a friend of mine had a girl
confess to him recently.

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:15.527 align:middle
[MIKU]
Yeah?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.822 align:middle
[FUTARO] She said she doesn't
need an answer, but...

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.491 align:middle
...it's still kind of troubling.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.827 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What's so funny?

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:28.707 align:middle
[MIKU] It's strange to hear you
talk about stuff like that.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.083 align:middle
It's like you're a normal guy.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.627 align:middle
I'm just concerned
about my friend.

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:33.878 align:middle
Yeah, but you seem
like the type

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.755 align:middle
who would brush off
that sort of thing,

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.799 align:middle
so I'm happy.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.594 align:middle
My friend is having
some trouble, too.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:46.016 align:middle
She tried to confess to a guy,
but she didn't have the guts to.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.768 align:middle
I think, once you do that,

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:51.354 align:middle
you can't go back to
the way things were.

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:54.858 align:middle
Confessions take
lots of courage.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.069 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I get that. But--

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:01.322 align:middle
[MIKU] I guess some people
are just braver than I am.

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:04.576 align:middle
[FUTARO] I don't know how
to talk to her anymore.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:07.746 align:middle
[MIKU]
Why am I so cowardly?

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.998 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Either way, it's spring break.

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.751 align:middle
There's plenty of time
to think it over.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.255 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Spring break. Yeah.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle
[BOTH]
Woo-hoo!

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:25.597 align:middle
This'll be great!

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.184 align:middle
I'm so glad Futaro won!
Thank you, Big Bro!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.644 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I still can't believe I got it.

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.772 align:middle
[RAIHA] Hey, what's
this thing over here?

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:37.317 align:middle
[ISANARI] The area's top tourist
attraction: The Bell of Vows.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.277 align:middle
The brochure says,
"Any man and woman

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.946 align:middle
who ring it together will
be eternally bonded."

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle
Wow.

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:43.323 align:middle
[RAIHA gasps]

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:45.533 align:middle
Big Bro! Take a picture!

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:46.743 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Sure.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.996 align:middle
Uh. Actually, I forgot
to charge my phone.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.122 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Boo!

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:53.541 align:middle
[ISANARI]
Oh, well. Let's keep moving.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.294 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Time to have some fun!

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.545 align:middle
[FUTARO]
She's right.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.381 align:middle
I need to enjoy this
family vacation

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:02.342 align:middle
and forget all about
the quintuplets!

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.426 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Yeah!

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.722 align:middle
[BOTH]
Woo-hoo!

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:11.434 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.478 align:middle
Wha--? Uesugi? What the heck?

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:14.479 align:middle
That's my line!

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:17.232 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Slow down, Itsuki. Uh.

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:19.734 align:middle
Hey, I didn't expect
to see you here!

00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:22.112 align:middle
But why?

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle
So you won the raffle, too?

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.866 align:middle
Your family vacation
is at the same place?

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.118 align:middle
There's no way!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.328 align:middle
[MARUO]
Yes, it's a <i>family</i> vacation.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:33.373 align:middle
And I'd advise you
to be careful.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:36.042 align:middle
Things can always go
wrong when you travel.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:37.836 align:middle
[FUTARO grunting]

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle
[MARUO] Now then, I suppose
we'll have some lunch.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.008 align:middle
Let's begin the preparations.

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle
[FUTARO]
That's odd.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.845 align:middle
When did they work things
out with their dad?

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:47.971 align:middle
Something the matter?

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.556 align:middle
Uh, Nino!

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle
[NINO]
What's up?

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:53.184 align:middle
If you have something
to say, then spit it out.

00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:54.561 align:middle
Futaro.

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:55.854 align:middle
[gasps]

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:57.063 align:middle
[MIKU]
Wait a second.

00:14:57.147 --> 00:14:59.149 align:middle
You just called him
by his first name.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.734 align:middle
Why did you do that?

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:04.237 align:middle
Well, we've known each other for
six whole months at this point.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.115 align:middle
It's about time that we got
closer, don't you think?

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle
[MIKU] I mean, you do bring
up a good point, but...

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.788 align:middle
Ooh! Better yet, we
should use nicknames!

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:15.457 align:middle
Miku! Come up with something!

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.624 align:middle
A nickname?

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:21.504 align:middle
Ue? No. Su. Taro. No.

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:23.798 align:middle
Fu, then! No, not that.

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:25.925 align:middle
Yeah! That's good!

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:28.386 align:middle
[MIKU] Forget it,
let's get ready for lunch.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.888 align:middle
[NINO]
All right, whatever.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:31.222 align:middle
Wait, don't leave!

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.224 align:middle
[YOTSUBA grumbling]

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:34.434 align:middle
Uh, hey.

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:37.854 align:middle
I'm getting so nervous.
What if I can't do it?

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.023 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh...?

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.609 align:middle
Ichika. Can I talk
to you real quick?

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:47.614 align:middle
Heh. Sorry, I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.199 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What gives?

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:52.744 align:middle
We haven't been apart that long,
why are they all being distant?

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.205 align:middle
Oh. Hey--

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:58.124 align:middle
Itsuki, dear, why
are you dawdling?

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.835 align:middle
Go and get our lunch
boxes from Ebata.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:01.836 align:middle
Right.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.005 align:middle
Um, sir. The bike thing--

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.424 align:middle
Now, it's time for our meal.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:09.928 align:middle
I'm glad we'll all
finally be together.

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:13.181 align:middle
I'd like to be alone
with my family, please.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.101 align:middle
[MIKU]
See you, Futaro.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.228 align:middle
I bet we're staying
at the same place.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:22.315 align:middle
Uesugi. We should talk later.

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:29.114 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Wow, it's like a haunted house!

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:31.116 align:middle
[ISANARI]
They're open, right?

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.121 align:middle
[FUTARO] How late did she mean?
Maybe I should call.

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:38.081 align:middle
Agh, damn it!

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.836 align:middle
She was headed this way.

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:45.463 align:middle
[FUTARO grunts]

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.298 align:middle
How'd she do that?

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:52.387 align:middle
Okay. Now where?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle
Gah! Sorcery!

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:59.227 align:middle
[ISANARI]
Ah! I'm in heaven!

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.437 align:middle
And it's a mixed bath,

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.856 align:middle
so we all got to spend
some time together!

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:06.401 align:middle
[RAIHA] Don't stay in too
long, you'll get pruny!

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.861 align:middle
Got it!

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.405 align:middle
[FUTARO] I wonder what she
wanted to talk to me about.

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.699 align:middle
This whole day's been weird.

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:24.586 align:middle
It's from her, right?
But why give me the runaround?

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:26.796 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.717 align:middle
Um, hey. The courtyard's
that way, correct?

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.095 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Is he dead or what?

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:35.347 align:middle
Huh?

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.931 align:middle
There you are!

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:40.643 align:middle
Just in time. Now, tell me,
what's the deal?

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:42.062 align:middle
I'm so confused!

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.272 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Um, let's go to the courtyard.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:48.151 align:middle
No. Let's talk here.
I won't let you run!

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.736 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Well...

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.031 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
What kind of relationship

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.741 align:middle
do you believe this is?

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.576 align:middle
Huh? I mean...

00:17:56.659 --> 00:18:00.997 align:middle
Let's see, you said we
were partners. All of us.

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.459 align:middle
[ITSUKI] No. We can't consider
ourselves partners anymore.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.169 align:middle
Look, I get it.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.463 align:middle
We're not studying
as often these days,

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:10.048 align:middle
so things have changed.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:13.009 align:middle
But I'm your tutor--
I'm here till you graduate.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.178 align:middle
And I promise,
I'll help you guys--

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.305 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
We're through with that.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.475 align:middle
We should end it,
as of right this moment.

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:23.019 align:middle
Huh? Seriously?

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.062 align:middle
Tell me what's going on!

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:25.397 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Ow!

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.692 align:middle
It's your dad, isn't it?
Did he make you say tha--?

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:35.407 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Okay... so you're not dead.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.826 align:middle
[MAN mumbling]

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.245 align:middle
Huh? What'd you say?

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:43.206 align:middle
Don't you dare touch
my granddaughter.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.166 align:middle
I'll kill you.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:50.213 align:middle
[FUTARO] Welp, that's
enough vacation for me.

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:55.051 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Big Bro! It's morning!

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.678 align:middle
Up and at 'em, okay?

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.764 align:middle
[FUTARO] No, thanks.
I'd rather stay in bed.

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:02.851 align:middle
I think I'll sleep forever
and fly into the future.

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Ugh.

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:05.645 align:middle
You still there?

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:07.689 align:middle
My brother is flying into
the future right now.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.734 align:middle
I'm sorry, but I guess you'll
have to try again later, Itsuki.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.068 align:middle
Good morning!

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:14.362 align:middle
Itsuki! What happened yesterday?

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:15.905 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
That's what I'd like to know!

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:19.617 align:middle
Why didn't you show up in the
courtyard like I told you?

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:20.493 align:middle
Huh?

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:22.328 align:middle
Hey, is everything okay, Bro?

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:23.788 align:middle
Gimme a second.

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.165 align:middle
Let's try to meet again.

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:27.751 align:middle
Please believe me,
I would love to do that.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:31.171 align:middle
But it could be kind of
difficult. Father's watching.

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:33.548 align:middle
He doesn't want any
of us to talk to you.

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.134 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I know a good place, then.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.264 align:middle
[door opens]

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:42.599 align:middle
Demiglace.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.642 align:middle
Um... Hamburg!

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:45.894 align:middle
[FUTARO]
All right.

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle
You knew the password,
so you must be Itsuki.

00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:52.984 align:middle
Last night, someone
met me at the desk.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:55.403 align:middle
She told me to stop
tutoring you guys.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:56.613 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Huh?

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.449 align:middle
I guess that wasn't you
I was talking to, huh?

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:03.953 align:middle
That's right. One of them
must've posed as me.

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.455 align:middle
[FUTARO]
In that case...

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:09.584 align:middle
For some reason, one of the
sisters is pushing me away.

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:12.045 align:middle
Did anyone seem suspicious?

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle
I mean, why did she feel
the need to do that?

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:18.385 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Well, if you ask me...

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:22.806 align:middle
[NINO] Once again... we bump
into each other in the bath.

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:25.308 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Nino? Why?

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.852 align:middle
[NINO]
Since it's just you and me,

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.021 align:middle
do you want me to wash
your back or something?

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:31.189 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Huh?!

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:34.025 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Wait a second! One question!

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:35.276 align:middle
Who are you?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:41.241 align:middle
[FUTARO] You're not Itsuki,
which means, uh, let's see...

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:42.909 align:middle
[NINO]
You jerk!

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:55.088 align:middle
I worked up all of my
courage... and he ruined it.

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
That was your fault, you know.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle
How's that?
You all look identical.

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle
I know, but that doesn't mean
that we're alike in every way.

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:06.891 align:middle
We know how to tell each
other apart after all.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:09.102 align:middle
I'm sure you could, too,
if you just tried.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.311 align:middle
Love is the key!

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:12.814 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Come on, be realistic.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.691 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
That was surprising, though.

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:17.569 align:middle
I mean, Nino used to
hate you so much.

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:19.654 align:middle
Wonder what could've changed.

00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:20.989 align:middle
[FUTARO]
That was Nino.

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:23.199 align:middle
And she's not the only
one who's changed.

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:26.494 align:middle
Ichika, too. Miku. Yotsuba.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:29.998 align:middle
They've all been acting funny
since our spring break started.

00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:31.958 align:middle
That's why I wanted
to meet with you,

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.252 align:middle
so you and I could discuss that.

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:36.504 align:middle
Can you think of any reason?

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.173 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I guess I wasn't the only person

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:41.217 align:middle
who noticed that something
was off with them.

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:42.844 align:middle
Nope, no idea.

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:46.765 align:middle
But for now, we need to
unmask the fakeski ASAP.

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:49.559 align:middle
If we don't figure out
what her motives are,

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:52.187 align:middle
then I could be fired
for real this time.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.605 align:middle
Yeah, good point.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle
Still, I have to admit,

00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle
there's one thing she said
to you that I did agree with.

00:21:58.443 --> 00:21:59.527 align:middle
Eh?

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:00.945 align:middle
I don't know why she said it,

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:03.573 align:middle
since we don't know
what she's plotting,

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:07.369 align:middle
but we're not partners who
have the same goal anymore.

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:10.705 align:middle
All those days we spent
studying, watching fireworks,

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:14.751 align:middle
the school camp, Christmas
and the New Year...

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:17.295 align:middle
That's a lot of time
together, isn't it?

00:22:18.797 --> 00:22:21.966 align:middle
So at this point,
you're our friend.

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:26.137 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
I'd say...

00:22:26.221 --> 00:22:29.724 align:middle
...you and I are
strangers, at best.

00:22:32.102 --> 00:22:34.062 align:middle
[FUTARO]
You say that so casually.

00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:36.564 align:middle
Anyway, my vacation's ruined.

00:22:36.648 --> 00:22:39.984 align:middle
So, fine. Let's sort this out.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.995 align:middle
