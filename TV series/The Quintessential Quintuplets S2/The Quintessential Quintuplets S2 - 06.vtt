00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.968 align:middle
This is your last chance.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:15.140 align:middle
[FUTARO]
He's gone.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:18.018 align:middle
Uesugi. Did you
hear all of that?

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:21.604 align:middle
Yeah, that guy is every bit
as awful as I was imagining.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.023 align:middle
That's Dad.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.442 align:middle
To be fair, though,
he's kind of in the right.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.528 align:middle
Thing is, "right" isn't
always what matters.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.282 align:middle
This sucks. I didn't think
he'd threaten a transfer.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.159 align:middle
Now I really can't fail.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.618 align:middle
I apologize for forcing you

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.039 align:middle
to be part of our family
problems, Uesugi.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.583 align:middle
I don't want to transfer.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.836 align:middle
Who cares?
There's no difference.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.838 align:middle
Whether it's a family thing,
a personal thing,

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:51.593 align:middle
an academic thing, whatever,
it doesn't change the facts.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:54.054 align:middle
Like I said before,
I'm gonna do what I want,

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.473 align:middle
and that's helping
you guys pass!

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.434 align:middle
You'll graduate from high school
with your heads held high!

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.145 align:middle
That's all I care about!

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.563 align:middle
[ALL chuckle]

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.607 align:middle
Well, that's encouraging.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.575 align:middle
[ITSUKI] It's not only the
deal I made with Father.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle
If I don't score
well on this exam

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.828 align:middle
and move on to the next grade,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.582 align:middle
then that means my dreams
are at stake, too.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.669 align:middle
[MIKU] I won't be satisfied
with just passing this exam.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.504 align:middle
I made up my mind that day

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:31.925 align:middle
that I was going to get a better
score than any of my sisters.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.678 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Don't think about anything else.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.473 align:middle
You have to concentrate
on passing this thing.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.184 align:middle
[NINO]
No way. This isn't happening!

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:44.312 align:middle
Me with him, of all people?

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:47.565 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Up until now,
I've messed up left and right.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle
If there's some god
of studying out there,

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.321 align:middle
please help me do
well on this test!

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:57.742 align:middle
Come on. We've worked
so hard to get this far!

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:02.539 align:middle
[FUTARO] Two months left
until the finals.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle
Everyone! Let's get started
on today's lesson!

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.419 align:middle
Yes, let us begin!

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.212 align:middle
Please tell us what
we need to do.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.631 align:middle
We're fully devoted
to passing the exams!

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:14.884 align:middle
Uh, right. I like
your enthusiasm.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:18.805 align:middle
Anyway, here goes.
Try to get a 30-- Uh.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:19.889 align:middle
[YOTSUBA, ITSUKI gasp]

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.099 align:middle
What's wrong with you?

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.435 align:middle
Have you been reading
dirty magazines?

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:24.894 align:middle
Ha, ha.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.021 align:middle
It's Miku's fault.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.439 align:middle
Chocolate gives me nosebleeds,

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.733 align:middle
but she keeps on
making me eat it.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.192 align:middle
I brought some more today.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.569 align:middle
Chocolate? That sounds good!

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle
I've been craving
something sweet.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle
It isn't for you.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.907 align:middle
What? Stop being so greedy!

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.159 align:middle
[gasps]

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.579 align:middle
Oh, I'm not. Not yet.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.622 align:middle
Eat these and tell
me what you think.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.499 align:middle
What is this even for?

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.084 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Uh.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.422 align:middle
[door opens]

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:55.342 align:middle
I'm surprised
you're still at it.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle
Ichika. Did I wake you up?

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.055 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
You must have a pretty good idea

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:03.058 align:middle
of Futaro's tastes by now.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.893 align:middle
You figured me out.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.644 align:middle
It's just that I
don't like sweets,

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.147 align:middle
so I'm not sure how to do it.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.232 align:middle
I'm making test batches.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.694 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Um, should I be
seeing a skull in it?

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.237 align:middle
It's fine--that's
the kind of skull

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.489 align:middle
that means it's safe to eat.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.657 align:middle
I'm not sure that's
a real thing.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle
There're plenty of easier
recipes out there, too.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.913 align:middle
Some of them are
just melt-and-mold.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.377 align:middle
Huh... Yeah, cooking's not
really my forte, either.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.087 align:middle
Hang on a sec!

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.633 align:middle
I just remembered. I happen
to know a great cook.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.928 align:middle
Maybe you should ask
for a quick lesson.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.846 align:middle
[FUTARO]
We're a week into the third term

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.224 align:middle
with one Sunday
left to work with.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.685 align:middle
This is the time to buckle down.

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.353 align:middle
So where's Itsuki?!

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.523 align:middle
"Yes, let us begin!
Tell us what we should do!"

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.233 align:middle
So much for that, huh?

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.359 align:middle
Easy, there.

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle
Please calm down.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.238 align:middle
For real, though, it's kinda
weird that she isn't around.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle
You guys, did you all forget?
Itsuki has that thing today.

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.288 align:middle
Wait, what thing?
Where is she going?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.207 align:middle
Wow, he's asking us point-blank.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.709 align:middle
You should be more sensitive

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.086 align:middle
when you ask about
personal stuff like this.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.587 align:middle
She's right.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.840 align:middle
It's sort of uncomfortable for
us to talk about, so, uh--

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.341 align:middle
What is it?

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.136 align:middle
It had better be something more
important than your exams.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.805 align:middle
Because if it's not,
Itsuki's a dead woman.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.683 align:middle
Uh. Well, you see,
girls have this thing--!

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.894 align:middle
Wrong. It's the day that
our mother died, okay?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.441 align:middle
[FUTARO] Wait, but she
was your mother, too, so...

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.817 align:middle
[YOTSUBA chuckles]

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.403 align:middle
Just to be clear,
today isn't <i>the</i> day.

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:42.323 align:middle
She actually passed
away on August 14th.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.659 align:middle
[FUTARO]
So, it's the monthiversary.

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle
[NINO] Yeah, Itsuki's super
devoted to visiting the grave

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.914 align:middle
every month on the 14th.

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:53.043 align:middle
Devoted, huh?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:57.255 align:middle
I wonder if that's the
only reason, though.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:01.176 align:middle
Will I ever be like you, Mom?
I've been working so hard.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.385 align:middle
[footsteps]

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.639 align:middle
[SHIMODA] Hey, I rarely
see other people here.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.517 align:middle
Oh, hi there. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:10.643 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:13.271 align:middle
You're alive?

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:16.024 align:middle
Ha! Sorry for that!

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.734 align:middle
But you look so much
like Ms. Nakano,

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.403 align:middle
I actually thought you
were her for a second!

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:24.574 align:middle
Ah, but she's been dead for so
long, that'd kinda be horrific.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.993 align:middle
Oops, I shouldn't say that in
front of her daughter, huh?

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.661 align:middle
My bad.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.081 align:middle
I think that you and I met
each other for a reason.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.999 align:middle
Go ahead, order as
much as you want.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.043 align:middle
It's in honor of
my late teacher!

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.921 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Huh? As much as I want?

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.718 align:middle
[gasps] Wait.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.429 align:middle
Shimoda, did you say my
mom was your teacher?

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.264 align:middle
Yep! Ms. Nakano!

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle
She smacked me in
the head so many times

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.851 align:middle
that I ended up losing count.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.103 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
That's the thing.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.729 align:middle
Could you please tell
me as much as you can

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.856 align:middle
about what kind
of person she was?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle
Do you really not remember?

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.695 align:middle
It was five years ago,
so you weren't that little.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.613 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Yeah, that's true,

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:06.991 align:middle
but all I really know is how
she acted with us at home.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle
So I thought maybe
you could tell me.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:12.497 align:middle
When my mother was your
teacher, what was she like?

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.791 align:middle
Hmm. A little bit cold.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.335 align:middle
She didn't try to be
friendly to her students.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.586 align:middle
In fact, I'm pretty sure

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.464 align:middle
I never saw her smile
at school even once.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.299 align:middle
[chuckles] If that's
how she was,

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.927 align:middle
then the students must've
been terrified of her.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:29.347 align:middle
[SHIMODA] No, believe it
or not, we weren't.

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:32.726 align:middle
She could be as fierce and
unsympathetic as she wanted.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.061 align:middle
In fact, we loved her for it.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:40.692 align:middle
Because... Ms. Nakano was just
that stunningly beautiful.

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.736 align:middle
That pretty, huh?

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.448 align:middle
[SHIMODA]
Heh. She even had a fan club.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.116 align:middle
The boys were all
smitten with her.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.035 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Wow, seriously?

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:53.163 align:middle
But I bet you're popular, too,
given the resemblance and all.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.749 align:middle
Huh? No, I'm definitely not!

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.626 align:middle
Anyway, Ms. Nakano
was so beautiful

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.837 align:middle
that I fell for her myself.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.506 align:middle
When she'd wallop me and
the other delinquents,

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.052 align:middle
she was always completely
expressionless.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.554 align:middle
But there was an air
of righteousness to it.

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.806 align:middle
It was part of her charm.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.477 align:middle
In the end, we'd fallen in love
with more than her looks.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.356 align:middle
For that entire school year,
she scolded me non-stop.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.984 align:middle
But still, I'm glad
that I met your mom.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:24.486 align:middle
She inspired me.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.572 align:middle
And today, I'm an instructor
at a cram school.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.369 align:middle
[ITSUKI] And I'm happy
I met you, Shimoda.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.997 align:middle
You've helped me come to
a very important decision.

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.291 align:middle
I think I'm going to do
the same thing you did.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.211 align:middle
I'll follow in my
mother's footsteps!

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.379 align:middle
[SHIMODA]
Not so fast.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.588 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.965 align:middle
It's a good thing that
you admire your mother.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:48.593 align:middle
And emulating someone
you have respect for,

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.929 align:middle
that's totally okay, too.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.598 align:middle
I mean, that is what I did.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:54.891 align:middle
But you're not just doing it

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:58.103 align:middle
so you can be like
your mom, are you?

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.855 align:middle
There are lots of
ways to do that.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:04.859 align:middle
But hey, nobody has the right
to decide your dreams for you.

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.736 align:middle
You want to be a teacher? Great!

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.156 align:middle
As long as you understand
what your reasons are.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.283 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
My reasons.

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.497 align:middle
[MIKU]
Hmm...

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.832 align:middle
[door opens]

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.835 align:middle
Miku? Why are you in
here by yourself?

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.336 align:middle
Nino.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.297 align:middle
I thought you had a study group
at school this afternoon.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle
[NINO] I did, but Ichika
made me come home.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:32.345 align:middle
Uh. Wait, you're the cook
she was talking about?

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.097 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Go get 'em, Miku!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.891 align:middle
Now she'll feel better
about her chocolates.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:38.601 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.687 align:middle
And Futaro's always
so oblivious--

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.814 align:middle
he'll never see it coming.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:43.857 align:middle
[sighs]

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.942 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Why did I end up liking him?

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.736 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Ichika? What are you doing?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:48.403 align:middle
[ICHIKA gasps]

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.279 align:middle
Futaro?

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.949 align:middle
What the--? Who's out there?

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.034 align:middle
[groans]

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Are you okay?

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:56.703 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Crap.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.163 align:middle
Yeah! What's up?

00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.248 align:middle
Yotsuba said she forgot
her reference book

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.624 align:middle
at your apartment.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:02.917 align:middle
I came to get it.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.004 align:middle
Oh, that? I think I threw
it away the other day.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.505 align:middle
What?!

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.966 align:middle
You know what? Let's go buy
her another one, right now!

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:15.388 align:middle
[NINO] What is this?
It looks absolutely disgusting!

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.807 align:middle
And I'm willing to bet
it tastes even worse.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.018 align:middle
Maybe if you didn't screw up
the looks and the taste,

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.519 align:middle
you'd be okay.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.939 align:middle
But you'd be better off buying
chocolates from the store.

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.775 align:middle
That's enough!

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.695 align:middle
Shut up.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:31.821 align:middle
[gasps]

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.406 align:middle
Oh, what am I saying?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.784 align:middle
The most important thing is that
you made it by yourself, right?

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.036 align:middle
Besides, it's kind of endearing
if it's not perfect.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.081 align:middle
I mean, look at this one,
it's like a cute little insect!

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:45.168 align:middle
Lately, Futaro won't eat
the food I make him anymore.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle
I think I get why.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.382 align:middle
I understand that I'm not
good at cooking anything.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.133 align:middle
But I'd like to be.

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle
I wanna make chocolates
he can't resist.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:10:00.266 align:middle
[MIKU] So please
teach me. If you would.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.521 align:middle
[NINO]
The heat was too high.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.398 align:middle
You cooked all the moisture out.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.108 align:middle
And let me guess,
you used heavy cream

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle
without warming it up
first, didn't you?

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle
That ruins the texture.

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:15.990 align:middle
Good grief, you're a disaster.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.159 align:middle
Okay, set up.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.874 align:middle
[NINO chuckles]

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.169 align:middle
[NINO] You know, you're
a real pain sometimes.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.132 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Oh. This should be it.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:36.011 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Oh, man. This is so not fair.

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.346 align:middle
[FUTARO]
It's kinda pricey, is that okay?

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.808 align:middle
Uh. Of course!
Don't worry about the cost.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.226 align:middle
I'll go check out, then.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.562 align:middle
Oh, wait. What are you buying?

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle
[FUTARO]
It's nothing.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.607 align:middle
I knew it, you do look
at dirty magazines!

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:53.153 align:middle
What? No! I'm not
sure if I'll buy it.

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle
Aww, so you wanna become
a good teacher, huh?

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:57.615 align:middle
Shut up!

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.868 align:middle
Don't be bashful. Hand it to me.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle
I'll buy it along
with Yotsuba's book.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:03.621 align:middle
I can buy it myself.

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.206 align:middle
Come on, let me!

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.541 align:middle
We're in danger of failing,

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.753 align:middle
and I wouldn't wanna let
that happen this time.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.212 align:middle
Hang on, "this time"?

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:14.257 align:middle
Really? Did nobody tell you?

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.595 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Yikes. That was expensive.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.264 align:middle
And I don't have much
left in my savings.

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:25.435 align:middle
[ICHIKA] But hey, if it makes
Futaro happy, it's worth it.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.062 align:middle
Wait, don't say that!

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.189 align:middle
That wouldn't be a
healthy relationship!

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:32.025 align:middle
I mean, if he and I were dating,

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.402 align:middle
I could totally see
myself spoiling him

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle
and spending money
on him all the time.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.366 align:middle
I would go broke!

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:43.244 align:middle
I'd better give up on him.
Yep, that's the mature choice.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:44.829 align:middle
Uh. Did you buy the book?

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:45.955 align:middle
'Course I did!

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.459 align:middle
I'm all shopped out.
Let's head back.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.211 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What happened to your hand?

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:54.339 align:middle
Uh. I hit it on something.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:57.092 align:middle
It doesn't really hurt that
bad, though. I'm fine.

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:58.968 align:middle
[FUTARO chuckles]

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.637 align:middle
Man, you're so clumsy.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.971 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.723 align:middle
You should be more careful.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.225 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Yeah.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.814 align:middle
[ICHIKA] That's right. It's
this side of him that I like.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:17.195 align:middle
[ICHIKA] He makes it so hard
not to fall for him.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.241 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Listen carefully, ladies.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.411 align:middle
Don't answer this question with
what the author is thinking.

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:27.789 align:middle
Respond with what you feel,
as the person who's reading it.

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:28.873 align:middle
[grunts]

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.083 align:middle
[GIRLS groan]

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.919 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Dammit. We're hitting a wall.

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:37.382 align:middle
[MIKU] Let's see. How did I
feel about the reading again?

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.093 align:middle
[FUTARO] I figured we'd come
to this point eventually.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:44.014 align:middle
At the end of the day,
I'm not a professional teacher.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.516 align:middle
If only I knew what it
is they don't know!

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.518 align:middle
Without that,
how can I teach them?

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.354 align:middle
How cruel is it that
our IQs must differ so!

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.064 align:middle
I can't read his mind,

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle
but he's thinking something
condescending.

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:56.943 align:middle
Sorry, teach.

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:58.778 align:middle
I don't think we can
hold our heads up,

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.489 align:middle
let alone answer these
reading questions.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:04.117 align:middle
Yeah, we've been
studying nonstop for days.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle
Um. I can keep going
in your place!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:13.793 align:middle
[FUTARO] "Cramming too much
is counterproductive."

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:17.255 align:middle
I guess they need
rewards sometimes.

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:19.841 align:middle
We're going to take
the afternoon off!

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:25.764 align:middle
[ICHIKA yells, laughs]

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.437 align:middle
Now let's go ride that one!

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.357 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Itsuki, please slow down.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.027 align:middle
Hang on a second.
Where'd Yotsuba go?

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.571 align:middle
She says she's in the
bathroom with a stomachache.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.907 align:middle
Wow, too much information.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.033 align:middle
Uh.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.284 align:middle
I gotta go, too.

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:49.079 align:middle
Okay, then. Catch up
with us later, I guess.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.455 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Sure.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:53.583 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.126 align:middle
Yeah, what?

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.711 align:middle
Nothing.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:13:59.756 align:middle
[WORKER A]
Huh?

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.217 align:middle
How many times are you
planning to ride this?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.426 align:middle
Pardon me.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.637 align:middle
Uh, I'm sorry, sir,
but that one's occupied!

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.848 align:middle
Can I join? Seat's empty.

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.601 align:middle
Uh. Feel free.

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:15.063 align:middle
Shoot. I thought this
was a good hiding spot.

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.107 align:middle
How did you see me up here?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.609 align:middle
I didn't see you, just that.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:20.944 align:middle
[YOTSUBA gasps]

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:24.155 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] So, my trusty
green ribbon betrayed me!

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:26.366 align:middle
[FUTARO]
You've been studying in here?

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.534 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Yup.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.285 align:middle
I've got more stamina
than the others,

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.955 align:middle
so I thought I
could keep working.

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.915 align:middle
Fun fact: Out of
all five sisters,

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.959 align:middle
I'm actually the
biggest idiot, too!

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:39.337 align:middle
Everyone knows that.
You should have some fun.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:42.549 align:middle
Otherwise, the money we spent to
come here was a total waste.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:45.802 align:middle
Sorry, but I just can't do that.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle
You have no idea how dumb I am.

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:52.183 align:middle
Do you know why we were
transferred to this school?

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:54.769 align:middle
Yeah, Ichika told me already.

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:57.022 align:middle
You were about to flunk
out, weren't you?

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:59.232 align:middle
[YOTSUBA chuckles]

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.734 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
The truth is,

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:04.362 align:middle
the high school we used to go
to was super prestigious.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.489 align:middle
People would get held
back a year all the time

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:09.951 align:middle
just for failing one exam.

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:12.245 align:middle
Naturally, we all
bombed pretty hard.

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.164 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Didn't see that comin'.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.249 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] They gave us
a chance to retake them,

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:19.753 align:middle
so we gave it our
best shot, but...

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:21.838 align:middle
Yotsuba.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.007 align:middle
Everyone passed but you?

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.803 align:middle
That's our Uesugi for you.
You always get the right answer.

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.598 align:middle
[FUTARO] So, only Yotsuba
failed the exam,

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:36.061 align:middle
but all five of them
transferred to a new school.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.605 align:middle
Obviously, my sisters
came with me,

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.399 align:middle
and they never
complained one bit.

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:45.195 align:middle
[FUTARO] Is that because you
were taught to stick together?

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.114 align:middle
[FUTARO] That gets them
through some tough times,

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:51.785 align:middle
but it's been known
to hinder them, too.

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:54.162 align:middle
Now that you know the truth,

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle
please let me study
as much as I can.

00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:01.127 align:middle
I don't wanna drag
everyone down anymore.

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.755 align:middle
I told you,
we're off for the day.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:08.593 align:middle
Then again, we're stuck for now.
I guess we might as well.

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:11.513 align:middle
Let's have a study
session! Man to man.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.348 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.849 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uh! Right!

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:16.768 align:middle
[FUTARO]
This is perfect, actually.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.269 align:middle
Now I can make sure
you understand

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:21.231 align:middle
that Japanese passage we
were looking at earlier.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.608 align:middle
Oh, don't worry about that one.

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:26.444 align:middle
I managed to figure
it out all by myself!

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.405 align:middle
Oh, yeah?

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:32.659 align:middle
Wow, you did! The other
girls had so much trouble.

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.202 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.788 align:middle
Ah! Hey, I thought you said man
to man, not mouth to mouth.

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.289 align:middle
If this is about what
happened on New Year's,

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:39.791 align:middle
I didn't mean to, I promise!

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.002 align:middle
I'm starting to see the light.

00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:43.128 align:middle
What?

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.754 align:middle
I think your father
had a good point.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.674 align:middle
If I have someone helping
me, we can do this!

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.134 align:middle
Sorry, but I'm gonna need you

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.302 align:middle
to dumb that down
a little for me.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.638 align:middle
You're gonna help me
teach Japanese.

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.182 align:middle
Uh. You mean it?

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.058 align:middle
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...!

00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle
[FUTARO]
You can do it!

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle
I know from your test scores--

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:03.606 align:middle
each one of you is strongest
in a different area.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.776 align:middle
Itsuki's science.
Miku's history.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.822 align:middle
And you, Yotsuba,
you're the Japanese expert.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:13.324 align:middle
Is that true?

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.326 align:middle
[FUTARO] You don't have
to do anything special.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.830 align:middle
Just say whatever's
on your mind.

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:23.168 align:middle
If you can do it, then I know
the other four can, too.

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.462 align:middle
'Cause you're quintuplets!

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:31.718 align:middle
So I can be useful?
Even though I'm such an idiot?

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.678 align:middle
I can't do everything, right?

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:36.931 align:middle
Now we'll all be students
and teachers together.

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:40.685 align:middle
Be honest with me, please.
Do you really think I can help?

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle
That's right. It's a job
that only you can do!

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:47.567 align:middle
So, you're sure I won't be
dragging everyone else down?

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.027 align:middle
'Course not.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.323 align:middle
'Cause this time, you'll be
pulling everyone forward.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:00.622 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
'Kay. I can handle this!

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.041 align:middle
I'll make sure my
sisters succeed!

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.209 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Whoa, there.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.045 align:middle
Don't forget, you're
the biggest project.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.929 align:middle
[FUTARO]
You do come here every month.

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.972 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Why are you here?

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:24.396 align:middle
[ITSUKI] Having all six of us
tutor seems like it might work.

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:26.481 align:middle
I've begun to realize that
teaching someone else

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:30.402 align:middle
is a great way to learn
things for yourself.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:35.198 align:middle
Wait. Are you trying to tell me
you don't need me anymore?

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.991 align:middle
I'm just letting you
know I appreciate

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:39.077 align:middle
what you've taught us.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.954 align:middle
Thanks a lot.

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:44.249 align:middle
So, how does it feel to be
thanked by one of your students?

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.875 align:middle
You must be proud of yourself.

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.753 align:middle
Don't say that.
It's so patronizing.

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:50.672 align:middle
Really, though.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.216 align:middle
Whoa! That makes
perfect sense now!

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.802 align:middle
Awesome! Thanks, Itsuki!

00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle
I want to hold onto
that feeling forever.

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.352 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
I'll work hard, Mother.

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:07.313 align:middle
And one day, I'll be a teacher.

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:13.361 align:middle
[MIKU] Took me all night
to make those chocolates.

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.947 align:middle
[ITSUKI] Oh, hey, Miku.
Good to see you're awake.

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:18.742 align:middle
You and Nino always
sleep for half the day.

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:22.579 align:middle
[gasps] Oh, you're here,
too. I didn't know.

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:26.583 align:middle
I wasn't expecting you,
but this is good.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:27.667 align:middle
[MIKU gasps]

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.669 align:middle
What happened to the chocolates?

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:34.049 align:middle
What do you mean? I ate them.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.092 align:middle
They tasted good.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:43.308 align:middle
Um. Thanks a lot.
They were meant to be special.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.895 align:middle
Miku, I have something
I want to say to you.

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:48.938 align:middle
It turns out
you're number one.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:51.316 align:middle
[gasps] I'm number one?

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.109 align:middle
What are you trying
to say, Futaro?

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:56.488 align:middle
I mean the mock exam we did
the other day, obviously!

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:58.865 align:middle
You scored higher than anybody!

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.575 align:middle
Oh. Cool.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:04.371 align:middle
[FUTARO] You know,
I'm startin' to feel some hope!

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.915 align:middle
[MIKU]
I'm going to keep trying hard.

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.084 align:middle
Watch me, Futaro.

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.797 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Ugh. So cold! Huh?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.008 align:middle
[MIKU]
Ichika. Long day at work, huh?

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:18.551 align:middle
Why are you out here?

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.304 align:middle
Oh, and, uh... how'd it go?

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:22.555 align:middle
I meant to ask.

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:24.766 align:middle
Are you planning to give
him some chocolates?

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.936 align:middle
[gasps] Me? Where'd
that come from?

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:31.314 align:middle
I mean, I did think
about doing that.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:34.192 align:middle
I'd feel bad if none of
us gave him anything.

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.361 align:middle
But then you did,
so it was all good.

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:38.113 align:middle
What do you mean by "all good"?

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:39.531 align:middle
[ICHIKA gasps]

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:44.035 align:middle
The thing about him is,
he doesn't think of us as girls.

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle
From the start, I've always
known that in his eyes,

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:49.416 align:middle
we're just his students.

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:50.875 align:middle
Miku.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:55.755 align:middle
So I decided that come what
may, I'll pass this exam.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle
In fact, I'll get the highest
score out of all of us.

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.846 align:middle
After that, I'll be confident.

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle
I'll graduate from being
Futaro's student,

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:10.478 align:middle
and that's when I'll tell
him my true feelings.

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:13.106 align:middle
Oh. Sounds like a plan.

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:16.735 align:middle
If that's your way of helping
yourself to stay motivated,

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.737 align:middle
then you can do it!

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.323 align:middle
I'm sorry, but I'm not
going to wait for you.

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:24.784 align:middle
It's a race to the finish.

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.077 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Mh-hm.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:27.662 align:middle
But I should warn you.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:30.749 align:middle
I'm not planning on
slacking off, either.

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle
Do your best.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:36.296 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Miku's changing all the time.

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:44.804 align:middle
[ICHIKA] I'm beat.
I should quit for the day.

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:48.058 align:middle
These days aren't going
to last forever, right?

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.561 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Keep going!

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:56.608 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Just... a little more.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.954 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Yotsuba! How did the exams go?

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:13.333 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uesugi?

00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.377 align:middle
Thank you for your help.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle
This time... I finally
get to feel victorious!

00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:26.096 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Yotsuba! I'm so proud of you!

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:27.055 align:middle
You succeeded!

00:22:27.138 --> 00:22:28.848 align:middle
[YOTSUBA laughs]

00:22:28.932 --> 00:22:31.184 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] These are the best
scores I've ever gotten!

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:34.062 align:middle
Even though 184
is barely passing.

00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:36.231 align:middle
I ended up with 224, total.

00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:39.359 align:middle
But I did almost fail
a few subjects.

00:22:39.442 --> 00:22:41.361 align:middle
I should work harder.

00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:46.074 align:middle
My total score was 238.

00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:48.743 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Whoa, that's awesome!

00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:52.622 align:middle
I knew you could pull it off!

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:54.499 align:middle
Ichika's here, too!

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:57.127 align:middle
Miku. I'm proud of you.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.921 align:middle
I knew you were the one
with the most potential.

00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:04.467 align:middle
Futaro... I--

00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:07.095 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] So, what score
did you get, Ichika?

00:23:07.178 --> 00:23:10.724 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Um... 240.

00:23:11.683 --> 00:23:12.892 align:middle
So that means...

00:23:12.976 --> 00:23:15.520 align:middle
You scored the highest
out of all of us!

00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:17.981 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Oh, did I?

00:23:18.064 --> 00:23:19.774 align:middle
That's good.

00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:25.321 align:middle
Congrats on passing your
exams! Time to celebrate.

00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:26.698 align:middle
Order as much as you like

00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle
and I'll deduct it
from Uesugi's paycheck.

00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:32.245 align:middle
Ha! I sincerely hope
that was a joke!

00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:33.747 align:middle
That's really nice of you, sir!

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.416 align:middle
Yes, but we're still
missing one person.

00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:37.876 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER]
Oh, that's right.

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:40.795 align:middle
Your other sister left
this with me earlier.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.634 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER] And she gave me
a message for you, too, Uesugi.

00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:50.472 align:middle
Lucky you.
You're useless to me now.

00:23:52.515 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Woo-hoo!

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:57.604 align:middle
[ITSUKI] I'm so happy!
We survived our exams after all!

00:23:57.687 --> 00:24:00.148 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Hey! Where are you off to?

00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:04.486 align:middle
This party is meant for
everybody. I'll get Nino.

00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:11.076 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
"Begin the Offensive."
