Good, we're all here.

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:17.208
This sucks.

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:19.125
Almost exam day and these jocks

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:21.208
are acting like
it doesn't matter.

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:23.375
You still can't get
in touch with Miku?

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:24.750
[RECORDING A]
The party you are...

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:26.583
It sounds like she might've
turned her phone off.

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.333
Just hold on a sec, she told
me where she was going.

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:31.125
Uh! Ichika!

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:32.667
If Yotsuba can't
back out of this,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.792
then you can always
do it for her, right?

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:39.291
Just play pretend.
You're pros at it.

I dunno, it's a lot
more difficult for me.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.250
Like, remember when I tried
to impersonate Ichika?

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.792
Sure I do.

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:51.083
Here's the plan. You'll switch
clothes with Miku, so-- Uh!

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.291
Crap! The track team's leaving!

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.291
We can't let Yotsuba make
it to the train station!

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.709
But how do we stop them?

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.500
[FUTARO]
Hmm...

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:01.834
Uh.

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:10.667
[NINO] I don't care.
I'm not going home.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.041
All that sugar is
gonna make you sick.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:14.709
I don't need your opinion.

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:18.125
Besides, how would you know?
You drink old lady tea.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.166
You're too much of a child
to appreciate green tea.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.583
Just finish your drink
and get lost.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:29.000
By the way, how did you find me
after I switched to this hotel?

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:32.375
I was at the other one
on the day you left it.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:36.208
I mean, you walked right
past me when you stormed out.

00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.041
Why was Futaro there?

[gasps]

[NINO] If I had to describe
what happened in one word?

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:43.959
Terrible!

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:47.542
Believe me, I am never
going to forgive that jerk.

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:49.917
Whoa. What in the
world did he do?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.875
He wore a disguise!

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.792
The nerve! He actually
pulled one over on me!

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:57.250
I see.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.959
That's it?

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:05.000
Be more upset! I need
a bigger reaction here!

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:08.166
Sorry, but disguises are
kinda normal in our family.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.041
[NINO]
Well, yeah, but...

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:15.041
That time... And that time...

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.750
It was always him!

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:22.083
How dare he? He's the worst.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.458
So, is that all that happened?

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:25.875
[NINO]
Pretty much.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.250
[gasps]

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.750
Yeah, that was all.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:33.208
You sure?

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:35.959
He said that,
even outside of exams,

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:38.959
he wants us all
to stick together.

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:41.917
Futaro really told you that?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.083
[NINO]
He did. Isn't that selfish?

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.208
Who cares what that jerk wants?

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.458
[MIKU] And you'd still
rather not come home?

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:50.542
Why the heck would I do that?

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.166
What's the point of
us sticking together

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.959
if we can't even
get along anymore?

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.917
'Cause we're family.
That's enough, right?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.500
I know you think
that everyone else

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:03.250
has changed without you, Nino,

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.834
but if you ask me, you've
changed quite a bit, yourself.

00:03:06.917 --> 00:03:10.291
Seriously? In what way?

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.417
[MIKU] You didn't drink
black tea before.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.959
[NINO]
That's it?

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:16.375
It's like we're all
20% of a person,

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:19.417
judging by the
scores we've gotten.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.709
Those worksheets.

00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:23.542
Hey, don't just go
digging through my bag!

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:25.125
[MIKU]
You missed number three.

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:27.709
It should be the
Battle of Nagashino.

00:03:27.792 --> 00:03:28.542
So?

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:29.583
What, are you trying to brag

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.959
about how hard
you've been studying?

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:36.709
I love Sengoku warlords.
And I've always loved them.

You really like that stuff?

Mh-hm.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.041
That's my 20% of it.

And...

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:50.041
Ugh, too sweet.

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:51.875

What's your problem?

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.875
[MIKU]
If it weren't for you,

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.333
I would never have
known how that tasted.

00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:00.917
It's true that when the
five of us were alike,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.458
we never argued
or got in trouble.

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:07.542
But if we hadn't changed,
we would've all stayed at 20%.

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:11.000
We should each laugh,
get angry, be sad,

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:14.083
experience life in our own way.

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:16.625
Make up for each
other's shortcomings

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.250
and become the people
we're meant to be.

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:22.500
It's good that we're different.

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:26.291
For example, you're
the one who can cook,

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:28.750
so we haven't been very
well-nourished recently.

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:30.750
It's been kind of a disaster.

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:34.375
You can figure something out--
it's not like you're babies!

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:42.125
I knew it. This
is way too bitter!

00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:44.500
Black tea's definitely
the way to go.

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:47.750
Black tea starts
off bitter, too.

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:50.000
Well, yeah,
but in a classy way!

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:53.834
They clearly use higher-quality
leaves to make it, after all!

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:57.709
Green tea is fancier, so I bet
it comes from way nicer leaves!

00:04:57.792 --> 00:04:59.458
Fine, I'll just look it up.

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:02.417
But don't be mad if they use
weeds to make green tea!

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.750
[MIKU]
Yeah, right!

00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:07.125
Oh, they use the same
for both kinds.

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:10.166
Black tea is just fermented.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.041
[BOTH laugh]

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:16.333

tell the other-- Uh.

accept the present, right?

for the future.

brace yourself, too.

to resign from the track team.

any good at this stuff!

is going to work out?

got away. Too bad.

Why, though?

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:33.500

Because exams are next week.

00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:36.542
No, not that. That's not
what I was asking.

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:40.250

pretending to be Nakano.

Well, at least it worked.

Groping people is not okay.

No! I didn't grope anyone!

Huh? What for?
I don't understand.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.792
Itsuki's posing as you

But I have to smooth
things over!

Look, it's too late. Uh.

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.458
Be quiet!

Uh. I promise you, I'm Yotsuba!

Yeah, you do look
a lot like her.

It's just... your hair
isn't the correct length.

She's right!

I didn't expect that she
would look that closely!

Please stop trying to
get me to quit the team!

else for a while!

A prank? Well, I'm
glad that's all it was.

It wasn't very funny, though.

I mean, the part about
me wanting to quit

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:16.875
was totally real.

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:20.834
Wait. You are quitting? But why?

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.333
[YOTSUBA]
You know why.

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:24.667
You must be out of your mind
to schedule a training camp

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.417
for the weekend
right before finals.

00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:31.291
Or maybe you're just stupid.

00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.959
You're right.

00:08:34.834 --> 00:08:36.834
What the hell was that?

00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:39.625
It's finally happening.

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:44.041
I have an evil twin!
Please don't murder me!

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:47.083
Quints can have evil
twins? Oh, right!

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:48.542
[ICHIKA]
Whew.

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:50.792
I made it just in time.

00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:52.000
[FUTARO]
Ichika!

00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:54.125
I was afraid you
wouldn't make it.

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:57.291
That means Miku must
be the one who-- Uh.

00:08:57.375 --> 00:08:59.917
Oh, not me.
I didn't do anything.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.917
[FUTARO]
Huh...?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.542
Miku!

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.709
[FUTARO]
Itsuki. Yotsuba. Ichika. Miku.

00:09:10.792 --> 00:09:11.959
No way.

00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:14.709
When I went over to
Nino's hotel room,

00:09:14.792 --> 00:09:18.083
Miku was there holding
some scissors.

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:20.333
Not sure what happened,

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:23.542
but it's obvious that Nino
changed her mind.

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:26.917
And her hair!

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.417
I can't believe you
cut it so short!

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.208
Did you have your heart broken?

00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:32.750
[NINO]
Yeah, you could say that.

00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:35.667
Ooh! By who? Miku, spill!

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.709
Yeah, what?

00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:37.875
[MIKU]
No clue.

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:40.208
I wasn't referring
to you, you got that?

00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:41.625
Okay.

00:09:41.709 --> 00:09:43.333
All right, then.

00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:47.834
[NINO]
Bye forever, Kintaro.

00:09:47.917 --> 00:09:50.250
Goodbye to the past, too.

00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:55.166
[NINO]
Yotsuba.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.667
I was just doing what I
was told to do, okay?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.458
But I hope you're happy.

00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:01.500
I'm sure if you'd been honest,
she would've listened,

00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:04.250
and we could've
skipped all this.

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:06.041
You need to change some, too.

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:09.333
It may suck sometimes,
but it isn't always awful.

00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:10.750
[gasps]

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:14.542
Yeah. I'll do it.

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:16.333
Want some backup?

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:21.291
Thanks, Ichika. But no.
I'll be fine by myself.

00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:29.083
Um. I'm sorry--

00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:31.500
Don't be. It's all right now.

00:10:31.583 --> 00:10:33.667
None of what you
said then was wrong.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.500
It was all my fault.

00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:38.041
Sorry.

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:39.834
Nino.

00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:42.291
[NINO] Well, you did
do one thing wrong.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.166
When you went and
slapped me in the face,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.709
you did it way too hard.

00:10:46.792 --> 00:10:50.250
Nino! I missed you so much!

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.709
Oh, yeah, by the way,

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:54.792
I have an apology
gift to give you.

00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:56.875
Two advance tickets
for that romance movie

00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:59.125
you said you wanted to see.

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:02.583
Let's go together, okay?

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:06.250
Oh, come on.
Are you kidding me?

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:09.125
[NINO]
Nothing ever works out right.

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:13.583
[YOTSUBA] I sincerely
apologize for the trouble

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:16.542
that I caused all of you!

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:19.750
I had a long conversation
with the track team captain.

00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:21.166
After I help them
out with the meet,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.417
I'm gonna quit the
team permanently!

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.875
[FUTARO]
Huh?

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:29.291
Really, you're still hung up
on that? Just come inside.

00:11:31.417 --> 00:11:32.917
[YOTSUBA]
'Kay!

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.041
As for the two runaways...

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:37.959
Welcome home.

00:11:40.583 --> 00:11:42.166
[NINO, ITSUKI]
Thank you.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.000
[MIKU] It looks like all five
of us have finally finished

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:49.667
with our problem sets.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.583
It was tough, but I'm not
sure if we improved any.

00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:55.709
[FUTARO]
It's fine. I have this.

00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:56.834
[GIRLS]
Hm?

00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:58.875
It's the ultimate cheat sheet!

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:00.333
[GIRLS gasp]

00:12:00.417 --> 00:12:01.834
I didn't think you were
the kind of person

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:03.125
who would have one of those.

00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:04.959
Yeah, what's the point of
us getting good grades

00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:06.667
if we do it by cheating?

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.792
I couldn't agree more
with that statement!

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:10.917
If I get you in
shape in two days,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.500
then that means you won't
have to resort to cheating!

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:15.083
So work hard!

00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:17.792
You don't mind if I move forward
with this new strategy, do you?

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:19.291
Miss Nino, ma'am?

00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:20.750
Really?

00:12:20.834 --> 00:12:23.959
Why would you choose now
to start asking permission?

00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:28.375
But thank you. I'm in, I guess.

00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:30.500
Let's get to it.
The clock's ticking!

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.083

'Kay!

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.125
[FUTARO]
Whoa.

00:12:35.208 --> 00:12:37.208
I got every question wrong!

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:41.083
So it turns out Mr. "Top
of the Class" is all talk.

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:43.750
Why do you care
about us so much?

00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:46.125
You'll never be my
tutor again, got it?

00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:49.542
You should've never
barged into our lives!

[ALL laughing]

00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:57.834
Huh?

00:12:57.917 --> 00:13:00.792
Hey, Futaro. Aren't you happy?

00:13:03.792 --> 00:13:06.875
[FUTARO]
Not yet. We're just starting.

00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:10.083
Today's the big day, huh?

00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:11.834
I'm really nervous!

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:15.500
We did everything we could
do. Right, Uesugi?

00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:17.667
Hey, wait. Where did he go?

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.125
He said he needed
to give Raiha a call.

00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:21.500
Now of all times?

00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:24.375
Yeah, it must be about
something super important.

00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:27.333
He even had to ask if he
could borrow my phone.

00:13:27.417 --> 00:13:30.083
Apparently, his was
out of battery.

00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:33.917
Do your best, you guys.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.417
Ichika. Nino. Miku.
Yotsuba. Itsuki.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.792
If the five of you are
together, you can't lose.

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:50.083
[ITSUKI]
This is terrible.

00:13:50.166 --> 00:13:53.291
[ICHIKA] How'd we score
so low after all that work?

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:56.709
[MIKU] Guess this means we
really are a bunch of idiots.

00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:58.750
Nino. Don't be sad!

00:13:58.834 --> 00:14:01.542
Why don't you worry
about yourself, Yotsuba?

00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.583
[ICHIKA]
Today's a tutoring day, too.

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:06.709
He'll probably wanna go
over the exam answers.

00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:07.792
[doorbell rings]

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:08.917
[ALL]
Huh?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.417
[ICHIKA]
Must be him.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.959
Futaro's about to give
us a long lecture.

00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:13.959
Bet so!

00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:15.709
Why do you sound so happy?

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:17.875
[YOTSUBA giggles]

00:14:17.959 --> 00:14:19.792
I do wish that we
had done better,

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:21.792
but I'm still really
excited to work hard

00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:23.625
with all of you guys again.

00:14:23.709 --> 00:14:25.166
[ITSUKI]
That's weird.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.000
Um. Actually, it's not
Uesugi at the door.

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:32.375
Hello there, ladies.

00:14:32.458 --> 00:14:34.709
Oh, it's Mr. Ebata!

00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:37.375
We thought you'd be
driving Dad around today.

00:14:37.458 --> 00:14:39.166
It would seem that I'm
going to be working

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.750
as your tutor, temporarily.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.291
[ITSUKI]
What? That's random.

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:47.417
I dunno. He was a
teacher once, wasn't he?

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.917
I smell a rat.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.375
[MIKU]
I wonder if Futaro's sick.

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:52.792
[EBATA clears throat]

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:55.834
Unfortunately, Mr. Futaro
Uesugi has resigned

00:14:55.917 --> 00:14:58.125
from the tutoring position.

00:14:58.208 --> 00:14:59.834
[ALL gasp]

00:14:59.917 --> 00:15:02.667
I received the word from
your father himself.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.125
Apparently, the young man
terminated his contract

00:15:05.208 --> 00:15:08.083
effective the day you
took your final exams.

00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:13.709
Does this mean... that we
won't see Futaro anymore?

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:19.583
No way.

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:22.709
This is because of our scores.
Dad forced him to--

00:15:22.792 --> 00:15:25.625
[EBATA]
I don't believe that's the case.

00:15:25.709 --> 00:15:28.041
I was informed that
Mr. Uesugi stepped down

00:15:28.125 --> 00:15:30.959
from his responsibilities
of his own accord.

00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:32.917
He wanted to quit?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.709
Why would he do that?

00:15:35.792 --> 00:15:37.625
There must be some mistake.

00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:40.500
I'll call him over here
and talk to him myself.

00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:44.041
[EBATA] I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid that won't be possible.

00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:45.750
Mr. Uesugi has been forbidden

00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:47.959
from ever entering
this home again.

00:15:48.041 --> 00:15:51.500
Those were your father's
express orders.

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.291
Why'd he say that?

00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:56.709
[MIKU]
Fine. I'll go to him.

00:15:56.792 --> 00:15:58.417
Ebata. Please move.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.083
No, miss.

00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:04.250
It may be temporary,
but I am your tutor for now.

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:06.917
Therefore, I cannot dismiss
you from today's lesson

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.583
until I've taught you
a meaningful amount.

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:12.917
So we can leave after
we're done with this?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.417
Why, yes. Once you finish,
you're free to go.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.291
These problems, they're
not very difficult.

00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:22.709
Kind of makes me wonder if Ebata
might be going easy on us.

00:16:22.792 --> 00:16:23.750
Me, too.

00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:24.792
Then again, I don't think that

00:16:24.875 --> 00:16:27.000
we could've handled
these before.

00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:30.250
It's almost freaky how
painless it is now.

00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:34.125
I hate to say it, but we
owe all of this to him.

00:16:35.917 --> 00:16:39.709
Just one more.
One more question to go.

00:16:39.792 --> 00:16:42.166
I'm down to the last
problem, as well.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.625
[EBATA chuckles]

00:16:43.709 --> 00:16:45.875
[EBATA]
If you girls don't finish soon,

00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:48.750
I suppose that I'll have to
give you an extra lesson.

00:16:48.834 --> 00:16:50.792
[GIRLS gasp]

00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:55.333
Hang on.

00:16:55.417 --> 00:16:56.542
[OTHERS gasp]

00:16:56.625 --> 00:16:59.208
We can always just
cheat. Should we?

00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:00.000
Huh?

00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:01.583
You mean the answer sheet.

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:05.208
Yeah. In each of
our pencil cases.

00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:07.250
But, is that okay?

00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:10.959
We're desperate. So the end
will justify the means.

00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:13.291
[YOTSUBA]
You look just like Uesugi!

00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:15.333
[NINO]
You sure have changed.

00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:17.667
Guess I'll take a look, then.

00:17:18.583 --> 00:17:19.959
[gasps]

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:22.166
[ICHIKA] It says,
"Don't try to take shortcuts

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.083
to the answer, fools."

00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:25.750
Ha. Wow.

00:17:25.834 --> 00:17:29.041
So he never intended to let us
cheat in the first place, huh?

00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:31.542
Of course. That sounds
just like him.

00:17:31.625 --> 00:17:33.750
[ITSUKI]
But what do we do now?

00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:37.500
Wait. There's more here.

00:17:37.583 --> 00:17:38.750
A two?

00:17:38.834 --> 00:17:40.834
Does he mean me?

00:17:42.208 --> 00:17:46.208
[NINO] Mine says, "I'm not
going to teach cheaters."

00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:49.792
"You have to get there
yourselves from now on."

00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.083
My paper says,

00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:54.834
"I'm glad I'm finally done
with this hell job."

00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:58.792
[gasps]

00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:00.834
[ICHIKA]
Itsuki?

00:18:00.917 --> 00:18:06.000
[ITSUKI] "But it was a
pretty fun hell. Later."

00:18:08.792 --> 00:18:10.166
[YOTSUBA]
This sucks.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.959
I want Uesugi to keep
on being my teacher.

00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:17.083
[MIKU]
So do I.

00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:20.792
I need Futaro here. Badly.

00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:22.583
You heard Ebata.

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:26.375
He can't come see us
anymore. It's over.

00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:35.125
Okay. Listen. I think
I may have an idea.

00:18:39.417 --> 00:18:42.583
Ah. Is there something
the matter?

00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:47.542
We need a favor, sir.
Will you help?

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.083
[gasps]

00:18:56.834 --> 00:18:59.792
[EBATA]
You've all grown up so much.

00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:16.959
[FUTARO]
Merry Christmas!

00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:19.875
Come in and try our desserts!

00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:22.083
[ITSUKI]
Excuse me.

00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:23.834
Yes! Uh.

00:19:23.917 --> 00:19:25.083
You guys!

00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:27.417
Is your store able
to do home delivery?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.750
We would like some cake
brought to our house.

00:19:29.834 --> 00:19:33.792
What? We don't have
delivery service here.

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:37.000
Uesugi, I can
finish things up.

00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:38.375
You go on home, okay?

00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:40.291
No! It's fine! I can work!

00:19:40.375 --> 00:19:42.333
[SHOP MANAGER]
I said you're done!

00:19:42.417 --> 00:19:43.583
[FUTARO]
Uh.

00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:46.417
Just go. It's Christmas Eve.

00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:52.000
Huh...?

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:53.333
Wait.

00:19:53.417 --> 00:19:56.250
This isn't the way to your
father's house, is it?

00:19:56.333 --> 00:19:57.542
It sure isn't!

00:19:57.625 --> 00:19:59.667
Just come along.

00:20:00.917 --> 00:20:04.917
Look, girls. Sorry I didn't
tell you when I quit.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.417
But the fact is, I can't
be your tutor anymore.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.291
[ITSUKI]
Check this out.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:13.583
It's a copy of our
new tutor's resume.

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:18.041
[ITSUKI] We wanted you
to see who replaced you.

00:20:18.125 --> 00:20:20.333
[sighs] Well, this is good.

00:20:20.417 --> 00:20:22.667
Your dad didn't waste
any time at all.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.667
He's a former teacher,
went to a college in Tokyo.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.333
Wow. This guy seems like
he's totally qualified.

00:20:29.417 --> 00:20:30.583
Is that it?

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:32.041
So you're just going
to abandon us

00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:35.041
to become someone else's
problem from here on out?

00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:40.625
[FUTARO] Look, I had a second
chance and I fumbled it again.

00:20:40.709 --> 00:20:43.208
Who knows if next time'll
be any different?

00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:46.000
This is a job for
a professional.

00:20:46.083 --> 00:20:50.041
It'd be selfish to put you
through more of the same crap.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.291
It would.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.208
But when have you not
been a selfish person?

00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:54.542
Never cutting us any slack,

00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:56.542
forcing us to memorize
so many formulas

00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:58.792
that it felt like our
brains would explode!

00:20:58.875 --> 00:21:00.583
But then, when we did
get a problem right,

00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:02.917
it made us so happy.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.291
[FUTARO gasps]

00:21:04.375 --> 00:21:06.250
Your selfishness is the
thing that got us this far!

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:08.375
So you don't get to
be considerate now!

00:21:08.458 --> 00:21:11.375
In fact, it's really creepy
coming from you!

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:18.250
Sorry. But it's too
late now. I quit.

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:22.083
I'm not even allowed inside
your father's house anymore.

00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:24.458
Is that the problem?

00:21:24.542 --> 00:21:27.500
Yeah. Can we just go?

00:21:27.583 --> 00:21:30.333
We're already here.

00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:32.458
Thanks for the cake
delivery, mister.

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.041
What? I don't--

00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:36.250
See this place?

00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:39.625
Welcome to our new
home-sweet-home!

00:21:39.709 --> 00:21:42.750
Huh? You live here now?

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:44.083
It's nice, right?

00:21:44.166 --> 00:21:47.166
I've been making good
money, so we rented it.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.667
The five of us are gonna
stay here from now on.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.208
So that takes care
of that problem.

00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:55.959
You're kidding. You gave
up your place for that?

00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:58.000
You said it yourself.

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:01.750
What's most important is that
we're all together, right?

00:22:01.834 --> 00:22:04.709
So who cares where we live?

00:22:04.792 --> 00:22:06.750
Aren't those your keys?

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.208
[RENA]
Bye for good.

00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:15.291
[FUTARO] Crap, my life's
flashing before my eyes.

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:16.875
[RENA]
It's been a while.

00:22:16.959 --> 00:22:20.542
[FUTARO] Or at least,
the last few things.

00:22:20.625 --> 00:22:22.792
[FUTARO]
If I was drowning...

00:22:28.208 --> 00:22:29.583
[gasps]

00:22:34.375 --> 00:22:35.917
Idiots!

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
What was the point of all five
of us jumping in here like this?

00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:43.166
You can't just give up
after only two tries!

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.750
It'll work out.

00:22:44.834 --> 00:22:48.917
'Cause as long as we have you,
I know we can do it this time!

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.750
[gasps]

00:22:51.834 --> 00:22:54.917
[RENA] Don't open that until you
learn how to accept yourself.

00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:58.000
[YOTSUBA]
Nino! What's wrong?

00:22:58.083 --> 00:23:00.166
[NINO]
I'm too cold to move!

00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:07.041
I'll lift you. Hang on.

00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:08.458
[NINO gasps]

00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:14.041
You're all nuts.

00:23:14.125 --> 00:23:17.792
Seriously, you need to learn
how to think before you act.

00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:20.625
I can't stand by and let
your stupidity kill you,

00:23:20.709 --> 00:23:22.750
and I'm getting really sick
of being considerate,

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:25.333
that's for damn sure.

00:23:25.417 --> 00:23:28.709
That's why I'm going to do
whatever I want now, too.

00:23:28.792 --> 00:23:32.917
So get used to my selfishness,
'cause I'm not goin' anywhere.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.208
[heart beating]

00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:37.834
[NINO]
No. It's not what I think it is.

00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:42.458
[ICHIKA] Well, now that we're
in agreement, let's head inside.

00:23:42.542 --> 00:23:44.834
Ah! I hope the cake's okay!

00:23:44.917 --> 00:23:46.750
Calm down.

00:23:49.834 --> 00:23:53.709
[FUTARO]
Goodbye, Rena.

00:23:53.792 --> 00:23:55.667
Futaro, hurry up.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.792
Yeah, or else we'll
eat without you!

00:23:57.875 --> 00:23:59.250
Sure.

00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:03.125
But if I'm there, you'll each
get less than 20% of it.

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:04.375
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:24:04.458 --> 00:24:09.875
