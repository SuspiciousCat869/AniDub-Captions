00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:17.809 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Ichika, she
has feelings for you.

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:19.436 align:middle
[sighs]

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.687 align:middle
What's with you?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.939 align:middle
Oh, I was just thinking
how rough it must be,

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.191 align:middle
tutoring the Nakano
sisters, and all.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.777 align:middle
Wait, what? How'd you know?

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.655 align:middle
[TAKEDA] My dad is the
president of this school.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:31.865 align:middle
You see, my family has

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.951 align:middle
a very close relationship
with Mr. Nakano.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.288 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Damn rich people cliques.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.873 align:middle
Teaching those five
dunces must be

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:44.169 align:middle
a terrible distraction for you,
especially at a time like this.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:47.047 align:middle
After all, you're not ranked at
the top of the class anymore,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.007 align:middle
so they've begun discussing
the possibility

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.884 align:middle
of me taking over your job.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:51.843 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:55.305 align:middle
[TAKEDA chuckling]

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:59.434 align:middle
[TAKEDA] I've finally usurped
the crown from you, Uesugi!

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:00.935 align:middle
I beat you!

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle
I feel like I'm on top of the
world now! I'm the winner!

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.857 align:middle
<i>Oui, oui, oui</i> !

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.776 align:middle
You've lorded over me
from the throne of power

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.363 align:middle
for all this time, but our
long rivalry is at an end!

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.073 align:middle
It began two years back.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.657 align:middle
I was striving to be number
one, and then you--

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.243 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Sorry, who are you?

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.037 align:middle
Huh? Come on, man.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.373 align:middle
Yusuke Takeda, I was always
right behind you in test--

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.876 align:middle
Don't care. I was getting
perfect marks up until now.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.128 align:middle
Why would I know
who was in second?

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.421 align:middle
[grunts]

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.591 align:middle
Gah! That hurt!

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.552 align:middle
[FUTARO] All right.
Time to start studying.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.222 align:middle
Okay. But why's he here?

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:39.349 align:middle
Are you following me?

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.185 align:middle
Don't waste your time
on this nonsense, Uesugi.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.312 align:middle
You've got much
bigger fish to fry.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:45.814 align:middle
What are you talking about?

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:48.733 align:middle
Please forgive my
rudeness, but...

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:51.945 align:middle
...these young ladies are doing
nothing but holding you back.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:52.862 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:53.947 align:middle
Holding him back?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.448 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
It's clear that it would be

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:58.535 align:middle
in Uesugi's best interest
to stop tutoring you at once.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.662 align:middle
You can't deny that fact.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.288 align:middle
Because of your folly,

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle
he has been turned into
a mediocre individual.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.878 align:middle
That's why I'd like
you to set him free.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.296 align:middle
[FUTARO]
You're not wrong.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.756 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.758 align:middle
But up until this past summer,

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:17.178 align:middle
more specifically,
until I took on this job...

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle
...I was on the way to becoming
even less than mediocre.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.475 align:middle
I thought I knew everything

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.563 align:middle
just because I memorized
textbooks cover to cover.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:31.276 align:middle
In fact, I didn't think idiots
of their caliber even existed.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.945 align:middle
Or that I was stupid, too.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.365 align:middle
As long as they'll have me,
I'll stick with them.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle
Futaro.

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:42.829 align:middle
[TAKEDA] Fine, but I still want
proof that this is working out.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.289 align:middle
Here's the deal.

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:47.208 align:middle
Rank in, say, the top 100
for the national mock exams,

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.752 align:middle
or you'll have to
give up the job to--

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.588 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hundred? That's child's play.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.881 align:middle
Top ten.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.592 align:middle
I'll keep on working
as the Nakanos' tutor,

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle
and do that all
at the same time!

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.347 align:middle
They're not holding me
back in the slightest

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle
and I can prove it!

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle
Uesugi!

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:07.479 align:middle
You talk a big game,
but you can't win.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle
You've got way too
much on your plate.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:06.056 align:middle
[FUTARO] Sorry. I need to go
out for some fresh air.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:10.352 align:middle
Uh?

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.479 align:middle
[groans]

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.105 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I have to bring their grades up

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.232 align:middle
so they can graduate
high school.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:21.237 align:middle
I wish I could focus on
acing the mock exam, though.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.574 align:middle
No! I can handle both!
They're not holding me back.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.242 align:middle
[MIKU]
Futaro.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.244 align:middle
Hey, Miku.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.455 align:middle
Nope, not a bit.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.958 align:middle
--Look, about two days ago--
--About two days from now.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.377 align:middle
Oh, you go.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.753 align:middle
No, go ahead.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:37.962 align:middle
Well, I--

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.714 align:middle
[ICHIKA] What are you
guys talking about?

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.424 align:middle
[MIKU, FUTARO gasp]

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:42.592 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Hm?

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.261 align:middle
Uh, it's not important!

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.764 align:middle
I'm worried.
I hope he'll be okay.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.684 align:middle
He'll be fine, but the best
thing we can do for him

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.603 align:middle
is try to lighten his burden
as much as possible.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle
So, I think we should
table the birthday idea.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.193 align:middle
[MIKU]
'Kay.

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.447 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I can't feel bad for what I did.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.825 align:middle
This is the strategy I chose.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.577 align:middle
I've put the brakes
on everyone else.

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.539 align:middle
Now only I'm giving him a gift.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.708 align:middle
It's too late for
second thoughts!

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.377 align:middle
[chuckles] Almost didn't
choose in time!

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.211 align:middle
[ICHIKA gasps]

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.171 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Nino. What's that?

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:21.965 align:middle
Huh? Oh, these?

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.009 align:middle
They're stress-relief candles.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.136 align:middle
Since his birthday's
almost here.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.595 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.515 align:middle
Whoops, my bad. I meant to
keep it a secret till then.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle
Did you not see my
text last night?

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:33.893 align:middle
Oh. I saw.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.271 align:middle
But I wanted to give him
a birthday gift anyway.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.605 align:middle
Hey. Hold on.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.107 align:middle
Does this mean I'm
the only person

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.775 align:middle
who's giving him a present?

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:43.987 align:middle
[giggles] Well,
that's even better.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.989 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Right, I forgot.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.284 align:middle
Nino's train doesn't
have any brakes!

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.201 align:middle
Wait a sec.

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:52.203 align:middle
Huh? What's wrong?

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:55.331 align:middle
You have a present to give him,
too, don't you, Ichika?

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.833 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:02.964 align:middle
Look, while we're
on the subject,

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.258 align:middle
we ought to clear something up.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.385 align:middle
On the last night of our
spring break vacation,

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:10.972 align:middle
I asked you to stop Dad
from running into me.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:14.351 align:middle
But lo and behold,
he still showed up.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.604 align:middle
I don't suppose you'd
like to explain.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle
We're all alike.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.524 align:middle
But in some ways, we're
still different, aren't we?

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle
Well, duh.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.693 align:middle
I should know, since I'm the one

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:26.363 align:middle
who has to come up with
meals for everybody.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.407 align:middle
Exactly. And you
like him, yeah?

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:30.367 align:middle
No, I love him.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.619 align:middle
Me, too.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:35.997 align:middle
Why is this the one thing
we both agree on?

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.668 align:middle
I'm sorry, Nino, but I
won't let you have him.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:44.673 align:middle
So it's your choice?
Just because you're the oldest?

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:47.967 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Seriously, who buys
aromatherapy candles for a guy?

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.804 align:middle
[NINO] What? A gift card is
the tackiest gift you can give!

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.097 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
No way!

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.391 align:middle
He can use it to get
something he really wants!

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:56.685 align:middle
Ah!

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle
Heh. You scared me!

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.898 align:middle
For a second there, I was
afraid that Uesugi came back.

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle
[NINO]
What are you working on?

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.318 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Paper cranes!

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.862 align:middle
I'm going to make him a
thousand to bring good fortune!

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.614 align:middle
It'll help him with his grades!

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.409 align:middle
Isn't that usually done
for sick people, though?

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.495 align:middle
Yeah, do those things even work
if the person isn't dying?

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:19.082 align:middle
I dunno. Uesugi seems
really tired lately.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.127 align:middle
He hides it, but I know
it must be a huge burden

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.504 align:middle
for him to have to
tutor us all the time.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:28.174 align:middle
So this way, I can at least
help keep him healthy!

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.551 align:middle
Done!

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.594 align:middle
[NINO] I thought we weren't
doing birthday gifts.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle
[YOTSUBA grunts]

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:36.307 align:middle
I'm sorry! I wasn't making
them for his birthday!

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.768 align:middle
Um, Yotsuba, library voice!

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle
It's nothing to beat
yourself up over!

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.606 align:middle
Oh, no, I'm the
scum of the earth!

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle
I didn't mean to, but I
feel like I'm cheating!

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.238 align:middle
I'll hate myself
for this forever!

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.823 align:middle
[ICHIKA, NINO]
Yikes.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.116 align:middle
[MIKU]
Me, too!

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.869 align:middle
I bought him these
couple's gym passes,

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.705 align:middle
so we could go and work
out together sometime.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.499 align:middle
I even asked for an
advance to pay for them.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.877 align:middle
I'm sorry, you guys!

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.794 align:middle
[sighs]

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.629 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Yup, we're sisters.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.256 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Okay, here's the plan.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.342 align:middle
If we give him these
before the mock exams,

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.135 align:middle
he'll be distracted
from studying.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.429 align:middle
I say it's better if we
wait till afterward.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Yeah!

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.014 align:middle
[MIKU]
Let's do that.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.474 align:middle
[NINO]
Not so fast!

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.309 align:middle
Who said you could decide?

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.978 align:middle
And are you sure that's
what you really want?

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:25.023 align:middle
You guys don't understand
Futaro very well.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.233 align:middle
It doesn't matter when
he gets his gifts.

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:30.236 align:middle
He's still going to like mine
the best, just wait and see.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.571 align:middle
[NINO grunts]

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.907 align:middle
[MIKU] So we won't do
anything the day of?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.283 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Hmm...

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.787 align:middle
Hold on! I've got
a brilliant idea!

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.671 align:middle
[ITSUKI] It's odd to see
you studying this late.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.799 align:middle
You must be having
a hard time. Here.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:55.345 align:middle
Itsuki. What do you mean?
This is nothing.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.934 align:middle
I'm amazing, remember?

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.477 align:middle
I've been meaning to tell you,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.896 align:middle
I had a talk with a cram school
instructor not too long ago

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:07.023 align:middle
by the name of Shimoda.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.068 align:middle
I mean, it's not like
an official job,

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.529 align:middle
but I'm going to work hard
to improve my academics

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.989 align:middle
while I'm helping
her out a little.

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.158 align:middle
What's wrong,
am I not good enough?

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:20.995 align:middle
Aw, don't get upset.
This isn't about you.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.205 align:middle
I just wanted a job

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:25.625 align:middle
that I could make into
a part of me, you know?

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:29.462 align:middle
I need to work toward my dream
before finals and graduation,

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:33.133 align:middle
so I thought it'd be good
to experience it firsthand!

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.968 align:middle
Man, you quintuplets
are constantly

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.803 align:middle
throwing curveballs at me.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.389 align:middle
Ever since we started
this new school term,

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.726 align:middle
well, it's like you've
changed--all of you.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle
What do you mean "changed"?

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.646 align:middle
[ITSUKI gasps]

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.774 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:53.403 align:middle
[ITSUKI] It's fine.
I'll tell you eventually.

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.286 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What time is it?

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:06.958 align:middle
[FUTARO] Oh, yeah. That was
today, huh? I should go.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.128 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:13.006 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Five paper cranes.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.509 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What is this?

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:29.606 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Right. I'm not alone.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle
They're all giving it
their best, too.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.946 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I can't give up.

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:42.869 align:middle
[TAKEDA] We received our results
from the national mock exam.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.455 align:middle
The Nakanos' grades
do vary a little,

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.582 align:middle
but they've all made some
considerable progress

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.584 align:middle
since last year.

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:52.128 align:middle
I got eighth place
in all of Japan.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.172 align:middle
As for Uesugi...

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:00.887 align:middle
Ha.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.475 align:middle
[TAKEDA] You win.
Third in the nation, huh?

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:10.522 align:middle
I don't like it, but it's only
fair that I tip my hat to you.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.944 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uh.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:19.698 align:middle
You work at a bakery, right?
Not a rock store?

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.241 align:middle
I'm sorry.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.285 align:middle
Nakano's brand-new here, so
she's still learning the ropes.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.915 align:middle
It kinda looks like a dead worm.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.417 align:middle
[BAKER A]
I don't understand.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.293 align:middle
I gave her the
exact instructions.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.754 align:middle
How does she still
manage to screw it up?

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:36.756 align:middle
[MIKU] Maybe I'm not
cut out for baking.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.466 align:middle
Ah! Don't give up yet!

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.428 align:middle
This one looks a lot more
food-like than the last one!

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.555 align:middle
Just be confident!

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:49.769 align:middle
It's bread! Did you really
make this yourself, Miku?

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.187 align:middle
[MIKU]
Mh-hm!

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.565 align:middle
Well, I don't think it's
quite good enough to sell yet,

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.984 align:middle
but I'm glad that you're showing
so much improvement.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.486 align:middle
You should be proud of yourself!

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.614 align:middle
I can't thank you enough for all
that you've taught me so far.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.117 align:middle
Hey, why don't we let
Uesugi try these, too?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.036 align:middle
He'll be so surprised!

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.912 align:middle
Not until I get a lot better.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.832 align:middle
[BAKER A] You want to master it
before the school trip, right?

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:14.544 align:middle
Yeah. We're responsible for
serving lunch on the first day.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.963 align:middle
Like Sun Tzu said
in <i>The Art of War</i> ,

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:20.091 align:middle
"In raiding and plundering,
be like a fire."

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.971 align:middle
Go, Miku! With that
attitude, you can't fail!

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:28.141 align:middle
There's still one big
problem, though.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.559 align:middle
If we're not in the same group,

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.354 align:middle
then we can't spend
lunch together.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:35.648 align:middle
All I want is to tour
Kyoto with him.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:39.152 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
No sweat! Leave it all to me!

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.905 align:middle
[FUTARO] Now that national
mock exams are behind us,

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle
there's another
matter to address,

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:46.534 align:middle
and that's the
upcoming school trip.

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.578 align:middle
We'll be doing activities
in small groups,

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.581 align:middle
each of which can have
up to five members.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:52.832 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:58.213 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Let's see.
Where'd he go, where'd he go?

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.173 align:middle
Uh! Found him!

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.424 align:middle
Hey, can we talk for a second?

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:02.801 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Yotsuba!

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.846 align:middle
Over here.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Is something wrong?

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.643 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I'm excited about the trip.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:15.438 align:middle
Some people are having trouble
with the "groups of five" thing,

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:17.941 align:middle
but it's kinda perfect
for us, don't you agree?

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.526 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.194 align:middle
Oh, yeah, good
thing we're quints.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:22.612 align:middle
The only thing that bothers me

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.531 align:middle
is that we'll have
to leave Futaro out,

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.282 align:middle
which sucks because
he's a third-year

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.992 align:middle
and still doesn't
have any friends.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:29.285 align:middle
It doesn't seem fair.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.496 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
You're right. Well, maybe--

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:32.664 align:middle
Hey, I know.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.208 align:middle
We should make a sacrifice
to help him out!

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uh. I'm lost.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle
What do you think about you and
me forming a group with him?

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.506 align:middle
Just us three.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.008 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Huh? Ichika!

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:46.177 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Oops, I'm getting
a call! Gotta go!

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.141 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Ugh, what's wrong with you?

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:54.644 align:middle
You're glued to your desk again,
even on your day off.

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:56.855 align:middle
Yeah, well, my free
time is precious.

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.607 align:middle
That's why I'm going to
spend it the way I want to.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.819 align:middle
Oh, yeah. I need to thank
you for the party.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.447 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Ooh! Did you get me a present?

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:07.407 align:middle
I'll pass.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.658 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh?!

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.535 align:middle
There's no reason for
you to give me thanks.

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle
If anything,

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:13.538 align:middle
Yotsuba's the person you
should really be thanking.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.749 align:middle
Why would you bring up Yotsuba?

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:18.626 align:middle
Ugh! I knew you would forget!

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.295 align:middle
Don't you remember she
was a huge help to you

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.005 align:middle
during that school camp?

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.924 align:middle
I told you to give her a nice
present in return, didn't I?

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.676 align:middle
You think just because
it's a new school year,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.511 align:middle
it doesn't matter anymore?

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:31.431 align:middle
See? This is the
problem with you!

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.017 align:middle
Huh? You want to
give me something?

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.352 align:middle
Like, a present?

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:38.688 align:middle
For like, a thousand yen.
Fifteen hundred tops.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:39.606 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Hmm.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.025 align:middle
So you showed up
out of the blue?

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:45.195 align:middle
This is the way you do things
though, isn't it, Uesugi?

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.988 align:middle
Don't you wanna surprise me?

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:48.573 align:middle
Yeah, I would,

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.575 align:middle
but I'm sick of getting people
presents that they don't like.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.745 align:middle
This is a lot easier, just tell
me something you want.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:56.247 align:middle
Well, let me see.

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:59.417 align:middle
I know of a really
neat place we can go!

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:03.088 align:middle
Ha! This is gonna be
a super fun day!

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.132 align:middle
[FUTARO] Really? But aren't
we just walking around town?

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.218 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
That's why it's fun!

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.471 align:middle
We're on a date, aren't we?

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:12.722 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.058 align:middle
Oh, wow, I'm starving,
let's get some lunch!

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.019 align:middle
Yeah, sounds good.
You pick the place.

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:19.104 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
How 'bout here?

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.314 align:middle
It's Itsuki's
favorite restaurant!

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:24.359 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Definitely outside my budget.

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.861 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Miku has a
membership at this spa!

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:28.238 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Forget it!

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.448 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] They're playing
the movie Ichika's in!

00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:31.783 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Ah, great!

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.493 align:middle
It's a good thing she
gave me two free tickets!

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:36.621 align:middle
Uh, that wouldn't really
be a gift from me though.

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:39.916 align:middle
I finally found one!
I've had my eye out!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.961 align:middle
A top? Yeah, I can
buy you that one.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.963 align:middle
I don't mind spending
a bit extra.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.423 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Awesome!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:50.468 align:middle
This is the one that Nino
wanted. She'll be so glad!

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:51.803 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Wait a second.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.013 align:middle
Huh?

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:56.182 align:middle
Come on. Isn't there
something that you want?

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.267 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Huh?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.727 align:middle
The restaurant,
then the spa, the movie,

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.311 align:middle
and now the new shirt.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:03.982 align:middle
None of these things were
actually centered on you.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Um, give me a second, okay?

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.654 align:middle
I'll think of something.

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:16.161 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uesugi...

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:18.204 align:middle
...you got any idea
what I want?

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:20.457 align:middle
'Cause I don't know.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.625 align:middle
[NINO]
Where'd Yotsuba run off to?

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:24.961 align:middle
We were supposed to clean
up the apartment today.

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.547 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Itsuki, do you know
what this box is for?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.299 align:middle
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:32.886 align:middle
It's just some outfits
I don't wear anymore.

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:35.013 align:middle
If you don't need it,
throw it out.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle
Well, not that I have
much room to talk.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:42.395 align:middle
Huh? Hang on,
you dropped some--

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:44.397 align:middle
It's from Kyoto.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:48.234 align:middle
I see.

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:51.613 align:middle
[FUTARO] Huh. I'm surprised
you know this place.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:54.574 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Oh, I come to
the park pretty often.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.994 align:middle
When I'm sad, I like to hop
on the swing for a bit.

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.663 align:middle
Oh, sorry, this isn't
really anything special!

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:03.333 align:middle
We can go somewhere
that's nicer!

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.838 align:middle
[FUTARO] Ah, looks like
I've still got it!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.298 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
You don't have to--!

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.592 align:middle
Watch, Yotsuba.
I bet you can't do this!

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:15.053 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Ha, you sound like a kid.

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.138 align:middle
And besides,
anybody can pull that off.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:20.767 align:middle
Pay attention and I'll show
you something really cool!

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.353 align:middle
Swing back as hard as you can!

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:25.855 align:middle
That's easy!

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:30.235 align:middle
[yells]

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:36.866 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
When you swing at full force,

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.411 align:middle
you get a beautiful view.

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:42.038 align:middle
I mean, I know it's
not anything fancy,

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:45.291 align:middle
but I like to think about how
every light means a home,

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.836 align:middle
and every home means a family.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.714 align:middle
It warms my heart.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.967 align:middle
And now... jump!

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.266 align:middle
I think that might
be a new record!

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.852 align:middle
There's no way you
can top this, Uesugi!

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:06.563 align:middle
Sure I can! Watch!

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.149 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:20.618 align:middle
Uh, you okay?

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:26.416 align:middle
[laughing]

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:29.794 align:middle
[FUTARO] Did you see that?
I didn't even let go!

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:33.131 align:middle
[FUTARO] Isn't there
something that you want?

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:35.216 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
You're such a goofball!

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.218 align:middle
Now let's go home,
it's getting late.

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:39.512 align:middle
Oh, okay.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:42.974 align:middle
[FUTARO] Man, I never found
a present to give her.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:45.518 align:middle
What've I got?

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:47.354 align:middle
Uh, you can have this.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:48.772 align:middle
[YOTSUBA laughs]

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle
That's so you, Uesugi.
Thank you so much.

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:55.862 align:middle
But I already got
what I really wanted.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.032 align:middle
Uhh... Wait, really?

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.533 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Yup!

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle
If you say so. Y'sure?

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:09.876 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Let's come back
sometime. With everybody!

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:15.048 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Uh! This is made
for middle-schoolers!

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.342 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Great, all of you are here.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.177 align:middle
Of course! You ready
to get started?

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle
[MIKU] Not yet. We have to talk
about the school trip first.

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:24.015 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.476 align:middle
Futaro, who do you
want to go with?

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.811 align:middle
I mean--

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:30.230 align:middle
Wait! I think Yotsuba
has something to tell you!

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:31.314 align:middle
Who, me?

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle
Uh, right. Maybe...

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.443 align:middle
Well? Speak!

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle
What?

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:39.489 align:middle
Spit it out.

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.032 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
I just thought that...

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:43.785 align:middle
...Miku and Ichika should...

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.079 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Wait, what about the others?

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:48.832 align:middle
Sisters have to stick together.

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:49.624 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.126 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Oh, I know!

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:55.213 align:middle
The best thing is for everyone
to group up! Uesugi, too!

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:56.214 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.882 align:middle
[MIKU]
It'd be great if we could.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.884 align:middle
But we can't have
more than five.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.595 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Oh, I know that--
I meant everybody besides me!

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.181 align:middle
That way, all of
you can be happy!

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Have you thought
this through, though?

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle
[FUTARO] Nah, that's
not gonna work for me.

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:16.526 align:middle
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.362 align:middle
Well, yeah. A pretty
big problem.

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:20.822 align:middle
I'll say.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.324 align:middle
None of us'll be happy if we
do what you're proposing.

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:25.493 align:middle
I certainly won't be.

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:27.662 align:middle
Here's a better idea.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:30.749 align:middle
Fu and I can be in a group,
you guys can do what you want.

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle
Did you...?

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:34.627 align:middle
[NINO] I don't know what Yotsuba
was hoping to accomplish,

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle
but this has been my
plan from the start.

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:42.177 align:middle
I've picked who I want,
and you can't tell me no.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.262 align:middle
[FUTARO] Hey, slow down there,
Nino. I never said--

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:45.847 align:middle
You stay out of this, Fu!

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.183 align:middle
[MIKU]
Hold on.

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:53.146 align:middle
Why'd... you call him Fu?

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:54.731 align:middle
[NINO]
Hmph.

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:57.567 align:middle
If you have something to say,
you might as well say it now.

00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:02.614 align:middle
It's settled.

00:22:02.697 --> 00:22:04.783 align:middle
No, it's not!
Would you let me speak?

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:07.869 align:middle
[NINO] Are you dense? I told
you to keep your mouth shut!

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:08.953 align:middle
Zip it!

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:10.205 align:middle
You should be grateful
for the chance

00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:12.082 align:middle
to go out on a date with me!

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:15.126 align:middle
It's just... I said I'd join
someone else's group.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.753 align:middle
Sorry.

00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:19.214 align:middle
So which of us is
the group leader?

00:22:19.297 --> 00:22:21.758 align:middle
I believe I'm
the obvious choice!

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:24.344 align:middle
Why'd this have to happen?

00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:26.846 align:middle
[AOI] See? I knew the
quints would group up!

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.056 align:middle
[TSUBAKI]
They must be really close

00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:30.225 align:middle
if they all want to go together!

00:22:30.308 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle
This is how it always plays out.

00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:33.061 align:middle
[ICHIKA chuckles]

00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:34.187 align:middle
Look on the bright side,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.231 align:middle
at least Futaro has
some friends now.

00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:37.774 align:middle
[grumbles]

00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:39.776 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Awkward.

00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:14.496 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
"Sisters War: Part 1."
