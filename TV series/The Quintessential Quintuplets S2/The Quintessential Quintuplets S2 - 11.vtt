00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.307 align:middle
[sighs] Uesugi.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle
[gasps]

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.811 align:middle
Uh. Hey, Itsuki. Just you?

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.896 align:middle
Yup, it's just me!

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.232 align:middle
What is it you're cramming
into your bag, there?

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.026 align:middle
Oh, you know, the last
few random things

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle
for the school trip.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:30.238 align:middle
That's right. It's
almost time, huh?

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.573 align:middle
There's been a lot of tension

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.367 align:middle
between all of us
sisters lately,

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:35.744 align:middle
but this trip'll be fun!

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.829 align:middle
Maybe it'll help
bring us together!

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.789 align:middle
Yeah, hopefully.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.709 align:middle
I'd like to get back
to how we were.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:48.381 align:middle
[RAIHA] Underwear, socks.
You have a toothbrush, right?

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:52.177 align:middle
[FUTARO] Come on. We don't
need to buy everything new.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.804 align:middle
[RAIHA] You have some money
saved up from tutoring.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle
There's nothing wrong with
spending at least some of it

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.851 align:middle
on stuff you actually need. Huh?

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle
Then again, you'd better make
sure you don't cheap out

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.188 align:middle
on the quintuplets'
birthday gifts

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.314 align:middle
or they'll hate you!

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:07.233 align:middle
Huh? Why, is that
coming up soon?

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.944 align:middle
Huh? It already happened!

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.363 align:middle
Eh, it doesn't matter.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.448 align:middle
They were late with
mine, after all.

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.825 align:middle
Besides, they never
told me when it was.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.494 align:middle
Get a gift, give one!

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:20.538 align:middle
Wow, even grade-school
kids know that.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.957 align:middle
All right, if you really think
it's that important, I will!

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.501 align:middle
[gasps]

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.127 align:middle
You're here, too, Uesugi?

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.672 align:middle
Ha. I was texting with
Itsuki yesterday.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.757 align:middle
And we're going
to shop together!

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.385 align:middle
'Kay... Back to the
birthday thing, though--

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.428 align:middle
Shh! Shh!

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:38.014 align:middle
I didn't know you were
going to be around, too.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.476 align:middle
I guess we won't be able to have
our shopping day, after all.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:43.687 align:middle
[FUTARO] Maybe if I observe
their shopping habits,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle
I can figure out what they like.

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.402 align:middle
What're you still
following me for?

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:53.029 align:middle
Well, we're shopping for
the same trip. Why not?

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.073 align:middle
Ugh! Because there
are certain items

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.492 align:middle
that we should look
at separately, okay?

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:00.787 align:middle
You know! Like
underwear and stuff!

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.497 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
So, Raiha, uh.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.791 align:middle
What do you think of this
one? Does it suit me?

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.168 align:middle
Well, I'm just a kid,
but that seems way too adult,

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:08.420 align:middle
if you're asking me!

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.588 align:middle
Yeah, but I'm more
of an adult than you are,

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.341 align:middle
so I think it's about right!

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.551 align:middle
[FUTARO]
You're not shopping?

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:15.885 align:middle
[YOTSUBA laughs]

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.179 align:middle
Nah, I tend to make stuff
last for a long time.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.889 align:middle
So you still wear kids' undies.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle
Uh! How did you know that?!

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:23.518 align:middle
I'm all done!

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.145 align:middle
Oh. No Itsuki?

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.814 align:middle
She's getting her measurements
to try some stuff on.

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.024 align:middle
But she's a quintuplet,

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:30.859 align:middle
so can't they all just
buy the same sizes?

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.235 align:middle
[whistle blows]

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.613 align:middle
We call that quintuplet
harassment. Or quintassment!

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.908 align:middle
Not sure why she's getting
her measurements, though.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.535 align:middle
Oh, no, don't tell me.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:43.121 align:middle
She's already outgrowing
the rest of us?

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:46.332 align:middle
Quintuplets sure have a lot
of unique problems, don't they?

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.169 align:middle
You got that right!
Especially lately!

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:52.672 align:middle
Uh, but... anyway,
our school camping trip

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.008 align:middle
turned a little ugly
by the time it ended.

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.052 align:middle
so this time, let's make
sure we all walk away

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.762 align:middle
without any regrets, okay?

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle
I don't really care,

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.432 align:middle
but I guess I'll try
not to get sick again.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:06.061 align:middle
Aw, don't bother pretending
that you're not totally excited.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.646 align:middle
He's read through the guidebook
like a zillion times.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.522 align:middle
Raiha!

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.441 align:middle
He-he. Oh, hey!

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.152 align:middle
What if you run into the girl
from that old photograph?

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.695 align:middle
Yeah, that won't happen.

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.073 align:middle
Huh? Wasn't that
in Kyoto, though?

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.908 align:middle
At least, Dad told
me that it was.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.535 align:middle
[FUTARO] She was a
tourist passing through.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.621 align:middle
Sorry, what photo are
you talking about?

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.539 align:middle
Go ahead, let
Yotsuba look at it!

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:30.168 align:middle
I don't even have it now.
It's nothing, all right?

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.295 align:middle
Yeah, it's obviously
not nothing.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.714 align:middle
Otherwise you would
let me know more!

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:37.467 align:middle
I can only think of one
reason you won't talk about it!

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.386 align:middle
I bet there's
something you regret!

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.056 align:middle
Might as well get it
off your chest now!

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.184 align:middle
All right, fine, then
I'll tell you about her.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:48.353 align:middle
Her name is Rena.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.189 align:middle
[gasps] Yeah, what else?

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.565 align:middle
That's the end.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.985 align:middle
Seriously? Come on,
now you've got me all curious!

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.613 align:middle
Please, you've gotta let me
hear the rest of the story.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.408 align:middle
Basically, Rena was
my big brother's first love.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:02.617 align:middle
Uh?

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.494 align:middle
Your first love?

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.079 align:middle
Hey, I never said that!

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.206 align:middle
[RAIHA giggles]

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.634 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Ha! Full house.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:20.844 align:middle
I lost.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.054 align:middle
I'll beat you next time.
I can feel it!

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.181 align:middle
Yeah, that's what
you keep saying.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.434 align:middle
Uh? Miku?

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.311 align:middle
We finished the game.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle
Um. Two pairs.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.398 align:middle
Too little, too late!

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.108 align:middle
You seem sleepy.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle
I noticed you got up early
and went somewhere today.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:40.155 align:middle
Yeah.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.908 align:middle
I had to beg my boss to let me
borrow the kitchen this morning.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:48.747 align:middle
Aw, that's great! So you're
gonna let him try your baking!

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.666 align:middle
You've worked really
hard to make it this far.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.044 align:middle
I'm rooting for you
till the end.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.464 align:middle
I hope it'll still be
good when it's cold.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:58.631 align:middle
I know!

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.842 align:middle
Whoever wins next time
can ask the losers

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.969 align:middle
to do anything they want.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:06.389 align:middle
Anything, huh?
Sounds interesting.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.974 align:middle
Yeah, count me in.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.851 align:middle
I'll end you.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.897 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
This is intense.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.776 align:middle
Why are we so into
this card game?

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.194 align:middle
[TEACHER B]
All right, students.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.237 align:middle
We'll send your
bags to the hotel.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.573 align:middle
Just take your valuables
with you, for now.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:27.327 align:middle
That's it for instructions.
Go have some fun!

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.704 align:middle
[click]

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.081 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:35.627 align:middle
Everything all right?

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.381 align:middle
Oh, uh, I'm fine.
I'm just out of it, I guess.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle
I wonder where
Fu's group is going.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.636 align:middle
Well, what do you
guys wanna do?

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.056 align:middle
For starters, if you're gonna
travel, then you have to shop!

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.893 align:middle
That's way more fun than looking
at some boring old temples.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:55.522 align:middle
Nah, don't be silly.
We're in Kyoto, of all places!

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:58.983 align:middle
He has to sample some
of the local delicacies!

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.903 align:middle
Obviously, I agree that
the food is important.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.655 align:middle
But first, I want to remind
him of what happened

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.074 align:middle
at the station that day.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.159 align:middle
Ah! I mean, why don't
we just walk around

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:09.577 align:middle
and explore the area?!

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.163 align:middle
Oh my gosh, what the
heck is wrong with you?

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:13.373 align:middle
Well, it's just--

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.624 align:middle
[ICHIKA gasps]

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.752 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Futaro's group is leaving now.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.505 align:middle
[NINO] The only reason none of
us decided to join up with them

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.842 align:middle
was because we're all
thinking the same thing.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.052 align:middle
We're following them.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:34.144 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Ah! It's like
they go on forever!

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.937 align:middle
[ITSUKI] I've seen pictures
of these before,

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.398 align:middle
but in person it's
totally breathtaking!

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.483 align:middle
Gotta post this!

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:44.237 align:middle
Everybody do a peace
sign for the camera!

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.073 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] It's not every day
we get a pic with just us.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:49.409 align:middle
[NINO] Wait, really?
Do we not have any?

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.370 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Didn't we take one
at the fireworks festival?

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.039 align:middle
[ITSUKI] The last one we got
was when we came here

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.124 align:middle
on our elementary school trip.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.959 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
We need one of all of us, then!

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.337 align:middle
Is Futaro at the top already?

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.297 align:middle
[NINO]
I haven't even seen him.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.257 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I bet the guys raced up there.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:07.927 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Okay! Then we can't
let them leave us behind!

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.015 align:middle
[NINO]
There's so many stairs.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.559 align:middle
[ITSUKI] I know, my legs
are starting to hurt.

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.644 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] C'mon, put some
pep in your step!

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.897 align:middle
She doesn't have a care
in the world, huh?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.024 align:middle
That's the Yotsuba
we know and love.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.484 align:middle
Good point.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.487 align:middle
She's not the type to stab
her own sister in the back.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.821 align:middle
I bet you're already coming up

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.823 align:middle
with another nasty
plot, aren't you?

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:29.991 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.161 align:middle
I'm not sure what
you're getting at.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] There are two
paths to choose from.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.875 align:middle
[ICHIKA] It looks like they
both lead up to the peak.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.086 align:middle
[NINO]
I wonder which way Fu went...

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.798 align:middle
I'm gonna fall behind if I don't
meet up with him here.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.633 align:middle
Well, it's already noontime.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.135 align:middle
We should all have some lunch
at this little restaurant!

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.846 align:middle
[gasps] Lunchtime?
But that means...

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.767 align:middle
[NINO] What's wrong? Did you
wanna eat someplace else?

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle
Don't worry.

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:58.561 align:middle
[YOTSUBA gasps]

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:01.231 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Full house!
Guess I win this time!

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.233 align:middle
[OTHERS groan]

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.402 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
We'll make two groups!

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.737 align:middle
Miku and I can head right...

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:11.449 align:middle
...and you three can take
the path on the other side.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:14.577 align:middle
That way, at least some of us
will run into Uesugi, right?

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.704 align:middle
Hang on a second!

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle
You can't just decide that!

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.291 align:middle
But the winner gets to make
the losers do anything!

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.377 align:middle
So whatever I say
goes, peasants!

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.087 align:middle
[NINO, ICHIKA groan]

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.676 align:middle
[NINO] This is all because of
your stupid card game idea.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.761 align:middle
I hope you're proud of yourself.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:35.932 align:middle
We clearly went the wrong way,
since there's no one else here.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:39.352 align:middle
Um, hey. Is there some
kind of problem, you two?

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:40.311 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.147 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Oh, look, a restroom!

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.567 align:middle
See, maybe we did end up on
the right path. I gotta go!

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.861 align:middle
I guess I should,
too, while I can.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:50.196 align:middle
It's probably the last one.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:56.494 align:middle
[MIKU panting]

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.499 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Come on, hurry!

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:04.169 align:middle
If you don't catch up,
their lunch break'll be over!

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:07.047 align:middle
[MIKU]
Just... another second.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.342 align:middle
You worked really hard for
this chance, remember, Miku?

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:13.011 align:middle
So don't throw in the towel now!

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.598 align:middle
Yeah, you're right.
Thanks a lot.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:20.143 align:middle
[ITSUKI] It's lunchtime. I'm
starting to get super hungry.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.644 align:middle
[NINO]
Of course you are.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.856 align:middle
I wonder what Fu's group
had planned for lunch.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.984 align:middle
That's odd. Where's Ichika?

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.111 align:middle
That little rat.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.615 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
If I read the map right,

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:36.451 align:middle
then this is the shortest
path to the peak.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:39.079 align:middle
If Yotsuba was alone,
she'd outrun me,

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.789 align:middle
but since Miku's so weak,

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:44.167 align:middle
there's no way they'll
get up there before I do.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.836 align:middle
But what do I do when I see him?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.048 align:middle
Those other guys
will be there, too.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.717 align:middle
Still, she's been
acting suspicious.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:56.054 align:middle
I can tell she's gonna try and
make a move during this trip.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.889 align:middle
I have to do it again.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle
If I can't take back the
lie that I already told,

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.478 align:middle
then my only option is
to keep the lie going,

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:06.106 align:middle
so I can stop Miku!

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.534 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
There's no one here.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.619 align:middle
I didn't run into
him on the way,

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:22.288 align:middle
which means he must've taken
the path on the right.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.957 align:middle
Better hurry!

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.461 align:middle
[ICHIKA] I'm sure I went fast
enough to lose those two.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:29.921 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.258 align:middle
Uh?

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle
Ichika. Um, why are you
trying to look like me?

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:45.478 align:middle
Listen. If there's
a reason for it--

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:49.858 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Ichika. This isn't
what I intended at all.

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle
You had a plan the entire time?

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.697 align:middle
Yotsuba, what do you mean?

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.074 align:middle
She's doing her best
to get in the way.

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:01.036 align:middle
Get in the way of what?

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:01.703 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Miku--

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.747 align:middle
Hold on! Quiet!

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.999 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] She won't let you
confess to Uesugi!

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.501 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I got here first.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.628 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:12.005 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:15.258 align:middle
Wait, what did you just say?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:23.141 align:middle
Uesugi, please tell me
you didn't hear that.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.269 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Miku!

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle
[NINO]
Ugh. Finally there.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.613 align:middle
Miku! What happened?!
Where are you going?

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:44.371 align:middle
It's you, right? That
was way out of line!

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.581 align:middle
Do you feel good
about making her cry?

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:50.001 align:middle
Hold on a sec!
I was the one who--!

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:53.338 align:middle
Yotsuba. It's fine.
It's still my fault.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:56.299 align:middle
That's what I wanted to
happen in the end, anyway.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:58.051 align:middle
You went too far!

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.346 align:middle
You've got no room
to talk, Nino.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:02.806 align:middle
Back at the hot springs,

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle
you said you'd walk over
anybody, didn't you?

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.145 align:middle
How am I any worse
than you are? Honestly.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.399 align:middle
[NINO]
True, I did say that.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle
I don't intend to give
him up to anyone.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.779 align:middle
But despite that, the bond
between the five of us

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.656 align:middle
is just as precious to me!

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.074 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.284 align:middle
[NINO] Even if you were the one
he ended up choosing,

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:27.288 align:middle
I would...
still be happy for you.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:30.542 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Ugh. I can't take another step.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.085 align:middle
It's your fault.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.255 align:middle
You ate way too much at that
restaurant on the way up here.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.131 align:middle
Hm?

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.383 align:middle
Huh? What's goin' on, man?

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.136 align:middle
Beats me. Not sure
what I walked into.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:44.222 align:middle
You might wanna take
it down a notch. Uh.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle
Back off! All you're gonna
do is make things worse!

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.310 align:middle
Go and catch up with
Miku, right now!

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.688 align:middle
--What?
--[NINO] Hurry up! Go!

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.441 align:middle
All right, all right.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.526 align:middle
Sorry, guys.
We'll meet up later!

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.402 align:middle
Okay.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.946 align:middle
Wait, I'll help you find her!

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.158 align:middle
We'd better start
heading down there, too.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:04.325 align:middle
[click]

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.252 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Damn. I don't see Miku.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:17.172 align:middle
Good news, I just
heard from Itsuki!

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:19.507 align:middle
She says she's on
the bus with Miku.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:22.594 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I see. To the bus stop, then.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle
So, Uesugi,

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.559 align:middle
you heard what I said when
you got to the peak, right?

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.311 align:middle
Please be honest with me.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:32.687 align:middle
I didn't hear a thing.

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:35.607 align:middle
Gah! I can't tell if
you're being sarcastic!

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle
[FUTARO] I said I didn't hear
you. Just leave it at that.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.905 align:middle
Either way, I was
being super reckless,

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:45.075 align:middle
so regardless, I know
I hurt Miku's feelings.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle
I mean, she's been working
so hard for this day!

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:50.830 align:middle
And Ichika wouldn't
have done what she did

00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:53.458 align:middle
if I hadn't put the
idea in her head.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:56.086 align:middle
Yeah, you're right.
This is all your fault.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.255 align:middle
Have some tact. You can't
blurt out stuff like that.

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.591 align:middle
A-ha, so you did hear me, then.

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.385 align:middle
I guess I kind of knew.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:06.596 align:middle
Huh? I'm sorry.
What did you know?

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.101 align:middle
I mean, I... I knew that...

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:17.691 align:middle
Well... that Miku, you know,
that she had feelings for me.

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle
I feel like I'm hearing things!
Repeat that please!

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.945 align:middle
Don't do that! You heard me!

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.863 align:middle
I didn't think you'd
ever notice it.

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:25.615 align:middle
I mean, you're so dense!

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle
Well, a lot of things
have happened.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.829 align:middle
When she of all people
said she was rooting

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.748 align:middle
for me and Ichika,
that threw me off.

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:36.376 align:middle
I wasn't talking
to the real Miku.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:39.337 align:middle
I figured that
part out, at least.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.214 align:middle
Anyway, it's fine.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.925 align:middle
You worry about
people way too much,

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.177 align:middle
and then you end up
overdoing it.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.554 align:middle
[YOTSUBA chuckles]

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.556 align:middle
That's not a bad thing.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.558 align:middle
Remember how I told
you that when I failed,

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:55.103 align:middle
my sisters transferred to
our new school with me?

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.814 align:middle
I made everyone pay
for my mistakes.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:01.317 align:middle
That's not something you
can make up for overnight.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.986 align:middle
The way I look at it,

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.822 align:middle
it makes sense if they
end up happier than me.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.741 align:middle
[FUTARO]
So that's that, then?

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:11.828 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] I really wanted the
whole group to enjoy this trip.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.872 align:middle
Hey, Uesugi.

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:14.998 align:middle
Do you think there's any way

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.917 align:middle
that everybody can
be happy in the end?

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.253 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Of course.

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle
If people could be content

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:25.633 align:middle
without comparing themselves
to anyone else,

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.427 align:middle
I think it would take
nothing less than that

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle
to create the kind of world
that you're talking about.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.015 align:middle
--Y'think so?
--But then,

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.851 align:middle
reality is a lot more
complicated than that.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.354 align:middle
One person's happiness
often means unhappiness

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle
for someone else.

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:41.483 align:middle
Certain kinds of happiness
can only be gained

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:45.278 align:middle
by competing with or
taking from others.

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.531 align:middle
If that's how it is,
then what am I s'posed to do?

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.993 align:middle
Not a thing.
Not much you can do.

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:54.329 align:middle
Don't you think it's a
little presumptuous?

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.581 align:middle
Trying to have
all that you want?

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.166 align:middle
When you choose
to <i>have</i> something,

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.834 align:middle
you give up something else.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.046 align:middle
Someday, you're going to
have to make a choice.

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.756 align:middle
Trust me.

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:11.513 align:middle
[NINO] Listen up, guys. A
photographer's been tailing us.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:16.601 align:middle
I first noticed it back at Kyoto
Station. It hasn't stopped.

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:19.354 align:middle
I read an article that said they
target high school students

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:20.855 align:middle
during their school trips.

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.316 align:middle
But, Nino, why would
someone target you?

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle
--What does that mean?
--[click]

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:26.277 align:middle
There they are!

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:27.904 align:middle
[AOI]
Looks so good!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.073 align:middle
I gotta post it.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.826 align:middle
By the way, Miku and Ichika
headed back to the hotel

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.536 align:middle
a little while ago, right?

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:36.079 align:middle
Uh-huh.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle
Apparently, they were pretty
worn out after all that walking,

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.958 align:middle
so they both wanted to
get some R-and-R.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:43.128 align:middle
[NINO] They're probably
not together, though.

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:46.006 align:middle
[ITSUKI] I can't believe Miku
took off all by herself.

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle
I should go and make
sure they're okay!

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.217 align:middle
Wait, Yotsuba.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.262 align:middle
I'm almost finished eating.
We should go together.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:53.805 align:middle
Really?

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:56.975 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.894 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Oh, dear.

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:01.896 align:middle
Uesugi? Is there
something wrong?

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.482 align:middle
I'm fine. But where'd Maeda go?

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle
Long bathroom visit.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.485 align:middle
Yeah, same here.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.654 align:middle
Then, obviously, I'll go, too.

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:11.448 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Don't follow me.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:12.907 align:middle
[knocking]

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle
[NINO] Hey, I know you two
are in there. Open the door.

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.664 align:middle
Why aren't they answering us?

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.332 align:middle
Not texting back, either.

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.918 align:middle
It's my fault!
Please forgive me!

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:26.963 align:middle
Come on, we still have two
more days of our school trip.

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.258 align:middle
Just give me a chance to
set everything right, okay?

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:32.552 align:middle
[MIKU]
She didn't do anything wrong.

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:33.345 align:middle
Yotsuba.

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.012 align:middle
[click]

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:37.932 align:middle
Ha.

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.143 align:middle
Wow, Nino, you got me so
worried about that photographer,

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.145 align:middle
I almost thought I heard
a click just now!

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.814 align:middle
Yeah, isn't it funny?
I heard it, too.

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:48.234 align:middle
But there's no way he would
follow us into the hotel, right?

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.824 align:middle
[ALL scream]

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:56.034 align:middle
Are they okay?

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.619 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Oh, no!

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.297 align:middle
[MIKU]
Nino, what was that scream?

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.132 align:middle
You finally answered.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:12.717 align:middle
Ichika. What's up?

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:15.595 align:middle
Hey, Futaro.
I'm glad I found you.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.514 align:middle
You have some time tomorrow?

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:21.184 align:middle
Miku, do you already have
any plans for tomorrow?

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.978 align:middle
[BOTH]
We need to talk about something.

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:29.776 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Oh! Hey, look! Kyoto Station!

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.445 align:middle
I'm scared, Yotsuba,
what if we fall from here?

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:33.655 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Whoa.

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.408 align:middle
Guess I forgot how high
up this place was.

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.118 align:middle
Hey, where did you come from?

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:40.245 align:middle
Yeah, I thought you were hanging
out with your own group.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:43.498 align:middle
I was, but I need
to talk to Miku.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.418 align:middle
I figured she'd be
wherever you guys were.

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle
Nope, we had to
leave her behind.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.255 align:middle
She's still not feeling too hot,

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.716 align:middle
so she's resting at
the hotel right now.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.009 align:middle
And Ichika and Nino met up

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:55.719 align:middle
with a few of their friends
from second year,

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:58.304 align:middle
so they're walking around
together for a little while.

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle
Honestly, I'm worried
about Miku,

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.392 align:middle
but we decided to
give her some space

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:03.893 align:middle
and go do our own thing.

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.146 align:middle
Kinda sad to see
you all split up.

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:08.523 align:middle
Oh, no, I think it's
a nice change of pace!

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.775 align:middle
I mean, we get to see
Kiyomizu temple, right?

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle
Itsuki?

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.404 align:middle
Why don't we enjoy the
beautiful scenery, Uesugi?

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:15.697 align:middle
It takes my breath away!

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.825 align:middle
Don't pull on me! It's not safe!

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.744 align:middle
Really, you're
afraid of falling?

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.245 align:middle
Wow, some man you are.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:25.498 align:middle
Uh! In your dreams.
I'm not the least bit afraid!

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:27.876 align:middle
You look like you're pretty
nervous about it, though!

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle
Ooh! Hey, I know!

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.546 align:middle
We should pose together
for a picture! Right here!

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.214 align:middle
Picture? That's stupid!

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.133 align:middle
Yotsuba! Can you take it for us?

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.259 align:middle
Uh, okay.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.053 align:middle
Hurry and get it
over with, would ya?

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:41.348 align:middle
We'll make it quick. Thanks
for taking the time, Uesugi.

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.811 align:middle
[ITSUKI] Wow, why am I being
so forward all of a sudden?

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.563 align:middle
Anyway, hopefully
this'll be enough

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:52.025 align:middle
to make him remember what
happened here six years ago.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.944 align:middle
I'm sorry for the
trouble, ma'am.

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:56.946 align:middle
I just hate it that
you're sick, dear.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.531 align:middle
And on today of all days.

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:01.242 align:middle
I think I'm gonna lie down
for a little bit longer.

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.702 align:middle
That's wise.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:05.413 align:middle
Oh, and they spotted a sneak
photographer around here,

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.915 align:middle
so be careful.

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle
[NINO]
Thank you, I will.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.293 align:middle
[door opens]

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:15.006 align:middle
"I move in the dark like
a shadow." Was that it?

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle
What are you doing? And why?

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:21.012 align:middle
I'm imitating you,
in more ways than one.

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.263 align:middle
They'd be suspicious

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.641 align:middle
if I had tried to act
like I was sick, too.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.351 align:middle
When's the next head
count anyway?

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.311 align:middle
Oh. Good, plenty of time.

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:31.439 align:middle
Forget that. I'm asking
why you came to see me.

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:34.943 align:middle
[NINO] I told you, there's
something I wanna talk about.

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:37.153 align:middle
Don't try to cheer me up.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:38.154 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:39.656 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.537 align:middle
Why would I do a stupid
thing like that?

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.332 align:middle
I mean, my competition just
backed down without a fight.

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:52.836 align:middle
It's kind of anticlimactic,
but it's a lucky break.

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:55.338 align:middle
Now only Ichika's left standing.

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:58.550 align:middle
She's a sneaky little weasel,
but I'll defeat her.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:01.845 align:middle
Anyway, I'm going
to take Fu for myself.

00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:03.263 align:middle
Are you okay with that?

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.558 align:middle
When did you start
calling him Fu?

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.184 align:middle
Who cares?

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:09.853 align:middle
Are you going to refuse
to give up on him

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:11.771 align:middle
just because you
liked him first?

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.189 align:middle
I don't mean that.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.150 align:middle
You've had feelings for
him longer than I have,

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:16.943 align:middle
I'll give you that much.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:18.945 align:middle
And I don't have enough
experience with love

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:21.656 align:middle
to tell you whether or not
that makes a difference.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.491 align:middle
This is my first time.

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:26.036 align:middle
I haven't figured out
the rules of love yet,

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:29.122 align:middle
so I'm totally clueless.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.166 align:middle
What I do know
is that I love him

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.084 align:middle
more than anyone else could.

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:37.172 align:middle
I'm not giving up yet.
Just watch me!

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:39.132 align:middle
Really? Because it sure
looks like you've given up

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.759 align:middle
from where I'm standing.

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:43.261 align:middle
This trip is the perfect chance
to get closer to him,

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:45.388 align:middle
and you're holed up in here.

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.807 align:middle
You had your turn,
and you wasted it.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:48.808 align:middle
Thanks for playing.

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:50.352 align:middle
But I don't wanna quit!

00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:51.519 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:51.603 --> 00:21:53.646 align:middle
[MIKU]
I'm just scared.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.316 align:middle
I knew things would
turn out like this.

00:21:56.399 --> 00:22:00.028 align:middle
Now that Futaro knows that
I have feelings for him,

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:02.947 align:middle
I'm worried I might
not be good enough.

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:05.992 align:middle
There's no way he could
fall for somebody like me.

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle
I figured love would be scary,

00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle
but I never realized a fair
fight could be so terrifying.

00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:14.584 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Hey, these are good
luck charms for love!

00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:17.003 align:middle
We should buy one for Miku!

00:22:17.087 --> 00:22:19.756 align:middle
Yotsuba, where did Uesugi go?

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:23.009 align:middle
I dunno, he probably went
back to hang with the boys.

00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:25.303 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
This should've been my chance.

00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Itsuki.

00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:28.973 align:middle
Are you hiding
something from me?

00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:31.309 align:middle
Hiding?

00:22:31.393 --> 00:22:34.854 align:middle
I just think it's time
you tell him the truth.

00:22:34.938 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle
That the girl he met in Kyoto
all those years ago was you.
