00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:11.094 align:middle
[MARUO]
Ebata, you were late today.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.179 align:middle
[EBATA]
I apologize, sir.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:14.431 align:middle
[MARUO]
It's fine.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.517 align:middle
What concerns me is the
way that you're dressed.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.769 align:middle
[EBATA chuckles]

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.147 align:middle
Well, no matter.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.816 align:middle
[FUTARO] Yes, sir.
They're all working hard.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.192 align:middle
[MARUO]
I see.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:29.779 align:middle
Then I'm expecting good
results from their finals.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.157 align:middle
[FUTARO]
May I say something?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.035 align:middle
It's a bit of a selfish request.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:36.494 align:middle
[MARUO]
Go on.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle
As of today, I would like
to resign as their tutor.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:44.586 align:middle
Also, did you know that Nino
and Itsuki had a fight

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.254 align:middle
and ran away?

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.715 align:middle
[MARUO] This is the first
I've heard of it.

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:50.216 align:middle
Did it get resolved?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.301 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Yes.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.219 align:middle
[MARUO]
Excellent. Take care, then.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.305 align:middle
Wait, sir, that's not all.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.141 align:middle
Don't you care to know what
they were fighting over?

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.727 align:middle
Aren't you the least bit curious
about how your daughters feel,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.354 align:middle
or what's been bothering them?

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:03.688 align:middle
I mean, you're their father.

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.482 align:middle
Oops, my apologies.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.026 align:middle
I shouldn't talk to my boss
like that, should I?

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.612 align:middle
Oh! That's right, I'm quitting!

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:15.158 align:middle
So get it together and be
a dad already! Asshole!

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.289 align:middle
[MARUO] Well, you've
done it now, Uesugi.

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:23.166 align:middle
Still...

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.003 align:middle
I'd never entrust my daughters'
future to a man like you.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.896 align:middle
Aw, thank you for
the cash, Grandpa!

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle
[RAIHA giggles]

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.399 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I guess I'm too old this year.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:14.402 align:middle
I might as well have just
stayed at home to study.

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.988 align:middle
Good fortune! All right!

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.323 align:middle
What does yours say?

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:19.949 align:middle
Uh...

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.534 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I don't need my fortune told

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle
to know how my
year's going to be.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.539 align:middle
Ever since I met
them, I've had...

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.709 align:middle
...the worst luck.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:30.502 align:middle
[grunts]

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.545 align:middle
[RAIHA gasps]

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle
Hey, look, Uesugi and Raiha!

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:41.179 align:middle
Do you have to
show up everywhere?

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.973 align:middle
Do you wanna come over and hang
out at our new apartment?

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.434 align:middle
--Nah, we're too busy.
--Let's go!

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.854 align:middle
[ACTOR D]
And I love you, too.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.982 align:middle
[ITSUKI gasping]

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.776 align:middle
He actually kissed her!

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.028 align:middle
Isn't it romantic?

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.656 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Why'd you even invite us?

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.034 align:middle
Oh, c'mon. It's the new year,
so we're taking it easy!

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.246 align:middle
Speaking of, I made
a present for you.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.288 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.207 align:middle
[MIKU]
It's a special New Year's meal!

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.083 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.502 align:middle
[stomach gurgles]

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.047 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Huh?

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.632 align:middle
Is something bothering
you, Raiha?

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:22.137 align:middle
Um, no. It's just that...
I'm a little confused is all.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle
I thought your family was
supposed to be super rich.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.017 align:middle
[YOTSUBA chuckles nervously]

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.352 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Yeah, stuff happened!

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.813 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Sorry the place
is kinda sparse.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.233 align:middle
[NINO] The landlord
lent us those kimono.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.526 align:middle
Anyway, you guys are welcome

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.946 align:middle
to make yourselves
comfortable here, okay?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.449 align:middle
I hope you can adjust
to the place.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.616 align:middle
[NINO]
Hang on.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.535 align:middle
Why are you sitting
way over there?

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.661 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:50.123 align:middle
Aren't you chilly?
Come get under this.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.542 align:middle
Here, Raiha.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.502 align:middle
Aw, there's no need
to be all shy.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.838 align:middle
I know! How about a massage?

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.048 align:middle
I bet you're tired.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:58.965 align:middle
[FUTARO grunts]

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.634 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh, I feel fine, really.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:02.427 align:middle
[GIRLS gasp]

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.928 align:middle
[MIKU]
Ichika, no fair!

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Be faster next time.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:06.639 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
I'll rub his arms!

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.183 align:middle
[NINO]
Fine, I'll help.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.894 align:middle
[ITSUKI] All right then,
I'll call dibs on his legs!

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:18.902 align:middle
[RAIHA]
When did he get so popular?!

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.195 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Guess what, Mom?

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.989 align:middle
My big brother's finally
becoming a man!

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.492 align:middle
Whatever this is,
leave Mom out of it.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.368 align:middle
[YOTSUBA gasps]

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.578 align:middle
Um, it's not like that, though!

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.413 align:middle
Yeah, we just want to
show our gratitude.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.706 align:middle
I doubt that!

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.541 align:middle
You always work so hard.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.001 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Something's wrong.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.004 align:middle
I'll even share some of my food
with you if you want it.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.756 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Yup, very wrong.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.383 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Let's play this
face-matching game

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.093 align:middle
to get into the party mood!

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:45.011 align:middle
It's the quintuplet version!

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.721 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Sounds impossible!

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:47.889 align:middle
Okay, fine.

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle
There's something that
we've been meaning

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle
to discuss with you.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.644 align:middle
Whoa! Don't just go
blurting it out now!

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:56.398 align:middle
Hang on. We're gonna
have a quick sidebar.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.399 align:middle
[RAIHA]
Uh...

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.276 align:middle
What are those
idiots up to now?

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.071 align:middle
[NINO]
What should we do?

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.323 align:middle
I don't think it'd
bother him at all.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.826 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Yeah, but I still feel bad.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.911 align:middle
I mean, we're asking him
to keep tutoring us

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.288 align:middle
without giving him any money.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.458 align:middle
I want to repay him.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.878 align:middle
Yeah, and I'd rather not depend
on Father anymore, if possible.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:19.963 align:middle
I agree.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.214 align:middle
There's gotta be
something we can do

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.801 align:middle
to show him our thanks,
but what would that be?

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.473 align:middle
No! Off the table!

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.851 align:middle
Itsuki, you were thinking
the exact same thing.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.019 align:middle
[ICHIKA chuckles]

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.478 align:middle
Actually, I don't know
whether that would

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.147 align:middle
make Futaro happy or not.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.108 align:middle
Well, try giving him a little
peck on the cheek, then.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.902 align:middle
I mean, you are the actress
around here, aren't you?

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.281 align:middle
Hey! What are you trying
to say about actresses?

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.616 align:middle
Plus, I don't think
it should be me.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.285 align:middle
How 'bout Miku?

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:56.207 align:middle
Wait, really? Me and Futaro?

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.043 align:middle
Futaro.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Miku!

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.548 align:middle
Now that you've shown how you
feel, I want us to do more.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.133 align:middle
[MIKU gasps]

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:08.219 align:middle
[MIKU]
Um, let's take it slow.

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:11.348 align:middle
[MIKU]
Stop. Wait, I mean, don't stop?

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.058 align:middle
[NINO]
How about you stop?

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:16.561 align:middle
Hey, uh, I feel like we're
not all on the same page.

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:19.356 align:middle
[ITSUKI] Why not do something
normal, like cooking?

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.151 align:middle
You're good at that, Nino.
You should make him some snacks.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.569 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:29.783 align:middle
I can't. I was just
starting to get over it.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.117 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Huh?

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:34.871 align:middle
You know what? We might as
well tell him what's up.

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.915 align:middle
Hey, Ichika.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.667 align:middle
Just hold still.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.752 align:middle
Wow. Are you--?

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.046 align:middle
No, wait!

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.547 align:middle
--[FUTARO] I knew it!
--Huh?

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.425 align:middle
This is totally Ichika's
mouth! It's gotta be!

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.345 align:middle
[RAIHA] Uhh...
Pretty sure it's this one.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:51.638 align:middle
--[ICHIKA grunts]
--[YOTSUBA gasps]

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] I'm so glad
you're playing it!

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.394 align:middle
We changed the rules
a little, though.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.604 align:middle
Yotsuba, what about this?

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle
Huh? Lemme see it.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:05.026 align:middle
Uh, Uesugi. There's
food on your face.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.611 align:middle
[FUTARO grunts]

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle
Whoa! Was that...?
Was that what I think it was?

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.325 align:middle
[YOTSUBA gasps]

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:13.618 align:middle
Why don't we call that little
peck on the cheek

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.745 align:middle
your payment for being
our tutor, okay?

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.581 align:middle
[MIKU] I can't believe Yotsuba
caught me off guard!

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.542 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uh! Creepy!

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.711 align:middle
What? Payment?

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:26.089 align:middle
[ITSUKI] The truth is,
now that we're independent,

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.801 align:middle
we can't really afford to pay
you fairly for your services.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:33.930 align:middle
[FUTARO] Oh, come on.
You could've said that, y'know.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.016 align:middle
I'm teaching you
because I want to.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle
Don't worry about paying me.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:40.145 align:middle
Wow, Uesugi.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.731 align:middle
Just give me a cut
when you make it big.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:43.982 align:middle
[GIRLS]
Uh...

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.775 align:middle
[FUTARO] But I want it
in writing, you hear?

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.569 align:middle
Five thousand yen
per person, per day!

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.612 align:middle
And I will collect every bit!

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.614 align:middle
Right, there's the guy we know.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.117 align:middle
What matters is that all
of you are here right now.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle
I say we get crackin' on some
of that winter homework!

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.748 align:middle
You want us to do
winter homework?

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle
[GIRLS chuckle]

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:03.543 align:middle
Silly.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.503 align:middle
Here's a fun surprise.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:08.214 align:middle
Believe it or not, we
finished it ahead of time.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.092 align:middle
Uh. Okay.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:14.012 align:middle
Well, why don't we just make it
a regular study session, then?

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:17.349 align:middle
Big Brother? I'm going home
so I won't be in the way.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:20.518 align:middle
Uh, cool. I'll see ya later.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.484 align:middle
Hey, Futaro? Can you help
me with this problem here?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.277 align:middle
Let's see.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.071 align:middle
You have to provide
examples of adjectives

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:32.781 align:middle
ending with "-like."

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:36.576 align:middle
It's a suffix, and in this case,
it denotes resemblance.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.828 align:middle
You know, like
lifelike, ladylike.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.539 align:middle
Oh, but "I like you,"
that one's a bit different.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.625 align:middle
[NINO grumbles]

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:44.834 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle
Nothing. Nothing at all.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.757 align:middle
Uh. Hey, are you falling asleep?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.261 align:middle
Who, me? Oh, no. I'm wide awake.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.888 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Real convincing.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.014 align:middle
[FUTARO sighs]

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.891 align:middle
Let's let her sleep
for a while, okay?

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.434 align:middle
Huh?

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:04.646 align:middle
[NINO] The poor girl's been
working harder than ever lately.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.524 align:middle
[ITSUKI] She's paying all
our bills and expenses.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.485 align:middle
And if Ichika wasn't paying
for us to live in this place,

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle
then you couldn't tutor us.

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:14.114 align:middle
But if she can't even
stay awake long enough

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.574 align:middle
to get her schoolwork finished,
then what's the point?

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:17.409 align:middle
Ichika! Hey--

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Wait.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.037 align:middle
Um. Maybe the rest of us
should get jobs, too.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.455 align:middle
[MIKU, NINO, YOTSUBA]
Huh?

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.374 align:middle
Uhh...

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.668 align:middle
[FUTARO] Do you have
any work experience?

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.128 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Um, no.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle
[FUTARO] All of you are
struggling to pass your exams.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.091 align:middle
How will you balance
school and a job?

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle
[ITSUKI gasps]

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:39.055 align:middle
I dunno. I could be a tutor.
The same as you!

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle
It'll be perfect!

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.934 align:middle
They say the best way to
learn is teaching, right?

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.769 align:middle
Two birds with one stone!

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.062 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Please don't, Itsuki.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle
You'd be doing your students
a huge disservice.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.275 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
I know!

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.318 align:middle
I could get a job
at a supermarket!

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.528 align:middle
[FUTARO]
They'd fire you.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.364 align:middle
[MIKU] Maybe...
I'll work at a maid café.

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:57.949 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Ooh, they'd love you!

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.367 align:middle
[NINO]
Bad idea!

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.411 align:middle
[MIKU]
Nino could be a dominatrix.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.204 align:middle
[NINO]
What makes you say that?

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:06.374 align:middle
You would do well in
food service, Nino.

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.126 align:middle
[NINO]
Sure, if I had to.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.336 align:middle
It's always been your dream

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.963 align:middle
to open a little place
of your own, right?

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:14.883 align:middle
Really? You've never
mentioned that.

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.385 align:middle
It's something I thought
about as a kid.

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.095 align:middle
No big deal, okay?

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:22.474 align:middle
Well, hey. We know of
a great cake shop, remember?

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:23.808 align:middle
[NINO]
Hm?

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle
<i>Une mille-feuille.</i>
<i>Deux eclairs. Mont Blanc.</i>

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:28.897 align:middle
<i>Merci beaucoup!</i>

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle
[NINO]
Gross!

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.318 align:middle
[NINO retches]

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.487 align:middle
[FUTARO] I've worked at
a lot of different jobs.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.199 align:middle
The thing is, they all took
some level of commitment.

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.034 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Forget working!

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.787 align:middle
I want you to focus
on your grades!

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.252 align:middle
[MIKU]
Futaro!

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.504 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Ichika!

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.506 align:middle
You're taking your
clothes off in your sleep!

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle
[NINO]
Don't look, weirdo!

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.801 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I didn't mean to!

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:04.766 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Like I said, jobs are hard.

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:15.902 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:17.946 align:middle
Hello?

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.407 align:middle
[MARUO] It's been quite
some time, Itsuki.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.325 align:middle
Yeah, it has.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.744 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Success!

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:27.497 align:middle
This pie I baked
is exactly like yours!

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.291 align:middle
I'll be taking my pay raise
now, thank you very much!

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.085 align:middle
Give it a taste.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle
Ugh. It's grossly underdone.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:40.343 align:middle
I guess this is what I get for
dissing Miku's cooking skills.

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:41.678 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER]
Yeah, I'm not letting you

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.388 align:middle
into the kitchen just yet.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:47.684 align:middle
Oh, by the way, Uesugi,
why don't you head on home?

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:48.893 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:51.521 align:middle
You mean... I'm fired?

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.399 align:middle
No, dummy, we're
closing at 12 today.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.234 align:middle
A film crew wanted
to rent the place out

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.028 align:middle
to do a shoot this afternoon.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.239 align:middle
Coulda told me before...

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle
We're here, sir! Looking forward
to workin' with you guys!

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:08.371 align:middle
I figure if the movie's popular,
our little shop is gonna be

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:11.624 align:middle
swarmed with its
fans in no time.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.084 align:middle
That's why I'll
be putting a pick

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.669 align:middle
in all the desserts
with our name on it,

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:17.422 align:middle
so it'll be featured
prominently on camera.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.924 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I admire this guy's hustle.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.093 align:middle
Wow! Looks yummy!

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle
Thanks for having us! Really!

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:28.183 align:middle
Yeah, no prob.
Guess I'll head out.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.018 align:middle
[door opens]

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:34.147 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Hi, I'm here
for the movie shoot.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.981 align:middle
[grunts]

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.108 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:41.529 align:middle
[DIRECTOR A]
Scene 37-4. Action!

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle
I've been wanting to come here.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.868 align:middle
This dessert shop
is like, totes cool!

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.871 align:middle
[ACTOR C] Tamako!
Now's not the time for that!

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.499 align:middle
Huh? Like, what do
you mean, girlfriend?

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.668 align:middle
She means you got the
cursed reply, remember?

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.961 align:middle
They say if you
receive one, you die!

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:59.714 align:middle
What? You'll have
to dumb it down.

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:03.009 align:middle
I'm like, too stupid to
understand this stuff!

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:06.429 align:middle
Eh, whatever! Let's just
have some pie, okay?

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.516 align:middle
[giggles]

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.142 align:middle
[grumbles]

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.312 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What's wrong, Tamako?

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:17.399 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Uh, listen,
can you not watch me?

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle
It's too embarrassing.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.736 align:middle
Why would you do a job
that you're ashamed of?

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.279 align:middle
I'm not telling the girls this,

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:26.199 align:middle
but our savings are
running out quick.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:27.701 align:middle
I mean,

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:30.954 align:middle
I had no idea food and power
and stuff were so expensive.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.914 align:middle
So I've been
accepting acting jobs

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:35.041 align:middle
that I would normally say no to.

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:38.294 align:middle
I have to keep it together
for my sisters,

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.463 align:middle
and don't try to stop me.

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:43.508 align:middle
[FUTARO] I'm not gonna
dismiss your hard work.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle
Besides, you were the one
who made it possible

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.805 align:middle
for me to keep tutoring
the five of you.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:52.225 align:middle
But if you ask me,
you can do a lot better.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.935 align:middle
Isn't this gig kind
of unprofitable

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.563 align:middle
for how much it requires of you?

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:01.484 align:middle
[PA A] Miss Nakano!
We're ready to start rolling!

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.778 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I'll be right there, sir!

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:10.035 align:middle
Whoa! Like, this pie is so good!

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.578 align:middle
[DIRECTOR A]
And... cut!

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.122 align:middle
Great job, girls,
that take was beautiful!

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:15.665 align:middle
One more for safety, all right?

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:16.916 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Sure!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.544 align:middle
[FUTARO]
She's acting so ditzy.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.671 align:middle
I wish the others could
see her like this.

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.048 align:middle
We're doin' one more.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle
I hope you don't mind if
we use this slice of pie.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:26.676 align:middle
[FUTARO]
That's fine.

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:30.555 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh? Wait, where'd the pick go?

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.851 align:middle
[FUTARO]
That's the dud I made!

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.437 align:middle
[DIRECTOR A]
Ready! Action!

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:46.529 align:middle
Like, this pie is so good!

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:49.199 align:middle
[DIRECTOR A]
Perfect! Love it!

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:58.917 align:middle
[FUTARO] You missed
problem five, you know.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.795 align:middle
Heh. Oops, I guess
you caught me.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.297 align:middle
It's not like you
have to hide it.

00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:08.343 align:middle
Yeah, I know, but it's a lot
cooler if it's a secret.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:10.011 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Done with your script?

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:13.306 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Yeah. I memorized
the entire thing already.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.474 align:middle
Why don't you apply

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:16.267 align:middle
your excellent memory
to studying, then?

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:17.769 align:middle
[ICHIKA chuckles]

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.688 align:middle
[ICHIKA] I get killed off by
the curse at the beginning,

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:21.773 align:middle
so I don't have that many lines.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle
You sure die a lot.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:27.946 align:middle
Oh, by the way. What's the
deal with the pie here?

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:31.282 align:middle
I could be nice and say it's
unique, but if I'm being honest,

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:33.702 align:middle
it tastes like something
Miku cooked up.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.412 align:middle
That was my fault.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.288 align:middle
But at least you
made it look tasty!

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:40.041 align:middle
Really saved my neck.
You're a good liar.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:42.711 align:middle
Um, it's called acting.

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:46.673 align:middle
Still, gotta say,
you threw me for a loop.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.592 align:middle
What I mean is... I'm impressed.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.554 align:middle
You're really growing
as an actress.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:55.348 align:middle
Did she fall asleep? Well,
I guess that's for the best.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:56.933 align:middle
If she had heard me
complimenting her,

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.477 align:middle
then she might've let it go
to her head or something.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:00.729 align:middle
But, yeah.

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:02.647 align:middle
It can't be easy
to keep it together

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:04.774 align:middle
in front of all those people.

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:08.695 align:middle
Like I said, I wish your
sisters could see it.

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle
Good work, Ichika.

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I'm even acting right now.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:21.207 align:middle
Maybe I am a liar.

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:26.171 align:middle
I just... couldn't let him
see the face I'm making.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.094 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:35.388 align:middle
Oh, jeez. So heavy.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:39.851 align:middle
Wait, think physics! The most
efficient method is to...

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:40.894 align:middle
Never mind, it's impossible!

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.063 align:middle
I can carry it for you.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:47.942 align:middle
Get it together, grunts.
We're not done yet.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:49.527 align:middle
Man, this sucks!

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:51.905 align:middle
Why'd you make me
come here at this hour?

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.907 align:middle
They're having
a good sale today.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.117 align:middle
And you should be
able to carry that.

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:58.119 align:middle
Fine, why don't you try it?

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:00.163 align:middle
Oh! That's right.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.749 align:middle
Miku wanted some of these.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.668 align:middle
Is she gonna eat all that?

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.295 align:middle
You're pretty stupid for being
so smart, you know that?

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle
Miku's ahead of the game
though--it's only January!

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.509 align:middle
[NINO]
Whatever, let's go.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.177 align:middle
Uh. Wait, Nino.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.221 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Can you hold this?

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.847 align:middle
[yelps]

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle
[FUTARO, NINO gasp]

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.895 align:middle
[FUTARO] What did I tell you?
Hold on tight, okay?

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
There. Sorry about that.

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.276 align:middle
Um, sure.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle
[heart beating]

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.158 align:middle
[NINO]
Something's off lately.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:43.331 align:middle
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe I'm not over Kintaro yet.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:47.127 align:middle
But it doesn't make
sense. I mean...

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle
...this guy?

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.964 align:middle
There's no way he's really
my prince charming!

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.966 align:middle
He's the worst!

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:55.969 align:middle
What's with you?

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:56.928 align:middle
I'm fine.

00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:59.806 align:middle
Hm? Hey, look! In there.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:04.978 align:middle
[MARUO]
Excuse me.

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle
We'll take one of each
sandwich you have, please.

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:07.814 align:middle
Sure.

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle
[ITSUKI gasps]

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle
You don't have to!

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.152 align:middle
You're not hungry?

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.447 align:middle
I am. Thanks.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.032 align:middle
[MARUO]
Good girl.

00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.868 align:middle
You're cooperative
and quick to catch on.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:23.371 align:middle
I believe that's what makes
a person intelligent, Itsuki.

00:19:23.455 --> 00:19:25.415 align:middle
You're a smart girl.

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:29.127 align:middle
I knew it, that is Dad.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.005 align:middle
Why's he with Itsuki?

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Wait a sec.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:37.385 align:middle
I think that's the guy
from the hospital.

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:41.181 align:middle
Don't tell me...
This guy is their father?

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.183 align:middle
[MARUO]
Now then, Itsuki.

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:47.103 align:middle
I'm prepared to overlook the
mistake you girls have made.

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.856 align:middle
But all you must return
home right away.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:52.734 align:middle
And please make the others
aware, if you don't mind.

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:56.112 align:middle
The others? Does that
include him, or not?

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.697 align:middle
[MARUO]
Uesugi?

00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:00.241 align:middle
Of course not,
this is a family matter.

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:03.536 align:middle
And that boy is an outsider
in every sense of the word.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:08.166 align:middle
Besides, to be frank,
I profoundly despise him.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Wow, that's childish!

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:14.214 align:middle
Good grief,
what did you do to him?

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:15.882 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh... I dunno.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:18.218 align:middle
Nothing really rings a bell.

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.345 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
We can't go home yet.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.472 align:middle
And you shouldn't
call him an outsider.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.891 align:middle
Not when he's so
involved in all this.

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.643 align:middle
[MARUO]
In that case,

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.562 align:middle
I can allow Uesugi
back into my household

00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:31.815 align:middle
and have him resume
his teaching duties.

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:33.233 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh?

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:37.195 align:middle
[MARUO] But I'll pair him
with a professional tutor.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:40.699 align:middle
He'll be hired in a support
position, and nothing more.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:43.076 align:middle
But, sir! We've all been
working so hard and--!

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.369 align:middle
[MARUO]
Come, now.

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:45.745 align:middle
Do you honestly believe that

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.747 align:middle
with Uesugi as
your primary tutor,

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:51.418 align:middle
Yotsuba would have any
hope of passing exams?

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:58.174 align:middle
I saw the scores she got
in her second term.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:01.553 align:middle
And based on that, I don't
have high hopes for her.

00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle
[NINO]
Relax.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:07.142 align:middle
You'll only make matters worse
if you get yourself involved.

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:09.019 align:middle
I know, but...

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:14.858 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Um... I guess you are right.

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:18.069 align:middle
We probably stand a better
chance with two people.

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:19.863 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
We'll pass.

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.531 align:middle
Yotsuba!

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:25.618 align:middle
With Uesugi's help,
we can make it happen!

00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:28.288 align:middle
I want the six of us
to do this together.

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:30.373 align:middle
Please trust us!

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.168 align:middle
We won't make the same
mistakes as before.

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle
And what happens if you do?

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:38.965 align:middle
[MARUO]
I hate to discuss this out loud,

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:41.843 align:middle
but I do know a board member
at another high school.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.678 align:middle
We've made an arrangement
that would allow all of you

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:46.306 align:middle
to enroll there as third-years.

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:48.308 align:middle
If you fail your next exam,

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle
then I'm going to
have you transferred.

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle
Since you insist on doing
things your own way,

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:56.149 align:middle
you'll have to bear
the responsibility.

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:57.859 align:middle
Am I clear?

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:02.322 align:middle
That's fine with us.

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle
I knew you'd be able to
understand my position, Itsuki.

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.744 align:middle
I'll have them
prepare the transfer.

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:09.329 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
No.

00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:12.957 align:middle
We'll switch schools if we fail,
but we still intend to succeed.

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:15.794 align:middle
I'm standing my ground
on this one, Father.

00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:19.214 align:middle
Sorry I'm not the intelligent
daughter you want.

00:22:21.132 --> 00:22:22.509 align:middle
That's all right.

00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:25.970 align:middle
Parents should hear their
children's selfish demands.

00:22:26.054 --> 00:22:30.183 align:middle
But it's also my job to
punish your selfishness.

00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:32.394 align:middle
