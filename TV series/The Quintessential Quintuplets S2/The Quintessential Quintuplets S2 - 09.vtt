00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.011 align:middle
[MIKU] We'll be third-years
starting next week.

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.596 align:middle
[ITSUKI] It's weird that
no one'll be above us.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.765 align:middle
I'm just relieved
that we didn't flunk out.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.018 align:middle
Let's keep up the good
work, okay, guys?

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.895 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Mm-hmm!
Speaking of next week...

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.982 align:middle
...that's when we're gonna start
splitting the rent and bills.

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle
If you can't cover your portion,

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle
you'll have to move
back in with Dad.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.655 align:middle
I suggest we work hard
so we can stay together.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.201 align:middle
Ball's in your court.
You can handle it.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:39.497 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER] Ohh... so you
saw the help wanted ad, huh?

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.042 align:middle
I appreciate you girls
coming in for an interview.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.045 align:middle
Why did you choose to
apply here, of all places?

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.048 align:middle
To be honest, I'm surprised to
see Miku applied here, too.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:51.259 align:middle
Believe me, in a perfect world,
I'd be glad to hire both of you,

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:53.303 align:middle
but there's just one opening.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.305 align:middle
Unless you were to quit, Uesugi.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.015 align:middle
Oh, Boss, you're
such a jokester.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:58.391 align:middle
[FUTARO laughs]

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.143 align:middle
I enjoy making sweets.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.019 align:middle
[BOTH grunt]

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:03.438 align:middle
Yeah? Avid baker? Well, then--

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.899 align:middle
Hold on! I'm better
at it than her!

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:08.693 align:middle
I've already made multiple
batches of chocolates this year.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle
Seriously? You wouldn't have
made squat without my help!

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:14.532 align:middle
[MIKU]
I made the last one alone.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.076 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER sighs]

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.787 align:middle
Both of these ladies are friends
of yours, isn't that right?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.288 align:middle
Uh, kind of?

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:21.539 align:middle
You deal with it.

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:22.624 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What?

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.459 align:middle
[MIKU]
Which of us do you want, Futaro?

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle
[NINO] Obviously, you'll
pick me, since I'm better.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.756 align:middle
[MIKU] But I'll do
anything you ask me to.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.133 align:middle
[BOTH]
You have to choose me!

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.846 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER] All right,
we'll have you start next week.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.265 align:middle
I lost.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.185 align:middle
This is what you get for
suggesting a bake-off.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.813 align:middle
You really thought
you would win?

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.609 align:middle
I do feel kind of bad, though.

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:51.903 align:middle
[MIKU] The bakery across
the street's hiring.

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.488 align:middle
I'll apply there, too.

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.739 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.866 align:middle
[NINO] Wow, you sure got
over that one quickly.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.284 align:middle
I figured you applied
for the job

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.869 align:middle
so you could be around him more.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:03.039 align:middle
It's fine. Working with Futaro
isn't the main goal for me.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.374 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.711 align:middle
[MIKU] When I made that
cake today, I realized...

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.965 align:middle
[FUTARO] Hey, it doesn't
taste that bad after all.

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:14.467 align:middle
...I actually enjoy
creating things.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.094 align:middle
And besides...

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.975 align:middle
[MIKU] ...I want to
become a version of me

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.811 align:middle
that Futaro would fall for.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:28.231 align:middle
[NINO] I still don't feel like
I've won this battle.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.983 align:middle
But now that we work together,

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:33.403 align:middle
I'm going to make him fall
in love with me for sure!

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:36.156 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Yeah.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle
I think I scared them by
bringing down the hammer.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.911 align:middle
I guess you weren't making
enough cash on your own, huh?

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.456 align:middle
It's enough, but we're
barely scraping by.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.458 align:middle
I've had to focus on
the more surefire gigs

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.544 align:middle
and pass on the others
that aren't as stable.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:51.171 align:middle
And if it wasn't for
the money issue,

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.715 align:middle
then I could move on
to more fulfilling work.

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:55.759 align:middle
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.927 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Yotsuba got a custodial job.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle
She's been cleaning
my room a lot,

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.515 align:middle
so she's pretty suited
to that, I think.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle
Itsuki hasn't found anything
yet, but she's doing her best.

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.771 align:middle
She'll be okay.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.689 align:middle
Yeah, well, I don't care
what you idiots do

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.107 align:middle
as long as you
don't screw it up.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.192 align:middle
[ICHIKA laughs]

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.487 align:middle
It would suck to
fail after all this!

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.324 align:middle
You give it your best,
too, okay, Teach?

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Something wrong?

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:24.788 align:middle
[gasps]

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.082 align:middle
I'm good.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.418 align:middle
[ICHIKA] You know,
even though it was my idea,

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.129 align:middle
I can't help but
feel a little sad.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.256 align:middle
We'll all be busy with our jobs,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.052 align:middle
so we probably won't see
each other as often.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.513 align:middle
I wonder if taking this
big step into adulthood

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.432 align:middle
is what finally
makes us grow apart.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.725 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Dunno.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.853 align:middle
But either way, I'm sure
it's not a bad thing.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.605 align:middle
You're right.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.107 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Long story short,

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.068 align:middle
this concern would
prove to be unfounded.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle
In fact, the bond between these
five turned out to be stronger

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:01.491 align:middle
than I could've possibly
imagined it was.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.619 align:middle
They're quintuplets!
Are you kidding?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.871 align:middle
Heh.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.624 align:middle
[FUTARO] It's enough that
you all look alike.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:46.388 align:middle
[AOI] Wow! So the Nakanos
are identical!

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:49.557 align:middle
[STUDENT A] It's so interesting
to see them in person!

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:52.769 align:middle
Can we use your first names
so it won't be as confusing?

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.897 align:middle
Sure! We'd actually prefer
you do it that way, too.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.733 align:middle
Can you, like, predict each
other's thoughts or read minds?

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:01.486 align:middle
Uh, no, we're not telepathic.

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.071 align:middle
[TSUBAKI]
You guys have such a cute face,

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.031 align:middle
why do you hide yours?

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.244 align:middle
Can you give us
some space, please?

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.537 align:middle
Move it, would you?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.538 align:middle
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.997 align:middle
What's up?

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.709 align:middle
Are you curious about the
Nakano sisters, too, Uesugi?

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:19.546 align:middle
[FUTARO] 'Course not.
I just need to use the bathroom.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.132 align:middle
[AOI] Does he have to
be a jerk about it?

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.175 align:middle
[ICHIKA laughs]

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.719 align:middle
He walked right past us.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.971 align:middle
Well, that's on brand for him.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.265 align:middle
He was like that as
a second-year, too.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.558 align:middle
It's like he goes out of his way

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.893 align:middle
to keep his classmates
at arm's length.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.353 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Oh, yeah!

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle
Like at camp when he tried
to do everything by himself.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.567 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
That's just how he his.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.487 align:middle
I wish people could see that
he's really a good guy at heart.

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.364 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Hmm...

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:49.075 align:middle
[TEACHER A] Starting today,
you're third-years.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.244 align:middle
Since you're the most
senior class in school,

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle
you now have a responsibility
to behave in a manner

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:56.541 align:middle
that's exemplary for
all the underclassmen.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:06:59.961 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:01.463 align:middle
I'd like to announce
that I'm running

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.132 align:middle
for class representative!

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.718 align:middle
But I haven't had
a chance to ask yet.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.012 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Please, sir! Just consider me!

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.764 align:middle
[TEACHER A]
I didn't say I wouldn't!

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:15.518 align:middle
Well, if no one else
wants to, then sure.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:16.519 align:middle
All right!

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:17.896 align:middle
If you need my help
with anything,

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.439 align:middle
please just let me know!

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.025 align:middle
Let's select our male
rep as well, shall we?

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.985 align:middle
Is there anybody up for it?

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.111 align:middle
Don't be shy!

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.738 align:middle
Any nominations?

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:27.989 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Who wants it?

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.658 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Oh, man,
she's embarrassing us all!

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.203 align:middle
Well, it's a pretty obvious
choice, don't you think?

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.288 align:middle
It's gotta be Takeda,
without a doubt.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.415 align:middle
He scored highest
on the finals, too!

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.377 align:middle
[chuckles] Honestly,
you guys are too kind.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle
You know, I have
someone in mind

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.297 align:middle
who would be
perfect for the job!

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:45.215 align:middle
Who?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.595 align:middle
Futaro Uesugi!

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:51.721 align:middle
[FUTARO]
What?!

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.848 align:middle
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.851 align:middle
Did she not see
Takeda or something?

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Seriously, Yotsuba?

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:01.606 align:middle
[TEACHER A] Right, let's
move on to the next role.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.275 align:middle
Wait a second, I never
said I would do it!

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.069 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Hmm...

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle
[FUTARO] Typical Yotsuba,
butting into things.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.702 align:middle
[MIKU]
Futaro, you busy?

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.287 align:middle
I have a quick question.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.707 align:middle
I'm holding a magic lamp.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.374 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Are not.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.542 align:middle
Am too.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.127 align:middle
[FUTARO]
This isn't a question.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.921 align:middle
If I told you that it could
grant you five wishes,

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.673 align:middle
what would you wish for?

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:31.511 align:middle
[FUTARO] Uh, is this like a
personality test or something?

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.013 align:middle
Hmm...

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.598 align:middle
I mean, I'd wish to
be ludicrously rich.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:36.683 align:middle
Wouldn't anybody?

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.476 align:middle
Money, then.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.436 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Are we done?

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.854 align:middle
Nope, four left.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.272 align:middle
[FUTARO]
This is too many.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle
Just answer.
You can have anything.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:49.696 align:middle
Sometimes I think I'd like
to have greater stamina,

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.032 align:middle
but then I'd overwork
myself even more.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:53.783 align:middle
So, faster recovery?

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:58.121 align:middle
I don't sleep well, either.
And I could use better luck.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.706 align:middle
Got it.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.625 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Got what, exactly?

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.919 align:middle
What, are you done talking now?

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:07.047 align:middle
[AOI]
Oh, there you are! Yotsuba!

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.882 align:middle
The teacher's asking for you.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:09.924 align:middle
[grumbles]

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:10.759 align:middle
Come with us!

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.177 align:middle
Um, but I...

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.263 align:middle
You know that's Miku,
right? Not Yotsuba?

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:16.348 align:middle
[TSUBAKI, AOI]
Huh?

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.807 align:middle
Really?

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.144 align:middle
Sorry, we're still learning
how to tell you guys apart.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.146 align:middle
[MIKU]
It's okay, I'm used to it.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle
Oh! Yotsuba, the
teacher wants you!

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.484 align:middle
Again already?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.613 align:middle
Pro-tip: The best way is to
memorize their accessories.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.657 align:middle
This tacky star has five points,
and Itsuki's the fifth-born.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.577 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Was the "tacky" part necessary?

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.038 align:middle
[FUTARO] That ribbon makes
a "Y" for "Yotsuba."

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.123 align:middle
If you know these tricks,
you'll never go wrong!

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:46.544 align:middle
[FUTARO] I mean, not that I
have a perfect track record.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.463 align:middle
That's amazing, Uesugi!

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.508 align:middle
You're so smart, it's no
wonder you're the class rep!

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.301 align:middle
Teach us more about them!

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:54.511 align:middle
[TSUBAKI]
Look, there's one over there!

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.512 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hey!

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:57.597 align:middle
Over here, Yotsuba!

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Nope, that's Nino!

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.392 align:middle
I don't like this.

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:02.686 align:middle
Those girls're way
too clingy with him.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.229 align:middle
[ITSUKI chuckles]

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:08.066 align:middle
Aw, it's okay. It looks like
he's starting to change, too.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:11.695 align:middle
But still, I can understand
why you'd be jealous.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.447 align:middle
Whoa, I didn't
mean it like that!

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.117 align:middle
Though there's one
thing I don't get.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.954 align:middle
How could anybody
fall for a guy like him?

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.708 align:middle
[MIKU] I asked Futaro
what his five wishes were.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.335 align:middle
[NINO] Yeah, none of
these are gonna work.

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:28.837 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
What should we do?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.798 align:middle
[ICHIKA] I dunno, but we'd
better think of something fast.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.467 align:middle
[MIKU] You're right,
there's not much time...

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.095 align:middle
...until Futaro's birthday.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
Hey, class rep!

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:43.143 align:middle
Do you mind if I talk to Miku?

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.978 align:middle
[STUDENT C]
Class rep!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.772 align:middle
Could you give this
to Ichika, for me?

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle
[AOI]
For Nino!

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.358 align:middle
For Itsuki!

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:51.901 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
For Yotsuba!

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.404 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Agh, do it yourself!

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.741 align:middle
So, the fact is, now that we've
become third-year students--

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.826 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Excuse me!

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.579 align:middle
Sorry, class rep, but
I'm having a little trouble

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.831 align:middle
hearing you all the
way back here.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:08.543 align:middle
Why don't you try
projecting better? 'Kay?

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.338 align:middle
What I would like
to discuss with you

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.299 align:middle
is arguably the highlight
of the first term.

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.134 align:middle
We've gotta get ready!

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.428 align:middle
--It's the national mock exams!
--It's the school field trip!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.222 align:middle
Step one is making
sure it's fun!

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:22.474 align:middle
[STUDENTS cheering]

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.101 align:middle
Ugh. Idiot.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.062 align:middle
[MIKU]
Are you off to work, Nino?

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.356 align:middle
Yeah, today's my first day.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.107 align:middle
Then, can I ask you a favor?

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.235 align:middle
What do you want now?
I'm not switching jobs with you.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.112 align:middle
If you can talk to Futaro,

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.448 align:middle
try to find out what
things he'd like.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.618 align:middle
Huh? You want that? You sure?

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.621 align:middle
[MIKU]
Yeah. I start today, too.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.789 align:middle
I have to work really hard

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle
to make sure he has
a great birthday.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:54.381 align:middle
[NINO] She's confident if
she's letting me ask him.

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle
Sure a lot happened
during spring break,

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.635 align:middle
but I'm still in the lead.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.762 align:middle
At least, I think.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:04.432 align:middle
But if that's the case,
then why do I feel so anxious?

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:07.268 align:middle
It's never gone that way for me.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle
[NINO]
I confessed to him.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:13.525 align:middle
That had to have changed
something, right?

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:14.984 align:middle
[FUTARO]
You're starting today?

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.695 align:middle
Yeah, I am.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.406 align:middle
They're actually letting me
into the kitchen already.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle
By the way, what do you think
about my new hairstyle?

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.619 align:middle
Well, it's practical
for foodservice.

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.538 align:middle
Try to keep up.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.665 align:middle
Did you forget who
you're talking to?

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.543 align:middle
This job won't be
a problem for me!

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:33.003 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.587 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Sure, you're a good cook,

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:37.257 align:middle
but you're still a
spoiled little rich girl.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.717 align:middle
Get ready.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.261 align:middle
'Cause you're about to see
what the real world is like.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.471 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER]
It's absolute perfection!

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:45.181 align:middle
You must be some
kind of a genius

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.684 align:middle
to create this masterpiece
on your first day!

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.602 align:middle
Oh, it's nothing, really.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:53.064 align:middle
I couldn't have done it if you
weren't such a great teacher!

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.277 align:middle
[NINO] He's more distant
than ever now.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.821 align:middle
Maybe confessing wasn't
the right move.

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.364 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER]
Wow.

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.075 align:middle
Don't think I could've hired
you at a better time, Nakano.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.786 align:middle
We've got a big reservation
coming in later.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.748 align:middle
Oh, yeah, that's right, all the
part-timers are here today.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.958 align:middle
Is it supposed to be a large
party or something?

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:14.377 align:middle
Actually, it's only one person.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.755 align:middle
A reviewer who's infamous
in our circles.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle
And her name is... May.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.968 align:middle
They say her assessments
are so astute

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.137 align:middle
that a restaurant's clientele
will be multiplied

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.474 align:middle
by the number of stars
she gives it online.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:30.602 align:middle
It turns out she wants to try
our new spring dessert.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.187 align:middle
Let's go for five stars!

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.521 align:middle
[NINO, BAKER A]
Right!

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:34.898 align:middle
[NINO]
I can't fail.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.733 align:middle
I need to prove myself
as part of the team

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.819 align:middle
and become closer to Futaro!

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:42.572 align:middle
Hey, Boss. Think you
could check this batter?

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:43.740 align:middle
Something's not right.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.784 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.243 align:middle
Yeah, it's off.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.329 align:middle
[NINO]
I'm sorry! That one's mine.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.581 align:middle
Hurry and remake it, please.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.041 align:middle
[NINO]
Yes, sir!

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:55.877 align:middle
I'm goin' on break now.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.422 align:middle
Gotcha. You take a break,
too, while you can, okay?

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:03.093 align:middle
It's fine, I don't
need to. I'll fix it.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.512 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER]
You have to take breaks, Nakano.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle
I shouldn't have given that job
to a newcomer. I'm sorry.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:13.937 align:middle
[NINO]
Right. I'll stop, then.

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.315 align:middle
This sucks.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.652 align:middle
Because of me, everyone
has to work harder.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:21.945 align:middle
I should go back in--

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.739 align:middle
The boss just said it
wasn't your fault.

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:26.116 align:middle
He was completely in the wrong

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:30.078 align:middle
for trusting you with that
on your first day here.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle
[NINO] I can usually
handle those things

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.124 align:middle
with no trouble at all.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:37.502 align:middle
Why did it have to happen
in front of Futaro?

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.212 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Take a look at this.

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:44.509 align:middle
But don't judge me
too hard, all right?

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.636 align:middle
One time, I accidentally bought

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle
a thousand Santa Claus
decorations for Christmas

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.016 align:middle
instead of a hundred.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.517 align:middle
[NINO]
Huh?

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.104 align:middle
[FUTARO] And this rack is dented
because I fell and hit it.

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.189 align:middle
[NINO]
What are you saying?

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:01.026 align:middle
[FUTARO] I can't count the
number of times I broke a plate

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.319 align:middle
or took an order
to the wrong table.

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.613 align:middle
I've messed up way
more than you.

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:08.158 align:middle
You're trying to cheer
me up, aren't you?

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.409 align:middle
Of course I'm not!

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:12.037 align:middle
I'm just teaching you
how brutal work can be!

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.123 align:middle
Because you're training.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.168 align:middle
Then, why?

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle
Why've you been avoiding me?

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:24.883 align:middle
[NINO] Uh. Sorry to make
things awkward for you.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:28.094 align:middle
I know I really must be
difficult to work with.

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:29.596 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I've worked a ton of jobs,

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.806 align:middle
and every time things go wrong,

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.684 align:middle
it makes me remember
the truth about myself.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle
All I'm really good
at is studying.

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:40.482 align:middle
I'm only a genius,
a top student,

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:44.277 align:middle
and an expertly qualified tutor
to a set of idiotic quintuplets.

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.780 align:middle
Are you just complimenting
yourself, or...?

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:53.119 align:middle
I've never dealt with this.
The whole confession thing.

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.789 align:middle
So I didn't know
how to talk to you.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.166 align:middle
But I'll answer now.
My feelings are--

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.668 align:middle
[NINO]
Wait!

00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle
I know you don't
like me back, okay?

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:05.048 align:middle
How could you after the
way I've treated you?

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.800 align:middle
But don't answer me yet.

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:10.053 align:middle
We're finally working together,
so I'll have more time with you.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:13.556 align:middle
And you can get to know me
for who I am, starting now.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.059 align:middle
I want to prove how
in love with you I am!

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.645 align:middle
You'll see before too long!

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.357 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh-huh.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.903 align:middle
Oh, hey, perfect
timing, you two!

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.863 align:middle
Looks like May just showed up.

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:31.908 align:middle
Okay, Boss, I'll be right over.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.911 align:middle
[SHOP MANAGER]
Heh. What's wrong, Uesugi?

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.913 align:middle
Your face is bright red.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.499 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh, nothing!

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.627 align:middle
[NINO]
Better get ready.

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.713 align:middle
Okay, Fu?

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.342 align:middle
That's May, at the table.

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:50.802 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:57.726 align:middle
[BOTH chuckle]

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.395 align:middle
I'll go on ahead and
take her order, sir!

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.235 align:middle
[FUTARO]
C'mon, we're at work!

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.364 align:middle
[NINO]
Itsuki! What's wrong with you?

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.575 align:middle
How'd you recognize me?

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.246 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Morning.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.374 align:middle
Huh? Oh, Ichika.

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:24.377 align:middle
It's kinda weird how much I run
into you on the way to school.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.962 align:middle
Huh? Is it?

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:27.964 align:middle
Are the other girls
around here somewhere?

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:29.549 align:middle
Oh, no, I just
came to get coffee.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.302 align:middle
I wasn't expecting
to see you! Ha!

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.138 align:middle
Here. I grabbed one for
you too, if you want it.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.306 align:middle
But I thought you
said you weren't

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.184 align:middle
expecting to see me here.

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:42.479 align:middle
And I don't drink
coffee. It's gross.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.522 align:middle
That's okay,
I'll drink it myself.

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.191 align:middle
Mmm! Yummy!

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:49.319 align:middle
[FUTARO]
C'mon, we're running late.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:54.407 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Ugh, I blew it.
I can't do the casual approach.

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:58.620 align:middle
But I could never come right
out with it like Nino, either.

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:03.291 align:middle
I mean, I don't wanna ruin
the relationship we have now.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.671 align:middle
Wait, have you
always worn glasses?

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.632 align:middle
Yeah, duh! You
never noticed that?

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.052 align:middle
So, Teach, do you think they
make me look like I'm smarter?

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:16.388 align:middle
They're kind of a
disguise, actually.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:17.555 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Disguise?

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.015 align:middle
You see, there was
a screening yesterday

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle
for the movie I did a while ago,

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:24.604 align:middle
and it seemed like it got a
decent amount of attention.

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:27.941 align:middle
You remember when I was
filming for that one, right?

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.568 align:middle
[chuckling]

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:33.154 align:middle
So you're wearing glasses
to avoid the paparazzi?

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:35.031 align:middle
Okay, Miss Hollywood!

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.659 align:middle
Don't say it like that,
you're embarrassing me!

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:40.912 align:middle
Well, after all, disguises
are a necessity in your family.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.497 align:middle
Yeah, we're used to them!

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.959 align:middle
And we each carry a bag full
of essentials at all times.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle
I could do Miku or
Yotsuba right now.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.422 align:middle
Oh, or Nino--

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.216 align:middle
[ICHIKA chuckles]

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.843 align:middle
Then again, maybe
I shouldn't do that,

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:57.220 align:middle
since you probably
wouldn't know it was me.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Heh. Don't underestimate me.

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:01.516 align:middle
Why, just the other day,

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle
I saw through Miku's disguise
without a single hint!

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:07.439 align:middle
Huh? You did what?

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:10.734 align:middle
[FUTARO] Hey, look,
it's all of your sisters.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.152 align:middle
[FUTARO chuckles]

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:15.405 align:middle
This is the perfect chance
to demonstrate my skills.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.908 align:middle
One of 'em's chowing down.
I bet that's Itsuki.

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:21.077 align:middle
And Yotsuba's the loud one.

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:22.495 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Please don't.

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.415 align:middle
I was surprised when Nino
got a job where I work,

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.752 align:middle
but then Miku got hired at the
bakery right across the street.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle
That's even stranger!

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:31.421 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Stop it.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle
Because of Miku, they
started losing business,

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:36.051 align:middle
and that made the
boss pretty happy.

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:38.386 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Don't talk about the others!

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.555 align:middle
Hold on!

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:45.226 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Forget them.
Just keep your eyes on me.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.189 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Hey. Do you wanna
skip class together?

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle
No way.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.737 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Huh?

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.322 align:middle
Aw, come on! Why not?

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.783 align:middle
[FUTARO]
'Cause that's truancy!

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle
[FUTARO] Thanks to your temper
tantrum, we're about to be late!

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:07.248 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Ugh! You're no fun, Futaro!

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:10.293 align:middle
[FUTARO] You play hooky from
tutoring enough as it is!

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle
Shape up!

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:16.341 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Play hooky? I've been
going to work, thank you!

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:18.718 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Whew, we made it.

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:21.388 align:middle
Man, I just can't win.

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.014 align:middle
[TSUBAKI] I saw you on
the news this morning!

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:24.057 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
You're an actress?

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.767 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
That's so cool!

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.311 align:middle
[AOI] Who knew we had a
celebrity in our class?

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.522 align:middle
I didn't think it was
that big a movie.

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:31.731 align:middle
Yeah, kinda.

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:34.567 align:middle
Not that I care.

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:36.736 align:middle
Well, congrats on
landing the role.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.280 align:middle
Now you're a professional liar.

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:43.576 align:middle
[ICHIKA] You paid attention
and remembered.

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:47.247 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Is it bad if that's all it takes

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.625 align:middle
to make my heart race like this?

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:52.669 align:middle
That simple thing
means more to me

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:56.423 align:middle
than all this praise from
our classmates put together.

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:59.259 align:middle
Just because it's
coming from you.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.097 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] Hey, Ichika!
I'm heading to the library!

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.598 align:middle
Right behind you!

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:07.851 align:middle
[AOI] Aw, but I wanted
to talk to you more!

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:09.352 align:middle
[TSUBAKI]
Can't you stay a while?

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:12.856 align:middle
Hah. Uh, I have a study group!

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.274 align:middle
[AOI, TSUBAKI]
Huh?

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:17.444 align:middle
Let's figure out which way she
went and track her down!

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:21.865 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Sorry, guys.

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:23.658 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Why are you still at school?

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:24.492 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.578 align:middle
Hurry up, Miku. Let's go.

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:28.288 align:middle
Oh, sure, but it's me.

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:30.457 align:middle
Hard to believe it's
almost release day.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.167 align:middle
Huh? Release day?

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.127 align:middle
You know, Ichika's movie.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.628 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Huh?

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:38.965 align:middle
[FUTARO]
You told me about it yesterday.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Oh. Miku did.

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
A lot happens in one day,

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:49.768 align:middle
since he talks to all
of us, not just me.

00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:53.855 align:middle
I guess I was never going to
be anything special to him.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.359 align:middle
You do what you want,
but I'll still win.

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.903 align:middle
But if I had to step over her...

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:04.324 align:middle
Anyway, stop holding back.
Just do what you want to.

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:11.206 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Hey, Teach-- Um, Futaro?

00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:12.624 align:middle
What's up?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.003 align:middle
I wanted... to say something.

00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle
Ichika, she has
feelings for you.

00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:23.259 align:middle
[gasps]

00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:28.598 align:middle
I think you'd be a cute couple.
I'm rooting for you two.

00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:31.518 align:middle
Are you... kidding?

00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:36.231 align:middle
Nope, not a bit.

00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:10.992 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
"Five Cranes in Return!"
