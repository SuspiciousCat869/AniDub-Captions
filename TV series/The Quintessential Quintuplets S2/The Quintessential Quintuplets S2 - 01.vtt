[FUTARO]
I was having a dream.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.375 align:middle
[GIRL]
Hey, look!

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:20.792 align:middle
Kyoto Station,
we were just there!

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.875 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Whoa! For real?

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:30.667 align:middle
[FUTARO] It was a dream about
that day... when we first met.

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:16.875 align:middle
[sighs]

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.917 align:middle
[FUTARO] The camping trip
was full of disasters.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.958 align:middle
My cold turned into the flu.

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:28.792 align:middle
Which was serious
enough that I wound up

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle
having to be admitted
to the hospital.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:41.375 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I think maybe...

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle
...they all came to visit me.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.375 align:middle
Nah, probably not.

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:51.417 align:middle
[footsteps]

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.042 align:middle
[door opens]

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Nino.

00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle
Nobody's around, right?

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle
Don't just barge in!
This is my room!

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:03.333 align:middle
[NINO]
Yeah, and?

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.958 align:middle
Who do you think is paying
for you to stay here?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.417 align:middle
Yeah, about that.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.125 align:middle
You guys didn't have to get
me the fancy private suite.

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:13.792 align:middle
All the nurses have
been spreading rumors

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:18.167 align:middle
about how I'm the hospital
director's secret love child.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.917 align:middle
What'd you expect?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle
My sisters thought you were
teetering on the brink of death,

00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:24.083 align:middle
so they acted as
quickly as they could.

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:25.958 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Right, but your dad's the one

00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:27.917 align:middle
footing the bill for
all this, isn't he?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.417 align:middle
Exactly!

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.458 align:middle
And that's essentially the same
thing as us paying for it!

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:36.167 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Wow. Talk about out of touch.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.333 align:middle
Anyway, this is a surprise.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:41.083 align:middle
I wasn't expecting you to be
the first person to visit me.

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:42.542 align:middle
Uh.

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:44.042 align:middle
Yeah. Well, I was free.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:45.208 align:middle
--[footsteps]
--[gasps]

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.125 align:middle
[NINO] On second thought,
I'm super busy!

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle
By the way, I was never
here, do you understand?

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:54.292 align:middle
Hey, Uesugi!

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:57.375 align:middle
Was Nino just in here
a minute ago?

00:03:57.458 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle
Yotsuba.

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:02.333 align:middle
Hey, teach! Haven't seen
you since the school trip.

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle
How have you been feeling?

00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:05.667 align:middle
Three of you? Really?

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.458 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Ah! Thank goodness!

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:09.792 align:middle
I'm so glad you're still alive!

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:11.542 align:middle
Heh. Well, yeah.

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:14.125 align:middle
What, did you come to
pay your respects?

00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:17.792 align:middle
Ah! I can definitely
smell Nino in here.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.167 align:middle
[YOTSUBA sniffing]

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.375 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Wow, is her BO really that bad?

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle
It must suck to be her.

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.333 align:middle
[NINO]
It's my perfume!

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:26.667 align:middle
To tell the truth,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.667 align:middle
you did have us kinda
worried for a while there.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.417 align:middle
Your temperature
climbed up so high,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.375 align:middle
we were afraid you might
not make it through.

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:36.375 align:middle
I'm happy you're feeling better.

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle
You can call us
if you get lonely.

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle
We'll come right over
and take care of you.

00:04:40.583 --> 00:04:44.333 align:middle
That's nice, but I'd rather
be by myself, so-- Ah!

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:47.333 align:middle
Stop it, Futaro.
You're being a jerk again.

00:04:47.417 --> 00:04:50.208 align:middle
Also, here. I grabbed all
the printouts from class.

00:04:50.292 --> 00:04:52.917 align:middle
Sorry it took me a while
to drop them off.

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.083 align:middle
[groans]

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:58.292 align:middle
I guess you're still going then?

00:04:58.375 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle
[grunts]

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.292 align:middle
Yeah.

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:06.583 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I think... I might quit school.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle
Heh. So you're showing a
little commitment for once.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:13.083 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Hey! You've got a
crappy way of saying thank you!

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:14.792 align:middle
[FUTARO laughs]

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.292 align:middle
[ICHIKA] I always thought
school was boring.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.542 align:middle
That quitting would
be easy to do.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.125 align:middle
But I think I'll stay a while.

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle
There's something I
can't leave behind.

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle
You're insensitive, stubborn,
and downright mean.

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:34.542 align:middle
So why...

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:39.167 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
...does it have to be you?

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.958 align:middle
[MIKU]
Do you not like hospital food?

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:45.458 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uhh...

00:05:45.542 --> 00:05:47.625 align:middle
If you'd asked me, I would've
cooked something for you.

00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:49.167 align:middle
[FUTARO groans]

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.875 align:middle
You know, suddenly my
appetite's all gone.

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.417 align:middle
[MIKU]
You should eat.

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:57.083 align:middle
Ahh.

00:05:57.167 --> 00:05:58.667 align:middle
Hey.

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:02.875 align:middle
Miku's right, you need to
keep your strength up.

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.625 align:middle
[grunting] Seriously?

00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle
[ICHIKA, MIKU giggle]

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:09.083 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
A-ha! There you are!

00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:10.875 align:middle
What are you, a dog?
Hey, watch it!

00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.417 align:middle
--Let go of me!
--We should let him rest!

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.833 align:middle
[YOTSUBA laughs]

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:16.875 align:middle
All right then, guess
we'll see you later.

00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.125 align:middle
Hope you get to feeling
better real soon, Futaro.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle
Hang on.

00:06:25.583 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle
That's weird. I do
feel a bit better.

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle
[MARUO] You're supposed
to be discharged tomorrow,

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:34.625 align:middle
right, Uesugi?

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.083 align:middle
Yeah.

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:38.667 align:middle
[MARUO] Aren't you worried
about your studies?

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.167 align:middle
Nah, not really.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.083 align:middle
I can keep my grades up,
but I am concerned

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle
about this gaggle of
idiots I have to teach.

00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:48.542 align:middle
[sighs]

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.625 align:middle
Is that so?

00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:52.542 align:middle
Well, your exam's all done.

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.125 align:middle
[NINO]
Would you stop shoving me?

00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:55.292 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.083 align:middle
[MIKU] You shouldn't
yell in a hospital.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.917 align:middle
[NINO] I can't help it!
I'm really tense right now!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.833 align:middle
[GIRLS chattering]

00:07:00.917 --> 00:07:02.625 align:middle
Speaking of which...

00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:04.458 align:middle
I guess I should probably
tell 'em "thanks"

00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:06.542 align:middle
for coming to see me.

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:08.208 align:middle
Jeez, it's just a dumb needle.

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle
You'll never get your ears
pierced if you're too scared.

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Needle?

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle
Oh! Uesugi!

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle
I shoulda known. You came
here for something else.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:21.417 align:middle
Well, yeah, duh.
Our vaccinations.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.208 align:middle
We get them every year
around this time.

00:07:24.292 --> 00:07:26.708 align:middle
[MIKU] But Itsuki and Nino
try to run away.

00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:28.917 align:middle
[NINO]
So? I just hate pain!

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.208 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
It's nice that we could stop by

00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:33.833 align:middle
and see Uesugi in the
same trip, though, huh?

00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:35.667 align:middle
I get it.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.042 align:middle
You selfish meatheads! You suck!

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:41.375 align:middle
[ORDERLY A] Sir! Please
don't yell in the hospital!

00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:43.333 align:middle
You're sick! Go and
get back into bed!

00:07:43.417 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle
Okay.

00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:50.667 align:middle
Uesugi, I expect nothing
but the very best from you.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.083 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.708 align:middle
[FUTARO] That's funny.
He seems so familiar.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:05.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
It was years ago...

00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:07.458 align:middle
...but the scene is
burned into my brain

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle
as if it happened yesterday.

00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:11.708 align:middle
[GIRL]
Hm?

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:13.333 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Right, that was...

00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:16.917 align:middle
[GIRL]
Futaro Uesugi!

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.958 align:middle
Bye-bye!

00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:20.542 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.792 align:middle
Why did... I think of that?

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.208 align:middle
[grunting]

00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:34.083 align:middle
[FUTARO sighs]

00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:36.833 align:middle
Oh, good, it's just you.
You startled me.

00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:39.542 align:middle
What? You're the one
who's acting scary, not me!

00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:41.875 align:middle
Aren't your sisters
looking for you?

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle
[ITSUKI chuckles]

00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:44.875 align:middle
Nah, not that I know of!

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.042 align:middle
Anyway, I came here
to ask you something.

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.667 align:middle
Tell me honestly.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle
What's your real reason
for studying so hard?

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:58.167 align:middle
I guess because it's my job to
as a student. That's all.

00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:02.792 align:middle
What's wrong with you?

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle
I'm gonna stare you down

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:06.042 align:middle
until you give me a
better answer than that!

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:07.542 align:middle
Okay.

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle
Then I'm just gonna
keep staring at you

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:11.417 align:middle
until you can't take it anymore!

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.083 align:middle
All right, fine, you do that!

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:15.875 align:middle
Whichever person quits
staring first is the loser!

00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle
Ah, young love.

00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:18.958 align:middle
So precious.

00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:23.083 align:middle
I refuse to leave this
room until you answer me.

00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle
Ugh, gimme a break here.

You gotta let Sanada be part

They're close. They have
been for years now.

and their parents are friends.

Hey, Uesugi, I think
I know a way to help.

00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:03.875 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?

00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.917 align:middle
When all of us were
still little girls,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle
our mother taught us
how we could tell.

00:17:08.583 --> 00:17:11.958 align:middle
She said, when you're in doubt,
your love will show you the way!

00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle
And how is that
supposed to help me?

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.708 align:middle
Can we take our hair down now?

00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:20.417 align:middle
You're acting even weirder than
usual today, you know that?

00:17:24.292 --> 00:17:26.125 align:middle
I smell shampoo.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle
Back off, creep.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.417 align:middle
Pervert!

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.667 align:middle
A-ha! I need you girls
to do something!

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.917 align:middle
Look me in the eye
and say "pervert"!

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.917 align:middle
[GIRLS groan]

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.333 align:middle
Easy.

00:17:41.417 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle
You're a worthless pervert
who can go die in a fire.

00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:45.333 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Nope.

00:17:45.417 --> 00:17:47.792 align:middle
I don't remember it burning a
hole in my soul the first time.

00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:50.208 align:middle
You can also tell us
apart by our moles.

00:17:50.292 --> 00:17:51.583 align:middle
That's perfect!

00:17:51.667 --> 00:17:54.125 align:middle
Show me yours then! Where is it?

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle
[MIKU gasps]

00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:57.625 align:middle
[MIKU]
Uh... Um.

00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle
[MIKU] If you wanna see,
I guess I'll show you.

00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:04.208 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.958 align:middle
If you didn't notice a
mole when it happened,

00:18:06.042 --> 00:18:07.792 align:middle
then what good is
that gonna do you?

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:09.292 align:middle
Oh, yeah, good point.

00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:10.875 align:middle
Wait, Futaro.

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.792 align:middle
There's actually a
distinct possibility

00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle
that none of us is
the culprit, after all.

00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:16.625 align:middle
How's that possible?

00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:18.792 align:middle
Don't freak out, okay?

00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:21.958 align:middle
We lied to you.
We have another sister.

00:18:22.042 --> 00:18:23.833 align:middle
Her name is Mutsumi!

00:18:23.917 --> 00:18:24.667 align:middle
[gasps]

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.333 align:middle
Do we really?

00:18:26.417 --> 00:18:29.042 align:middle
So where's Mutsumi right now?

00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle
[ICHIKA chuckles]

00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:31.708 align:middle
In a secret room.
It's a place...

00:18:31.792 --> 00:18:34.417 align:middle
'Kay, well, that's BS.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.167 align:middle
The face thing is getting me
nowhere, but that's okay.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.417 align:middle
It's time for plan B!

00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:43.333 align:middle
[FUTARO]
This problem set has questions

00:18:43.417 --> 00:18:45.333 align:middle
from those exams that I found.

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle
Whoever scores the
lowest is our girl.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.958 align:middle
Why do we have to do
all this extra work?

00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:53.958 align:middle
[YOTSUBA groans]

00:18:54.042 --> 00:18:55.958 align:middle
This is really useless.

00:18:56.042 --> 00:19:00.042 align:middle
You're so pushy today,
It's worse than normal.

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:01.417 align:middle
[ICHIKA chuckles]

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.542 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
You'll never win now, Futaro.

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:07.625 align:middle
I panicked and kicked
you out in a hurry,

00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle
so you didn't get
a good look at me.

00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:13.375 align:middle
And this exam won't
help, either.

00:19:13.458 --> 00:19:16.417 align:middle
I let my guard down the
day we took those tests,

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.333 align:middle
but I can do better if I try.

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:22.792 align:middle
Sorry, sisters, but you'll just
have to struggle through it.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.583 align:middle
[ICHIKA gasps]

00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Wait, I get it!

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:31.625 align:middle
He's using this as a chance
to compare our handwriting!

00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:34.917 align:middle
Not a bad move, teach.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.417 align:middle
Almost got me.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.417 align:middle
My hair's the shortest,
so it dries the fastest.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.083 align:middle
I wish I'd had more time
to get dressed, though.

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:48.667 align:middle
'Kay! I'm all finished!

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.125 align:middle
[ICHIKA] You don't pay
enough attention to girls,

00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:54.208 align:middle
which is why you won't win.

00:19:54.292 --> 00:19:55.792 align:middle
Huh.

00:19:57.333 --> 00:19:59.833 align:middle
So you're the guilty party.

00:19:59.917 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle
What the--? But how?

00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:04.458 align:middle
I changed up my handwriting!

00:20:04.542 --> 00:20:07.042 align:middle
Right here. The letter B.

00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle
You're the only one who
writes it in cursive.

00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:13.458 align:middle
I don't know you girls well
enough to pick out your faces,

00:20:13.542 --> 00:20:14.792 align:middle
but I've seen your handwriting

00:20:14.875 --> 00:20:18.458 align:middle
more times than
I ever wanted to.

00:20:18.542 --> 00:20:20.792 align:middle
You... You found me out!

00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:23.292 align:middle
[FUTARO laughing]

00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:24.583 align:middle
Uh, hey.

00:20:24.667 --> 00:20:27.333 align:middle
Not that it matters,
but we finished ours, too.

00:20:27.417 --> 00:20:30.792 align:middle
Very well. Let's see
how you all did.

00:20:32.292 --> 00:20:36.167 align:middle
[FUTARO] Itsuki writes "so"
the same as the culprit does.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.708 align:middle
Nino's "mon" radical matches.

00:20:38.792 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle
Miku's four.

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:43.625 align:middle
And Yotsuba's kanji suffix.

00:20:43.708 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle
Every one of them lines up!

00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:47.333 align:middle
[growls]

00:20:47.417 --> 00:20:52.625 align:middle
And that tells me each of you
dunces failed a different exam!

00:20:52.708 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle
We're busted.

00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:55.875 align:middle
Thanks a lot, Ichika.

00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:59.083 align:middle
You were supposed to hide our
tests before he came over here!

00:20:59.167 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle
Oops.

00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle
I get sick once and
it all falls apart.

00:21:03.083 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle
This is a lost cause.

00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:06.833 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Uesugi.

00:21:06.917 --> 00:21:08.542 align:middle
I know the real reason
you were trying

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:10.375 align:middle
to figure out who was who.

00:21:10.458 --> 00:21:12.667 align:middle
It must have something to do
with that mysterious girl

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.458 align:middle
you met in Kyoto five
years ago, right?

00:21:15.542 --> 00:21:20.083 align:middle
You think it's one of us and
you want to find out for sure.

00:21:21.417 --> 00:21:23.375 align:middle
Yeah, that's it.

00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:25.958 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Why are you buying so many?

00:21:26.042 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle
[GIRL] 'Cause maybe they'll
make me try five times harder!

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:33.708 align:middle
I want to be a good
example for everyone else!

Raise your hand if we
met a long time ago.

Huh?

00:21:45.583 --> 00:21:47.167 align:middle
[NINO]
Where'd that come from?

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.375 align:middle
[MIKU]
I'm confused.

00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:51.583 align:middle
I guess I should've known.

00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:55.125 align:middle
That girl wasn't an idiot,
so it's just not possible.

00:21:55.208 --> 00:21:57.875 align:middle
Hey! You don't have
to be a jerk about it!

00:21:57.958 --> 00:21:59.208 align:middle
[FUTARO]
But it's true.

00:21:59.292 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle
Your scores were so awful,
you hid them from me.

00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:05.125 align:middle
We're spending all
day on review.

00:22:05.208 --> 00:22:06.708 align:middle
Itsuki.

00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:07.917 align:middle
Hm?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.125 align:middle
You didn't do that
on purpose, did you?

00:22:11.208 --> 00:22:12.583 align:middle
[FUTARO wheezes]

00:22:12.667 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle
I don't care about
you anymore, Futaro.

00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:16.542 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh! I'm sorry!

00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:18.083 align:middle
[YOTSUBA laughs]

00:22:18.167 --> 00:22:21.708 align:middle
It looks like you might have
some studying to do, too, huh?

00:22:21.792 --> 00:22:23.625 align:middle
[YOTSUBA laughing]

00:22:23.708 --> 00:22:25.958 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Now that I take a closer look,

00:22:26.042 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle
quintuplets can have all
kinds of differences.

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:33.542 align:middle
But for now, I don't
think there's any hope

00:22:33.625 --> 00:22:35.125 align:middle
of me telling these girls apart

00:22:35.208 --> 00:22:37.583 align:middle
without looking at
their handwriting.
