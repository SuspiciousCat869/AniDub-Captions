00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:15.181 align:middle
So, fine, let's sort this out.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:19.102 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh. Did she not hear me?

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.688 align:middle
That's awesome, thank you!

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.481 align:middle
[FUTARO] Hey! You can't
come on this side!

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:24.941 align:middle
It's a mixed bath,
right? Who cares?

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:25.942 align:middle
I do, okay?

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.527 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
What's your problem?

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.779 align:middle
Come on, we're friends,
it doesn't have to be weird.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.031 align:middle
[gasps]

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.826 align:middle
No, you're right, this is weird.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.329 align:middle
I'm sorry. Can we just
forget this ever happened?

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.541 align:middle
I still have something important
that I need you to do.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.543 align:middle
Focus on that.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Father?

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.962 align:middle
[MARUO]
Hm?

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.631 align:middle
Mind if I talk to you
for a few minutes?

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.674 align:middle
What about?

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.093 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Well, the thing is...

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.805 align:middle
[FUTARO] Good. Once I get past
here, it's smooth sailing.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.392 align:middle
All I need to do is confront
them one at a time.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.394 align:middle
That should be enough
to help me identify

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.855 align:middle
which one is the fake Itsuki.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.149 align:middle
I'm sure they're
not busy, anyway.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:13.031 align:middle
Ichika. Nino. Miku. Yotsuba.
Ready or not, here I come!

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:14.115 align:middle
[wheezes]

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.117 align:middle
[gasps]

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle
[grunts]

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.453 align:middle
[gasps]

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.459 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Itsuki army!

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.379 align:middle
[FUTARO] Why are all five
of you dressed as Itsuki?

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle
Wow, Futaro. You ever
heard of knocking?

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle
I think we scared him.

00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:33.468 align:middle
We're trying to--

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.428 align:middle
[NINO]
Perfect timing.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:38.473 align:middle
I wanted to run this
experiment again, anyway.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.976 align:middle
I'm sure you remember the
quintuplets game, right?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle
Try to figure out
which of us is which.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.106 align:middle
Bet you can't do it.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle
Just an introduction?

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:54.447 align:middle
I'm Itsuki, born on May 5th.
Seventeen, blood type A.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.616 align:middle
What are my favorite things?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.451 align:middle
Well, I'm usually at my happiest

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.663 align:middle
whenever I'm eating
some delicious food.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.498 align:middle
Uh! Uesugi!

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:07.085 align:middle
It's rude to ask a girl such
personal questions!

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle
[FUTARO] Damn it. They're not
making this easy at all!

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:15.593 align:middle
So, uh, if you're
done asking me stuff--

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:19.681 align:middle
Just one more thing. What's
with the Itsuki disguises?

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.641 align:middle
Listen, I can explain.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:24.352 align:middle
I should warn you,
it's kind of a long story.

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:25.937 align:middle
But, uh...

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:29.024 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I think this one might be...

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.735 align:middle
[FAKE ITSUKI 4] The five of us
grew up looking identical.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.863 align:middle
Everyone could tell that we
were tight-knit siblings.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:38.324 align:middle
And us being so alike made
our grandpa happy, too.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:39.868 align:middle
But then, one day,

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:43.121 align:middle
I decided to change it up and
dress a little differently.

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.623 align:middle
Yeah? How did you
change your look?

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle
Oh, that's when I started
wearing my green ribbon! Ah!

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.128 align:middle
Aha! Yotsuba!

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:53.381 align:middle
What?! No way!
I'm totally Itsuki!

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.799 align:middle
[FUTARO]
She's the worst liar,

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:58.094 align:middle
so I figured it would be
easy, but not that easy.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.722 align:middle
Um, can I finish
the story as her, though?

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.558 align:middle
Yeah, that's fine.
Pick up where you left off.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.851 align:middle
[YOTSUBA sighs]

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:07.228 align:middle
When he saw we were
becoming more different,

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:10.523 align:middle
it was a little upsetting
for our grandfather.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.526 align:middle
He thought that we might've
had a falling-out.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.529 align:middle
He collapsed one day
and gave us a scare.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.031 align:middle
When that happened,

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:21.326 align:middle
we decided we'd always be
identical sisters around him.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle
And after talking it over,

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.623 align:middle
we agreed that we
would all be Itsuki.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.793 align:middle
Ever since we found out we were
coming here for spring break,

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.713 align:middle
I've been nervous about whether
or not I could pull it off.

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.757 align:middle
Is that what's been
bothering you?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle
[YOTSUBA chuckles]

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.426 align:middle
Everyone was
having a good time,

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle
so I was trying not
to bring it up.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:44.766 align:middle
You do all that for him, huh?
He's so cranky, though.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.184 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
No.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:50.563 align:middle
Our grandpa's a nice old man,
and I love him a lot.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.857 align:middle
[FUTARO]
It may seem silly to me,

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.859 align:middle
but it's a big deal for them.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.444 align:middle
[NINO]
Well?

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle
You think you can tell us apart
now that you've talked to us?

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:00.281 align:middle
Yeah.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:02.992 align:middle
Uh-oh...

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:06.496 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Which one did I talk to last?
I had it a second ago!

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.664 align:middle
[NINO sighs]

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.416 align:middle
I figured. You really
still can't do it.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.376 align:middle
Hold on, give me one more try!

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.961 align:middle
[knocking]

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle
Oh, hey, Grandpa!

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.173 align:middle
Morning!

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.675 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER mumbles]

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:19.676 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uh, what?

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle
[MIKU]
He seems kinda concerned.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:26.266 align:middle
Aw, don't worry. We're still
five identical best buddies!

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.643 align:middle
[GIRLS laughing]

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:29.936 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Thank goodness.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.273 align:middle
I'd be in real trouble if
that'd been their dad!

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle
Wait, if the fake Itsuki's here,

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.569 align:middle
then she probably has
a bruise, right?

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.863 align:middle
I shoved her by accident.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.074 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle
Whoa. What the--?

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.579 align:middle
Um, please don't!

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.456 align:middle
What are you doing?

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.082 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.752 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Bingo!

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.546 align:middle
This is the one from last night.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle
Guys, let's go to the main hall!

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:05.722 align:middle
Hey, Ichika, you feel
like a morning bath?

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.599 align:middle
Okay, sure.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.437 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Well, that was slightly helpful.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.315 align:middle
But still, they passed
their term finals,

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.526 align:middle
so why cut me off like that?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.235 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.737 align:middle
May I speak with you?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.781 align:middle
Uh... Yotsuba?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle
[FAKE ITSUKI grumbles]

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle
Here's a hint.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:26.451 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Nino.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:27.911 align:middle
How about now?

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.288 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Oh! Ichika!

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.582 align:middle
Oh, right! You must be
the real Itsuki!

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.084 align:middle
Don't play with me.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.961 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I swear, I'm not!

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.297 align:middle
[NINO] Uh, let me know
if you're itchy anywhere.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:43.051 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Sheesh, that's
really not necessary.

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:46.388 align:middle
Now, dish, why are you
sucking up to me so much?

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:50.266 align:middle
Well, I figured you would be
the best person to ask...

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.143 align:middle
...about dating.

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.395 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:56.648 align:middle
[NINO] I can't talk to
the others about it...

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.067 align:middle
...but I kinda like someone.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.444 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Where's everyone else?

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.029 align:middle
Man, I could eat a horse.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.782 align:middle
[stomach growls]

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:10.328 align:middle
I require sustenance.
Would she say that?

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:12.706 align:middle
If I don't eat, I'll die!

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.709 align:middle
Mh-hm! I nailed it that time.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.293 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
So, anyway, the five of us

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.629 align:middle
went to buy some curtains.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:20.672 align:middle
But since all of us...

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.465 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Come on, Uesugi.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.426 align:middle
How long do you need me
to keep his attention?

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.762 align:middle
Ugh, I haven't even
had any breakfast yet!

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:31.057 align:middle
If I don't eat, I'll die!

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.768 align:middle
[FAKE ITSUKI] You must've been
surprised to see our dad.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.311 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Yeah.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.147 align:middle
[FAKE ITSUKI] I accidentally
wrote the address to his place

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.025 align:middle
on the entry form
for the contest.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:43.611 align:middle
But at least it means we
all get to be here together.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle
[FUTARO]
So it's Miku.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.781 align:middle
I wouldn't have
guessed by looking.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:48.158 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Love is the key!

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.325 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.077 align:middle
[FUTARO]
But what if I'm wrong?

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:54.372 align:middle
Love is the answer!
I just have to try harder!

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.625 align:middle
Itsuki says there must be
something bothering Miku, too.

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.961 align:middle
I have a pretty good
guess as to what it is,

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:02.714 align:middle
and it's something that
happened last month.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.717 align:middle
I have to solve this puzzle.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.218 align:middle
Ugh, what's with me?

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:10.889 align:middle
Since when did I let myself
worry about crap like this?

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle
[MIKU] Why do I feel like he's
giving me a creeper stare?

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:16.853 align:middle
[sighs]

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:20.357 align:middle
I give up. Stop being
stubborn and tell me.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.067 align:middle
That's against the rules.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.444 align:middle
You can figure it
out for yourself.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:28.031 align:middle
I would like you to get it
right. Please, Futaro?

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.908 align:middle
Well, could you at least
show me your legs?

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.951 align:middle
Where'd that come from?

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:34.788 align:middle
Huh? Grandpa.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.122 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh?

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.918 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER mumbling]

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:40.794 align:middle
Sorry?

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.253 align:middle
I heard you.

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:45.006 align:middle
This is the second time that
you've tried to touch her.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.174 align:middle
[FUTARO chuckles]

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle
I didn't this time, I swear!

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER] Miku,
are you all right, my dear?

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.849 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER grumbles]

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.440 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hm?

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:05.485 align:middle
Wait a minute. He knew she
was Miku at first glance!

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.612 align:middle
Hey. Let's catch up later!

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:08.988 align:middle
[MIKU]
Uh.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.245 align:middle
Wait! Old man--I mean, sir!
Teach me your ways!

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.582 align:middle
I wanted to ask for your advice.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:23.586 align:middle
Things were rocky at first,
but as I got to know him,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.964 align:middle
I slowly fell in love.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.883 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Please, Nino,
don't tell me any more.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:31.428 align:middle
He's so...

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.763 align:middle
Oh, gosh! It's hard
to say it out loud!

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.558 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I can guess.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:40.228 align:middle
[NINO] The other day,
I confessed my feelings to him.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.606 align:middle
But I still can't say for sure
whether that was the right move.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.108 align:middle
You're good with this stuff!

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.695 align:middle
When guys confess, do you
end up liking them more?

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:52.198 align:middle
Well, in my experience,
let's see...

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.287 align:middle
Sorry, it's never gone
that way for me.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.414 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I have feelings for him, too.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.917 align:middle
I just want things to stay the
way they are for a bit longer.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.254 align:middle
Oh, so confessing
isn't enough. Huh.

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.715 align:middle
Huh? No, that's not it!

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.343 align:middle
You said that it was
rocky at first, right?

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.804 align:middle
So are you sure you're
actually in love with him?

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.223 align:middle
I just meant, he first
came into my life

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:20.477 align:middle
as a threat to something
that was precious to me.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.062 align:middle
But then, one night,

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle
I mistook him for my prince
charming on a white horse,

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.734 align:middle
and I fell in love with him.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.362 align:middle
Later on, I figured out
what I was rejecting

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:33.865 align:middle
was the role he had been playing
in my life that entire time,

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.992 align:middle
and not him as a person.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle
Once I realized he
really was my prince,

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:42.165 align:middle
well, I just couldn't
control myself.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.833 align:middle
Uh-huh.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:48.004 align:middle
So you fell in love
just like that?

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:51.299 align:middle
Don't you think that's
a little much?

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.259 align:middle
It probably is.

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:56.471 align:middle
Trust me, I'm just as creeped
out by it as you.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.766 align:middle
But I'm not planning on
giving up on him, either.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.977 align:middle
I mean, they're my
feelings, after all.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:06.106 align:middle
And what's the point of love
if it doesn't make me happy?

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:09.901 align:middle
Um, yeah, but what if someone
else likes the same guy?

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.778 align:middle
For all you know that person
could care about him

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:14.447 align:middle
a lot more than you
do, couldn't they?

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle
In that case,
I guess... I'd feel bad.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:22.455 align:middle
But if I had to step over
them, well, then I would.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.374 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Wow, she's serious.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.961 align:middle
She's an unstoppable
freight train of love!

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.337 align:middle
Why'd she ask me for advice

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.549 align:middle
if she's just gonna do
whatever she wants?

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.968 align:middle
[NINO]
I'm glad I talked to you, sis.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.554 align:middle
Guess I need to do
more than confess.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.598 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Huh? What are you gonna do?

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.559 align:middle
[NINO] I think I'll
take him by the hand.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.977 align:middle
No, I'll hug him.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.312 align:middle
And if he still
doesn't take the hint,

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:47.731 align:middle
then I'll kiss him!

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:51.985 align:middle
Huh?! Wait, that's a bad idea!
He might not like it!

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:55.697 align:middle
Yeah, good point.
I shouldn't spring that on him.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle
If I'm bad at it,
he'll be turned off.

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.953 align:middle
Hey, have you done
any kissing scenes yet?

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.788 align:middle
Um, what are you suggesting?

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.999 align:middle
[NINO] Come on, it's okay!
We're sisters!

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle
[ICHIKA] That's exactly
what makes it not okay!

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.138 align:middle
I'm gonna sneak out
at night to see him.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.265 align:middle
I can't stay away.

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.267 align:middle
And I know Dad'll be a problem.

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:28.772 align:middle
That's why I need you to keep
an eye on him for me, Ichika.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.858 align:middle
[ICHIKA] Nino's going to
meet up with Futaro tonight.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.736 align:middle
And it sounds like she
might even kiss him.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.156 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I can't stop her.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.283 align:middle
She's not a coward like me.

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.619 align:middle
She doesn't care
what anyone thinks.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:46.498 align:middle
She loves him with
everything she has.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:51.836 align:middle
I don't stand a chance...
and I don't deserve to.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.465 align:middle
Gotta hit the little
girls' room!

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle
Ichika.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.514 align:middle
You okay?

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:03.848 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:10.188 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Aw, hey. Please don't cry.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle
Ooh, I know. Let's go
to our secret place!

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.278 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Uh! There's Dad.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:18.863 align:middle
[YOTSUBA giggles]

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:22.575 align:middle
He'd never expect us to be up
here, not in a million years!

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:23.993 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
What do I do?

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle
I was supposed to distract him
so Nino could sneak out.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.915 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Um... Ichika?

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.208 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.503 align:middle
I don't know what's
going on, but I...

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.755 align:middle
[YOTSUBA sneezes]

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.967 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.136 align:middle
You knew it'd be cold out.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:44.347 align:middle
You should've bundled
up a little more.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.391 align:middle
Uh-oh. Let's blow your nose.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.936 align:middle
Thanks, but I think I
can handle that myself!

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.065 align:middle
Heh. You act like
a little kid sometimes.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:55.358 align:middle
But thank you.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.944 align:middle
I understand that you're
trying to cheer me up.

00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.946 align:middle
I'm okay, really.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.365 align:middle
I need to go get
Dad's attention.

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.909 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Wait, you're acting tough.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:05.952 align:middle
It worries me.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.871 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.623 align:middle
Sorry if I'm way off base.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.085 align:middle
Where did everyone run off to?

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:16.838 align:middle
They better not be
with Futaro right now.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.173 align:middle
[ITSUKI laughs]

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:21.092 align:middle
[ITSUKI] There's no reason
to see him at this hour.

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:25.263 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Then again, it happened before.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:30.477 align:middle
[ITSUKI] Miku. There's no use
in sitting around waiting.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.646 align:middle
Do you want to go to
the bath for a while?

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.273 align:middle
Ever since we got here,

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:37.942 align:middle
I've been thinking
of the old days a lot.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:41.279 align:middle
You know, about how
scary Grandpa used to be.

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:42.947 align:middle
Or how Mom would always scold us

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle
whenever we stirred up
some kind of trouble.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:49.162 align:middle
Heh. You've been a
troublemaker since day one.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:50.955 align:middle
Nah, who are you kidding?

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:54.167 align:middle
You used to get into more
trouble than any of us.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.877 align:middle
Oh? You think so?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.046 align:middle
Don't say that! You remember!

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.382 align:middle
Even though we were
so similar back then,

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:03.635 align:middle
you were the biggest bully
of the family for sure!

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:06.721 align:middle
You took away my candy
so many times, I lost count!

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:08.556 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Oh, sorry.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.266 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] The stickers you
had on your school bag

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle
were stolen from my collection!

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Oops.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.146 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] And every time
I made a new friend,

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.108 align:middle
I would see them talking
to you later instead!

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:21.069 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I seriously used to do that?

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:24.781 align:middle
Well, I mean, we've all grown up
a lot since then, Yotsuba.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle
I dunno, it's weird.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:29.369 align:middle
I still feel like I'm a kid
after all these years.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.788 align:middle
Why did you grow up
so much faster than us?

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:32.956 align:middle
[gasps]

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.666 align:middle
Because...

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:39.254 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
After Mom passed away,

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:43.425 align:middle
I noticed how much
pain Itsuki was in.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:46.928 align:middle
There was no choice.
I had to be the big sister.

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:51.599 align:middle
I know, and I'm so
glad we have you.

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:54.019 align:middle
I've been meaning
to say this to you.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.771 align:middle
When we were kids,
you were kind of a meanie.

00:14:56.855 --> 00:15:00.442 align:middle
Always wanting to take
things from other people.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle
But on the other hand,
you were the leader.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle
We may be quintuplets,

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:10.368 align:middle
but you've always
been my big sister.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.122 align:middle
So, uh--

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:17.751 align:middle
Oh, whoops. Forgot what
I was gonna say.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.005 align:middle
Anyway, stop holding back.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:25.842 align:middle
Just do what you
want to, all right?

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.762 align:middle
But what is that, I wonder?

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:32.766 align:middle
I thought I wanted these
days to last forever.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:35.060 align:middle
Because it felt better to
stay in my comfort zone

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:38.063 align:middle
as long as I could.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:40.732 align:middle
But what I really hoped...

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.985 align:middle
...was that nobody would ever
take him away from me.

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:45.236 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Hm?

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:50.617 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Wait, what?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.993 align:middle
[ICHIKA sighs]

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:54.204 align:middle
Sorry, but I'm
pretty cold myself.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.998 align:middle
Huh?! After you
let me borrow it?

00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:59.167 align:middle
[ICHIKA laughs]

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.752 align:middle
Let's go back inside, shall we?

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.796 align:middle
Yeah, guess we should.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.924 align:middle
You had to talk to Dad
about something, didn't you?

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:10.595 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Nah. I'm good now.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.974 align:middle
[footsteps]

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:16.351 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.688 align:middle
Uh?

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.067 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Huh?

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.111 align:middle
[MIKU]
What are you doing here?

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:27.654 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Uh...

00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:29.197 align:middle
Itsuki. Miku.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle
Agh! Dammit!
I was gonna say that!

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:33.576 align:middle
You barely beat me to it!

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.745 align:middle
I had it in the bag
this time, I swear!

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.831 align:middle
Hold on. What's this about?

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:40.959 align:middle
[FUTARO] I'm so close!
Give me a little more time!

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.419 align:middle
I talked to your grandfather.

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:45.672 align:middle
He's gonna let me in
on the secret! Huh?

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.799 align:middle
Uh, wait, sir!
Where are you going?

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.426 align:middle
The nerve of this guy.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:52.512 align:middle
I don't know why he's so against
figuring it out for himself.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.389 align:middle
How can he?

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:58.184 align:middle
He can't be expected to tell us
all apart after only six months.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:16:59.811 align:middle
It's too much to ask.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:02.355 align:middle
Listen. This is really
important, sir.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:04.816 align:middle
If there's some kind of trick
to it, please tell me.

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:06.985 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER mumbling]

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:08.570 align:middle
Love.

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:13.491 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER]
If you have love, you can do it.

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle
[FUTARO] So, he's the
one who started that!

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:21.041 align:middle
You pick up on things over time,
like their mannerisms, voices,

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle
the small habits
that set them apart.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:26.963 align:middle
Seeing those details,
that's the same as love.

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.467 align:middle
You wanted to know
the trick? There it is.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.136 align:middle
Were you expecting
an easy answer?

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:36.848 align:middle
What I'd like to know is why
you wanted to learn how.

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.768 align:middle
What is it you hope
to accomplish

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:42.645 align:middle
by telling one girl
from the other?

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.483 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER]
Well, young man,

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle
do you have the commitment
to face them in good faith?

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.493 align:middle
Let's get one thing straight.

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.204 align:middle
Are you the same Itsuki I met
on the first night here?

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle
I am... I just wanted to say--

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.375 align:middle
Hold it.

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:06.294 align:middle
I never did crack the code to
that stupid quintuplets game.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.046 align:middle
You guys win.

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:11.383 align:middle
That being said,
I happen to be a sore loser.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:12.926 align:middle
One more try.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:16.471 align:middle
I'll pick you out even if I
still mess up on the rest.

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.723 align:middle
[FUTARO] The old man said
to face them in good faith,

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:21.935 align:middle
and this is the best
way I can think of.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle
[FUTARO] Itsuki told you
all the details, right?

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:25.814 align:middle
[FAKE ITSUKI]
Yeah.

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle
[FUTARO] Yotsuba's problem has
to do with the vacation itself,

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:32.654 align:middle
so when the trip is over,
she won't have to worry anymore.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.823 align:middle
Besides, you can't be Yotsuba.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:36.741 align:middle
She doesn't have nearly
this much talent

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.201 align:middle
for impersonating people.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:41.079 align:middle
Correct so far.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:44.457 align:middle
And as for Nino,
she wasn't perfect, either.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:47.544 align:middle
She forgot to take
off her nail polish.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.462 align:middle
[MIKU]
Please stop it, Futaro.

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.756 align:middle
There's no point to this.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:57.804 align:middle
Your leg is bruised.
It was you, wasn't it?

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:01.474 align:middle
[MIKU] Oh. I guess it hasn't
healed all the way.

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:02.934 align:middle
Miku.

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle
You were always the most
cooperative out of all of us.

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:08.231 align:middle
Why are you trying to end your
relationship with Uesugi?

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:11.526 align:middle
Well, first off,
I should tell you sorry.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:14.696 align:middle
I kind of panicked because
Grandpa was around.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle
No, that's just an excuse.

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.492 align:middle
I couldn't face him as myself

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.786 align:middle
and tell him that
I'm in love with him.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:22.787 align:middle
I was scared.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.164 align:middle
[ITSUKI gasps]

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.875 align:middle
Wait a minute, so you have
a crush on Uesugi?

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.835 align:middle
Whoa! This is big news!

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.755 align:middle
The other three are gonna be so
freaked out when they hear that!

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.757 align:middle
[MIKU]
Pretty sure everyone knows.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.592 align:middle
Are you sure
that's okay, though?

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:38.636 align:middle
What I mean is, because he is
our teacher and everything.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle
[MIKU]
Exactly.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:43.183 align:middle
Right now, we're
teacher and student.

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:45.935 align:middle
And if our relationship
stays that way forever,

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.605 align:middle
then nothing will change.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:53.443 align:middle
All right, I understand how you
feel, so can you do me a favor?

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.237 align:middle
Go and meet with Uesugi
one last time.

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:59.366 align:middle
[FUTARO] Which means...
you're not Nino, either.

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:00.867 align:middle
Right again.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.119 align:middle
What's been bothering
Nino, though?

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Hmm... It's probably...

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.625 align:middle
Well... it's not
my place to say.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.836 align:middle
That's fair enough.
I'll leave it alone, then.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.589 align:middle
You've gotta be Ichika or Miku.

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.803 align:middle
[FUTARO] If I think of Ichika,
she looks like Ichika.

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:23.473 align:middle
But then... the same
goes for Miku.

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:26.851 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:29.688 align:middle
Forget it! I'm done!
I'll never know!

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:30.563 align:middle
[MIKU]
Huh?

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:33.483 align:middle
Really? Well, that's all right.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.944 align:middle
[MIKU] I don't know
what I was expecting.

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:38.571 align:middle
Hey, could you call her in here?

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:39.823 align:middle
Call who?

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:43.118 align:middle
Oh, come on, you know.
What's her name again?

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:45.537 align:middle
Itsu-- Itsu...

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.664 align:middle
[MIKU]
Oh, now I get it.

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:48.707 align:middle
Itsuki, right, Teach?

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.084 align:middle
[laughs] You fell for it!

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.753 align:middle
There's only one quintuplet
who calls me "Teach!"

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:57.048 align:middle
Which means,
you're definitely Ichika!

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle
[laughs]

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.804 align:middle
You figured me out, after all!

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.849 align:middle
Ugh. This was a huge
waste of time.

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle
Well, I kind of already
suspected it was you,

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:11.312 align:middle
since I didn't know what
was wrong with you.

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.148 align:middle
Wow. Nice job.

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:14.607 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Is it a work thing?

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.776 align:middle
I hear you've been
really busy lately.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.903 align:middle
Yeah, pretty much.

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:22.282 align:middle
I should pack for
the trip home. See ya.

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.284 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER]
You pick up on things over time,

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.745 align:middle
like their mannerisms, voices,

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:28.997 align:middle
the small habits that
set them apart.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.914 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:31.249 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Okay.

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:34.252 align:middle
So this is the only way
I can tell the difference.

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:38.089 align:middle
But hey, that's all right.
It still gets me to the answer.

00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:41.676 align:middle
Fake Itsuki,
your true identity is...

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.720 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER]
Seeing those details,

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:47.599 align:middle
that's the same as love.

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.519 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Miku.

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:58.485 align:middle
[MIKU] Wait, what?
I just told you, I'm Ichika.

00:21:58.568 --> 00:22:00.153 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Oh, sorry.

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle
It might be in my imagination,
but for one second there,

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:08.203 align:middle
I thought... you kinda
looked like Miku.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:12.832 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh?

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:16.586 align:middle
You're right!

00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:27.347 align:middle
I got it?

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.349 align:middle
[MIKU]
Can I ask you a question?

00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:30.433 align:middle
Huh?

00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:31.726 align:middle
[MIKU]
It seemed like you had a hunch

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.895 align:middle
about what was bothering me.

00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:36.564 align:middle
If I hadn't turned out
to be Fake Itsuki,

00:22:36.648 --> 00:22:38.817 align:middle
then what would you
have said it was?

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.694 align:middle
It's kind of an
embarrassing thing to say

00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle
now that I know I had
everything mixed up.

00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:45.615 align:middle
Don't laugh when I tell you.

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle
Valentine's. I never, uh,
gave you anything back.

00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:53.373 align:middle
[MIKU laughs]

00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:55.458 align:middle
Hey, I told you not to laugh!

00:22:55.542 --> 00:22:58.503 align:middle
Anyway, why did you
want me to quit my job?

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:00.422 align:middle
Oh, forget about that.

00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle
Wha--?

00:23:02.173 --> 00:23:04.175 align:middle
[MIKU]
Futaro's a teacher.

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:08.138 align:middle
I'm his student...
and that won't change.

00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:11.599 align:middle
I'm just happy you
finally got it correct.

00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:16.938 align:middle
--[RAIHA] Bye-bye!
--[GIRLS] Goodbye!

00:23:18.148 --> 00:23:21.568 align:middle
My granddaughters are all
I have to live for these days.

00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:24.946 align:middle
Ever since I lost Rena,
that's how I've felt.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.449 align:middle
They should stay
true to themselves.

00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:30.076 align:middle
Make sure to tell them that.

00:23:38.793 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle
You pick up on things over time,
like their mannerisms, voices,

00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:45.759 align:middle
the small habits
that set them apart.

00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:49.304 align:middle
Seeing those details,
that's the same as love.

00:23:49.387 --> 00:23:54.684 align:middle
If that's true, then today
when I guessed Miku right...

00:23:54.768 --> 00:23:57.979 align:middle
Well, regardless, I still
made a brilliant deduction.

00:23:58.063 --> 00:24:00.357 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.566 align:middle
[gasps]

00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:14.245 align:middle
[MIKU]
"Welcome to Class 3-1."
