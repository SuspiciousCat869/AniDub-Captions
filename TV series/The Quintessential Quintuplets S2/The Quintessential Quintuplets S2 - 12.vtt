00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:14.431 align:middle
[MIKU] There's no way he would
ever like someone like me.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.351 align:middle
[NINO]
Why are you being so mopey?

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.021 align:middle
With that attitude,
you've already lost him!

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.523 align:middle
[MIKU]
Ichika's the one I can't beat.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.776 align:middle
She's so pretty and
popular with the boys,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.571 align:middle
and she's got confidence
in herself.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:33.491 align:middle
I mean, if I were a guy,
I would pick her.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.494 align:middle
And then, there's you, too.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.371 align:middle
Thanks a lot.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle
Whatever, I know I'm cute.
I don't need you to say it.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle
If anything, it shows
how stupid he is

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.963 align:middle
for not asking me out as soon
as I confessed my feelings!

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.758 align:middle
Doesn't he know how
much courage it took me?

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.718 align:middle
You confessed to him?

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.179 align:middle
Congratulations. That was brave.

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.598 align:middle
Then I'm guessing you
haven't done that yet.

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.932 align:middle
Trust me, he's not gonna get it

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.143 align:middle
through his thick
skull if you don't.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.062 align:middle
Probably not.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle
I said I'd do it if I
scored the highest,

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.358 align:middle
or if I could bake well.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.778 align:middle
But I was just making excuses
so I could put it off.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:13.782 align:middle
And I can't blame Ichika
for that. All of this was me.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.116 align:middle
[NINO]
All right, fine.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.952 align:middle
Stay in here feeling sorry
for yourself, I guess.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.579 align:middle
Typical Miku.

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle
It's like you and I are
from different planets.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:25.085 align:middle
Still, no matter how
you feel about it,

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.838 align:middle
I consider you a rival.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.966 align:middle
You think you're no
match for me? Really?

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle
That doesn't make any sense!

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.846 align:middle
You had no trouble admitting
that I was cute before,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.599 align:middle
but, Miku, we're
quintuplets, remember?

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.226 align:middle
You look like me!

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.187 align:middle
Which means you're
cute, too, stupid!

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.733 align:middle
[NINO] Don't you think
this is way too short?

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.652 align:middle
[MIKU]
You said you wanted it cut.

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:53.279 align:middle
[NINO] Yeah, but I've never
had that much taken off!

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.824 align:middle
[MIKU]
Don't worry. You look cute.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.201 align:middle
[NINO]
Hmph. You'd better be right.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.953 align:middle
[MIKU]
Yup, super cute.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.663 align:middle
[NINO]
I'm out!

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:06.084 align:middle
I'm sorry. But...

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.920 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Slow down! Where are we going?

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.505 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Just come with me.

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.925 align:middle
You're acting weird,
Miku. What's up?

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.553 align:middle
[ICHIKA] We need to
talk about something.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.431 align:middle
Listen to what Miku says, okay?

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:22.475 align:middle
[ICHIKA] As long as Futaro
knows she has feelings for him,

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.812 align:middle
the lie I told won't
make any sense.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.064 align:middle
I'm pulling out all the stops.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:33.361 align:middle
I need my plan to work,
and this is the only way!

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I'm confused.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.785 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
You've been here, right?

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.663 align:middle
[FUTARO] Yeah, back in
elementary school.

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.832 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Six years ago.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.047 align:middle
I wandered around
this area with Rena,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.217 align:middle
just following her wherever
she wanted to go.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:03:01.556 align:middle
After she told me she needed me,
every part of it was fun.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.435 align:middle
Anyway, before I knew it,
the sun had gone down.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.021 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
And then what happened?

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.981 align:middle
My teacher was supposed
to come and pick me up

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.775 align:middle
at the end of the day.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.234 align:middle
I got to wait in an empty room

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.403 align:middle
at the hotel Rena
was staying at.

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.073 align:middle
I think we played cards.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.284 align:middle
It's just a nice memory.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.412 align:middle
--So, this girl--
--You can stop now.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.581 align:middle
I played along for a while
because I had a feeling

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:30.752 align:middle
you might be plotting something,
but enough of that.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:34.589 align:middle
I'm done playing your
little game, Miku.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.384 align:middle
No. Ichika.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.221 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I thought as much.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.139 align:middle
Ugh. Some timing.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.685 align:middle
So, when I met Miku
in the hallway before...

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:47.811 align:middle
...was that you, too?

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.646 align:middle
Um, no, of course not!

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.856 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Why did you lie to me?

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.113 align:middle
Futaro.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:02.242 align:middle
The girl from six years back...
That girl was one of us.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.619 align:middle
But you figured that
out, didn't you?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Yeah.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle
It was me. It's true.

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle
I was Rena.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:15.005 align:middle
We met here, in Kyoto,
six years ago!

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:18.842 align:middle
I'm not lying. Believe me.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle
[FUTARO]
If that's true,

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle
do you remember which good
luck charm we bought?

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.851 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Yeah! I still have it.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.437 align:middle
I could never forget that.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.689 align:middle
[FUTARO]
No. Liar.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.734 align:middle
I'm sorry. I can't trust
you right now.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.321 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Come on, you'll catch a cold.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.033 align:middle
[ICHIKA crying]

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.827 align:middle
[MAEDA] Ugh! The weather
guy said no rain!

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.538 align:middle
Oh, my. And where have you been?

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.248 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Eh, nowhere.

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.834 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Heh. You got lost, didn't you?

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:55.253 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Hey, what's the plan tomorrow?

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.343 align:middle
Okay, the shower's free.
Sorry for taking it first.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.304 align:middle
Ugh. I'm soaked all
the way to the bone!

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.639 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
You can go next then, Yotsuba.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.433 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Thanks.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.436 align:middle
[NINO]
I'm glad I didn't go outside.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Wow, Itsuki, that's some getup!

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle
Are you gonna wear it?

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.487 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Um, no, I don't think so!

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.947 align:middle
It's too much for me.
I'll probably get rid of it!

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.033 align:middle
[NINO]
Ichika.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:28.578 align:middle
Isn't there something you
wanted to say to Miku?

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.413 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Uh.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.918 align:middle
Look, Ichika, I'm sorry.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle
[knocking]

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:36.878 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Coming in.

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.213 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:41.299 align:middle
Are all of you here?
I have news.

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:44.928 align:middle
We'll all be assembling in the
main hall 30 minutes from now.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.262 align:middle
Why'd they send you?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.807 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Because I'm a class rep.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.106 align:middle
What's the deal?

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.941 align:middle
[MIKU]
Excuse me!

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle
Don't tell me you're
still fighting.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle
What happened today?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.115 align:middle
--[ITSUKI] The thing is...
--[NINO] No.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:08.868 align:middle
Whoo! I feel way better! Uh!

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:09.828 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.705 align:middle
Well, it's not a
big deal, is it?

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.082 align:middle
Of course not. This is
just a normal day for us.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.167 align:middle
That's right, there's
nothing to worry about!

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.044 align:middle
If you say so.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.879 align:middle
Just come out in
like half an hour.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.881 align:middle
We're gonna decide tomorrow's
elective schedule,

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle
so be thinking about that.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.221 align:middle
Um, sorry to speak for you.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:29.264 align:middle
Eh, it's okay.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle
Fu would've worried about us

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.851 align:middle
if you hadn't played
it off like that.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.936 align:middle
You shouldn't have run away!

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.896 align:middle
I know, but--

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.776 align:middle
Miku, you can't keep on
doing this forever, you know.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.195 align:middle
We should clear the air.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.197 align:middle
Obviously, we're all
looking for a chance

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:49.284 align:middle
to be alone with Futaro
during this trip.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:52.328 align:middle
Well, duh, I figured that much
out as soon as we got here.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.789 align:middle
Is that what you're
trying to do, too?

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle
I mean, you're not wrong.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.712 align:middle
At this rate, none of us are
going to get what we want.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.631 align:middle
And all of us hate to see
each other unhappy.

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.301 align:middle
That's funny, coming from you.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.386 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
You listen, too.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.222 align:middle
Um, is he gone now?

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:14.684 align:middle
[ICHIKA] On the last day,
we get an elective field trip.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:18.146 align:middle
We're supposed to choose
one of five destinations.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle
My suggestion is for each of us
to select a different course.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:25.111 align:middle
Only the sister who picks
the same place as Futaro

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.821 align:middle
gets to see him.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.573 align:middle
We'll leave everything
up to luck.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:31.576 align:middle
Sounds good! That way, there
won't be any hard feelings!

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.036 align:middle
I don't like it.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.789 align:middle
We can't do this after we all
made such careful plans.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.958 align:middle
It's one in five!
Those odds are terrible!

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:42.087 align:middle
Actually, I don't know
how I can face Futaro

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.713 align:middle
after what happened
at the shrine.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.758 align:middle
So in my case, it's better
if the odds are lower.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.594 align:middle
If you ask me, going by
luck is the best way.

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.888 align:middle
Why didn't we just do
this from the beginning?

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.849 align:middle
[NINO] Ugh. Let's just
point like usual.

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.268 align:middle
I'm sure we'll all pick
something different.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle
[GIRLS]
And... go!

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.609 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Yo, Uesugi!

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.194 align:middle
Which course are we
picking tomorrow?

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.863 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Let's go with Course E.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.954 align:middle
[TEACHER B]
Course D people, come with me!

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.039 align:middle
[TSUBAKI]
Which one was D again?

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.417 align:middle
That's Honnouji Temple,
the samurai graves,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.584 align:middle
you know, all the history stuff!

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.587 align:middle
Really? That sounds
totally boring!

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.798 align:middle
That's why you gotta
read the descriptions.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:30.844 align:middle
Huh? I didn't know you were
a history buff, Ichika!

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.263 align:middle
Man, my stomach really hurts.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:37.642 align:middle
Over here, Course E!
We're leaving now!

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:39.978 align:middle
[FUTARO, MIKU gasp]

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:45.483 align:middle
[TEACHER A] Attention,
all students on Course E,

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle
we've just arrived at our
destination--the Studio Park.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.782 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Actually, D sounds better.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.577 align:middle
Miku, can we trade?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.663 align:middle
[MIKU] She switched courses
with me at the last minute.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.874 align:middle
Why would she do that?

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.169 align:middle
Ichika was supposed
to be here, not me.

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:06.087 align:middle
[MAEDA]
Where are we headed?

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.506 align:middle
Ah! Miss Nakano! We meet again.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle
Uh...

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.052 align:middle
[TAKEDA chuckles]

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.386 align:middle
[TAKEDA]
Still running away.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.221 align:middle
She probably hates you.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.265 align:middle
Hey! Stop!

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.853 align:middle
That looked like it really
hurt! Sorry, ma'am!

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:31.196 align:middle
[ICHIKA] This is your chance,
Miku, so don't run away.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.616 align:middle
Not that I think this
makes up for what I did.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:38.453 align:middle
Jeez. You gotta learn to
watch where you're going.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.998 align:middle
[MIKU]
Sorry, Nino. I can't do it.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:45.126 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
She's bailing again! Now what?

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:47.671 align:middle
[ICHIKA, NINO]
Try on some traditional

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:51.132 align:middle
and historical clothing here!

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.384 align:middle
What are you up to?

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.718 align:middle
What about you?

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:55.303 align:middle
I faked sick.

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:58.098 align:middle
I wanted to come and keep an eye
on the two of them, that's all.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:01.142 align:middle
Tell the truth! You're here to
screw things up, aren't you?

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.435 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
What? No!

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.938 align:middle
I told the teachers
I had a stomachache!

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:09.109 align:middle
Then again, I can see
why you're suspicious.

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:12.195 align:middle
Listen, I know what
I did was unforgivable.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.322 align:middle
But I still want
to make this right.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:18.368 align:middle
Or fix it as much as I can
before the trip's over.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:20.954 align:middle
It's so nice of you
to come along

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:23.456 align:middle
and help support
Miku, too, Itsuki!

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.751 align:middle
Yotsuba. Are you sure you don't
wanna tell him the truth?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.629 align:middle
He still doesn't know
that girl was you.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:32.882 align:middle
Well, I know it was me.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle
That's the most important
thing here, isn't it?

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.762 align:middle
Hey, look! It's Ichika and Nino!

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.264 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.057 align:middle
You guys are here, too?

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.392 align:middle
What a surprise.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.894 align:middle
Despite everything, we all
came to the same place.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:49.441 align:middle
Typical. We always end up
breaking our own rules, huh?

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.572 align:middle
[NINO] We can't have those
two idiots in the mix.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.574 align:middle
I'll get them out
of the way somehow.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.034 align:middle
Ichika, your job is to get Miku

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.911 align:middle
to try on the traditional
clothes, can you do that?

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.205 align:middle
What? But how is that
supposed to work?

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:06.249 align:middle
I dunno, impersonate her?

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:09.044 align:middle
That's what you're
good at, right?

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.129 align:middle
You're a jerk.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.799 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Excuse me.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.343 align:middle
The traditional clothes,

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle
I'd like to try them
on, too, please.

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.475 align:middle
[FUTARO] Takeda and Maeda
still haven't shown up.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.936 align:middle
And Miku said she'd wait,
but she just sorta vanished.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.105 align:middle
Guess this means I'm on my own.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.815 align:middle
I can't really
blame her, though,

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle
after all that drama
on the first day.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:38.281 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Miku, there you are.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.075 align:middle
Decided to try it, huh?

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.118 align:middle
Honestly, I wasn't
planning on it,

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.372 align:middle
but the workers were
weirdly aggressive.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.874 align:middle
You think it looks silly?

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.293 align:middle
No. You look good.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.712 align:middle
[gasps] Where'd your friends go?

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:54.839 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Your guess is as good as mine.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle
Wherever they are,
they're taking forever.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:58.718 align:middle
[TAKEDA screams]

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:02.514 align:middle
[MAEDA] Uesugi!
Make the monsters go away!

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:04.557 align:middle
[NINO]
Well, that was easy.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:05.725 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:08.311 align:middle
[NINO]
Looks like Ichika did her part.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.774 align:middle
[NINO]
They're a good pair.

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:30.583 align:middle
[MIKU]
Futaro! Take a picture! Hurry!

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.961 align:middle
[FUTARO]
All right, chill out.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.463 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:41.344 align:middle
I'm not gonna let her
take you from me.

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:50.979 align:middle
Uh, sorry.

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.814 align:middle
[giggles]

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle
That's not good.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:57.819 align:middle
She's totally drenched.
Just like we were yesterday!

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:00.155 align:middle
What about her underwear?

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle
[ITSUKI, YOTSUBA gasp]

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle
[MIKU]
That was really clumsy.

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:06.244 align:middle
And you told <i>me</i>
to pay attention.

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:09.039 align:middle
Look, I said I was sorry, okay?

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:13.335 align:middle
I'll go apologize to the staff.
You worry about getting changed.

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.378 align:middle
All right.

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle
[MIKU] We're already talking
like normal again.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.967 align:middle
It's strange
after what happened.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.135 align:middle
I guess when I'm with him,

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:27.182 align:middle
I stop worrying
about silly things.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:30.852 align:middle
Like, for example, not
having any dry underwear!

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.271 align:middle
[MIKU]
Huh? How'd this get here?

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:36.024 align:middle
It says it's from
a lingerie store.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:38.443 align:middle
[MIKU]
Maybe the staff lent it to me?

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.154 align:middle
I guess I'll take them up on it.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.739 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.496 align:middle
How lucky was that?

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.623 align:middle
Good thing you happened
to bring those, huh?

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.041 align:middle
Not sure why, though.

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.043 align:middle
Look, I just wanted to be
prepared for anything,

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:56.711 align:middle
that's all!

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:59.047 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Still no sign of the guys.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.424 align:middle
Where did they go?

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.301 align:middle
Uh. What's the matter?

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:04.469 align:middle
[MIKU gasps]

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:08.306 align:middle
[MIKU] I'm a little tired.
Can we sit down?

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle
There, that ought to do it.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.603 align:middle
'Kay. I'm back now.
So how are things going?

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:17.148 align:middle
Not bad. They seem fine.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
Yotsuba. What should we do now?

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:23.029 align:middle
[YOTSUBA gasps]

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:24.489 align:middle
I meant to bring Miku's bread,

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.116 align:middle
but I forgot it
back at the hotel!

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:29.077 align:middle
Her bread? I'm confused.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.537 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I have it.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.456 align:middle
Now I just need to get
it to Miku somehow.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle
Time flies, huh?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle
I can't believe we've
been here three days.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.461 align:middle
Uh-huh.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.715 align:middle
Then again, I guess it
was only two for me.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle
But that's okay.

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:47.345 align:middle
I got to spend the last day
with you, so that's enough.

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.556 align:middle
Hey, wait. What's that?

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.724 align:middle
[MIKU]
Huh?

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.226 align:middle
That's funny, what's
my bread doing here?

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.269 align:middle
Your bread?

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.104 align:middle
What, you mean
you baked something?

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.355 align:middle
Well, I did, but...

00:14:57.439 --> 00:15:00.608 align:middle
Can I have some? I'm starving.

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle
[MIKU]
B-But it's not--

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.201 align:middle
It's good.

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:14.456 align:middle
I don't have the best palate,
so I can say I like it,

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:17.751 align:middle
but I can't give you
the best feedback.

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:21.671 align:middle
What I do know, though,
is you must've worked hard.

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.423 align:middle
So, thanks.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:36.269 align:middle
[MIKU]
You're right. I did work hard!

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.731 align:middle
I put it down next to her.

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.107 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Sorry, Ichika.

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:42.567 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Hm?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.402 align:middle
[YOTSUBA] I think I was
rooting for her the most

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:46.738 align:middle
because she needed
the most support.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle
I thought if she ended up happy,
maybe everyone would be.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.994 align:middle
But now, I see I should've
paid more attention

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:55.288 align:middle
to how you might
be feeling, too.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.749 align:middle
Sorry. Really.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle
Why would you guys
apologize to me?

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.549 align:middle
I should be sorrier
than any of you.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:09.469 align:middle
[FUTARO]
My mom baked for me a lot

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.721 align:middle
when I was about... six?

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.391 align:middle
She made bread every
day until she died.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.102 align:middle
I dunno. That reminded me.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.144 align:middle
[MIKU gasps]

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:20.146 align:middle
Well, I'm happy to listen.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.774 align:middle
It was that nice handmade
bread, you know?

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.318 align:middle
The kind they have at cafes.

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:27.696 align:middle
My dad and I both
really loved it.

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:31.074 align:middle
Ugh. Sorry, I'm just
rambling about myself.

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:33.702 align:middle
[MIKU]
No! I wanna hear more!

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.328 align:middle
I've known you for so long,

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.914 align:middle
but I've never heard any of
this stuff until right now!

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:42.085 align:middle
I've been so self-centered
that I never tried to learn.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.338 align:middle
But I want to know!
Please tell me all about you!

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:50.969 align:middle
Not just that, but I want
you to know about me.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.303 align:middle
See, look!

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.097 align:middle
That spot is famous
for being used

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.725 align:middle
as a magistrate's office
in period dramas.

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:59.644 align:middle
I love that I got
to see it today.

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:02.856 align:middle
Yeah, you're into history
stuff. I know that.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.567 align:middle
[MIKU] I also love that
bridge we crossed.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:06.985 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Is it famous?

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle
[MIKU]
Yeah.

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.947 align:middle
Oh, and... I love that.

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:13.408 align:middle
I love that. I love this.

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:17.370 align:middle
Okay, you love it here.
I understand.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.295 align:middle
I love you.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.797 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.678 align:middle
[ICHIKA] I'm sorry, Miku.
I kept getting in your way.

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:35.221 align:middle
And, Futaro,

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle
I'm sorry I deceived you,
but the last thing I said...

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:41.728 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
Guess what!

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.147 align:middle
I met this really
interesting boy today!

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.859 align:middle
And look! We bought these
good luck charms together!

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.071 align:middle
He's hanging out in
the main hall right now!

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:56.034 align:middle
Hey. I'm glad you came back.
I was so bored all by myself.

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:58.203 align:middle
Hey, we should play a game!

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:01.581 align:middle
Um. Okay, how 'bout Sevens?

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:03.625 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
We weren't there for long,

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:06.503 align:middle
but I'm pretty sure I fell
head-over-heels in love with you

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:10.131 align:middle
during that little bit of time
that we spent together.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.801 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Futaro,

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:18.848 align:middle
you have no reason to believe
me, but that moment...

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:23.812 align:middle
That memory of us...
it wasn't a lie.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:26.189 align:middle
[NINO]
I need to admit something.

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.775 align:middle
When I saw the two
of them together,

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.902 align:middle
I couldn't control my actions.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.613 align:middle
I just jumped on him
without thinking.

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:34.781 align:middle
Nino.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.908 align:middle
[NINO]
I kind of know how you feel

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle
when you did what you did.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:41.996 align:middle
If things had played out the
slightest bit differently,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.082 align:middle
I could've been in your shoes.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.209 align:middle
[gasps]

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.754 align:middle
I was so mean to you,
and I'm sorry.

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:53.550 align:middle
You don't need to be.
That isn't true.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.051 align:middle
Thanks, Ichika.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.553 align:middle
No matter what, though,

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.264 align:middle
I see now that I
was being stupid.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle
And you, too, honestly.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:07.147 align:middle
But the entire time,
Miku never held it against you.

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:15.196 align:middle
[ICHIKA] All this scheming
and dragging each other down,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.783 align:middle
nothing good can come of that.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:22.454 align:middle
We're not enemies.
We all love each other.

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:24.831 align:middle
Let's go tell her we're sorry.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:27.751 align:middle
Maybe this'll help us
be even closer.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:30.086 align:middle
I mean, think about it this way:

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.715 align:middle
Now we have something
we all like.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:35.342 align:middle
[MIKU]
I love you.

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:38.511 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Yeah. I know that.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:40.138 align:middle
So--

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.599 align:middle
Yep! It's true.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.727 align:middle
I really do love
my family a lot.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.353 align:middle
[FUTARO gasps]

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.145 align:middle
[NINO gasps]

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.605 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh?!

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.191 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Why are you here?

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:53.109 align:middle
[YOTSUBA]
You saw us, Miku?

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:54.778 align:middle
[ITSUKI]
How did you know?

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.196 align:middle
How could I not?

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:58.948 align:middle
I mean, I heard Nino and
Ichika talking away.

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:00.784 align:middle
It's kinda hard to miss.

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:02.786 align:middle
Wait, I need a second here.

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:06.247 align:middle
When you pointed and you said,
"I love you", you meant...

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:09.959 align:middle
[MIKU] That was directed
toward my sisters, yeah.

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:14.881 align:middle
Huh? Oh, no. Did you
think I meant you?

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.636 align:middle
You're just messing with me!

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.388 align:middle
I don't understand.

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.848 align:middle
You finally told him
your true feelings.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.141 align:middle
It's okay.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:27.352 align:middle
Because unlike a
certain someone,

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:30.397 align:middle
I'm not stupid enough to barrel
in when I have no chance.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.856 align:middle
What does that mean?

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.944 align:middle
Besides, Futaro's not as
oblivious as we think.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.323 align:middle
[FUTARO] I really should
have seen that coming.

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:43.159 align:middle
Oh, and, Yotsuba,
thanks for the bread.

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:44.369 align:middle
[YOTSUBA chuckles]

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:46.871 align:middle
I was pretty worried
for a minute there!

00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:49.833 align:middle
Also, the underwear.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:52.585 align:middle
They're yours, aren't
they? Thanks a lot.

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:54.087 align:middle
Don't mention it.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.839 align:middle
[MIKU]
Listen--

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:57.841 align:middle
Whatever, we're a family, right?

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:01.428 align:middle
Yeah. Thanks, Nino.
And, Ichika--

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:08.727 align:middle
Oh, Miku. Forgive me!
Would you? I'm so sorry!

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:18.403 align:middle
It's fine. I guess...
falling in love is painful.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:21.281 align:middle
Thank you, Ichika.

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:24.701 align:middle
[FUTARO]
The five of them stayed together

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.454 align:middle
until it was time for us
to meet up again.

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:30.874 align:middle
As for what they
talked about, well,

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:34.252 align:middle
that's for them,
and only them, to know.

00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:41.092 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
Futaro.

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:48.016 align:middle
I caused a lot of trouble for
you, too, didn't I? I'm sorry.

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:50.018 align:middle
[FUTARO]
No.

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:52.020 align:middle
I went too far.

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:56.066 align:middle
I should've heard you out.
It's my fault, too.

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:57.484 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:01.821 align:middle
You know what?
It was all your fault!

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:04.657 align:middle
How dare you get up in
a lady's face like that!

00:22:04.741 --> 00:22:05.658 align:middle
Sorry.

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:08.036 align:middle
You have no idea
how hurt I was!

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:09.454 align:middle
I know.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.289 align:middle
[ICHIKA]
I'm kidding.

00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:14.709 align:middle
It was a lie.

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:15.919 align:middle
[gasps]

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:17.504 align:middle
[FUTARO]
Huh?

00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:18.838 align:middle
All of it?

00:22:18.922 --> 00:22:20.465 align:middle
That's right.

00:22:27.889 --> 00:22:31.518 align:middle
So, Uesugi, did you hear?
About the sneak photographer?

00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle
I screwed up. Sorry.

00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:35.772 align:middle
Not very discreet, huh?

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:38.316 align:middle
[MAEDA]
I think I may have overdone it.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.026 align:middle
[sighs]

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.239 align:middle
It's all right. I am the one
who asked you to do it.

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:50.245 align:middle
And smile!

00:22:57.377 --> 00:22:58.378 align:middle
[PRIEST A]
Do you take this man

00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:00.797 align:middle
to be your lawfully
wedded husband,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.217 align:middle
to have and to hold,
for better or for worse,

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.929 align:middle
for richer or poorer,
both in sickness and in health,

00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:11.141 align:middle
from this day forward,
till death do you part?

00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:13.393 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:16.354 align:middle
In that case, you may
kiss the bride.

00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:21.568 align:middle
[bells tolling]

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.157 align:middle
[FUTARO chuckles]

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.494 align:middle
[FUTARO] Now they'll never
be able to fool me again!

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:33.705 align:middle
Huh? What the heck?

00:23:33.788 --> 00:23:37.334 align:middle
Hold on, what is this?
Can you back off?

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:38.376 align:middle
[gasps]

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.836 align:middle
[gasps]

00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.135 align:middle
[FUTARO]
I think...

00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:49.721 align:middle
...when she ran
into me that time,

00:23:49.804 --> 00:23:52.265 align:middle
that must've been the moment

00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:55.894 align:middle
when I began to feel
like she was special.

00:23:55.977 --> 00:23:58.146 align:middle
It was that day.
