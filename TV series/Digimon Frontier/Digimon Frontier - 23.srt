00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,836
NARRATOR: Feeling guilty about
what happened to his friends,

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,038
Takuya took DarkTrailmon
back to the real world.

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:07,841
But on the way home, he turned
into this freaky half human,

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,842
half Digimon.

5
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,510
Talk about an identity crisis.

6
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,313
Then to make matters worse,
Takuya returned to the same

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,848
day he left for the
Digital World.

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,683
Thinking everything would go
back to normal if he never

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,019
left, Takuya tried to stop
himself from getting on the

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,655
train, but Duskmon kept
getting in the way.

11
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,857
Takuya finally realized he
couldn't run from his fears,

12
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,093
so he decided to go back
to the Digital

13
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,361
World to face the music.

14
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,429
But something tells me
this time, things

15
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,664
are gonna be different.

16
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,932
THEME SONG: Digimon!

00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:37,070
[theme music]

18
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,274
THEME SONG: We look to the past
as we head for the future

19
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:44,411
to reclaim the Digital World.

20
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:48,782
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

21
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,550
by the lessons we've learned.

22
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:57,090
As we work towards one solution

23
00:00:57,124 --> 00:01:01,428
through a Spirit Evolution.

24
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:02,829
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

25
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:03,830
Huh!

26
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:04,831
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

27
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,099
Digimon!

28
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,468
Forever united as one.

29
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,469
Digimon!

30
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,472
Together the battles are won.

31
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,473
Digimon!

32
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,777
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

33
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,681
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

34
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,818
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

35
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,819
Ha-ya-mooh-ah!

36
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:26,820
Huh!

37
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,488
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

38
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,489
Digimon!

39
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,063
-(THINKING) Everyone's gone.

40
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,466
How could they have
survived this?

41
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,068
Ugh.

42
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,202
Guys, I'm so sorry.

43
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,512
This is all my fault.

44
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,381
My plan was useless.

45
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,349
Koji was right.

46
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,385
I risked everyone's lives.

47
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,720
I have to find them.

48
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:03,890
Tommy!

49
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,193
Koji!

50
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,061
Zoe!

51
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,697
J.P.!

52
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,566
Bokomon, Neemon, anyone!

53
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,973
-I don't get it.

54
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,109
Why didn't Duskmon finish me
off when he had the chance?

55
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,146
Huh?

56
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:26,947
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Stop!

57
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,982
Leave that alone.

58
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,651
-Hey stop messing around
with our D-Tectors.

59
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,120
-Hm.

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,954
-Come on.

61
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,089
Give them back to us.

62
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,124
-Hm.

63
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,291
-You'll break them!

64
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,459
-I'm warning you!

65
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,094
-Stop it!

66
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,463
-Execute now!

67
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,298
Yes.

68
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,299
No.

69
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,167
Aw, man.

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,001
What's the use?

71
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,269
-Don't say that.

72
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,837
We can't give up now.

73
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,873
I'm sure Koji or Takuya will
find a way to save us.

74
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,541
-We have to believe in them.

75
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,844
-I want to, but it's hard.

76
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,046
-What's the good word?

77
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,347
Have you pried loose
the spirit?

78
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,983
-Mm mm, mm mm.

79
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,686
-T'would be well for you
children to reconsider and

80
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,686
give us what we seek.

81
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,321
-Forget it, metal head.

82
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,357
We're not telling you anything,
not today, not

83
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,025
tomorrow, not ever.

84
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,994
So you might as well just let
us down before we get mad.

85
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,263
-Oh, I don't think so.

86
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,332
Mercurymon, can't I squash
just one of them?

87
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,902
All of this whining's giving
me a headache.

88
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,237
-Patience, my anxious urchin.

89
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,239
Methinks thine humor
ill received.

90
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,607
No.

91
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,276
We shall use these three
as bait to lure the

92
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,911
other two out of hiding.

93
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,914
-Oh, but sugar, aren't
you sick of waiting?

94
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,882
It'd be faster to just make
them tell us where their

95
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,751
friends are right now.

96
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,253
-I fear it will be a fool's
errand, m'lady,

97
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,255
but do as you wish.

98
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,590
-Oh, goody goody.

99
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,762
-What are those?

100
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:49,763
-Not goody.

101
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,731
-Oh, this won't hurt a bit.

102
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,310
-What are you doing?

103
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,179
And now the fun begins.

104
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:06,813
-No!

105
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,447
No!

106
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,682
Not the belly button.

107
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,283
No, stop it.

108
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,184
Haha haha.

109
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,986
Come on, seriously, cut it out.

110
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:13,820
-Zoe.

111
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,989
-Ha ha ha!

112
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,158
-Tommy!

113
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,659
-All right, Slim.

114
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,962
Give us your spirits and tell us
where your friends are, or

115
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,497
the tickling continues.

116
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,231
-Do your worst.

117
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,999
I can take it.

118
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,468
-All right, you asked for it.

119
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,302
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): Ah!

120
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,403
You're mad, Ranamon.

121
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,738
Mad!

122
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,042
-Come on, guys.

123
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:36,676
Where are you?

124
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,379
Where'd everybody go?

125
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,882
Huh?

126
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,216
Wow.

127
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,551
Nothing.

128
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,355
That's weird.

129
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,756
I could have sworn
it was raining.

130
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:53,960
Huh?

131
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,363
How is this possible?

132
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,801
It's like I knew that it
was going to rain.

133
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:04,137
I can feel the power
of nature.

134
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:08,608
Everything's finally starting
to make sense.

135
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,912
Ophanimon told me that coming
here was my destiny.

136
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,313
It's funny.

137
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,950
I had always felt that I was
meant to do something special,

138
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,420
and when I stood in that circle,
surrounded by light, I

139
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,455
thought I knew it was.

140
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,959
I remember that first moment
when the power of Agunimon was

141
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,460
coursing through me.

142
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,130
I felt as if I could
do anything.

143
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,432
There wasn't anyone
who could beat me.

144
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,035
I knew that I was going to save
the digital world and

145
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:39,005
destroy any evil Digimon
that tried to stop me.

146
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,375
Battle after battle, my strength
grew, and so did my

147
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,343
confidence.

148
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,512
But that was the problem.

149
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,682
I was so wrapped up in myself,
I never realized what being a

150
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,550
Digimon was all about.

151
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,852
There was no connection
between me and the

152
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,888
world around me.

153
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,892
But now there is, and
I won't forget it.

154
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:08,636
-'Tis but a matter of
moments 'ere your

155
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:09,837
spirits shall be mine.

156
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,473
Why not save yourselves
from this misery and

157
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,242
tell us what we wish.

158
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,478
-Huh?

159
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,447
-I don't know where they are,
but sooner or later, they'll

160
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,115
show up, and then you'll pay.

161
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,316
I promise you.

162
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,651
-Now that's funny.

163
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,286
-Oh.

164
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,988
-Ha ha hee haha.

165
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:27,989
Stop it!

166
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:28,956
Ah hahaha.

167
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,825
Come on.

168
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,060
-Don't make me come down
off this wall!

169
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,166
-A force field?

170
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,035
If I could just get
through that.

171
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,038
Then I could get
the D-Tectors.

172
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,375
But there's five of them
and only one of me.

173
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:54,715
[laughter]

174
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,418
-Now, you're gonna tell
me what I wanna know.

175
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:01,555
-I already told you,
I don't know.

176
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,091
-I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

177
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,228
-Ah!

178
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,229
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Oh dear.

179
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,065
It's coming back.

180
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:12,400
Please don't hurt me.

181
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,200
Can't you see I'm with egg?

182
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:14,435
Take my friend.

183
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,270
He's a bit annoying, but
a good listener.

184
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,438
-What did you say?

185
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,806
I wasn't listening.

186
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,107
-You two are funny.

187
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,610
Will you be my friends?

188
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,944
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Sepikmon.

189
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,280
This lonely Digimon has no
friends and spends all his

190
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,750
time throwing his spirit
boomerang to himself.

191
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,952
-We'd love to be your friend.

192
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,954
-Then let's dance!

193
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,922
-I can't dance.

194
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,425
I have no rhythm and
two left feet.

195
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,794
-Well, you have to dance,
or we can't be friends.

196
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:41,862
What's it gonna be,
boogie or bye bye?

197
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:44,265
-B-But I never learned
how to boogie.

198
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,299
-Then bye bye.

199
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,270
-Are you guys OK?

200
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,105
-Where have you been?

201
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:52,873
-Yeah, we missed you.

202
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,041
-I missed you too.

203
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,676
Where is everyone?

204
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,179
-After the fierce battle with
Duskmon, they were captured by

205
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,181
Mercurymon and Ranamon.

206
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:03,551
J.P., Zoe, and Tommy are all
trapped, poor things.

207
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,820
And Duskmon's disappeared.

208
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:06,520
-Where's Koji?

209
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,723
-I don't know, do I?

210
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,690
SEPIKMON (OFFSCREEN):
Excuse me.

211
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,225
Could I have my boomerang
back?

212
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,059
That depends.

213
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:13,761
Will you be more careful
with it?

214
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:14,762
-Huh?

215
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,330
What do you mean more careful?

216
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,531
It's a boomerang.

217
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,366
I through it and
it comes back.

218
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,001
I'm confused.

219
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,503
-Just watch where you
throw it, pal.

220
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,604
You could hurt someone.

221
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,439
-Mhmm.

222
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:26,273
-Oh, you're right.

223
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,408
I'm sorry.

224
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,243
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

225
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,245
I just wanted some friends.

226
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,880
Friends.

227
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,415
-Maybe you're just trying
too hard, buddy.

228
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,617
Be yourself, you know?

229
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,419
See ya.

230
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:41,555
-You mean people will like
me if I'm just myself?

231
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,257
-Well, of course.

232
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,327
-Does that mean that you guys
would really be my friends?

233
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,495
-Sure, why not?

234
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,996
-Ooga chaka.

235
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:49,923
Ooga chaka.

236
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:52,099
Ooga chaka.

237
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,934
Mercurymon has our other
friends, right?

238
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,836
Well, maybe I can help
you find them.

239
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,472
-What do you mean?

240
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,641
-Just follow my spirit
boomerang.

241
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,610
It should lead you
right to them.

242
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,845
-We will, thank you.

243
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,346
-Aren't you forgetting
someone?

244
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,114
-Wait for us!

245
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,984
-Goodbye my new friends,
and good luck!

246
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:16,157
-Come on, talk already.

247
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:22,997
-What news, m'lady?

248
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,132
-Zero, hun.

249
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,001
I don't think they're quite
getting the message.

250
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,135
Is it all right if
I do something

251
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:30,070
a little more drastic?

252
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:31,305
-Do as you wish.

253
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,474
-You, sweet thing!

254
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,376
-Ah!

255
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:39,046
No, not Zoe.

256
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,549
-Let's see how pretty you are
when you're squashed like a

257
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,216
bug.

258
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,185
-Let's not.

259
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,754
-Ah!

260
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,222
-Leave her alone, fish face.

261
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:49,757
Take me instead.

262
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,392
-J.P., don't.

263
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,394
-No one touches Zoe while I'm
around, right, my little

264
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,528
snuggie pie?

265
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:55,629
-Oh, J.P.

266
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,231
-Snoogie woogie face.

267
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:59,466
-J.P.!

268
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,401
RANAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Pay attention, son.

269
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,702
I'm trying to threaten
you here.

270
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,037
Hello.

271
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,105
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): What
are you doing?

272
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,607
-I was just--

273
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,875
it's a long story.

274
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,276
-Don't worry, precious.

275
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,111
I'll get to your little
girlfriend soon enough.

276
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,113
No offense, but I'm saving
the best for last.

277
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,119
Dark Vapor.

278
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,157
-Stop it.

279
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:25,759
-Leave him alone!

280
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,863
-Oh man, this has got
to be a dream.

281
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:32,800
A really bad dream!

282
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,467
-Stop!

283
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,144
OK, we'll talk!

284
00:10:35,144 --> 00:10:36,837
-Ah!

285
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,172
-J.P.!

286
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,384
Execute!

287
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,518
Spirit Evolution!

288
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,772
Lobomon!

289
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,073
-Wha?

290
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,078
-It's Lobomon.

291
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,447
-That is no way to
treat a lady.

292
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:23,050
Didn't your parents teach
you any manners?

293
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,753
-And so, the fourth
hath joined us.

294
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:31,725
-Hang on, you guys.

295
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,760
We're coming!

296
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,962
-Hehe heheheh.

297
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,167
-Enough.

298
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:53,640
-They can't be much further.
(THINKING) Please

299
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,308
let them be all right.

300
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:56,977
Lobo Kendo!

301
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,945
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): I'm
getting shoulder sick.

302
00:11:58,979 --> 00:11:59,846
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Who cares?

303
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:01,348
My baby's half scrambled.

304
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:03,650
-I think not.

305
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:06,620
Dark Reflection!

306
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:07,821
-Ah!

307
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:10,123
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Wee,
I'm all dizzy.

308
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:12,058
-Heh heh.

309
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:13,126
-Hi honey!

310
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:17,030
Acid Ink!

311
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:24,337
-Yeah, you're quite a lady.

312
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,381
-So, where are they?

313
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:36,049
Lobomon!

314
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:37,517
-Oh my.

315
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,787
He's taking on Mercurymon and
Calmaramon all by himself.

316
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,890
-Bokomon, why are the others
stuck to that wall?

317
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:46,359
-They've been captured,
you witless nit.

318
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:47,694
-Guys!

319
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,262
-Wait!

320
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:50,296
-Howling Laser!

321
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,137
-Lobomon needs our help!

322
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,605
-But what can we do?

323
00:12:58,605 --> 00:12:59,806
-Man, if only we could
Spirit Evolve.

324
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:06,112
Hey, you better not throw
our D-Tectors in there.

325
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:10,650
-Now what?

326
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:11,951
-I'm gonna need a plan.

327
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:16,456
-Tell me something.

328
00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:19,025
It's obvious you don't care
about yourself, but can you

329
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:20,627
promise me the others
won't get hurt?

330
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:23,029
If you can't, then we'd better
just go home now, because I

331
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:24,998
won't let you risk
their lives.

332
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:28,034
-I'm gonna need to do
this carefully.

333
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:29,536
-That would be nice.

334
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:32,138
-I can't just jump in without
thinking first.

335
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:35,141
Tommy and the others can't
Spirit Evolve, and if those

336
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:37,811
two goons get their hands
on them, they

337
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:38,845
won't stand a chance.

338
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:40,814
I'll need Lobomon's help.

339
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,348
-I think he might need yours.

340
00:13:42,382 --> 00:13:43,683
Look!

341
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:49,089
-Hurry, Takuya.

342
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:49,656
Hurry.

343
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:50,924
Run like the wind.

344
00:13:57,464 --> 00:14:00,567
-Oh sweetie, don't tell me your
done playing with me.

345
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,103
-Maybe the poor lad just needs
a bit of refreshment.

346
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:05,705
-You are so thoughtful.

347
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:08,041
One drink of water
coming right up.

348
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:09,075
Draining Rain!

349
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:13,913
-All right.

350
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:15,615
I want you two to stay here.

351
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:17,717
-But what are you gonna do?

352
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:19,085
-Wait until the time is right.

353
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:20,754
-Well, when is that?

354
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,723
So, we ran all this way and my
tummy got upset for nothing?

355
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:24,924
-All right, quiet please.

356
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:27,427
I have a feeling Takuya
is right.

357
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:28,461
-Really?

358
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:29,796
OK.

359
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:30,296
-(THINKING) That smell.

360
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:31,798
The sound.

361
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:35,401
The atmosphere is changing.

362
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:38,138
-This doesn't seem like
Takuya at all.

363
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,140
It's as if he's become
different somehow.

364
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:48,615
-A storm is coming.

365
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:49,816
-What kind of storm?

366
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:52,118
-I don't know.

367
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,953
(THINKING) I thought Takuya
had some sort of plan.

368
00:14:53,987 --> 00:14:55,822
He certainly thought about
it long enough.

369
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,290
But now I'm not so sure.

370
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:59,659
All this waiting and wondering
about the weather.

371
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:00,627
Who cares about the weather?

372
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,028
The others are in danger.

373
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:10,870
-Have you no control?

374
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,405
-Why are you mad at me?

375
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:13,406
It was your idea.

376
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:15,742
-Ugh, I'm surrounded
by buffoons.

377
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,381
-Lobomon!

378
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:24,584
-Give me your best shot.

379
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:27,453
-As you wish.

380
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,291
Ha ha ha.

381
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:33,393
-Look there is a storm.

382
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,762
-(THINKING) Wind.

383
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,363
I'm getting stronger.

384
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:43,736
-Well, what do you know?

385
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,938
Takuya was right.

386
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,606
-Yes, but how could
he have known?

387
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,610
-(THINKING) And a little snow.

388
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:52,612
Right now!

389
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:55,949
-You're freaking me out.

390
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:57,617
-Oh, that's cold.

391
00:15:57,617 --> 00:15:58,952
-Wind and snow.

392
00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:01,588
Thunder and lightning.

393
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:04,591
Forces of nature lend
us your strength!

394
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:07,627
-He's talking to the weather
and it's listening.

395
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:11,097
-Now I understand what it
means to be a Digimon!

396
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:14,334
I'm ready to accept the
responsibility that comes with

397
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:15,702
great power.

398
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:19,872
To truly become Agunimon,
Warrior of Flame!

399
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:25,845
-Had enough?

400
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,180
-Leave him alone!

401
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,682
-Oh, can it.

402
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:33,253
At least, the final player
hath arrived.

403
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:36,489
-Then let's get this
show on the road.

404
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:38,024
-Pyro Dirt.

405
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:41,995
-Missed me, missed me,
now you gotta k--

406
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,730
-Thanks, but no thanks.

407
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,735
-That little whelp is much
stronger than I remember.

408
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:50,069
-Pyro Tornado!

409
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,780
Now Lobomon, free the others!

410
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:04,914
-Lobo Kendo!

411
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:09,318
-All right, guys.

412
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:10,419
It's your turn.

413
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:22,665
-Execute!

414
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:24,100
Spirit Evolution!

415
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:43,319
-Beetlemon!

416
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,869
-Kozemon!

417
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:19,121
-Kumamon.

418
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:21,958
-Ah, isn't this sweet?

419
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:23,759
Together at last.

420
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,261
I love reunions.

421
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:26,963
Ha ha.

422
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:30,132
It appears it's time for the
final act of our little play.

423
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,269
-I should put on something
more appropriate.

424
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:36,239
Ranamon Slide Evolution!

425
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:38,774
Calmaramon!

426
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,610
-You don't really think
you can win?

427
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,944
Haven't you heard?

428
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:44,480
It's not nice to mess
with Mother Nature!

429
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:45,448
-Let's finish this.

430
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:46,749
Thunder Fist!

431
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,188
-Tempest Twist!

432
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:57,660
-Argh, what is going on?

433
00:18:57,693 --> 00:19:00,496
-Blizzard Blaster!

434
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,497
-Ah!

435
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:02,832
-Lobo Kendo!

436
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:08,037
-How did y'all get so strong?

437
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,041
-We have a stronger ally than
you could ever imagine.

438
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,043
-Odds bodkins!

439
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,544
They're using the forces
of nature to

440
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:17,013
amplify their attacks.

441
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:18,548
The master will be displeased.

442
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:19,749
RANAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Forget the master!

443
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:21,684
What about us?

444
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,653
-Will you stop sniveling,
woman?

445
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:24,987
-Argh!

446
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:31,561
You won't defeat
us ever again!

447
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:37,567
[screaming]

448
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,369
-Ah, I just love the theater.

449
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:41,070
Takuya

450
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,071
-Takuya, my boy.

451
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,105
You've matured.

452
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,545
-Well, now what do we do?

453
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:50,580
-Retreat and regroup.

454
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,651
-You little brats.

455
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:58,988
This isn't over!

456
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:00,256
-Yeah!

457
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:06,062
-That is the last time that I
listen to you, Mercurymon.

458
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:08,965
You should've let
me squash them.

459
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:12,001
-The little humans are smarter
than I thought, but fret not,

460
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:15,604
m'lady, for within me,
a plan is hatching.

461
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:18,808
All we need is a more
advantageous location to spin

462
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,509
our web of woe.

463
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:22,144
-I'm so sorry, you guys.

464
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:23,612
This was all my fault.

465
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:25,314
-What are you talking about?

466
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,316
You're the one who rescued us.

467
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:27,817
-But--

468
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,485
-It's OK, Takuya.

469
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:32,955
We were worried about you, but
I knew you'd come through.

470
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:35,057
-I guess I really owe
you one, Koji.

471
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:37,193
-Nah, all of us owe Takuya.

472
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:38,527
You've really changed.

473
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:39,528
-Yeah.

474
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:41,063
I hardly recognize myself.

475
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:42,231
-Huh?

476
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:43,666
-I don't feel like
a kid anymore.

477
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:45,501
I think I finally understand
what being a

478
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:47,737
Digimon is all about.

479
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,672
We're in for an amazing ride.

480
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:52,708
All of us.

481
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,411
NARRATOR: Wow, who ever thought
Takuya would be the

482
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:56,846
responsible one?

483
00:20:56,879 --> 00:21:02,730
Well, you live and learn on
Digimon, Digital Monsters.
