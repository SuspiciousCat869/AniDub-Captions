00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:03,586
NARRATOR: On their to the Forest
Kingdom, J.P, Zoe,

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,922
Bokomon and Neemon came upon
a school for young Digimon.

3
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,091
There they met Tsunomon, a
little guy who didn't get

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,592
along with the other kids.

5
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,594
See, one day he digivolved
to Gabumon to help his

6
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:13,563
classmates, but they totally
freaked out.

7
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,898
So much for individuality.

8
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,433
Then the rain came and almost
washed away the school.

9
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,602
Zoe and J.P. spirit evolved
just in time.

10
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:21,604
But while they were busy,
Kapurimon got swept away.

11
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:24,274
With a little convincing from
the guys, Tsunomon digivolved

12
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,608
to Gabumon and saved
his friend.

13
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:29,179
After that, Kapurimon was the
most popular kid in school So

14
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,447
being an individual does work.

15
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:32,682
THEME SONG: Digimon!

16
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:43,359
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

17
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:45,662
digital world.

18
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:50,300
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other we live by

19
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,467
the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:55,505 --> 00:01:00,176
As we work towards one solution
through spirit

21
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:01,511
evolution--

22
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:07,817
Digimon!

23
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:10,753
Forever united as one--

24
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:11,754
Digimon!

25
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:14,157
Together the battles are won--

26
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:15,391
Digimon!

27
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,061
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

28
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:22,031
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:26,736
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all!

30
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:30,273
Digimon!

31
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:37,747
-I believe the Forest Kingdom
begins beyond that track.

32
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:39,482
-Sure looks big.

33
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:42,051
Hey, Bokomon, how much farther
do we have to walk to the

34
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:43,786
forest terminal?

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,988
-Don't worry.

36
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,956
You should only have to walk
a little bit more.

37
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:49,459
-A little bit more?

38
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:51,461
These little bits
are killing me.

39
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:54,464
Wait up!

40
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:56,299
Man, isn't it time for
a dinner break?

41
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:57,834
I'm wasting away here.

42
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,103
-We didn't even get
any breakfast yet.

43
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:02,505
-I think we better stop
here and make camp.

44
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,807
-It's been a long day
for all of us.

45
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:05,642
-Yeah, whatever.

46
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,143
-We're stopping?

47
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:08,278
-Does that mean I get to eat?

48
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:09,479
And lay down?

49
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:10,213
And-- eat?

50
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:11,547
Yes!

51
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,018
-Look what I found.

52
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,519
I hope it's edible.

53
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:17,854
-It's called a meat apple.

54
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:18,688
-Meat apple?

55
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,023
-Yes.

56
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,224
Each one has the flavor
of a different meat.

57
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:22,892
Quite nutritious, actually.

58
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:24,727
-Where'd you find that thing?

59
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:26,529
-It was just lying
on the ground.

60
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,532
There has to be a tree
somewhere nearby.

61
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,200
Bokomon, will you help
me find some more?

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,868
-Certainly?

63
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:32,869
-Can I come?

64
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:33,736
-All right.

65
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:34,570
-Goody!

66
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:35,905
I love meat apples!

67
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:36,873
-Well, billy for you.

68
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,374
-Wait for me!

69
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,679
-Well, I guess we'd better
gather some firewood.

70
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:45,281
-I'm not gonna have to lift
anything heavy, am I?

71
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:46,049
-Ah, yes.

72
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:47,383
Fresh young minds.

73
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:48,618
They'll have sweet
dreams tonight.

74
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,590
-Is something wrong?

75
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:57,293
-I just thought I heard
something flying by.

76
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:00,430
-I didn't hear anything.

77
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,599
Maybe it's a monster.

78
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:03,066
-Yeah.

79
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:03,933
There it is!

80
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:04,934
-Huh?

81
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,271
-A big tree!

82
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:10,273
-There's so many!

83
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,474
-It's loaded with meat apples.

84
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,575
Yummy!

85
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:25,488
-Am I done yet?

86
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:26,155
-Yep.

87
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:27,190
I'll take it from here.

88
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,997
-Apple, you're my best friend.

89
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:34,697
Blech!

90
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:35,665
Disgusting!

91
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,533
-You don't eat them
raw, you know.

92
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,502
-Why didn't you say
that before?

93
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,208
-I got a question.

94
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:47,910
All five of us kids now have
the spirits of legendary

95
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:48,678
warriors, right?

96
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:50,346
-Uh-huh.

97
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:52,181
-So tell me, how come even when
we combined our forces we

98
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:55,551
still couldn't beat that
stupid Grumblemon?

99
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:57,420
-Good question.

100
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:58,488
-Thunderfist!

101
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:04,060
-Nice shot, dorkus.

102
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,361
Huh?

103
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:08,431
Ahhh!

104
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,236
-At one point we seemed to
have the upper hand.

105
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,537
But then--

106
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:21,144
-I never find without you.

107
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,646
Now get rid you!

108
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,747
-Huh?

109
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:27,216
-Execute!

110
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,484
Release spirit evolution!

111
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:35,958
Gigasmon!

112
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,493
Quagmire twister!

113
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:43,466
-He spirit evolved into
that crazy Gigasmon.

114
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:46,269
-But he called it
beast spirit.

115
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:47,470
Just what does that mean?

116
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,005
Any clue?

117
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:49,806
-The fire's ready.

118
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:50,840
Bring your apples.

119
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,378
-Hm?

120
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:57,146
TOMMY (VOICEOVER): There
it is again.

121
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:57,980
-Come on, shorty.

122
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,048
Quit lagging!

123
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,687
-Hey, Bokomon.

124
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:06,222
Anything in your book about
a beast spirit?

125
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:07,857
-I haven't seen anything.

126
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:09,192
-If it's not too much trouble,
could you just

127
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,393
take another look?

128
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:11,194
-Certainly.

129
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,695
Let's see now.

130
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:14,397
Beast, beast, beast, beast.

131
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,066
I'm afraid I still don't
see anything.

132
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,234
Paws off, baggy.

133
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:20,670
-But I think I found
something.

134
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,705
This page seems to
be folded over.

135
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,707
Maybe there's other
stuff inside.

136
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,508
-Oh.

137
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,209
It's a miracle.

138
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,111
You're actually right.

139
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,612
This changes everything.

140
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,047
It seems there are two
spirits for each of

141
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:32,515
the legendary warriors.

142
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:33,382
-Huh?

143
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,550
-Huh?

144
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,586
-The first is the human
spirit, like Agunimon.

145
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:39,088
But the second is called
the beast spirit.

146
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,857
That explains where Gigasmon
came from.

147
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,726
But how did he summon
the beast spirit?

148
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,430
-I wonder what life would
be like as a beastie.

149
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:48,297
-Let's feed you to one,
and you can find

150
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:50,066
out from the inside.

151
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,300
Don't you realize this means
that the children may have the

152
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:52,602
power to spirit evolve again?

153
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,983
-Well then.

154
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,485
If Bokomon's right, each
of us should be able

155
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:03,620
to get a beast spirit.

156
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,956
-But if that's true then we're
only halfway there.

157
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:06,824
-Oh, man.

158
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,225
It's like starting over.

159
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:10,861
-Bokomon. Bokomon. Bokomon.

160
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:14,198
-But if get our beast spirits
maybe we can beat Grumblemon.

161
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,732
-Well, I'm willing
to give it a try.

162
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,368
Beast spirit evolution,
here we go!

163
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,070
-Yeah!

164
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:20,671
-Bokomon.

165
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:21,538
Bokomon.

166
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:23,373
Boko-- ow!

167
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:25,042
Is this a good idea?

168
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:26,543
-What's the matter with you?

169
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:27,844
We have to help you
find your beast

170
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,413
spirits as soon as possible.

171
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,849
After all, it may be the only
way to save the digital world.

172
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:34,718
We haven't even made it to
the Forest terminal.

173
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,887
We're running out of time.

174
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:38,789
These beast spirits must be
our number one priority.

175
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:39,389
-Nope.

176
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:40,757
Not good.

177
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:42,693
-What is not good?

178
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,794
-The meat apples.

179
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:44,795
While you're talking,
they're burning up.

180
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:46,129
-Huh?

181
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:55,973
-Mine's like a meat bun!

182
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:57,774
-This one tastes almost like
a chicken drumstick.

183
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,643
-I think I'm eating prime rib.

184
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,445
-Mm, yeah. Gingered pork.

185
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:05,616
-Mine's ossobuco!

186
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:13,624
-Hey, you're blocking
the view.

187
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:14,691
-Something is happening.

188
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,430
Wow. A TV.

189
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:26,169
-A bunch of 'em.

190
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:28,005
-That is pretty sweet.

191
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:28,639
-Whoa.

192
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,007
Tree TV.

193
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,475
I hope it isn't all
travel channels.

194
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,010
I wonder if we can
get music videos.

195
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,877
-Wait a minute.

196
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:34,845
That's our world.

197
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,346
Those scenes are
from back home.

198
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,681
-That's right, Zoe.

199
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:39,316
It's called the TV Forest,
a video gateway

200
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:40,751
to the human world.

201
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,019
-Now that's really weird.

202
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,186
-It's my school.

203
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:45,489
It never looked so
pretty to me.

204
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:46,356
Oh, look.

205
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:48,225
The cherry tree's blooming.

206
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:49,426
-I love cherries.

207
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:50,927
You know, come to think of
it, I love pretty much

208
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,162
every kind of food.

209
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:55,732
By the way, is this
pre-recorded?

210
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,267
-That's the park where
my mom always used to

211
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:58,368
always take me to play.

212
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:04,241
My mother.

213
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,242
-Huh?

214
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:08,578
-Are you serious?

215
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:09,746
-You weren't kidding.

216
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:11,949
Your mother's very
pretty, Tommy.

217
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:14,151
-Oh, Mom.

218
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:15,485
Huh?

219
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:19,089
Wait.

220
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:21,224
Where are you going?

221
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,893
Don't leave me!

222
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,493
Please!

223
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:24,895
[sobbing]

224
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,163
Momma!

225
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,470
-I bet my mom is really
worried about me.

226
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,838
-Cheer up, little buddy.

227
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:36,640
Go on, try my apple.

228
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:39,109
It's hot dog.

229
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:40,477
-Tommy could be your
little brother.

230
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,617
-Hey, Koji.

231
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,786
Are you falling asleep?

232
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,988
-Sleep?

233
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,789
I'm lucky I'm not
bored to death.

234
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:53,323
-Hey, bud.

235
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,224
What's your problem?

236
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:56,026
He needs a nap

237
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,527
-He's just grumpy.

238
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,129
Hey, J.P, maybe Tommy would
like to see you do some of

239
00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:00,731
your magic.

240
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:01,365
-Magic?

241
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:02,466
Since when?

242
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:04,334
-Since I was a kid myself.

243
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:08,205
Ladies and germs, I present to
you the magic of Howie Doodat.

244
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:09,172
-Yay!

245
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:10,040
-All right!

246
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,674
-Observe.

247
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:11,742
Nothing up my sleeves--

248
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:13,877
KOJI (VOICEOVER):
Or in his head.

249
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,848
-I happen to have this beautiful
red scarf here.

250
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:21,051
But now this blue one wants
his friend back.

251
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:21,518
-Yeah!

252
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:22,853
Put 'em back!

253
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:24,054
-That wasn't my trick.

254
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,055
Yet.

255
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,523
I will put 'em together--

256
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:27,924
one more twist here--

257
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:28,625
ta-da!

258
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:29,459
My clothesline!

259
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:30,260
-Ooh.

260
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:31,094
-Yes, my friends.

261
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,764
But this is just
the beginning.

262
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,799
I will now bring them
back to normal.

263
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:38,435
-Now, how did he do that?

264
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:40,103
-Well, I guess that explains
where he got

265
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,972
his stage name from.

266
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:44,608
-It doesn't explain why
he's so annoying.

267
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:45,742
-Do another one!

268
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:47,444
-I don't know if
I know anymore.

269
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:50,113
In fact, I don't if I know how I
knew how I did the last one.

270
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:51,114
-Now stop that.

271
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:53,116
[laughter]

272
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:54,451
-Nightmare syndrome.

273
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,839
-This stinks.

274
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,008
I do a spectacular performance
tonight, and I still have to

275
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,509
watch the stupid fire.

276
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:20,877
-Stop complaining.

277
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:23,380
We drew straws and you lost,
fair and square.

278
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,682
-I'm just wiped out from
all the walking.

279
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:28,151
I think I need to pass
out for a while.

280
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:28,652
-Hey,

281
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,353
J.P. -Hm?

282
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,521
-I was wondering.

283
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:32,856
Are you an only child?

284
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:33,757
-Yeah.

285
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,425
But how could you
have known that?

286
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,394
-It's pretty obvious.

287
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:38,061
-So?

288
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:38,495
Big deal.

289
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:40,096
What about it?

290
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,898
-I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings.

291
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:44,234
I just miss my little brother.

292
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:45,235
Same age as Tommy.

293
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,875
It was my little brother's
birthday.

294
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:54,111
The day we came to the
digital world.

295
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:55,112
Aw, man!

296
00:10:55,178 --> 00:10:57,547
I missed all the cake
and ice cream!

297
00:10:57,581 --> 00:11:00,717
-Afraid it's a little bit
late for that now, bud.

298
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,418
-Yeah.

299
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:03,887
No big whoop.

300
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,588
-Huh?

301
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:06,089
Did you just see a ghost?

302
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:06,990
-I saw something.

303
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:07,991
I'm just not sure what.

304
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,726
But it feels like we're
being watched.

305
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:10,994
-Wha?

306
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:23,940
Um, maybe it was a squirrel
or something.

307
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,843
-I can't believe you didn't
feel anything just then.

308
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,345
-I did.

309
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:30,280
But I think it might have just
been gas from eating too many

310
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:32,015
of those meat apples, if you
know what I'm saying.

311
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,116
And I think you do.

312
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,624
-You must search for the
spirit, Koji Minamoto.

313
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:44,194
Never give up, for the
spirit awaits you.

314
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:49,132
Once you have found it,
everything will become clear.

315
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,735
-Everything will become clear?

316
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:54,371
I wish I knew what
everything was.

317
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:56,740
[whimpering]

318
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:57,707
-Huh?

319
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:59,042
-Huh?

320
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:06,216
-Wait!

321
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:07,217
Wait!

322
00:12:07,284 --> 00:12:09,219
Momma!
-Tommy.

323
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,220
-Sorry, shorty.

324
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,855
You're a big boy now.

325
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:13,223
You don't need your
mommy any more.

326
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:13,890
-Momma, don't go!

327
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,260
-Goodbye forever, Tommy.

328
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,261
-No!

329
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:23,099
Stop!

330
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,802
-Tommy, what is it?

331
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:27,571
-I won't forgive you.

332
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:28,471
I won't forgive you.

333
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:31,107
I won't forgive you.

334
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,076
I won't forgive you.

335
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:34,744
-There's something
wrong with him.

336
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:35,278
-Hey, half-pint.

337
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:36,746
Snap out of it.

338
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,616
-Tommy, stop that right now.

339
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:40,617
-I will not forgive!

340
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:41,585
-Now cut it out!

341
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:43,954
This isn't funny, Tommy!

342
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,122
-I will never forgive
any of you.

343
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:53,697
You're going to pay for what
you've done to me.

344
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,333
Execute.

345
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,701
Spirit evolution!

346
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:09,646
Kumamon.

347
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,249
Crystal freeze!

348
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:14,651
[cackling]

349
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:20,523
-Keep it down.

350
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,092
That's one angry bear.

351
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,660
-Kumomon!

352
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:25,562
-Has Kumomon gone mad?

353
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:28,331
-I'm tired of you bullying me!

354
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:29,599
Crystal freeze!

355
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:30,900
-No!

356
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:34,904
-What's going on here?

357
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,373
-No clue.

358
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:37,540
-Maybe you could use the book?

359
00:13:37,574 --> 00:13:38,875
-Maybe on your head.

360
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:44,581
-He's gone completely crazy.

361
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,416
-I'm really sorry, Tommy.

362
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,318
-Justice will be served.

363
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:50,420
Crystal freeze!

364
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:51,821
-Guess sorry wasn't
the magic word!

365
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:58,395
-You OK?

366
00:13:58,461 --> 00:13:59,562
-Yeah.

367
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:01,564
-Hey, how come Takuya gets
to fall with Zoe?

368
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,133
-Run, you jerk!

369
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,602
-Crystal freeze!

370
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:08,271
-Looks like the only choice we
have is to spirit evolve and

371
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:10,173
take him out!

372
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:11,841
-I will never forgive you.

373
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:13,476
-Spirit evolve?

374
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,778
I won't do it.

375
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,646
There has to be another
way to stop him.

376
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:17,781
-Right.

377
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:19,616
-Sorry, J.P. I'm with them.

378
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:20,550
-Fine.

379
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,985
Well, what do you propose?

380
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:24,387
-Crystal freeze!

381
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:25,388
-Run!

382
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:26,656
Come on, Zoe!

383
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:27,490
Take my hand!

384
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:28,625
I'll protect you!

385
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:31,027
Agh!

386
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:31,628
-Sorry.

387
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:32,896
-I'm good.

388
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:40,503
-What was that?

389
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,839
-I know I definitely heard
something that time.

390
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:44,074
-Right.

391
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,721
Execute!

392
00:14:57,787 --> 00:14:59,055
Spirit evolution!

393
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:18,141
Lobomon.

394
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:21,911
-Wait a minute.

395
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:22,912
I thought we all agreed
not to spirit evolve.

396
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:24,748
Who does he think
he is, anyway?

397
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:25,982
Sometimes I hate him!

398
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,951
-Koji must have a good reason.

399
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:29,285
Maybe he knows something
that we don't.

400
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,359
-Ancient spirit of light!

401
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:49,472
-There he is!

402
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,186
Execute!

403
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,520
Spirit evolution!

404
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:23,940
Agunimon!

405
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:29,412
-OK, now something is
definitely wrong.

406
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,714
-All I know is that they broke
the agreement and we have to

407
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:33,082
protect Tommy.

408
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:35,251
-Lobomon, don't you harm
a hair on that bear.

409
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:37,220
OK?

410
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:38,821
-Frozen tundra!

411
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:48,637
-Kumamon, this has to stop.

412
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,332
-Incoming!

413
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,466
-Stupid humans.

414
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,802
This is too easy.

415
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:54,437
-Rotten little warthog!

416
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,771
-What is he riding?

417
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:57,006
-[inaudible].

418
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:03,179
-Bakumon.

419
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:05,181
The product of a medical sleep
research computer program.

420
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:08,618
His special attack is
nightmare syndrome.

421
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:10,386
-Come back here, you
flying pork pie!

422
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,388
-He looked pretty nasty
for a Bakumon.

423
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:14,223
Aren't they supposed
to eat bad dreams?

424
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:15,625
-You sap.

425
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:17,527
Did it occur to you that
Cherubimon may have turned him

426
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:18,127
evil?

427
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:19,028
-But how?

428
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:20,363
-I have no idea.

429
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:22,798
Ah, he's supposed to be wearing
this power ring.

430
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,700
But apparently Cherubimon
has taken it away.

431
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:28,838
-Nightmare syndrome!

432
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,685
-What?

433
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:44,287
-These are not your friends.

434
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,055
Use your powers to
punish them.

435
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,928
-Huh?

436
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,930
-They're all against
you, Takuya.

437
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,598
Destroy them before
they destroy you.

438
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:03,139
-No, it's--

439
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:04,140
not real!

440
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:05,608
Now get out of my head!

441
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:12,949
TAKUYA (VOICEOVER): That's it.

442
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:16,252
Tommy must be having
this nightmare too.

443
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:17,453
-It's only a dream.

444
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,290
Bakumon has convinced him
that we're his enemy.

445
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,326
-Oh, no.

446
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,160
-Stop.

447
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,428
Tommy!

448
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:31,634
-My name is Kumamon, and you are
nothing but a big bully!

449
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,135
-No, you're wrong.

450
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:34,503
-Kumamon!

451
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:37,006
You're under the spell of
Bakumon's nightmare syndrome!

452
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:40,509
It isn't real, you
have to fight it!

453
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:41,510
-Agunimon.

454
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:42,845
You're not my enemy?

455
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:47,083
-Takuya!

456
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:48,584
-Wait! Don't do it!

457
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:49,919
-Ahhh!

458
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:55,024
It's time to end
this nightmare!

459
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:06,869
Now for some purification.

460
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,779
Fractal zone, digitize!

461
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:27,223
-Lobomon.

462
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:28,424
Wow, have you been fighting
somebody?

463
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:30,793
-Glad to have you back, Tommy.

464
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:31,627
-Tommy.

465
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:32,495
Don't you remember?

466
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:34,230
You just had a terrible
nightmare.

467
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:35,464
-Huh?

468
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:36,832
-That's right.

469
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:39,101
You gave us quite a scare
there, young man.

470
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,637
Bakumon's dream made you think
we were your enemies.

471
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:44,340
-Yeah, but it was actually
Cherubimon's fault.

472
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:47,476
-Bakumon's better now, He didn't
know what he was doing

473
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,310
at the time.

474
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:49,645
-I'm sorry.

475
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,148
From now on I promise I'll only
send you good dreams.

476
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:52,648
-Ah.

477
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:54,150
OK.

478
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:57,319
I had an adventure and I
don't even remember it!

479
00:19:57,386 --> 00:19:58,387
-It's good you don't.

480
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,525
-Thanks, Koji.

481
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:04,293
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

482
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,227
I owe you one.

483
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:06,696
-You don't owe me anything.

484
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,365
Besides, you're the one who
sensed something out there.

485
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:10,833
-Huh?

486
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:13,703
-I've always heard savages
rely on intuition.

487
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:15,204
-You really hate being
nice, don't you?

488
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:24,580
-I'm not sure I'll ever
understand them.

489
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:25,715
-Sweet dreams, children.

490
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:39,528
[snoring]

491
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:42,932
-Now is the way to sleep.

492
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:45,101
Oh?

493
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:48,137
-Your beast spirit awaits,
Koji Minamoto.

494
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,939
But first, you have some
growing to do.

495
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:51,073
-Huh?

496
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:52,074
-What?

497
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:54,777
What does she mean by that?

498
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:57,279
NARRATOR: So Koji thought
he had all the answers.

499
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,647
Typical.

500
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:01,517
There are only more questions
ahead, on the next Digimon,

501
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,686
Digital Monsters!
