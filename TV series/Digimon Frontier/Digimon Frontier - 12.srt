NARRATOR: Bokomon took the gang
to get their futures told

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,038
by Shamanmon the fortuneteller,
but just as

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:07,007
Shamanmon started the
Premonition Tango, Grumblemon

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,176
attacked, and this time
he brought a friend.

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,845
With the strength of Golemon
behind him, Grumblemon stole

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,147
Tommy's spirit, then
BurningGreymon joined the

7
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,716
fight, but he didn't know the
difference between good guys

8
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,184
and bad guys.

9
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,353
Goggle head figured out that it
was Shamanmon possessed by

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,355
a Beast Spirit, but when he
freed Shamanmon, the Beast

11
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,557
Spirit possessed him, instead.

12
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,993
When he started attacking his
friends, Koji had to digivolve

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,028
to KendoGarurumon to stop him.

14
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,764
Man, did these guys have
control issues or what?

THEME SONG: Look to the past as
we head for the future to

18
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,945
reclaim the Digital World.

19
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,949
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

20
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,585
by the lessons we've learned.

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,225
As we work towards one solution

22
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,227
through a Spirit Evolution.

23
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,800
Digimon!

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,503
Forever united as one.

25
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,804
Digimon!

26
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,140
Together the battles are won.

27
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,141
Digimon!

28
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,444
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

29
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,448
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30

If we're all for one world,
there's a wold for us all.

Digimon!

00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,165
-Takuya, stop!

33
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,870
-Put me down!

[screaming]

35
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,218
-There has to be a
way to stop him.

36
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,187
-But how?

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,555
-Isn't there anything
we can do?

38
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,756
-Yes.

39
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,391
Get out of here before
it's too late.

40
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,392
KENDOGARURUMON (OFFSCREEN):
All right.

41
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:08,562
If it's a fight you
want, fight me!

42
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,131
-Don't look at me!

43
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,467
-Is he really going to
try to fight him?

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,801
What if they hurt each other?

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,441
-Lupine Laser!

[shouting]

47
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,983
-Not so fast!

48
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,619
Come on, before one
of us gets hurt!

49
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,653
-Pyro Barrage!

50
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,797
-We have to do something before
he levels the whole

51
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,866
forest, or the whole world.

52
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,200
-I'll stop him.

53
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,673
-Howling Star!

54
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,675
-You were supposed to stop him,
not help wreck the place!

55
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,512
-If we ever have to fight
trees, he'll be deadly.

56
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,680
-Then count your blessings
we're not trees.

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,516
Let's go.

58
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,552
-(THINKING) If I could only
Spirit Evolve to Kumamon.

-Crystal Breeze!

60
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,661
-(THINKING) But I can't.

61
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,530
-Tommy, this is no time
for daydreaming.

62
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,532
Come on.

63
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,267
-Oh, man.

64
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,435
If he keeps this up, they're
going to have to rename it the

65
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,569
Burnt to a Crisp Kingdom.

66
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:34,047
-Takuya, don't!

67
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,282
It's me!

68
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:38,752
TAKUYA (THINKING): Wait.

69
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,588
What am I doing?

70
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:45,092
-I can't believe this is how
I'm gonna check out.

71
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,093
Gotta stay calm.

72
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,729
Stay in control.

73
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,063
TAKUYA (THINKING): These
guys are my friends.

74
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,599
I have to keep reminding
myself that.

75
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,468
Wait a second.

76
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,471
If they are my friends, why
are they attacking me?

77
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,406
Maybe they are the enemy.

[roaring]

79
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,320
-What a horrible noise.

80
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,655
It doesn't even sound
human at all.

81
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,656
-Well, of course not.

82
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,158
That's why they call
it a Beast Spirit.

83
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,226
Isn't it obvious?

84
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,827
-But it's like Takuya
isn't even in there.

85
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,062
Can't we help him?

86
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,663
-Not really.

87
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,499
He has to learn to control the
Beast Spirit on his own.

88
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,967
Sooner or later, he will.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,702
-It's the later part
I'm worried about.

-Back to the burning forest!

93
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,913
I can't believe I said that.

94
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,581
-(THINKING) I can't
keep running away.

95
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,884
Takuya needs me.

gonna fall down.

-(THINKING) But what can I do?

112
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,956
Those kids were bigger
than me, and

113

BurningGreymon is way bigger.

I know you don't want
to hurt any of us!

This isn't really you.

and afraid.

We're your friends.

Don't you remember
what happened?

-Stop, Tommy!

-Frozen Tundra!

-Tommy, you have to stop this.

137
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,968
-My name is Kumamon, and you're

138
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:45,571
nothing but a big bully.

139
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:46,905
-No, you're wrong.

140
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,807
-Kumamon, you're under
the spell of

141
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:50,008
Bakemon's Nightmare Syndrome.

142
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,310
What you're feeling
isn't real.

143
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:53,812
You have to fight it!

144
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:58,183
-Agunimon, you're
not my enemy?

145
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,320
I learned that true courage
isn't paying bullies back.

146
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,655
It's just standing up to them.

147
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,125
You helped me see that fighting
back in fear is just

148
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,659
as bad as being a bully.

149
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:08,794
You can't let fear
control you.

150
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,129
You have to fight it.

151
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,801
I know you won't hurt me if you
remember we're friends.

TAKUYA (THINKING): Wait.

Tommy?

154
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,919
What was I going to do?

155
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,556
What did I do?

00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:38,524

Some DigiDestined I am.

00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:17,629

Thanks, Tommy.

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,798
-Oh, it was nothing.

167
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,166
But you're welcome.

168
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,367
-It wasn't nothing.

169
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,037
It was one of the bravest
things I've ever seen.

170
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,505
-Well, I owed you one.

171
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,040
Now we're even.

172
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:29,841
-Oh, the trials of friendship.

173
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,711
Take note, you two, for when
you get your Beast Spirits.

174
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:34,346
-Um, why don't you go first?

175
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:35,314
-Oh, no, you.

176
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,648
I insist.

177
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,351
-Yes, well, of course you still
have to get back those

178
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,853
spirits that you lost
to Grumblemon.

179
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:43,689
-Thanks for the reminder.

180
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,657
(THINKING) But what good does
it do us if we get all those

181
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,493
spirits back, and we can't
even control them?

182
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,530
-How are we going to find
Grumblemon, anyway?

183
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,600
-Jeez, it seems harder to avoid
him than to find him.

184
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,235
I think we should
just keep going.

185
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,103
I bet we'll run into him
sooner or later.

186
00:08:58,136 --> 00:08:59,605
-Sounds good to me.

187
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,240
JP (OFFSCREEN): I knwo yo want
your spirit back, but how can

188
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,741
running into Grumblemon
sound good?

189
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,743
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard.

190
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,245
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): You better
hope you'll get your Beast

191
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,779
Spirit first, pal, because
I'm coming after

192
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,414
you when I get mine.

193
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,716
JP (OFFSCREEN): Now I know
what Bokomon meant by the

194
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,117
trials of friendship.

195
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,786
-The book says the roots make
the forest paths treacherous.

196
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:16,088
Oh, that's ridicu-- oh!

197
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,892
JP (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
check it out.

198
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:22,761
What's up with these roots?

199
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:25,931
Oh, do those symbol stands
for hugs and kisses?

200
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:26,665
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

201
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:27,432
Like you'd know.

202
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:28,634
-Hey!

203
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,635
-It's like a maze.

204
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,802
-Well, not really.

205
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,638
All the roots connect.

206
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,006
-Well, make it a maze.

207
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,108
Everyone get your own
vine, and let's go.

208
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,809
-Cool, I'll take this one.

209
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,611
-And this one's mine.

210
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,612
-Ready? Set?

211
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,847
Go.

212
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,487
[laughter]

213
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,491
-We win!

214
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,498
-Yeah, so what's the big deal?

215
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:03,969
[shouting]

216
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:04,870
-Help me up!

217
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,138
-Stop struggling.

218
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:07,739
You're only gonna make
things worse.

219
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,508
-Easy for you to say.

220
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,709
-Here!

221
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:11,743
-About time.

222
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,021
-Look who here.

223
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:23,722
-It's Grumblemon!

224
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:24,556
No!

225
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,191
-Grumblemon yes!

226
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:28,627
And you just where I want you.

227
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,728
Ha ha ha!

228
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,800
Looks like you two won race.

229
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,470
Too bad winners now
big losers!

230
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:43,139
It's spirit taking time!

231
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:44,774
-Actually, I think it's getting
stuck in the mud time.

232
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,476
-You not quiet!

233
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,145
You learn hard way it really
hammer smashing time!

234
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:49,912
Got it?

235
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:51,748
And I'll take care of you!

236
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,950
-Why can't we just be friends?

237
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,251
-Quiet now!

238
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:57,286
No one give me much
trouble as you.

239
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:58,287
You know you lose.

240
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:59,956
Why not you play nice?

241
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,024
-So what?

242
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:02,525
We should just hand
over our spirits?

243
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:04,293
Forget it.

244
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:06,295
That's never going to happen,
especially now that I have my

245
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:08,164
Beast Spirit!

246
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:10,767
-Now, why me not
afraid of that?

247
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,169
-Well, you should, because
it's very powerful!

248
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:16,839
-Only powerful if you can
control, and I betting that

249
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:20,343
you not learn yet, or why
you look so afraid.

250
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:22,679
See, you tell me all
I need know.

251
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:28,317
-Hurry!

252
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:29,352
-Execute!

253
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:32,922
Slide Evolution!

254
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:37,760
Gigasmon!

255
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:48,337
-Execute!

256
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:49,605
Spirit Evolution!

257
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:09,592
Agunimon!

258
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:15,298
-Hasn't the forest had
enough fire today?

259
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:16,632
-Right!

260
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,306
Quagmire Twister!

261
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:27,310
[shouting]

262
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,812
-Whoa!

263
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,814
-Agunimon!

264
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:32,815
Ah!

265
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:34,984
-Gigasmon, put him down!

266
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:39,322
-If you want him, you
have come take him!

267
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:41,157
-Don't worry, we're fine now.

268
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:42,658
I mean, we're kind
of stuck here.

269
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:43,993
-OK.

270
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:49,565
GIGASMON (OFFSCREEN): If play
hide and seek, you really need

271
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,867
seek, you know?

272
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,881
-Tommy!

273
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:09,552
-Not bad.

274
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:12,555
Course, not good, either.

275
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:13,890
-When I get my hands on you!

276
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:19,529
-No!

277
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:24,433
-Agunimon!

278
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,769
[screaming]

279
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:27,804
-Yeah, you tough guy.

280
00:13:27,837 --> 00:13:29,772
Ha ha ha!

281
00:13:29,805 --> 00:13:31,741
-No!

282
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:34,610
This is gonna hurt!

283
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:35,611
-Oh, no!

284
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:36,946
-Oh, my!

285
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:37,980
-I was right.

286
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:43,286
-Takuya!

287
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:45,988
-Are you OK?

288
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,123
-Yeah.

289
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,025
But Tommy's still in trouble,
and I don't

290
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,359
know how to save him.

291
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:52,595
-Looks like a Human Spirit
just can't compete with a

292
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:53,963
Beast Spirit.

293
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:56,032
You back to turn into
BurningGreymon.

294
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:57,333
-But I can't.

295
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,002
What if I lose control again?

296
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:00,836
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Don't
be afraid.

297
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:03,005
Just remember what Tommy said.

298
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:04,340
-Huh?

299
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:07,677
-I learned that true courage
isn't paying bullies back,

300
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:10,346
it's just standing up to them.

301
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,648
You helped me see that fighting
back in fear is just

302
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:14,016
as bad as being a bully.

303
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:15,651
You can't let fear
control you.

304
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:16,986
You have to fight it.

305
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:23,025
I know you won't hurt me if you
remember we're friends.

306
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,027
-Wait.

307
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:26,329
Tommy?

308
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:27,530
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Remember
who your friends are,

309
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,265
and you'll be fine.

310
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:30,166
-What?

311
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:33,569
Not want to help friend?

312
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:35,238
-Tommy!

313
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:36,739
-Ha ha ha!

314
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,742
Play time over, now
give me spirit.

315
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:44,213
You hurry, maybe you save him.

316
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:45,748
-No, don't do it, Takuya!

317
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:47,950
Don't trade your
spirit for me!

318
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:51,220
It's OK. I'm not afraid!

319
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:52,421
No!

320
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:52,989
GIGASMON (OFFSCREEN): Hm.

321
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:55,057
Some friend you be.

322
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:58,160
Won't even give up Beast
Spirit to save friend.

323
00:14:58,194 --> 00:14:59,395
-I'm not afraid of you!

324
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:02,732
-You should be.

325
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:06,669
[shouting]

326
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:07,303
-No!

327
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:08,671
Tommy!

328
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:10,139
That's it!

329
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:11,641
If Tommy can show courage
in the face of that

330
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:13,476
freak, then so can I!

331
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:23,819
-Execute!

[screaming]

334
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:45,708
-BurningGreymon!

335
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:50,046
-So, let's see if can control.

336
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,080
-Takuya!

337
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,054
-Whoa!

338
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,959
GIGASMON (OFFSCREEN):
Not going make it!

339
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:18,183
-Tommy, you OK?

340
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:18,951
-Yeah.

341
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,352
Hey, check it out!

342
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:23,088
You got control of your
Beast Spirit.

343
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:24,256
-Thanks to you, buddy.

344
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,491
-I'll help the others.

345
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,659
Now go get him!

346
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:27,860
-Right!

347
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:33,332
You're the one who likes
twisters, right?

348
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:34,366
Well, enjoy!

349
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:45,544
-That fun!

350
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:46,979
Now your turn!

351
00:16:51,183 --> 00:16:52,184
-Pyro--

352
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:54,353
wait, I'll set fire to
the whole forest.

353
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,921
OK, I'll do it the old
fashioned way.

354
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:04,930
Execute!

355

Agunimon!

357
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,614
I have to lead him away
from the others.

358
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:23,983
Tag, you're it!

359
00:17:29,588 --> 00:17:31,156
What's the matter, slowpoke?

360
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,558
Can't you catch me?

361
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:40,666
Hey, Gigasmon.

362
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:43,001
You're not getting tired
now, are ya?

363
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,636
[panting]

364
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,973
-You gotta start working
out, buddy.

365
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:53,612
-Even if me tired, you still
get defeated good.

366
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:57,816
Did you forget me warrior
of earth?

367
00:17:57,883 --> 00:18:00,152
-Actually, I did forget
about that.

368
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:01,286
-Tectonic Slam!

369
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,192
-Oh, man!

370
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:08,193
-Ha ha ha!

371
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,631
-What are you excited about?

372
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:14,700
You missed me, earth boy.

373
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,202
By the way, I think you
forgot something, too.

374
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:18,337
Execute!

375
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:22,207
Slide Evolution!

376
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:28,380
BurningGreymon!

377
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:31,383
Out here there's no forest
to catch fire.

378
00:18:31,383 --> 00:18:32,951
-Uh-oh.

379
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:34,053
-Pyro Barrage!

380
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:40,926
Wildfire Tsunami!

381
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:51,970
-You did it!

382
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:01,814
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Gigasmon's spirit.

383
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,782
-And now for Tommy's.

384
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,417
Here ya go, buddy.

385
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:06,685
Got a little present for ya.

386
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:13,025
-Hey, my spirit.

387
00:19:13,058 --> 00:19:14,359
Yeah!

388
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:16,094
This is better than birthdays
and Christmas combine!

389
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:17,663
-And now to get Zoe's spirit.

390
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:23,635
-Hm?

391
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:27,005
-Me leave while behind!

392
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:28,674
-No!

393
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:30,008
He still has my spirit.

394
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:39,601
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN): Can't
believe me get spirit taken.

395
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:42,737
Me make kids pay, and
pay big time.

396
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:44,239
RANAMON (OFFSCREEN): Goodie.

397
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:45,807
The beast with brains of dirt
has another incompetent plan.

398
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:48,343
Honey, you couldn't
outwit a nitwit.

399
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:48,977
-What?

400
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,511
Who there?

401
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:50,845
That you, Ranamon?

402
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:54,682
-How many warriors of
water do you know?

403
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:56,518
Now listen up, rockhead.

404
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:58,953
Stop sneaking around behind our
backs trying to impress

405
00:19:58,987 --> 00:19:59,821
Cherubimon.

406
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,156
-You back off.

407
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,358
What I do no business of you.

408
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,959
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN):
Thou art mistaken.

409
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:05,860
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Mercurymon.

410
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:07,529
Warrior of steel.

411
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:10,732
-Thy thoughtless acts reflect
badly upon us.

412
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:13,835
Thou should study an opponent
first, not just boorishly rush

413
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:14,569
into battle.

414
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,137
-Got that right.

415
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:17,972
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Arbormon, warrior of wood.

416
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:20,375
-Yo, you want I should rough
'em up for ya's?

417
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,209
-Enough.

418
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,544
Our circle is complete.

419
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:24,312
-But Duskmon, warrior
of darkness--

420
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:27,715
-Oh, sugar, he wouldn't join
us in a million years.

421
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:29,350
-Forsooth.

422
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:30,585
He hath no heart for battle,
and does little more than

423
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:32,220
stare at the moons.

424
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,223
We shall rule this world, whilst
his only domain shall

425
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:37,725
be the world he sees when
he closeth his eyes.

426
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,260
[laughter]

427
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,762
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Me no get.

428
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:44,771
-Ugh, I'm surrounded
by buffoons.

429
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,272
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Isn't
that pretty?

430
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:48,942
ZOE (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, I guess.

431
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:50,443
-Come on, guys.

432
00:20:50,443 --> 00:20:54,180
We've got a long road
ahead of us.

433
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:55,348
NARRATOR: That's for sure.

434
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:56,249
They barely beat Gigasmon,
and now there are

435
00:20:56,316 --> 00:20:57,584
four other bad guys?

436
00:20:57,651 --> 00:20:59,953
This could get ugly on the next

437
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:02,689
Digimon, Digital Monsters.
