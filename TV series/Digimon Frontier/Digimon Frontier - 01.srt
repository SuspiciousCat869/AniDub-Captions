Look to the past as we head for
the future, to reclaim the

Digital World.

With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all!

It's Shinya's birthday.

And don't even think of eating
that cake, Takuya.

44
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,252
Now, honey, I know that you're
busy, but how would you feel

45
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,087
if the kids didn't acknowledge
your birthday?

46

well, OK, well, that

wasn't their fault.

Take the 5:45 outbound train.

-This is way better
than being bored.

00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,850
-Watch this.

173
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,286
Hey, honey, you want
some chocolate?

174
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:06,820
Move!

175
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,621
So, my name's JP.

176
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,457
What's yours?

177
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,291
-I'm Zoe.

178
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,026
It's nice to meet you.

179
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:13,526
-And I'm--

180
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,227
I'm Takuya.

181
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,795
Hi there.

182
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,365
-I'm--

183
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,167
-What?

184
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:26,072
-I'm Tommy, but I didn't want
to get on this train.

185
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,707
-What are you saying?

186
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:31,011
-[whimpering]

187
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,681
Two kids-- bullies--
and they--

188
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,050
pushed me on the train
and shut the door!

189
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,057
Why are kids always
picking on me?

190
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,859
JP (OFFSCREEN): Jeez, that
kid's like a faucet.

191
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,693
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): JP!

192
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,027
Don't worry, Tommy.

193
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,696
You're safe now that
you're with us.

194
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,298
[growling]

195
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,634
-Huh?

196
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,603
[screaming]

197
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,907
-Huh?

198
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,411
Huh?

199
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,580
Whoa!

200
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,582
[beeping]

201
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,751
-What's going on?

202
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,752
FEMALE VOICE (ON PHONE):
Welcome to the

203
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,754
Digital World, Takuya.

204
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,190
This is your D-Tector.

205
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,092
-Digital World?

206
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:19,993
You're kidding.

207
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,929
What have I gotten
myself into?

208
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:30,470
[growling]

209
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,204
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Did you
guys get that message?

210
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,710
I'm guessing yes.

211
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,979
[yelling like a train whistle]

212
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,483
-Oh, you can hear
that on Mars!

213
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,751
Man!

214
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,319
-Are those ghosts?

215
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,353
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): They
look like it.

216
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,254
JP (OFFSCREEN): Or
marshmallows.

217
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,489
They'd go great with
chocolate.

218
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:58,498
[laughing]

219
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,833
-[screaming]

220
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:07,273
-Probably ghosts of kids
that came here before.

221
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,741
What have gotten myself into?

222
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,245
A-and what if there's no way
of getting back out?

223
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,580
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Jeez,
calm down, Takuya.

224
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,281
We're all in this together.

225
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:33,697
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): I bet that's
the train station.

226
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:36,100
I hope there aren't any more of
those ghost things there.

227
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,268
Not that I was scared
or anything.

228
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:40,103
JP (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, I always
scream in terror

229
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:41,738
when I'm not afraid.

230
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:43,407
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Ugh. Boys.

231
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:56,420
-[groans]

232
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,421
-Human kids!

233
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,289
-Someone to play with!

234
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:00,524
-Just don't break
them this time!

235
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:09,967
-Hear that first
step's a doozy.

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,968
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

237
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:13,337
-Is it me, or did the
train just talk?

238
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,639
-Hey, but, I'm not just
any old train.

239
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:18,475
I'm Trailmon, and I'm
alive just like you.

240
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:20,878
Although I am more handsome than
you scrunched up little

241
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:22,346
pugs, thank you very much.

242
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,482
Anywho, this here is
Flame Terminal.

243
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:27,751
You're in the heart of
a Digimon village.

244
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:29,253
-Digimon village?

245
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:32,089
-Be our pals!

246
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:35,492
-Our last friends didn't
last very long.

247
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:38,762
-I have enough friends.

248
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,063
-[crying]

249
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:43,433
I didn't even wanna
be on this train!

250
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:46,436
-Sorry you feel bad, kiddo,
but I can't stick around.

251
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,738
If you want to go home,
you'll have to

252
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:50,040
find a Spirit or something.

253
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,075
-This kid should get a
job as a fire alarm.

254
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:53,210
-What's a Spirit?

255
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:53,877
And where do we get one?

256
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,913
Hello!

257
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:56,780
-Where are you going?

258
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:57,414
Give us an answer!

259
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:58,749
Hey!

260
00:11:58,815 --> 00:11:59,716
-Hey yourself!

261
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:02,219
I've got a schedule to keep!

262
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,754
-So guess that's it.

263
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,390
We're all alone.

264
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:06,890
-Wait!

265
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,724
Come back here!

266
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:08,392
-Yeah!

267
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,227
Pretty please?

268
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:10,727
-[crying]

269
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:12,162
Take me home!

270
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:16,433
-Hey, wait!

271
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:20,137
Tommy, stop!

272
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,605
JP (OFFSCREEN): Why do I get
the feeling we're going to

273
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:23,140
spend all our time rescuing
the baby?

274
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:29,646
-Tommy!

275
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,782
-Go away!

276
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:33,650
-This isn't helping!

277
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:35,118
You're gonna fall!

278
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:37,621
-At least I won't
be here anymore!

279
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:39,056
-I'll take you home!

280
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,457
That's right!

281
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:42,125
Trailmon said that if we
find this Spirit, we

282
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:44,628
can go home, right?

283
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:45,796
-Right.

284
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:48,372
OK, I'm coming back.

285
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:48,865
Whoa!

286
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,167
-Tommy!

287
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,838
-Don't move!

288
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,840
I'm coming to get you.

289
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:03,380
-Look what you've
gotten me into!

290
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:10,687
-It's a human.

291
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,556
-You think everything's
a human!

292
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:14,358
-Don't start with me, you!

293
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:15,292
-I'm human.

294
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,860
Would you mind getting
off me now?

295
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,195
-I'm so sorry.

296
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:18,629
His fault.

297
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:19,696
-Yeah, my fault.

298
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:21,031
Hey!

299
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:25,769
-What is that?

300
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:27,738
-That is one bad dog.

301
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:29,406
Bad dog.

302
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:32,943
Cerberumon, special attack
Emerald Blaze, and that's why

303
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:34,978
we need your help.

304
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:38,415
-Where's the Ancient Spirit?

305
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:40,584
-So whenever you're ready,
go and get him!

306
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:41,918
-That would be good.

307
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:45,122
-I can sense the Spirit's
presence all over this town.

308
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:47,357
I must destroy it!

309
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,258
-No way!

310
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:49,192
It's mine!

311
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,694
I-- uh.

312
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:51,662
-[nervous laughter]

313
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:54,498
-Then you shall be destroyed
with it!

314
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:55,532
Emerald Blaze!

315
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:01,471
-What?

316
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,306
Are you crazy?

317
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:05,175
Run already!

318
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,811
-Yeah, but where am
I supposed to go?

319
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,146
-Anywhere but here!

320
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:15,318
That mutt is going to eat
up the whole village!

321
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:16,253
-Oh, great!

322
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:19,690
-There go the train tracks!

323
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:20,257
-Takuya!

324
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,425
-Oh, no!

325
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:31,101
-[screaming]

326
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:34,871
-[beeping]

327
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:36,106
-Hey, my D-Tector!

328
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:39,710
No way.

329
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:51,822
What is--

330
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:52,889
-It's the Spirit.

331
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:59,563
Spirit of Flame.

332
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:00,831
-Spirit?

333
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:03,767
That wasn't so hard.

334
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,102
Time to go home!

335
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:10,474
But how am I supposed
to get it?

336
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:11,775
And what do I do with
it when I do?

337
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:13,777
-No need to worry about that!

338
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,979
For it will soon be destroyed.

339
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:16,780
Ha!

340
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,285
[growling]

341
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:29,860
-[whimpering]

342
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:33,463
-This sure rates pretty high on
a scale of one to stupid!

343
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,068
Oh, man!

344
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,674
-[growling]

345
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,044
Get out of my way, human,
or suffer my wrath!

346
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:48,845
-No!

347
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,934
But I hope his wrath isn't
as bad as it sounds.

348
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:57,636
-Augh!

349
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,506
The Spirit's power!

350
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,177
Oh, that hurt.

351
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:06,212
-But what about Takuya?

352
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:10,850
-I'm fine.

353
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,851
But--

354
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:17,189
Ancient Spirit.

355
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:18,524
Huh?

356
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:26,432
Spirit!

357
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,979
FEMALE VOICE (ON PHONE):
It is time.

358
00:16:40,012 --> 00:16:50,122
-[yells]

359
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:51,857
Execute Spirit Evolution!

360
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:14,313
Agunimon!

361
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:17,016
[yells]

362
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,484
-What is this?

363
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:19,552
A human turned into a Digimon?

364
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:23,522
-What did he turn into?

365
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,157
-Well, let me see.

366
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:28,027
Hmm.

367
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:29,995
-No way.

368
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,164
-Every way.

369
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:36,268
-Big and red, likes flame,
not Santa Claus-- oh!

370
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:37,336
Agunimon!

371
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:41,707
Oh, my!

372
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:42,942
I mean, oh my!

373
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:44,076
-No matter who you
are, you'll lose!

374
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:48,214
Emerald Blaze!

375
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:02,310
-Wow!

376
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:03,496
-Molto cool!

377
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:07,633
-Portals of Darkness!

378
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:22,314
-Whoa!

379
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:28,287
-Now we'll see how you fare
on my turf-- darkness!

380
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:37,129
[cackles]

381
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,297
No one escapes the darkness!

382
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,398
Emerald Blaze!

383
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,508
-How about I defeat you
without escaping?

384
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,080
Pyro Tornado!

385
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:55,714
-No!

386
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,016
You can't!

387
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:06,559
-I have to admit it,
I'm impressed.

388
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,361
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): But what
if he's in trouble?

389
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:09,795
-Trouble?

390
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:12,698
No no no no no.

391
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,266
-A human child defeated me?

392
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,601
No!

393
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:23,242
-That's amazing!

394
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,577
-He's beautiful!

395
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,582
-Now to take the Fractal Code.

396
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:58,711
-Hey, look at the pretty
little light.

397
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:00,312
-You nincompoop.

398
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:02,314
That pretty little light is
Cerberumon's essence.

399
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:04,483
So it looks like we're
not done with him.

400
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:05,818
Buzz off!

401
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:09,221
You said you didn't want
to carry the book.

402
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:09,822
-Whoa.

403
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,923
Hm?

404
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:17,696
-[panting]

405
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:20,599
Wow, that's tiring.

406
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,001
But what-- what happened?

407
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:24,603
How did I know how to
do all that stuff?

408
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:25,270
FEMALE VOICE (ON PHONE):
You are Digidestined.

409
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:26,772
-I'm what now?

410
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:27,706
FEMALE VOICE (ON PHONE):
Digidestined.

411
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,608
Chosen for great things.

412
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,076
But don't be frightened.

413
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,278
The one who chose you is you.

414
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:34,947
-I chose myself?

415
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,050
I guess this means we're
not going home.

416
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:51,397
FEMALE SPEAKER NARRATING: These
guys have no idea what

417
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,064
they've gotten themselves
into.

418
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:53,732
But I'll bet you know.

419
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:56,651
Find out on the next Digimon:
Digital Monsters.
