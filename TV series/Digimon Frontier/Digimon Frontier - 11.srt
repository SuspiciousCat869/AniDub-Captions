RIKA NARRATING: After getting
this weird email, Kouji broke

2
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:04,534
away from the others to
find his Beast Spirit.

3
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,335
Not wanting to miss the show,
Neemon and Bokomon

4
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:07,702
decided to tag along.

5
00:00:07,735 --> 00:00:09,502
The three of them ran into
Gotsumon, a rock Digimon who

6
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:11,835
was looking for this jewel that
was supposed to awaken

7
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:13,169
the spirit.

8
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:14,870
Anyway, their old pal
Grumblemon came back

9
00:00:14,903 --> 00:00:16,203
for some more fun.

10
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:18,170
When Takuya and the rest of the
gang showed up, Gigasmon

11
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,171
defeated them and ended up
taking Zoe's spirit.

12
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:23,505
So Kouji used the jewel Gotsumon
found to unleash his

13
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:24,838
Beast Spirit.

14
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:26,105
He digivolved to KendoGarurumon
and sent the

15
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:27,505
legendary mole right
over the edge.

16
00:00:27,572 --> 00:00:30,505
Sure hope he can swim.

17
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,573
THEME SONG: Digimon!

18
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,075
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

19
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,208
Digital World.

20
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:48,743
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

21
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:50,210
by the lessons we've learned.

22
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:58,612
As we work towards
one solution,

23
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:01,945
through a Spirit Evolution!

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,880
I am the one!

25
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:05,880
I am the one!

26
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:06,546
Digimon!

27
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:09,247
Forever united as one!

28
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,447
Digimon!

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,780
Together the battles are won!

30
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:14,414
Digimon!

31
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:16,982
Through us let your
spirit evolve!

32
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:20,949
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

33
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:25,683
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

34
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:26,683
I am the one.

35
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,251
I am the one.

Digimon!

37
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:43,786
-Them stupid children.

38
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,287
They think can me defeat.

39
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,988
Me teach them lesson or two!

40
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:55,990
KendoGarurumon keep me from
stealing everyone Spirits.

41
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:02,291
Me have to take him
out of picture.

42

-[roars]

43

-And me think me
know just how.

[cackles]

45
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:14,493
By power of great spirit of
darkness who live beneath

46
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:18,660
ground, me command big
thing that was sealed

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,828
away to be free then.

48
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:24,328
My sword you be, my
shield you be.

49
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:25,362
Me commanding you!

50
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:37,098
Not even legendary Beast Warrior
of Light can stand up

51
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:41,331
to power of earth itself!

55
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,869
Good morning, new friend.

56
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:07,236
How was nap?

57
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:08,303
-Master.

D-TECTOR NARRATING: Golemon.

59
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:13,804
Made almost entirely of stone.

60
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:17,538
His special attack, Sulfur
Plume, is a blast of volcanic

61
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:20,239
gas that turns his
enemies to ashes.

-[roars]

-Watch out, kids.

64
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:27,807
Here me come.

65
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:33,742
Going down!

66
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:35,642
-Isn't it nice to have a moment
of peace and quiet?

67
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,910
-Let's have some fun
and play charades!

68
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:39,576
-I thought you said fun.

-[laughing]

70
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,510
-I've always wanted to try that
thing where I'm trapped

71
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:45,077
in an imaginary box.

72
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:47,411
-If only the box were real.

73
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:48,344
-Oh, man.

74
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:51,512
I really messed up.

75
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:52,846
-You're finished!

00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,780

-Zoe!

80
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:17,217
He got her Spirit!

81
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,784
-Zoe, no!

82
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:20,951
-It's OK, Tommy.

83
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:23,018
What happened wasn't
your fault.

84
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,286
-Well, the next time I see that
guy, I'll get your Spirit

85
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:27,486
back, even if I have
to do it by myself.

86
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:30,153
-Why would you want to do
something like that?

87
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,719
-Based on your last encounter,
I don't think that

88
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:32,886
would be very wise.

89
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,153
-So what?

90
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,820
It sure beats sitting around
here doing nothing.

91
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,521
She needs my help.

92
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:41,855
-You have a one track
mind, buddy.

93
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,822
We can't just run
out and fight.

94
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:46,323
We have to get to the
Forest Terminal.

95
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:46,989
-So what?

96
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:48,757
Then we just let him win?

97
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,157
I can't just sit back and let
Grumblemon run around with

98
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,324
Zoe's Spirit!

99
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,491
-It's OK, JP.

100
00:04:57,091 --> 00:05:00,092
-No, it's really not OK, Zoe.

101
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:03,359
The Spirit Of is yours, and you
were destined to find it.

102
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:05,693
So we're going to get
it back for you.

103
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:07,860
-Nice sentiment, but we have
more important things to do

104
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,928
than fight a battle
we can't win.

105
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:12,028
-What is your problem, Kouji?

106
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,361
You'd be going crazy if your
Spirit was stolen!

107
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:15,029
-Hmph.

108
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,762
-But hey.

109
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:18,029
I understand if you're afraid.

110
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:20,863
Even the great Kouji has no
chance against Grumblemon.

111
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:21,963
-What?

112
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:23,563
-Who cares if you have
your Beast Spirit?

113
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,530
You can't even control it.

114
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,530
-Hey, stop it!

115
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,464
-Knock it off, JP!

116
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,598
-I guess I'm the only one
who wants to help Zoe!

117
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:31,032
-Guys, forget it.

118
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,765
Let's just go to the
Forest Terminal.

119
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:35,065
-Don't you start talking
crazy, too.

120
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:35,565
-All right.

121
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:36,399
That's it.

122
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:38,066
I've had enough.

123
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:39,933
I think it's time to do
something more productive than

124
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,233
stand here and argue.

125
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:44,067
But do I dare reveal this
great secret to you?

126
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,267
Are you ready?

127
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,734
Well, I guess there's only
one way to find out.

128
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:49,235
Ahem.

129
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,069
My friends, I believe the
time has finally come.

130
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,236
-Has come for what?

131
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,102
-What do you mean?

132
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:56,570
-Time to show you the
path of wisdom.

133
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,270
-Well, there's a change.

134
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,337
-Yeah, no kidding.

135
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,570
-Wisdom is a path which
is not easily walked.

136
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:05,905
You must think about every
choice, consider every option,

137
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:08,838
and know where each
step will lead.

It seems that wisdom has
landed in a mud puddle.

your wise solution?

Fortune telling.

telling?

144

BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Shamanmon
is the wisest

00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:27,208
Digimon of them all.

146
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:28,276
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): If I'd have
said that, you'd have

147
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:29,043
told me I was crazy.

148
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:29,976
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
You are crazy, but

149
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:31,043
that's beside the point.

150
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:38,678
-Step right up.

151
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:40,111
Play Squeeze the Pudgy Bear.

152
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:41,378
Go away, kid, you bother me.

153
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:44,179
-Wow, I've never had my
fortune told before.

154
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:45,646
-I had my palm read once.

155
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:47,346
It took a week to get
the paint off.

156
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,713
-Come on.

157
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:49,480
Do you actually think
any of these weirdos

158
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:50,846
can tell the future?

159

-Oh, yes, round one.

160
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,647
And it's all so clear.

161
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,014
-I don't really believe in
any of this mumbo jumbo.

162
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,481
-There is a girl in your life
who thinks you're quite

00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:00,015
special.

164
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:00,683
-Huh?

165
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:02,149
-[laughs]

166
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,482
-I'm, uh, special?

167
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:05,916
-You know who I mean.

168
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,317
You were meant for each other.

169
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,317
-Really?

170
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:10,251
Yahoo!

171
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:11,818
-Come on, JP!

172
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:13,751
Let's get married!

173
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:15,718
-Indeedley-doo!

174
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:16,686
-Oh, JP.

175
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,219
This is a dream come true.

176
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:21,253
-You can say that again.

177
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:23,086
-Kiss me.

178
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:26,220
-[laughing]

179
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:27,387
-Look at me, guys!

180
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:28,854
I'm king of the world!

181
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:31,355
[laughing]

182
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:33,021
-JP, what are you doing?

183
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:34,056
-We're leaving now.

184
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,756
-Come on, come on, you can ask
me anything, short stuff!

185
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,524
-OK.

186
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:44,691
How do you polish that tuba?

187
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:46,091
-Wait a second, let me guess!

188
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:48,258
You're rather new to this
fortune telling stuff, aren't

189
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,059
you?

190
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:49,558
-Just ignore him.

191
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:51,259
What have you got?

192
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:54,225
-I shall conjure up a potion
made from orange juice and ear

193
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:58,060
wax, which I will place in a
hat and then drink while

194
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,127
standing on one leg.

195
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:01,627
-[groans]

196
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:04,428
-The result will be inspiring,
my friends.

197
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,395
Don't knock it until
you've tried it.

198
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:08,095
Where are you going?

199
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:09,429
-Over here.

200
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:10,762
-Check it out.

201
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,796
So what's your deal,
masked dude?

202
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:14,129
-Carrywood Method.

203
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,563
-Um, OK.

204
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,897
What exactly is the
Carrywood Method?

205
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,631
-I give you these heavy wooden
sticks, and then you to carry

206
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:25,432
them, one at a time.

207
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:26,966
-And?

208
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,499
What exactly would that tell
you about our future?

209
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:33,667
-That in the future, you
will be stronger.

210
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:36,834
The more wood you carry,
the stronger you get.

211
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:37,701
[laughs]

212
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,969
Carrywood! Get it?

213
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,601
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Why
are we here, Bokomon?

214
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,436
All these fortune tellers
are fake.

215
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:46,103
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Like
my Grandmamon's teeth.

216
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:47,270
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Have
a little faith, please.

217
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:48,437
I do know what I'm doing.

218
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:51,271
Shamanmon is the real thing.

219
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:54,538
Shamanmon, I call upon your
wisdom, your insight, and

220
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:59,172
basically, well, ask you for
two cents' worth of advice.

221
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,139
-Who calls upon Shamanmon?

222
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,006
-Weary travelers in need of
guidance from the universe.

223
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,506
-Oh, you'll get guidance,
all right.

224
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,374
[laughs]

225
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:10,140
-Wait a minute.

226
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,474
I remember you!

227
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:14,809
-You're one of those
nasty Goblinmon

228
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:16,241
from the Wind Factory!

229
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:17,642
-Come on, you guys!

230
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:18,476
Let's get him!

231
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:19,643
-No no no!

232
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,310
Shamanmon's one of
the good guys!

233
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:23,810
Shamanmon is a medium.

234
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:26,243
This all-seeing Digimon does a
ceremonial dance, and uses his

235
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:29,678
magical club to see
into the future.

236
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:32,845
-You should be very careful.

237
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:36,512
Ahead, you face much danger.

238
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:40,680
You will come up against a foe
you have faced before, but

239
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:44,847
this foe has a friend, and in
beating him, you will find a

240
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,881
friend is your foe.

241
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:47,781
-Huh?

242
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:49,115
-I don't buy it.

243
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:50,849
-Then listen to this!

244
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:55,850
The greatest test will
be faced by you two!

245
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:57,450
This test has the power
to destroy you all

246
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:59,084
if you're not careful.

247
00:09:59,117 --> 00:09:59,917
Heh.

248
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,950
-Hey, come back!

249
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:03,451
-Yeah, we don't want
to get destroyed!

250
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:08,252
-Then remember who you are, and
trust in each other and

251
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:09,553
your friendship--

252
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,279
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Right.

253
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,187
Run for it!

254
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:19,054

-Grumblemon back with big angry
surprise for little

Spirit kids!

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,223
-One of these days, I'm gonna
beat this jerk for good.

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,390
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): When
are you gonna learn?

262
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,458
How about working with
the rest of us, huh?

-[growls]

-Oh, my.

265
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:42,292
Just remember what you
have been told,

266
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:44,093
and you will prevail.

267
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:45,326
Huh?

-Whoa!

of there, you guys!

342
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:44,818
-Oh, you mean other
than bad news?

343
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:45,918
-Now, just hold on.

344
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:48,252
That thing may be on our side.

345
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:51,086
-OK, but somehow, I
don't think so.

is, he seems very upset.

-Oh, man.

355
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,653
-He's really strong.

356
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:52,187
-Too strong.

357
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,054
-If he comes after us, there's
no way we can beat him.

358
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:55,721
-Right.

359
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:56,721
Time to go.

360

00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,322
-Huh?

364
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,389
-I'm possessed by the
Beast Spirit!

365
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,323
-Shamanmon?

366

-Please, rescue me!

367
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:19,592
I was in the temple when the
Beast Spirit was revealed.

368
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:27,227
The instant I touched
it, I was possessed.

369

Please, help me!

370
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:37,062
-Agunimon, what are you doing?

371
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:38,062
-Don't worry, Shamanmon.

372
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:39,362
I can help you.

Now to free Shamanmon!

385
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:47,309
My D-Tector should
release him.

No!

has possessed him.
