NARRATOR: Taking Cherubimon out
seemed like the end of our

2
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:06,337
heroes' troubles, but this
Digimon named Baromon show up

3
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:07,605
with some bad news.

4
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:10,341
Super bad Lucemon is coming
back into the picture!

5
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:13,712
Baromon predicted Lucemon will
soon rule the Digital World

6
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:16,347
with his two Royal Knights,
Crusadermon and Dynasmon,

7
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:18,149
doing all the dirty work.

8
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,385
When the gang tried to stop
these chumps, the Knights took

9
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:21,686
our hero to the cleaners!

10
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:23,355
Baromon tried to shield
the kids, but

11
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:25,023
ended up checking out.

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,860
Even with MagnaGarurumon and
EmperorGreymon on their side,

13
00:00:28,927 --> 00:00:30,662
the future is pretty
much up in the air.

14
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:31,696
THEME SONG: Digimon!

15
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:41,606
We look to the past, as we head
for the future to reclaim

16
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:43,875
the Digital World.

17
00:00:43,908 --> 00:00:48,580
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

18
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:53,585
by the lessons we've learned.

19
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:57,589
As we work towards one solution

20
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:01,493
through a spirit evolution.

21
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:02,861
I am the one.

22
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:03,528
Huh!

23
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:05,029
I am the one.

24
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:06,431
Digimon!

25
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,400
Forever united as one.

26
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:10,435
Digimon!

27
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:13,071
Together the battles are won.

28
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:14,072
Digimon!

29
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:16,608
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

30
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:21,045
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

31
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,383
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

32
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,384
I am the one.

33
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:27,085
Huh!

34
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,386
I am the one.

35
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,288
Digimon!

36
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:33,324
PATAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Koichi, wake up!

37
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:38,930
Koichi, please!

38
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:39,998
Wake up!

39
00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:46,237
-Is that you, Patamon?

40
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:47,172
-Thank goodness.

41
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:48,506
Hey, guys, get over here.

42
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,474
Koichi's awake!

43
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:52,110
-Really?

44
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:54,279
-I hope you enjoyed nap time.

45
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:55,780
-Where is everyone?

46
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:56,648
Where's Koji?

47
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,516
-Out cold, I'm afraid.

48
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,418
They've been like
that for hours.

49
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:02,253
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): They didn't
even respond to my

50
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:05,056
wakee-wakee little
flaky dance.

51
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:06,257
-Ah!

52
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:08,827
Koji!

53
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,228
Oh, man.

54
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:11,763
Please be OK.

55
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:13,965
-I'm sure he'll be just
fine once he wakes up.

56
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:18,470
-What should we do now?

57
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:21,473
-We need to get these guys
to a safe place.

58
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:25,844
But where in the world
are we, anyway?

59
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:26,644
-Well--

60
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:27,445
-Uh--

61
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:28,479
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): I got it!

62
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,848
We're at the bottom of a hole!

63
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:33,318
-What a brilliant deduction,
Commander Obvious.

64
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:35,820
-I'm going to go find
us some help.

65
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:38,189
[music playing]

66
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:40,825
-Oh.

67
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:42,827
-This air is so thin.

68
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:45,964
No oxygen.

69
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,532
-Ah!

70
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:48,466
Ahhhh!

71
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,034
-Oh!

72
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,369
-Oh, no!

73
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,872
[yelling]

74
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:55,373
-Hey, what's up with this?

75
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:01,312
-Wow, how'd he do that?

76
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:04,315
-Koichi, since when do
you know how to fly?

77
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,950
-I don't know, but I dig it!

78
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,285
Ha!

79
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:11,522
-Oh.

80
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:12,657
Time out.

81
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:16,160
What is going on here?

82
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:17,562
Huh?

83
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:18,730
-No offense, little feller,
but you got that

84
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,365
human-in-the-headlights
look on you.

85
00:03:20,398 --> 00:03:22,233
You need a ride, don't you?

86
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:23,301
-Yeah, thanks.

87
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:28,139
-We're where?

88
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:30,375
You're telling me we're
on the moon?

89
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,043
-Yessiree, Mr. Greensleeves.

90
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:36,047
This here's one of the three
moons of the Digital World.

91
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,415
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN):
Starmon, a

92
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,584
helpful star-shaped Digimon.

93
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:42,020
His special attack
is Meteor Squall.

94
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:44,522
-I guess that explains why
I could jump so easily.

95
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:46,557
-What do you mean, Koichi?

96
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:49,227
-Well, the gravity here is a lot
less than on Earth, so we

97
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:50,395
all weigh less.

98
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:53,064
-Oh, now I'm really confused.

99
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:54,933
-Weight loss by relocation
is something

100
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:55,967
I could live without.

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,602
-I don't get it.

102
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:59,804
How did we all get to
the moon, anyway?

103
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,040
-I couldn't say for sure, but
you probably caught a warp

104
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,374
from an observation point.

105
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:05,376
That's how we got
here, uh huh.

106
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:09,681
[yelling]

107
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:11,215
-Heads up, fellas.

108
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:12,383
company's comin'.

109
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:14,218
-Yeah, that makes sense.

110
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:17,422
-Well, at least you're doing
all right, Koichi.

111
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:18,690
It's amazing.

112
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,959
You don't seem to be
injured at all.

113
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:22,627
-Yeah, you're right.

114
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,896
But how come I'm not?

115
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,798
-I guess you just got lucky.

116
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,267
KOICHI (THINKING):
But why just me?

117
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,769
Everyone else got hurt.

118
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:33,371
-Well, this is the Moon
Base where we live.

119
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:35,306
Welcome to home sweet dome!

120
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,607
[laughing]

121
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:42,080
-Yeppers.

122
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:43,414
It may not be much, but if
you're into tubes and

123
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:44,983
mountains, it's perfect.

124
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,818
Now let's get your friends
fixed up right.

125
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:52,590
-So you really think they're
going to be OK?

126
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:54,125
-Our scientists are very good.

127
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,360
Your friends are
in great hands.

128
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:56,594
Don't worry.

129
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:57,962
-Hmm.

130
00:04:57,962 --> 00:04:59,263
-The commander's calling.

131
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:01,299
Let's get you to the bridge.

132
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:02,100
-There's a bridge?

133
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,868
I didn't even see the river.

134
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:04,936
-Well, look at that there, man.

135
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,204
Um hmm.

136
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,705
-Oh.

137
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:10,074
-Shake it, don't break
it, kiddies.

138
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:13,745
SuperStarmon, at your
service, baby.

139
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:14,912
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
SuperStarmon, a

140
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:16,447
legend in his own time.

141
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,616
His special attack is
Halley's Squall.

142
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:20,251
-Well, thank you, thank
you very much.

143
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:21,252
Now, listen, people.

144
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:22,987
I got a favor to ask.

145
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:25,189
-Oh?
What is that?

146
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,358
-Well, you see, the Digital
World is deteriorating, baby,

147
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:28,593
a little more every day.

148
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:32,463
Get a good look at that, man.

149
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:35,433
-Now, that's where you all came
from, am I right, babies?

150
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,335
Any idea what's happening
down there, uh huh huh?

151
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:38,503
-Yeah.

152
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:39,937
The Royal Knights
are to blame.

153
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:42,674
They're scanning all the fractal
code of the Digital

154
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:45,843
World in order to
revive Lucemon.

155
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:49,180
-More data for Lucemon!

156
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,515
-They're doin' what!

157
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:52,850
-What about our old home?

158
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,052
[worried chatter]

159
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:55,686
What old home?

160
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:58,189
-Out sweet little corner of the
Digital World It'll get

161
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:00,458
eaten faster than fried peanut
butter and banana sandwiches,

162
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,026
I'm tellin' you, baby.

163
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,094
[gasps]

164
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:10,001
-Give me more data.

165
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,936
-As you command.

166
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:13,938
-You shall have all the
data you require.

167
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:16,140
And in exchange, you must
keep your promise.

168
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:18,476
LUCEMON (OFFCREEN): Of course.

169
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:21,345
When I am revived, you shall
have what you desire.

170
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:24,515
-Beautiful Lucemon.

171
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:28,019
-But I fail to understand why
you would want to go to the

172
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:28,653
human world.

173
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:30,688
-To control it!

174
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:34,425
The humans are weak, but their
data is oh, so sweet!

175
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:35,760
LUCEMON (OFFCREEN): I see.

176
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:38,763
-We seek to do as you have
taught us, to dominate the

177
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:42,433
weak, to destroy anyone who
would oppose us to prove how

178
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,569
worthiness to follow you.

179
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,405
-Flattery will get
you everywhere.

180
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:48,739
Now bring me more data!

181
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,824
[thunder]

182
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:58,459
-So we're on the moon?

183
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:00,394
-I can't believe it.

184
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:01,428
-Well, I couldn't, either.

185
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,264
But it's true.

186
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,400
-I guess it isn't made
out of cheese, huh?

187
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,769
-No.

188
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,104
-All right, all ready!

189
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:11,839
Now's not the time
to get flaky.

190
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:13,908
We've got to return to
the Digital World and

191
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:16,310
save it from Lucemon.

192
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:18,312
-And how exactly are we
supposed to do that?

193
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,081
-SuperStarmon said there are
no terminals around, so we

194
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:22,349
can't take a Trailmon.

195
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:24,785
-So that means we're
stuck here?

196
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:25,786
-No!

197
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,688
There has to be a way back!

198
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:30,491
-And that is?

199
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:32,993
-You don't know, do you?

200
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:34,628
-Well, let's all brainstorm.

201
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,964
We've got to come up with
something, right?

202
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:38,499
-Hmmm.

203
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,569
-Let me get into my
thinking pose.

204
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:42,503
Hmmmm.

205
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,271
-Right.
[snoring]

206
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:45,239
-Hm?

207
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:45,839
Ah!

208
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,575
Oh, would you wake up!

209
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:51,078
-Ah ha!

210
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,247
-Oh, man, we gotta hurry!

211
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,049
Spirit evolving may not
help us think, but

212
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,517
it's worth a shot.

213
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,085
-Mm hmm!

214
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:00,054
-Execute!

215
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,355
Spirit evolution!

216
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,399
-Yaa ha!

-Haa-uh!

226
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:00,047
Ha ha!

-Kumemon!

00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:01,715
-All right, everyone!

229
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,584
Fire on my signal!

230
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:06,220
And give it all you got!

231
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,522
Aaaaaaa!

232
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:10,691
-You got it!

233
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,259
Huh!

234
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,595
Shadow Meteor!

235
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:15,596
Yaaaa!

-Lupine Laser!

240
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:31,445
-And last but certainly
not least, Pyro Punch!

241
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:38,952
-Well, that ought to take
care of whatever we

242
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:40,287
were shooting at.

243
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,489
What exactly were we shooting
at, anyway?

244
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:44,458
-Well, nothing specific.

245
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,126
We were just firing that way.

246
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,995
-Now I'm confused and annoyed.

247
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:50,931
-What were you trying
to do, genius?

248
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:52,599
-I don't know.

249
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,967
I thought if we all fired in one
direction, maybe we could

250
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:55,536
move the moon.

251
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:56,937
You know, we could use the force
of our attacks to nudge

252
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,440
it closer to the
Digital World.

253
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,275
-Uh, what?

254
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:04,211
-Well, at least we gave
it our best shot.

255
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:05,179
[laughing]

256
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,180
-Come on, you guys.

257
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:06,680
Let's go.

-I'm a genius!

259
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:08,716
I'll give it a best shot!

00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:09,683
-That's just wrong.

00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:11,518
-He's lost it.

262
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:12,019
-Hey!

263
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:13,187
Wait up, you guys!

264
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:18,525
-Up!

265
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:19,526
Up!

00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:21,161

00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:22,529

Uh!

Whoa!

00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:27,601
-So, what do you think
he's doing?

271
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:31,205
-I don't know, but it sure
is funny to watch.

272
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:34,742
-One for the money, two for the
show, three to get ready--

273
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:38,345
and here we gooo!

Uh!

-Crackers!

00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,261
Get your hot crackers here!

-Don't forget to try our
bouncing bear special.

285
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,298
You'll love it!

hold the pickles.

-I'll take a space burger
with cheese.

288
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:03,771
-Yeah, make that two for me.

289
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,439
-Coming right up!

00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:06,039
-Uh!

291
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:07,674
I give up.

292
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:10,611
-Well, nice try.

00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:11,912
-Leave this to me.

00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:18,786
-Huh huh.

295
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:22,790
Look, he made it.

296
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:25,759
-I think he's in trouble!

00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,427

00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:48,315
-What the heck happened
to you up there?

305
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:49,950
-I got stuck in something.

306
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,451
It drained all my energy.

307
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:54,288
It was all I could do to keep
from dedigivolving.

308
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,323
-That would be the
electromagnetic stream.

309
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:57,991
-Yep, it's the stream.

BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Gotsumon.

312
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:05,065
This Digimon eats
meteor burgers.

313
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:07,000
His special attack
is Cosmo Flash.

314
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:12,439
-The stream is a river of energy
in space that separates

315
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,007
us from the Digital World.

316
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,310
Its flow is changed by the
pull of the moons, and no

317
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:17,411
one's ever crossed it.

318
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:19,313
-But we must have
crossed it OK.

319
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:21,315
I mean, we're all
here, aren't we?

320
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:22,015
-Yes and no.

321
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:22,983
-Huh?

322
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:24,651
-We must have bypassed it.

323
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:26,653
We got here through a
warp created by the

324
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,355
Royal Knights attacks.

325
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:30,123
-Great!

326
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:31,325
Which means we're never going
to find a normal way to get

327
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:33,527
off this stupid rock.

328
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:38,198

us off this rock tonight.

-I sure am worried.

00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:43,804
-I hope they're all right.

aren't you?

BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Burgermon
are Digimon with a

335
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:51,378
burger-shaped head.

336
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:53,480
-Well, you guys must have
crossed the stream, right?

337
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,215
-Oh, why would we?

338
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:57,885
The moon is where all we
Burgermon come from.

339
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:00,621
-But we saw Burgermon down
on the Digital World.

340
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,990
-They were very nice to us.

341
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,359
-My goodness, you saw them?

342
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:07,194
Those are our friends who
moved down there.

343
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:08,528
-Oh, I see.

344
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:10,831
-But we haven't heard from
them in forever.

345
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:16,303
[yelling]

346
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:17,471
-Beautiful!

347
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,740
At this rate, we shall gather
enough data for

348
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:21,541
Lucemon in no time.

349
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:23,877
[laughing]

350
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:29,163
-Uh!

351
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,266
There's gotta be a
way outta here!

352
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:32,967
-Calm down.

353
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,302
-How can I be calm at
a time like this?

354
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:36,337
-Hang on a second.

355
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:38,839
You said your friends move
to the Digital World?

356
00:13:38,906 --> 00:13:40,307
How did they get down there?

357
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:41,175
-Simple.

358
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,143
They built a rocket.

359
00:13:43,177 --> 00:13:45,713
-That's the ticket!

360
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,114
-OK, let's see.

361
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:49,783
Times the square root of pi,
divide by 5, carry the 2.

362
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:50,985
-Where'd you get those
equations?

363
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:52,786
-I saw them in a book.

364
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,388
-That's reassuring.

365
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:57,358
-Hey, are you sure this
is going to work?

366
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:58,859
-Of course it will.

367
00:13:58,893 --> 00:13:59,727
Trust me.

368
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,328
All right, here we go.

369
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:04,164
Five, four, three, two, one--

370
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:06,166
blast off!

371
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,469
-Woo hoo!

372
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:09,837
Ahh!

373
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,839
Oh!

374
00:14:11,906 --> 00:14:13,774
-OK.

375
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:16,477
Maybe it was divide by
2 and carry the pi.

376
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,846
If at first you don't
succeed--

377
00:14:18,913 --> 00:14:20,314
hey, Agunimon!

378
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,882
You ready to try again?

379
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,551
-No!

380
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:25,719
I can't believe I let you talk
me into it the first time,

381
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:26,220
metal head.

382
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,621
-Ah, come on.

383
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:28,956
-There's gotta be
a better answer.

384
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:30,858
-I should hope so.

385
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,694
-I'd let you guys shoot
me out of a canon.

386
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:35,629
Come on, it'll work this time!

387
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:39,700
-You got any ideas?

388
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:46,207
-Hey, what is that?

389
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:47,541
-Fire!

390
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:49,743
See?

391
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,544
I knew it.

392
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:53,347
That work, no problem.

393
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,782
And those guys doubted me.

394
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:57,117
This is definitely the answer.

395
00:14:57,151 --> 00:15:01,388
We just need to build a rocket
big enough to carry us all.

396
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:03,357
-I just looked down,
and there it was.

397
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,125
-I can't believe it.

398
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,860
-Amazing.

399
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,128
-Hey, you guys!

400
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:09,363
Check it out.

401
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:10,998
I know how to get us back
to the Digital World.

402
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:12,399
You're gonna love this.

403
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,201
All we have to do is
build ourselves--

404
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:15,869
AGUNIMON (OFFCREEN): A rocket?

405
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:16,737
-Yeah!

406
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,173
How'd you know?

407
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:21,041
Hey, where did that come from?

408
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,010
BURGERMON (OFFCREEN): Our
friends built it.

409
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:24,245
-Huh?

410
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:25,879
-That's the one they
used for testing.

411
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:28,382
But as you can see, it
didn't work so good.

412
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:29,450
-Hey, can we use it?

413
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:31,051
-Of course you can.

414
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:32,219
KENDOGARURUMON (OFFCREEN): Then
what are we waiting for?

415
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,787
AGUNIMON (OFFSCREEN): Let's
get that thing out of the

416
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:34,421
ground!

417
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:35,356
-It's pretty heavy.

418
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:36,290
Maybe we can help.

419
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:37,591
-Yeah, we'll help you, too!

420
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,592
-Thanks, guys.

421
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,127
We'd appreciate it.

422
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,463
-If we help you get back to the
Digital World, maybe you

423
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:45,232
can help our friends
down there.

424
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:56,644
[grunting]

425
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,645
-Yeah!

426
00:15:57,711 --> 00:15:59,680
We finally got it out
of the ground.

427
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:01,515
-Now how do we launch it?

428
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,517
METALKABUTERMON (OFFSCREEN):
We could-- um--

429
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,019
-We could answer that!

430
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:08,022
-Yeah, we know exactly how
to get us into space.

431
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:08,756
-All right.

432
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:09,256
How?

433
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:12,026
-We can use those.

434
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,193
-Huh?

435
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,298
[chatter]

436
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,933
-I like your style, people.

437
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,601
Lookin' good, there.

438
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:21,902
That's right, honey.

439
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,237
-I get it.

440
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,105
We glue those ban together and
make a giant slingshot.

441
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,645
[laughing]

442
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:33,447
-All right, now, check it out.

443
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:36,016
When those two moons line up
with of the Digital World, the

444
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,619
electromagnetic stream will form
a path to bring you right

445
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:39,520
on home, baby.

446
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:42,323
-Um, are you super
sure about that?

447
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:43,924
-Super is as super does.

448
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:46,860
A fool such as I can never
lie, my little hound dog.

449
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,529
You got one shot, but
hit it right, and

450
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:49,630
it's return to sender.

451
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,464
Thank you!

452
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:52,833
Thank you very much.

453
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,001
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Wow.

454
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:56,970
A few repairs, one big elastic
band, and this

455
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:58,672
ship's ready to fly.

456
00:16:58,672 --> 00:16:59,907
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Cool!

457
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,442
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Thanks
for your help, everybody.

458
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:03,911
-And thank you for helping our
friends on the Digital World.

459
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:06,180
You will do that, won't you?

460
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:06,947
-We promise.

461
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:12,953
[cheering]

462
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:14,188
-OK, guys.

463
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:16,423
Next stop, the Digital World.

464
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,092
-Hmmm.

465
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:19,993
KOICHI (OFFSCREEN): Well, we
may not remember how we got

466
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:22,863
here, but we're sure going
to remember getting back.

467
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,865
-The moon's are aligned.

468
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:25,332
-Yeah.

469
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:26,300
-Oh, wow.

470
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,801
This is exciting.

471
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:29,470
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): This
waiting is unbearable.

472
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,338
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Let's
have a singalong.

473
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:33,340
Who knows "Wheels On
The Bus?" [singing]

474
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,041
The wheels on the bus--

475
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:34,808
-Here we go!

476
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:36,310
-Rock 'n roll!

477
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:37,644
Halley's Squall!

478
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:45,486
[yelling]

479
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,854
[cheering]

480
00:17:46,854 --> 00:17:49,389
-The ride may be bumpy,
honey, but don't get

481
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:50,390
all shook up, now.

482
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:51,725
Uh huh.

483
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,543
-This doesn't feel right.

484
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:02,577
-We don't have enough speed!

485
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,382
-Don't worry, I'm all over it!

486
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:17,892
-Execute!

487
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,861
Beast Spirit evolution!

488
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:23,865
Ahhhhh!

489
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:38,813
-BurningGreymon!

490
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:42,617
-Wildfire Tsunami!

491
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:49,457
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): We're
gaining speed.

492
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:51,459
Way to go, Takuya!

493
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:54,662
-Nice work!

494
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:58,499
-Now we're right
back on target.

495
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,602
[yelling]

496
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:02,904
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): We're
almost through it!

497
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:04,772
-All right, we're save!

498
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,108
-Not for long.

499
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:08,109
-Huh?

500
00:19:08,142 --> 00:19:09,744
-Oh, man, an asteroid belt!

501
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:10,812
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
More good news!

502
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:14,582
-Yaaa!

503
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:15,783
-Full speed ahead!

504
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:22,590
-Here comes a big one!

505
00:19:22,624 --> 00:19:26,294
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Hold on!

506
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:29,931
[yelling]

507
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:32,767
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): We're
out of the stream again!

508
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,335
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
But we're OK.

509
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,037
Neemon, what are you doing?

510
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,705
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Standing
on the ceiling.

511
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:38,306
Why?

512
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:40,208
-Hey, this is fun!

513
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:42,310
[? -legs ?] go up, [? head ?]
goes down.

514
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:45,647
-Yeah, this could be fun, but
I'm over it all ready.

515
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,881
-My skirt keeps falling up--

516
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:48,182
I mean down--
I mean up!

517
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:49,017
Whatever!

518
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,385
Just nobody look!

519
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:51,686
-You heard her, J.P.

520
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:54,656
-What are you looking
at me for?

521
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:55,423
[crash]

522
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:57,191
-What was that?

523
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:59,861
-Excuse me, but you're
in my way.

524
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:03,998
-Wait, you guys!

525
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:05,900
It's a Trailmon!

526
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,068
-Move it, please.

527
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:08,069
Road hog!

528
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:08,736
-Oh!

529
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,238
-Um, excuse me.

530
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:13,608
Would you mind giving us
a little push home?

531
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:16,744
-Well, I suppose I could leap
over you, but that seems like

532
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:18,913
an awful lot of work.

533
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:19,914
Eh!

534
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,883
Pushing, it is.

535
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,885
-Gratzi, Mr. Trailmon.

536
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:26,921
-My nose is going to be
so sore tomorrow.

537
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:32,927
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Would
you look at the

538
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:34,462
damage they've done?

539
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:35,797
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): At the rate
they're going, there won't be

540
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,999
much of the Digital World
left to save!

541
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:39,467
-Ah, yes.

542
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:42,503
My strength is growing.

543
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:44,138
It won't be long now.

544
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:46,107
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Now that we're
back, we've got a score

545
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,309
to settle with those
Royal Knights.

546
00:20:48,343 --> 00:20:49,477
-And Lucemon.

547
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,346
We're not going to lose twice.

548
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:53,648
The whole Digital World
is counting on us.

549
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:55,950
NARRATOR: The gang made it back
from the moon all right,

550
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:58,820
but are they too late to
foil Lucemon's plans?

551
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,523

Digital Monsters!
