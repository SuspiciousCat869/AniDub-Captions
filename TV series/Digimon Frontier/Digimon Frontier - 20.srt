00:00:01,698 --> 00:00:02,865
NARRATOR: The gang headed into
Burgermon Village hoping to

2
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:05,268
enjoy some of their famous
hamburgers, but the town was

3
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:06,869
broken and battered.

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:08,771
Petaldramon and his cronies had
ravaged the Hamlet on a

5
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:11,941
quest for the ultimate burger
and took the town's top

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:13,443
burgermeister hostage.

7
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,712
Our heroes decided to help the
missing Burgermon's family by

8
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:17,313
creating their own burger
masterpieces.

9
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:20,083
Fortunately, Tommy made a burger
the beasties liked, but

10
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,318
they liked it so much
they took Tommy, Zoe

11
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:23,987
and J.P. Away too.

12
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,723
But as usual, the kids saved
the day and reunited the

13
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:28,691
Burgermon family,
but Petaldramon

14
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,326
isn't finished yet.

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,394
THEME MUSIC: Digimon!

16
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:41,938
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

17
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:44,274
digital world.

18
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:49,112
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other we live by

19
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:57,787
the lessons we've learned as we
work towards one solution

20
00:00:57,787 --> 00:01:01,758
through a spirit evolution.

21
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,760
I am the one-- huh.

22
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:05,128
I am the one--

23
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:06,396
Digimon.

24
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:09,165
We're the rhythm
united as one--

25
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:10,400
Digimon.

26
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,769
Together the battles are won--

27
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:13,770
Digimon.

28
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:17,006
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

29
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:21,010
Everyone for one world, there's
a world for us all.

30
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,782
We're all for one world, there's
a world for us all.

31
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:26,783
I am the one--huh.

32
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:28,151
I am the one--

33
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:29,452
Digimon!

34
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:37,260
-One, two, three, four-- use
Digi kids to mop the floor.

35
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:39,429
Five, six, seven, eight--
they're the kids

36
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:40,663
I just don't like.

37
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,498
-Thou has more enthusiasm
than wit.

38
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:44,634
-Thanks, there Mercurymon.

39
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,904
It's like I always say, a little
training before saves a

40
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:50,473
lot of trouble after, right.

41
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,876
-Your diligence confirms your
allegiance, my piney partner.

42
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,278
-I know.

43
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:58,348
Lord Cherubimon wants me ready
at all times to serve up a

44
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,283
healthy helping of havoc.

45
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,019
-It plays warmly on my ears to
hear you speak thusly. 'Tis

46
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:05,922
truly most apt to call you
a legendary warrior.

47
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:08,758
-Yeah, well I'd love to chat
more, but I got some road work

48
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,360
to tend to, you understand?

49
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:11,995
Forget about it.

50
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,029
-Hmp.

51
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,469
Ahh-- victory.

52
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:24,140
Seraphimon's fractal code
and it's all mine!

53
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,676
With this there's only a few
ticks of time before the

54
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,878
digital world bows before me!

55
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:34,917
[evil laughter]

56
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:37,320
-But why is Cherubimon
coming here?

57
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,855
One of you two must
have messed up.

58
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,556
-Yeah, what are you
looking at me for?

59
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,225
I didn't do nothing, right?

60
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:44,394
-He's coming for the fractal
code, you nits!

61
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,870
Lord Cherubimon.

62
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,240
-Power is everything
and the only thing.

63
00:02:57,273 --> 00:03:00,343
Greetings, my most faithful
followers.

64
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:02,845
It appears someone is missing.

65
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,080
-Indeed--

66
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:05,848
Duskmon is absent.

67
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:07,316
-He's flakier than pie crust.

68
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,251
-Don't worry.

69
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:09,752
He'll get his, right.

70
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:13,222
-And alas, Grumblemon has
fallen in battle.

71
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:15,158
-So he has.

72
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:18,394
It was the humans who sealed
his fate, was it not?

73
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:19,729
-Uh, [inaudible].

74
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,297
-He knows.

75
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,865
-But no matter.

76
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:26,135
With you, my three legendary
warriors, this entire world

77
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:28,037
will submit to my power.

78
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:30,807
[grunting]

79
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,410
-My lord and master, I humbly
give you all the fractal code

80
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:35,445
we have gathered thus far.

81
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:43,553
-Well, it's gratifying to see
how much you've compiled.

82
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:45,221
Well done my minions.

83
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:47,256
-We live to serve
you, mighty one.

84
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,092
-How disappointing that you
chose not to present me with

85
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:53,296
the most vital data you have,
Seraphimon's fractal code.

86
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:55,998
-Oh.

87
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:56,432
I--

88
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:57,366
I can explain.

89
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,202
[evil laughter]

90
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:00,536
-I see.

91
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,406
Consider that code a gift I may
demand to have returned

92
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:04,807
whenever I wish it.

93
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,543
[sighs]

94
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:10,746
-Beware, the earth children have
found their beast spirits

95
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,281
and their strength is growing.

96
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:14,884
-With all due respect, those
little rugrats can't hold a

97
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:15,985
candle to us.

98
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:18,054
We are the only true
legendary warriors.

99
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:21,424
-Then why have you been unable
to eliminate them?

100
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:22,692
-I-- um--

101
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:24,093
hmm--

102
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:25,628
-Grumblemon may not have
been able to handle

103
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,863
the job, but I will.

104
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:28,764
I'll make those human
kids the weeds and

105
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:30,633
I'm the weed whacker!

106
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,935
-Excellent, but don't fail me.

107
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:39,142
[nervous laughter]

108
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,551
-Wooo-wooo!

109
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:50,119
Well, whatever.

110
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:51,454
Blah, blah, blah.

111
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,054
Woo!

112
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,055
Blah.

113
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:53,523
-Oh, wow!

114
00:04:53,556 --> 00:04:54,891
Check it out!

115
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:57,226
The Rose Morning Star's
gotta be close now.

116
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,861
-Yeah.

117
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:00,663
-Fantastico!

118
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:02,164
But it's mid day.

119
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:04,867
Are the clouds supposed
to be that dark?

120
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:06,302
-Uh.

121
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:08,337
Hey, Bokomon, what does this
book have to say about this

122
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:09,038
area?

123
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,306
-Hmm, let's see.

124
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,674
I haven't found anything that--

125
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:13,209
[gasps]

126
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:15,511
[screaming]

127
00:05:15,545 --> 00:05:16,946
-All right.

128
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,481
Who was the nimrod who slammed
on the brakes?

129
00:05:18,481 --> 00:05:19,949
-That'd be me, blue boy.

130
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:21,350
End of the line.

131
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,352
-That can't be right.

132
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,321
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

133
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:27,757
-It looks like the tracks
don't stop for miles.

134
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,258
-How observant of you.

135
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:30,893
Look, if I say it's the
end of the line, it's

136
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:31,727
the end of the line.

137
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:34,163
Go on. Get out. Get lost.

138
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:34,964
-Kogi, how did you ever
race with this guy?

139
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:36,198
-You can't do this!

140
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:37,533
We have Digirail passes!

141
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,301
-Yeah, yeah.

142
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:38,968
Write it down.

143
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:39,735
You'll sell millions.

144
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,737
Look, you want to go, then go!

145
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:42,471
I ain't stopping you!

146
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:44,507
[screaming]

147
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,042
-Let me be the first one to
wish you the best of luck.

148
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,277
You're gonna need it!

149
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:50,680
-I would have to admit, I've
been dumped before but never

150
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:52,014
quite like that.

151
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:52,715
[grunts]

152
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:54,650
-So everyone in one piece?

153
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:55,818
-Yeah.

154
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,386
Aren't there any normal
trailmon?

155
00:05:57,386 --> 00:06:00,623
-I think I popped a waistband.

156
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,358
-Bokomon.

157
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,560
-Welcome to the Dark Gate.

158
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,228
ALL: Huh?

159
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:08,764
-That temple-like structure
behind you is the Dark Gate,

160
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:11,634
through it lies the Continent
of Darkness.

161
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,369
[gasping]

162
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:17,773
-Why do I get a feeling that's
not a good thing?

163
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,675
-Is it as bad as it sounds?

164
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:22,745
-I wish I could tell you, but
to be honest, I have no idea

165
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,113
what awaits us there.

166
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:27,383
It's an eerie land shrouded
in utter darkness, but the

167
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,953
dangers it holds are as
legendary as its mysteries.

168
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:34,056
-There's got to be something
written in the book about it.

169
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,558
-Well, let's take
a look shall we.

170
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:38,961
Continent of Darkness,
Chapter 12.

171
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,529
-Whoa, it's pitch black.

172
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:41,664
-How come?

173
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:43,733
-It appears that there's
really no firsthand

174
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:45,601
information on this place.

175
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:49,038
Many a brave Digimon have
ventured within, but it seems

176
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:50,239
none of them have ever returned

177
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:52,408
to tell of its secrets.

178
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:53,976
-Whoa.

179
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,345
-Only the foolhardy would
dare enter the

180
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:57,680
Continent of Darkness.

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,682
We'll have to find another
route to the Rose Morning

182

183
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:02,785
-But the shortest route
is straight ahead!

184
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:04,654
Nothing ventured, nothing
gained, right?

185
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:05,988
-Uh-huh!

186
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:11,093
-Uh, I think we should
take a vote.

187
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:12,595
-Agreed.

188
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:14,764
-You know, when all of us work
as a team, we've overcome some

189
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:16,098
pretty tough stuff.

190
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,567
So what's the point in backing
off here and giving up?

191
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,469
-Yeah, if something major
happens we'll just spirit

evolve.

193
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,539
-There isn't any trouble
that we can't handle.

194
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:24,640
-Exactly.

195
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:26,609
We're the five legendary

-Just because Cherubimon gets
you three to obey his requests

doesn't mean that you are

336
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:24,879
Those creatures are pipsmon.

337
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:28,249
They're mutant Digimon whose
power is greatest in the dark.

338
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,753
They can reflect the sound back
exactly as it's heard.

340

-Hmm.

341
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:43,431
-For cave dwelling Digimon,
they're really rather gentle

342
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,700
even if they are a bit
scary looking.

they're kind of cute.

I think they're kind of cute.

346
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:53,742
-I'm amazed to find peaceful
Digimon in such a dark place.

347
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:56,010
-So, I guess it turns out
you're glad you came?

00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:57,178
-What?

349
00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:59,147
-You just learned something.

350
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,149
If you hadn't come, you'd never
have known about this.

351
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,384
It's good that you
took a risk.

352
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:06,020
-If you're not sure about
something, there's really only

353
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,422
one way to find out--

354
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,924
that's to take a risk and go
experience it for yourself.

355
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,693
-Well, bless my buttons.

356

You're right.

357
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:15,296
-Why don't you write it
down in the book?

358
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,831
You'll be the first Digimon
to chronicle the

359
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:17,899
Continent of Darkness.

360
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:18,666
You'll be famous.

361
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,734
-Uh.

362
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:20,802
Well, I--

363
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:22,370
Really?

364
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,072
-Sure, and since you're writing
about Digimon, maybe

365
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:25,206
you could write about us--

366
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:27,609
The True Adventures of the
Legendary Warrior.

367
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:29,944
You can say how I controlled
my beast spirit.

368
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:31,412
-I'd like to be mentioned.

369
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:32,714
You can write about
my cool hat!

370
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:35,216
-And mention how
fearless I am!

371
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,785
-All right then, I'll do it!

372
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,220
Today I'll begin the greatest
novel of all time, The

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,990
Legendary Warriors of the
Continent of Darkness.

374
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:44,058
-So, will you write
about me as well?

375
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:46,060
-Oh, I think not!
