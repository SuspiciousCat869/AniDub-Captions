1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,494
NARRATOR: Koji confronted
Koichi, and the truth

2
00:00:02,494 --> 00:00:03,496
finally came out.

3
00:00:03,496 --> 00:00:05,531
They really are brothers!

4
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:08,000
Cherubimon used the darkness in
Koichi's heart to turn him

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,702
into Duskmon.

6
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:12,037
But after meeting his equally
tortured twin, Koichi realized

7
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:14,640
that darkness doesn't have
to be a bad thing.

8
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:17,643
Then Cherubimon came after the
Digigang to coax Koichi back.

9
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:20,012
But the kid's change of heart
transformed him with the true

10
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:21,347
spirit of darkness.

11
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:24,683
As JagerLoweemon, Koichi
conquered Cherubimon, only to

12
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:26,652
find out that he
was a big fake!

13
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:29,989
The real big boss fatty is
waiting at the Rose Morning

14
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:30,589
Star.

15
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:31,924
-Digimon.

16
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:40,232
THEME SONG: We look to the
past, as we head for the

17
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:44,236
future, to reclaim the
digital world.

18
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:48,941
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:53,779
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:58,217
As we work towards
one solution,

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,585
through a spirit evolution.

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,158
Digimon!

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,161
Forever united as one.

24
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,162
Digimon!

25
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,132
Together, the battles are won.

26
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:14,133
Digimon!

27
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,802
Through us, let your
spirit evolve.

28
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:21,340
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:28,480
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:29,815
Digimon!

31
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,713
[evil laughter]

32
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:04,416
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN):
Children hear me.

33
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:06,051
-We've made it.

34
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:07,886
The Rose Morning Star.

35
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,293
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN):
Hear me.

36
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:15,861
-Huh?

37
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,263
-I know that voice.

38
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:21,634
OPHANIMON (ON DEVICE): Children,
you finally made it.

39
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,235
-It's Ophanimon.

40
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,303
OPHANIMON (ON DEVICE): With
the spirits of the 10

41
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:27,306
legendary warriors, you must
defeat Cherubimon here.

42
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:27,906
-Huh?

43
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,607
-What?

44
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,275
-Cherubimon is here, too?

45
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,643
-Oh.

46
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,614
OPHANIMON (ON DEVICE): He is
anticipating your arrival.

47
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,450
-Oh, where's all that
data going?

48
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:39,752
OPHANIMON (BREAKING
UP): The digital--

49
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:44,590
-Her signal dropped out.

50
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,759
That huge data stream must
have overloaded things.

51
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,160
We just got cut-off!

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,928
-Where do you think that
data's coming from?

53
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,968
-Maybe Koichi knows something
about it.

54
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,336
-Huh?

55
00:02:57,336 --> 00:02:58,837
-Yeah, he was Duskmon.

56
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,305
He must know what's going on.

57
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:02,641
Hey, Koji, your brother
was on the dark side.

58
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:03,675
Ask him what gives!

59
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:08,847
-Gah!

60
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:10,049
-Now, that was subtle,
palazzo.

61
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,851
You ever thought of becoming
a diplomat?

62
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,754
-Well, somebody's got to ask.

63
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:17,689
-I wish I knew.

64
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,925
Cherubimon's gathering data
for some reason, but

65
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,060
I don't know why.

66
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,165
Sorry I can't be of more help.

67
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,734
-Anyway, what we really need
to do now is to find and

68
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:30,369
rescue Ophanimon.

69
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,905
-But how are we going to
get there from here?

70
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:35,441
-Seems to me the only choice we
have is to use those big,

71
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:36,408
floating rocks.

72
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:37,776
-I'll bet it's another trap.

73
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:38,744
-Ah!

74
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:39,745
A trap?

75
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,246
But I'm too young to fly!

76
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,581
-You ninny.

77
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:44,583
Need I remind your friends have
overcome much greater

78
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:45,984
obstacles than this.

79
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,253
They are fearless warriors
to whom traps

80
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:49,555
are part of the game.

81
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:52,057
Takuya, am I right?

82
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,560
-Uh, actually, Neemon
does have a point.

83
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:55,494
-Huh?

84
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,129
-Gotcha!

85
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:57,996
Of course we're going!

86
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,064
Now, let's do it!

87
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,341
-Execute!

88
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,442
Spirit evolution!

89
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,294
[yelling]

90
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:30,362
-Agunimon!

91
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:47,546
[yelling]

92
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,881
-Lobomon!

93
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:59,191
-Execute!

94
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:00,526
Spirit evolution!

95
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,078
[growling]

96
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,113
-Loweemon!

97
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:32,024
-Execute!

98
00:05:32,057 --> 00:05:33,358
Spirit evolution!

99
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,973
[yelling]

100
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:49,208
-Kazemon!

101
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,856
[yelling]

102
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:05,157
-Beetlemon!

103
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:17,769
[yelling]

104
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:19,104
-Kumamon!

105
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,407
[grunting]

106
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:23,742
-Quickly, post haste!

107
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,777
Ophanimon is in peril!

108
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,447
-Next time, no hitchhikers!

109
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,216
-Careful, this altitude might
cause a nosebleed.

110
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,251
-Wee!

111
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:44,686
[evil laughter]

112
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:49,925
-They are here.

113
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,934
Our long-awaited guests
have arrived.

114
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:03,939
Ophanimon, have you
changed your mind?

115
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,774
-Your heart is evil.

116
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:07,776
I cannot align myself with you.

117
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:09,078
-Ha.

118
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,613
Keep in mind, if you join forces
with me, the digital

119
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:13,615
world will be ours to
do with as we wish.

120
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:16,085
-How can you be so misguided?

121
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,486
-What?

122
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:20,856
-My only wish is to bring
peace to this world.

123
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:25,527
I have no desire to impose my
will upon it, as you do.

124
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:29,198
-I see you are still
against me.

125
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:33,168
Do what you will, Ophanimon, but
very soon you will regret

126
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,169
this folly.

127
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:48,917
-All life will one day
be annihilated.

128
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,487
Whether the end happens
now or later is

129
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:52,988
simply a matter of fate.

130
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,191
It appears their fate
is not a lucky one.

131
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,228
For by meeting us, their
destruction is at hand!

132
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,897
[grunting]

133
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:05,200
-Um, does this remind anyone
else of the dark gate, or is

134
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,235
it just me?

135
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,237
-This must be the entrance
to the castle!

136
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,440
-OK, but there's nothing back
here for us to enter into!

137
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:15,711
-Well, you'd have to think this
gate leads to somewhere.

138
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:16,411
Wow!

139
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:19,915
Nice reception!

140
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:23,819
-It is time for the harvest,
of your souls!

141
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,654
-Ah!
-Ah!

142
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,457
Those are Phantomon Digimon,
the grim reapers of the

143
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,791
digital world!

144
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,460
Phantomon always carry
a scythe and

145
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,828
know how to use them.

146
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:34,796
They wear crystals around their
necks which give them

147
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,465
clairvoyant power.

148
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:38,800
And they're just dying to see
into the future to know who

149
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,435
their next victim will be.

150
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:41,436
-Soul chopper!

151
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,672
[grunting]

152
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:44,339
-Whoa!

153
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:46,308
Lobo kendo!

154
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,277
[grunting]

155
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,611
[evil laughter]

156
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:50,212
-Eh?

157
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:51,547
[roars]

158
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,950
-Shadow meteor!

159
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:57,519
-Hey, nice shot.

160
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,022
-Hurricane wind!

161
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:01,290
-Ah!

162
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,392
-Frozen tundra!

163
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,360
-You sure froze him out.

164
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,395
-It was my pleasure.

165
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,697
-Thunder fist!

166
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,232
-Slippery little devils,
aren't they?

167
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:12,367
-Pyro punch!

168
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:13,569
[grunting]

169
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:14,236
-Nice try.

170
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,406
[laughs]

171
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:18,540
-Great, they vanished!

172
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,508
[whimpers]

173
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,009
-Use extreme caution.

174
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:24,046
The clairvoyant crystals they
wear can capture and hold you

175
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:25,380
in another dimension forever.

176
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,182
-That doesn't sound good.

177
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,418
-Phantomon, show yourselves!

178
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:32,187
-Don't wander off too far.

179
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:33,088
-Huh?

180
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:33,956
Uh.

181
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:34,423
Oh!

182
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:35,257
-Beetlemon!

183
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,092
Ah!

184
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,060
-Kazemon!

185
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:39,261
-It's no use.

186
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:40,462
We can't see them in time to--

187
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,297
-Uh!

188
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,265
-No!

189
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,099
[whimpers]

190
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:46,435
-Oh beans.
[whimpers]

191
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:50,272
[evil laughter]

192
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:54,610
-Once trapped inside our
crystal spheres,

193
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,278
you can never escape.

194
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:01,750
Join them!

195
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:02,985
-No!

196
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:04,253
I won't let you!

197
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:08,323
-They're waiting for you.

198
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,859
-To react quickly, I
must clear my mind.

199
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:21,003
[yelling]

200
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,371
[crash]

201
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:26,008
[groans]

202
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:26,508
-Huh?

203
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:29,011
-Shadow lights!

204
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,346
[yelling]

205
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,723
-Confused evil souls, be buried
in darkness and sleep.

206
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:45,694
Let the shadows purify you.

207
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:46,595
[grunting]

208
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:48,563
Fractal code, digitize!

209
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:57,039
-Outstanding!

210
00:10:57,072 --> 00:11:00,575
-Wow, Loweemon, you
saved everybody.

211
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:01,576
-Thanks, Koichi!

212
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:06,415
[gasps]

213
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,549
-The gate!

214
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:09,318
-Right, let's go!

215
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,119
[grunts]

216
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:18,627
[evil laughter]

217
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,633
-Excellent.

218
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,802
Just a little more.

219
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:30,138
Once I have absorbed all the
digital world's data, I will

220
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:34,309
possess even greater power.

221
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:38,113
The spirits of the 10 legendary
warriors are drawing

222
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:39,648
ever closer.

223
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:44,019
And when I have their power
within my control, the digital

224
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:46,021
world will be mine.

225
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:03,505
[breathing heavily]

226
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:06,208
-What in the world
is this place?

227
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,709
-Who knows?

228
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:11,380
This world just gets weirder
and weirder!

229
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,048
[yells]

230
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:14,349
-I'm shutting my eyes!

231
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,917
Tell me what happens!

232
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,353
[grunts]

233
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,287
[screams]

234
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,623
[grunts]

235
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,129
-How do we stop these things?

236
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:31,767
-Whatever that is,
it stopped them.

237
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,101
[bell]

238
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,448
-This is the hall of shadows.

239
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:49,651
All those who have fallen prey
to Cherubimon's treachery are

240
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:50,986
locked forever within.

241
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:53,021
-And just who are you?

242
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:55,023
-My name is Oryxmon.

243
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,491
I am not your enemy.

244
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,662
NARRATOR: Oryxmon is
a great black goat

245
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,464
who acts as a sentry.

246
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:04,833
He is programmed to hold large
amounts of data which help him

247
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,535
protect the secret treasures
and ruins

248
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:07,869
of the digital world.

249
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,372
-Cherubimon's castle is a deadly
labyrinth, filled with

250
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,174
pitfalls and traps.

251
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,910
But I can lead you safely
to Lady Ophanimon

252
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:15,744
-What do you think?

253
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:16,978
-I don't know.

254
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,847
I'm not sure we can
trust this guy.

255
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,082
-Tell us, what proof do you have
that we can trust you?

256
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,222
-Ah!

257
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:29,658
-Wha, wha, where are you
going, Patamon, my boy?

258
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:30,859
-[inaudible].

259
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:32,227
Oryxmon won't hurt anybody!

260
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:35,097
[delighted squeals]

261
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,099
-Well, kind of hard to
argue with that.

262
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:38,600
-No kidding.

263
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,734
-Sorry for doubting you.

264
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:42,270
We'd appreciate you showing
us the way.

265
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:43,605
-Very well, let's begin.

266
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:01,289
Lady Ophanimon is being held
in the sphere above us.

267
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,629
Sealed within the light
of that golden orb.

268
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,634
-It's so bright.

269
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,436
-And warm.

270
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,004
-What is that?

271
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:19,941
-That glowing entity you see
before you is one of the three

272
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,877
great angels, Lady Ophanimon.

273
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:27,649
-You made it.

274
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,885
The legendary warriors
have returned.

275
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:31,353
[grunts]

276
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:33,688
-Come on, Z, we got to
get her out of there!

277
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:34,856
-Thunder fist!

278
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,391
-Hurricane wind!

279
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:39,694
[grunts]

280
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:41,863
-Whoa!

281
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:44,366
-That seal's too strong
to break through.

282
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,202
-Thank you, children, but
you must not waste

283
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:48,570
your powers on me.

284
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,238
-But why?

285
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,073
-Because there is a greater
purpose for your being here.

286
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,377
But before you put yourselves
into any more danger, you must

287
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:58,380
know what all of you were
called to this world.

288
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,016
Ages ago, there was
a terrible war.

289
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,851
A fierce battle raged
between the human

290
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,619
and beast-type Digimon.

291
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,689
Then Lucemon appeared and
stopped the fighting, bringing

292
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:09,090
peace to this world.

293
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:12,561
But soon after, Lucemon grew mad
with power, tormenting and

294
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:14,429
oppressing all Digimon.

295
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:17,632
It was then that the 10
legendary warriors rose up,

296
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,602
carrying the light of truth
and right in their hearts.

297
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:23,972
Oh, how bravely they fought
against Lucemon and the evil

298
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,307
of his injustice.

299
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:28,009
And after finally defeating
him, the 10 warriors

300
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:30,612
disappeared.

301
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:34,749
Cherubimon, Seraphimon and I
worked together to bring peace

302
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:37,919
and harmony to the digital
world once more.

303
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:41,423
-Hey, that's the exact same
story Seraphimon told us.

304
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:42,357
-Hoi!
-Ah!

305
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,326
Ah!
Ah!

306
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,294
-But it wouldn't last.

307
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:49,631
Seraphimon upheld our world's
system of law and order.

308
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:52,000
Cherubimon protected all our
knowledge and legends.

309
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:54,035
And I fostered the
appreciation of

310
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:55,870
all life and love.

311
00:15:55,937 --> 00:16:00,008
And yet, it soon became obvious
that Cherubimon's

312
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:03,178
ideas and philosophies were
quite different from ours.

313
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:05,647
-To honor these simplicities
is absurd!

314
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,016
Love, law, order--

315
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:09,884
this world is a wild place!

316
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:12,821
Chaos is its natural state,
but you human-type Digimon

317
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:13,888
can't understand this!

318
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,730
-Seraphimon and I decided we
should meet alone to try and

319
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,898
find a way to reconcile our
views with those of

320
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:25,400
Cherubimon.

321
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,902
But when Cherubimon found
us talking together, he

322
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,571
misunderstood our intentions.

323
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,273
He thought we were trying to
undermine him and subvert the

324
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,909
beliefs he held.

325
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,879
-Seraphimon and his
laws are only for

326
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:39,481
the human-type Digimon!

327
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:42,150
It's up to me to give
the beast-types a

328
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:43,284
new system of order.

329
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,128
[grunting]

330
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,130
-Our world exploded.

331
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,932
We were treated like traitors
by Cherubimon's followers.

332
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:59,968
He had convinced the beast-types
that we were the

333
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,636
cause of all their problems.

334
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,673
Cherubimon led them in an
aggressive campaign against

335
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,308
the human-type Digimon.

336
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:09,644
He had become a monster
steeped in evil.

337
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:15,684
[screams]

338
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:19,954
[roar]

339
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:26,528
[screams]

340
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:29,531
-Seraphimon!

341
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:32,667
From now on, I am the
law of this world!

342
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:36,538
And you are nothing!

343
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:37,872
[evil yell]

344
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:42,444
[screams]

345
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:47,549
-Seraphimon, no!

346
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:48,917
Ah!

347
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:52,921
I will do whatever
you ask of me.

348
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:56,791
But I beg you, please
spare his life!

349
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,728
Ever since that moment, I have
been imprisoned in this castle

350
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,930
waiting for Seraphimon
to awaken.

351
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,264
-Wow.

352
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:11,473
-I wish everybody would
just play nice.

353
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:14,275
-I wonder if all of this
happened because Cherubimon

354
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:15,677
liked Ophanimon.

355
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,011
-No way!

356
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,447
-When he gained power,
Cherubimon possessed five of

357
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:21,616
the 10 legendary warriors'
spirits.

358
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,487
He took four of these spirits
and created his own group of

359
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:27,255
evil warriors.

360
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:30,325
Then he commanded Digimon all
over our world to begin

361
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,193
collecting the digital
world's data.

362
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:35,663
They ruthlessly carried out his
edict, creating chaos for

363
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,534
our beautiful planet, and
turmoil for its inhabitants.

364
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,836
At the rate they were pillaging
our world, I knew it

365
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,872
would soon be destroyed.

366
00:18:43,938 --> 00:18:46,808
With the survival of our world
in the balance, I desperately

367
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:51,980
called out to another world in
which Cherubimon had no power.

368
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:52,514
-Huh?

369
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,648
Hello?

370
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:56,417
-This is a game to determine
your future.

371
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:59,087
Are you willing to play?

372
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,756
-Only those human children
who were pure of

373
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,091
heart answered my call.

374
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:06,060
Your positive response
encouraged me, but your level

375
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:08,396
of commitment has
astounded me.

376
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,566
Thankfully, I had been told by
Seraphimon that the other five

377
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,701
spirits of the legendary
warriors were hidden.

378
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,271
Without Cherubimon knowing,
I led you to them and

379
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:18,373
you found them all.

380
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:21,409
Then Cherubimon planted the
remaining spirit that he held,

381
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:24,078
a spirit of darkness,
into Koichi who had

382
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:25,747
wandered into our world.

383
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:29,450
But you were strong and turned
away from the darkness.

384
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:31,986
Your strength and courage
triumphed over the many

385
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,555
ordeals you have faced.

386
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:35,824
Now you face the truly daunting
task of defeating

387
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:37,325
Cherubimon.

388
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:39,828
But you possess the power
of the spirits of all 10

389
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,763
legendary warriors.

390
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:44,966
You are our greatest hope
to conquer his evil.

391
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:46,768
-You are a fool, Ophanimon.

392
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:47,468
[gasp]

393
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:49,137
-It's Cherubimon!

394
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,004
[growls]

395
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,506
[gasps]

396
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:52,974
-I hear him, but where is he?

397
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:55,477
-Haven't you wondered why I
would allow the human children

398
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:58,279
to come here without
destroying them?

399
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:00,882
Surely I had the strength
to do it.

400
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:02,350
-What are you saying?

401
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:04,686
-The spirits of the 10 legendary
warriors are

402
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:07,522
gathered here, and
within my grasp.

403
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:10,291
When I combine them with the
data I've collected, total

404
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:13,361
control of the digital world
will at last be mine.

405
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:17,232
And it's all thanks
to you, my lady.

406
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:22,070
You and these humans have
brought my plan to fruition.

407
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:23,371
Let's end it.

408
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,752
-My spirit!

409
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:39,420
-It's starting to glow!

410
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,288
-What's going on?

411
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:41,956
-Oh come on, what is happening?

412
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,925
[screams]

413
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:45,793
-The spirits!

414
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,129
-Cherubimon, no!

415
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:52,267
-Finally, it has all come to
this shining moment when my

416
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,601
evil will reign supreme!

417
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:56,104
NARRATOR: Oh man,
this is serious!

418
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,406
If Cherubimon gets to the
spirits, the digital

419
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,774
world is done for!

420
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:03,711
You have got to watch the next
Digimon Digital Monsters!
