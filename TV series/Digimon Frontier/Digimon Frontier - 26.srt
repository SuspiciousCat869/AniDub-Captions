00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,769
NARRATOR: Sakkakumon decided the
guys needed a little one

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,038
on one attention, so he split
them all up to face their

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,673
personal demons.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,642
Tommy had some unresolved stuff
with his brother to work

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,345
out, and Asuramon was more
than willing to help.

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,847
Meanwhile, Koji was plagued
by his deepest fears about

7
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,315
friendship.

8
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,350
Karatenmon thought he got the
best of him, but he didn't

9
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,018
count on KendoGarurumon.

10
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,687
Koji promptly beat him
just to shut him up.

11
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,056
As it turns out, Asuramon was
just pretending to be Tommy's

12
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,359
friend so he could
steal his spirit.

13
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,695
But Tommy's spirit evolved to
Korikakumon and digitized the

14
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,831
three faced freak!

THEME SONG: Digimon!

[theme music]

17
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,908
THEME SONG: Look to the past as
we head for the future to

18
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:44,745
reclaim the Digital World.

19
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:48,749
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

20
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,385
by the lessons we've learned.

21
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:59,893
As we work towards on solution
through a spirit evolution.

22
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,833
Digimon!

23
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,169
Forever united as one.

24
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,804
Digimon!

25
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,173
Together the battles are won.

26
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,474
Digimon!

27
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,444
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

28
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,348
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,686
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,990
Digimon!

31
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,631
-Oh.

32
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,034
I really am gorgeous.

33
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,469
Wait a minute.

34
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,706
Why am I looking at this dinky
thing when I could use the

35
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,575
whole darn ocean as a mirror?

36
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,878
Looks like I have yet
another fan here.

37
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:52,913
All right, sugar.

38
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,516
Tell me, who's the fairest
of them all?

39
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,552
-Prepare thyself.

40
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,887
-Hey, that's Mercurymon.

41
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,724
-It takes not a genius to see
that the fairest in all the

42
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,092
land is thee.

43
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,194
-Now, that's what a girl
wants to hear.

44
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,896
-Or 'tis what I would have said
before the fairest of the

45
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,298
fair entered the land.

46
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,066
By that, I mean Kazemon.

47
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,468
-You what?

48
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:18,772
-And the strongest and bravest
must surely be Zephyrmon.

49
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,642
-Hey, watch it, metal head!

50
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,778
-But I merely repeat what
everyone says, that you

51
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,080
couldst never hope to
defeat her, my lady.

52
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,082
-We'll just see about that.

53
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,585
She'll go from the fairest to
the foulest faster than you

54
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,620
can whistle Dixie.

55
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,989
-This is too easy.

56
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:40,260
No matter who wins the fight, I
shall have one less problem.

57
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,262
-The others must still be
inside of that thing.

58
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,697
-Yes.

59
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,365
Let's just hope they make
it out in one piece.

60
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,033
-A piece of what?

61
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,501
-You've got to have faith.

62
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,870
If I was able to make it
out, then so can they.

63
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,006
-I hope you're right, Tommy, but
if they could get out, why

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,274
haven't they?

65
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,542
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Takuya?

66
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,044
JP?

67
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,813
Where is everyone?

68
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,049
Jeez, if you yell in the forest
and no-one hears you,

69
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:06,053
is there really any point
in yelling at all?

70
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,888
-I can't believe what
I'm beholding.

71
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,158
The mean one really exists.

72
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,527
-It's beyond me that
anyone could be so

73
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,162
beastly to our beloved.

74
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,364
-It's because she's jealous
of Ranamon.

75
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,200
But we'll put her where she
belongs, right boys?

76
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,669
-No-one messes with Ranamon
and her fans!

77
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,604
Yeah!

78
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:25,572
FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
The Honeybeemon's

79
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,074
speed makes them dangerous.

80
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:31,244
Luckily, they're not
so sift upstairs.

81
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,213
-Alone again.

82
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,915
You'd think I'd be used
to it by now.

83
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,753
(THINKING) Seems like I
always end up alone.

84
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,897
-Ow.

85
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,099
-You OK?

86
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,501
-I guess, but my shoe's
hurting my foot.

87
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,469
-That doesn't look too bad.

88
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,671
Here, try this.

89
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,305
-That feels great.

90
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,740
-I'm glad.

91
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,808
-Wow, thank you.

92
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,977
-Why don't we walk together
for a little while?

93
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,780
You know, just in case that
bandage doesn't hold.

94
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,348
-I didn't think you'd be so
nice after what the other

95
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,016
girls said.

96
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,151
-Oh.

97
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,186
-Sorry, that didn't really
come out right.

98
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:13,987
-That's OK.

99
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,822
I'm kind of used to it by now.

100
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,657
Those girls have been mean
to me ever since I

101
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,992
came back from Italy.

102
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,061
But listen, I'll totally
understand if you want to go

103
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,229
and catch up to them.

104
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,330
-Are you kidding?

105
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,398
You're nicer than all of
them put together.

106
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,299
-Thanks.

107
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,701
-Hey, I've got an idea.

108
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,071
Why don't you join our group
for dinner later?

109
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,306
-(THINKING) She seemed
so nice, too.

110
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:33,907
Oh, well.

111
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,542
Better find the others.

112
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,710
-Be prepared.

113
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,378
When she's beneath
the cage-- hey.

114
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,416
She's making a beeline
for the other path!

115
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,255
-Huh?

116
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:42,349
Aw.

117
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,184
-Come on!

118
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,385
-We were so close!

119
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,589
-Huh?

120
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,424
Look like you guys could
use a little help.

121
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,559
-If you'd be so kind.

122
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,217
-Hold on a second.

123
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:02,318
I'll get you out.

124
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,195
Execute!

125
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,763
Spirit Evolution!

126
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,450
Kazemon!

127
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,952
-Unbelievable!

128
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:39,122
KAZEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Stand back!

129
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:39,656
All right, guys.

130
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,124
You're all clear.

131
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,292
-Thank you!

132
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,426
-We don't know what would
have become of us.

133
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,260
Thanks so much.

134
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:46,496
-Take care.

135
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:47,330
-Ugh.

136
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:48,631
Can you believe her?

137
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:50,300
-Being all phony about caring.

138
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,334
-She'll be sorry.

139
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:59,275
-This web will catch her before
she can believe it.

140
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,109
-Ah!

141
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,144
I don't believe it.

142
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:03,480
Here she comes!

143
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:05,782
-Betrayed by our own trap.

144
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:07,684
-Sorry, but would it be
too much trouble?

145
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:10,119
-No problem.

146
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:13,890
Hurricane Wing!

147
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,159
-We owe you beyond
a mere thanks.

148
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:17,026
-You sure do.

149
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,027
-Ah!

150
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:21,197
Before long, she'll want
to enslave us.

151
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:22,999
-Then we must stop her.

152
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:25,702
-And when we do, Ranamon
will love us forever.

153
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:26,169
-Right!

154
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,203
Let's get her!

155
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,679
-Here she comes!

156
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,949
-We have her for sure.

157
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,086
-Ah!

158
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:47,423
[shouting]

159
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,229
-Oh, great.

160
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,098
A dead end.

161
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,300
Wait, maybe it's not.

162
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,401
I hope this works.

163
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:03,273
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Now where am I?

164
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:06,676
And where's everybody else?

165
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,278
Man, this world takes confusion

166
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,780
to a whole new level.

167
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,615
Hey, at least there's nothing
here I have to fight.

168
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,317
[screeching]

169
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,252
-Whoa.

170
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,322
[roaring]

171
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,158
-Well, here we go again.

172
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,660
FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): If
he doesn't get you with his

173
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,862
razor sharp claws, Parrotmon
will defeat you with his Sonic

174
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:26,963
Destroyer attack.

175
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,009
-Execute!

Spirit Evolution!

-Sonic Destroyer!

179
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,705
Sonic Destroyer!

180
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,608
-Pyro Darts!

181
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:12,976
How's that for a hot foot?

182
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,982
No way I'm going out
as bird food!

183
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:20,950
Pyro Punch!

184

[shouting]

185
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,824
-Time for some purification.

186
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:28,791
All right, bird brain.

187
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:33,763
Let's put you back
in your cage.

188
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,765
Fractal code digitize!

189
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:41,337
Bye bye, birdy.

190
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,608
Huh?

191
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:47,643
What are you looking at?

192
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,879
Wait a second, what is this?

193
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,882
It almost feels alive.

194
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:54,384
Whoa.

195
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,719
-Honey bread, oh
beautiful one?

196
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,454
-Before that, try
some honey ice.

197
00:08:58,521 --> 00:08:59,689
-I--

198
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,224
-Let her finish her
honey juice.

199
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:02,692
-Thanks.

200
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,694
-It's our most beloved drink.

201
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:06,329
-Well, it's great.

202
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:09,032
-Just be sure to have some ice
before you get too full.

203
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:10,566
I beseech you.

204
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,001
-Well, of course I will.

205
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:15,505
I'm sure if it's anything like
juice, I'll just love it.

206
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:17,240
-And please don't be
afraid that it's

207
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,207
going to make you fat.

208
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,877
That's what always
worried Rana--

209
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:23,946
-Thanks once again for bailing
us out of everything that

210
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,847
befell us.

211
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:26,049
-I was glad to do it.

212
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,251
And anyway, I should be thanking
you for all this

213
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:28,951
delicious food.

214
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,253
-No problem.

215
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,755
Besides, if not for you, we
wouldn't even be here.

216
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:36,426
-Hey, you guys need
to eat, too.

217
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,429
Food's always better if you
eat it with someone else.

218
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:40,763
-Ah!

219
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,903
-Dirty double crossers.

220
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,237
I've got to do everything
myself.

221
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:58,247
-There.

222
00:09:58,281 --> 00:09:59,082
Ranamon!

223
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:00,116
-My, what lovely flowers.

224
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,317
Are they for me?

225
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:02,318
-Sure.

226
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,187
Who else would they be for?

227
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,823
-And now, here's a little
something for you and your

228
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,691
numbskull friends to give
to that bratty girl.

229
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,159
Make sure she eats it.

230
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,661
This apple's going to
give her the worst

231
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,463
nightmares she's ever had.

232
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,832
And just a word to the wise,
if you mess this up, you're

233
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,667
out of the fan club, honey.

234
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,135
-Yeah, but--

235
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,169
-Just do it!

236
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,974
-An apple for us?

237
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:25,842
-No.

238
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,844
I brought this for her.

239
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,193
Here.

240
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:29,892
-For me?

241
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:30,680
Thank you.

242
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:34,383
Looks delicious.

243
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,218
HONEYBEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Wait!

244
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,385
-What?

245
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,887
-Oh, nothing.

246
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,155
-OK.

247
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,560
Mm.

248
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,895
Thanks, guys.

249
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:49,866
This turned out to
be a great day.

250
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,900

RANAMON (OFFSCREEN): What's
the matter, sugar?

253
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:07,481
Feeling a little under
the weather?

254
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:09,116
Let the nightmare begin!

00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:14,388
-Hey, guys.

257
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:15,656
Can I help?

258
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:16,957
-I doubt it.

259
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,459
-Yeah, besides, if it isn't
pasta, she probably

260
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:21,461
wouldn't eat it.

261
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:22,129
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Zoe!

262
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:24,665
-Huh?

263
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,967
-What are you doing just
standing over there, Zoe?

264
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,101
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Well, I--

265
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:30,304
-Are you gonna join us
for dinner, or what?

266
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:31,472
-Yeah.

267
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:32,706
-Well, come on.

268
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:34,308
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): You
must be kidding.

269
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:35,209
Her?

270
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:36,610
-Huh?

271
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:38,111
-If she's going to eat
here, then I'm not.

272
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:38,612
-Me either.

273
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:39,146
Weirdo.

274
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:40,614
-Go back to Italy.

275
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:44,351
Maybe somebody likes
you there.

276
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:46,954
-I guess, then, maybe you
should, you know, go back to

277
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,856
your own group, Zoe.

278
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:52,025
We're already using all of our
pots and pans, and junk.

279
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:53,494
Sorry.

280
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:56,029
-Liar!

281
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,030
-I'm sorry!

282
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,065
-Wait!

283
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:03,871
RANAMON (OFFSCREEN): Oh,
what's wrong, sugar?

284
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:06,206
Did our little beauty queen
wannabe just realize what I

285
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,207
always knew?

286
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:09,276
That no one really likes you?

287
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:10,377
Must be hard to be
s unpopular.

288
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:16,617
-Man, I would kill for
a cheeseburger.

289
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,852
Actually, knowing this world and
my luck, I'd probably get

290
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,187
eaten by a cheeseburger.

291
00:12:20,254 --> 00:12:21,522
Hey, wait, what are those?

292
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:22,890
Cherries?

293
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:27,628
Those are better than a
cheeseburger, because they're

294
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:28,929
actually here!

295
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:34,801
-Come here, I got somethin'
for ya.

He's like Woodmon's
older, bigger,

299
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:40,407
and much meaner brother.

-Cherry Blast!

301
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,243
Chew on those, pallie.

Not.

Lightning Blitz!

00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:41,902
Looks like someone's hungry for
some purification pie, and

311
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,904
I'm just the guy to pass
out the plates.

Aw.

315
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,619
I can't eat that.

316
00:13:58,619 --> 00:13:59,886
Wait, maybe it's a way out.

TOMMY (OFFSCREEN):
We'll catch you!

319
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:13,266
-That was a bad idea.

320
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,334
-You made it out!

321
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:15,502
-We were worried.

322
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:16,970
Did you bring me a present?

323
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,671
-No.

324
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:19,139
-See?

325
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,807
They are gonna make it out,
just like I said.

326
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:22,109
-Oh, no!

327
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:24,378
Look, it's Zoe and Ranamon.

328
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:26,313
-I have friends.

329
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,447
-Please.

330
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:28,849
They're just pretending,
sugar.

331
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:30,784
When you're not around, they
say all sorts of bad things

332
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:31,385
about you.

-That's not true, is it?

334
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:37,190
My friends wouldn't
be that mean.

335
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:39,659
But then again, how could I know
for sure whether or not

336
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:41,194
they're lying to me?

337
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:44,064
Lots of people seem
nice at first.

338
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:46,166
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Sorry.

339
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,200
-Liar!

340
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:49,536
-I'm sorry!

341
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:50,871
-Wait!

342
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:58,111
-So I was cruel right
back to her.

343
00:14:58,145 --> 00:14:59,112
That's not right.

344
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:01,181
I shouldn't have been mean.

345
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,949
I'm gonna try harder
to be nicer.

346
00:15:02,983 --> 00:15:05,452
I'll be a better person.

347
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:08,288
-Oh, you are such a
goodie two-shoes!

348
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:09,623
Uh-oh.

349
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:19,800
-Execute!

350
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,134
Spirit Evolution!

351
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,522
Kazemon!

352
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:43,690
-All right, miss perfect.

353
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:45,492
You think you're so hot?

354
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,694
Well, you're not as smart
as you think.

355
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,996
See those Honeybeemon
over there?

356
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,865
You thought they cared about
you, didn't you?

357
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:54,668
Well, let me let you in on a
little secret, honey pie.

358
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:58,004
They're really working for me,
and they despise you like

359
00:15:58,004 --> 00:15:59,506
everyone else does.

360
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:01,341
What's that look for?

361
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:03,009
-Wha!

362
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,344
-You're still in the fanclub,
so you little insects better

363
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:06,513
start cheering for me, or
you're next on the list.

364
00:16:06,513 --> 00:16:08,215
Got it?

365
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:09,216
-Yeah.

366
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:10,150
Yay.

367
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:11,151
Yay.

368
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:11,985
-Ha!

369
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:13,386
-Now, that's better.

370
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:14,387
Draining Rain!

371
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:19,926
-Whoa!

372
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:24,564
RANAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Whipping Waves!

373
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:27,100
-Whoa!

374
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,235
-What's the matter?

375
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:29,736
Hard to do your little
kicks when you're

376
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:31,071
so far off the ground?

377
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:34,040
Here, let me help you down.

378
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:35,976
It's all over, girlie girl!

379
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:46,209
-I can't believe it's
over so quick.

380
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:47,510
-Huh?

381
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:50,847
-It's not!

382
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,182
Tempest Twist!

383
00:16:58,388 --> 00:16:59,689
-Why, you horrible
little brat!

384
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:02,692
Oh, you're going to pay
so big for that.

385
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:03,727
-Oh, yeah?

386
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,031
Slide Evolution!

387
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:12,669
Zephyrmon!

388
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:14,904
-So beautiful!

389
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:16,172
-Oh, please.

390
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:20,243
Slide Evolution!

391
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:25,248
Now, what do you say?

392
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,249
-So ugly!

393
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:29,119
But it's still Ranamon.

394
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:31,421
Quick, before she gets mad.

395
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,756
Yay!

396
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:38,728
CALMARAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Lay off the face!

397
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:45,935
What's wrong?

398
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:47,103
Little water logged?

399
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:48,671
-Yay, yay!

400
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:49,973
Yay, yay!

401
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:52,575
Yay!

402
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,144
-See?

403
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:55,178
No one's on your side.

404
00:17:57,547 --> 00:18:00,283
It's time I clipped your
wings for good.

405
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:05,155
Titanic Tempest!

406
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:19,969
Well, well.

407
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:21,871
Looks like everything's right
with the world again.

408
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:24,541
What's more, I am the prettiest
and the strongest.

409
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:26,876
Now, give me that cheering!

410
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,211
Huh?

411
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:34,250
-Sorry, but you're still as
ugly and weak as ever.

412
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:36,219
-Yeah!

413
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,854
You are beyond great.

414
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:38,755
-So strong.

415
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:40,390
-And really nice.

416
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:43,059
-From now on, we're gonna
be your number one fans.

417
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:44,260
-Thanks, guys.

418
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,696
CALMARAMON (OFFSCREEN): What?

419
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,966
How dare you turn on me,
you little runts!

420
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:52,535
Acid Ink!

421
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:56,206
Take a good look, boys, before
your new queen melts into an

422
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:57,607
ugly ball of muck!

423
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,374
-Don't listen to her.

424
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,776
You still have inner beauty.

425
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:02,445
-The only thing that's melting
is our hearts.

426
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:07,317
[shouting]

427
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,954
-Where's my cheering?

428
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:13,923
-How about this instead?

429
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:17,827
Hurricane Gale!

430
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:18,828
[shouting]

431
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:21,798
-[inaudible], remember?

432
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:24,133
-For you, I'll make
an exception.

433
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,136
Plasma Paws!

434
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:30,106
[shouting]

435
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:31,341
-A gift?

436
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:32,442
You shouldn't have.

437
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:39,649
Slide Evolution!

438
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:42,185
Kazemon!

439
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:45,521
Ranamon, your reign is over.

440
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:50,326
I'd say it's been fun,
but it hasn't.

441
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,895
Fractal code digitize!

442
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:10,413
See ya, "sugah." It's one thing
to be nice, but it's

443
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:13,082
another to be a big pushover.

444
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:19,556
[cheering]

445
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:20,790
-Huh?

446
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:26,262
Hey, guys.

447
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:27,730
Guess what?

448
00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:29,232
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): You
brought me a present?

449
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:29,999
-No.

450
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:30,667
-What is it, Zoe?

451
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,668
-Why not?

452
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,236
-Ranamon's gone.

453
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,570
-Yes, and long live Zoe!

454
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:35,805
-She's the best.

455
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:37,640
JP (OFFSCREEN): Let
me see that.

456
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:39,475
You guys might be members
of the Zoe fan

457
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:40,910
club, but I'm the president.

458
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,848
-Wait, where are the others?

459
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:47,817
-I'm afraid the eyes
have them.

460
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,819
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): I thought
they'd be here by now, but I'm

461
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:52,241
starting to wonder if they'll
ever get out.

462
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,203
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): They will.

463
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:53,823
I hope.

464
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:55,792
NARRATOR: But if they
don't, how will they

465
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:57,126
save the Digital World?

466
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,461
Or get home?

467
00:20:58,494 --> 00:21:01,331
See if everything will work
out on the next Digimon,

468
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,832
Digital Monsters.
