NARRATOR: After their battle
with the Royal Knights, the

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:05,020
gang found themselves marooned
on the moon.

3
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:07,923
Even worse, everyone was
unconscious, except Bokomon,

4
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:09,258
Neemon, and Koichi.

5
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:11,594
Suddenly, a Starmon appeared and
took everyone to safety.

6
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,263
Once the gang was revived, they
had to figure out how to

7
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:16,398
get off the moon and back
to the Digital World.

8
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:18,934
They tried everything, and
eventually settled on using an

9
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:20,569
old rocket that the
Burgermon built.

10
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:22,604
They used a slingshot to
get it into orbit,

11
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:23,772
but ran out of steam.

12
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,574
Luckily, along came a Trailmon
to push them

13
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:27,009
the rest of the way.

14
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,445
Now they're back on Digi firma
and looking to stop Lucemon

15
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:30,913
and his royal rats.

16
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:31,914
THEME SONG: Digimon!

00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:37,486
[theme music]

18
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:40,856
THEME SONG: We look to the past
as we head for the future

19
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:45,127
to reclaim the Digital World.

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,831
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

21
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:51,166
by the the lessons
we've learned.

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,340
As we work towards one solution

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,277
through a Spirit Evolution.

24
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:03,612
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

25
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:04,279
Huh!

26
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:05,247
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,615
Digimon!

28
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:09,184
Forever united as one.

29
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:10,819
Digimon!

30
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:13,188
Together the battles are won.

31
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:14,189
Digimon!

32
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:17,459
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

33
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:21,797
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

34
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,467
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

35
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:26,468
Hi-ya-moo-ha.

36
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:27,469
Huh!

37
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:28,470
Hi-ya-moo-ah.

38
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:29,705
Digimon!

39
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:41,650
-Beautiful.

40
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:44,753
But now it's my turn.

41
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,230
And now for a late
night snack.

42
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:56,231
Beautiful.

43
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:58,534
Delicious.

44
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:03,005
[wicked laughter]

45
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,484
-Full yet?

46
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:16,251
-Never.

47
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:18,387
-Then let's see.

48
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,722
Ah, beautiful.

49
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,391
-Steel Town.

50
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:24,059
We'll scan everything there!

51
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,264
-Thanks for the lift.

52
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:31,567
-I'm just glad I didn't
mess it up.

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,403
-Bye!

54
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:35,737
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Where
are we anyway?

55
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:36,772
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Steel Town.

56
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,907
The whole place is
made of steel.

57
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:39,708
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): Gee, never
would've guessed

58
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,376
that from the name.

59
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,911
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Wow, it's
all so shiny and bright.

60
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:45,247
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
bright is right.

61
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:47,950
Some of those buildings are
reflecting right in my eyes.

62
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:49,618
-I bet you guys wish you
had a cool pair of

63
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:51,954
goggles about now.

64
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:53,222
-Yeah right.

65
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:55,124
All the cool kids
wear goggles.

66
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:57,292
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Well, they will.

67
00:02:57,292 --> 00:03:00,195
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): It's not
so shiny and clean here.

68
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:02,564
[laughter]

69
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:05,033
-Huh?

70
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,034
-What is that?

71
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:11,073
[gasp]

72
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,708
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Sagittarimon.

73
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:16,545
Half man, half horse, and all
mean, his judgment arrow

74
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:19,982
attack is three prongs
of pain.

75
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:21,483
-Stop right there, humans.

76
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:24,219
While I have nothing against you
personally, I must demand

77
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:26,622
that you hand over all
of your obsessions.

78
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:28,624
-Obsessions?

79
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:30,793
-No, wait I mean your
possessions.

80
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:33,262
I should've just said stuff
like I usually do.

81
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:35,464
I never should have bought
that thesaurus.

82
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:38,300
-So, you have nothing better
to do than rob us?

83
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,801
-That's right.

84
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:41,270
Now, if you don't want to
get hurt, hand over your

85
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:42,938
obsessions.

86
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:43,438
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): I can't
believe we're being robbed by

87
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,506
someone this dumb.

88
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:46,108
You mean possessions, right?

89
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:47,142
-Yeah, right.

90
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,311
That's what I just
said, isn't it?

91
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:52,214
-OK, just give us a sec.

92
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:54,449
-There's no way he's with
the Royal Knights.

93
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:57,352
-Yeah, let's just get rid of
him and be on our way.

94
00:03:57,352 --> 00:03:58,353
-What's wrong?

95
00:03:58,387 --> 00:03:59,855
Hand it over.

96
00:03:59,888 --> 00:04:02,424
-I'm afraid we're going to
have to say no to that.

97
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:04,126
-Wha?

98
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:05,627
-Look, we don't have time for
this, so why don't you just

99
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:06,962
leave before you get hurt?

100
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:07,963
-Trust me.

101
00:04:07,996 --> 00:04:09,765
You're the one who's
gonna be hurting.

102
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:11,099
YOUNG VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Stop!

103
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,134
-What now?

104
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:17,806
-Who's that?

105
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:18,440
-Human kids.

106
00:04:18,473 --> 00:04:19,975
But how?

107
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,810
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Well, uh,
perhaps other humans are

108
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:23,979
working to save the
Digital World too.

109
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:28,183
-Hey you.

110
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:29,852
Are you the no good Digimon
who's been stealing from

111
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,220
everybody around here?

112
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:32,788
-So what if I am?

113
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,523
-Well, then you're
gonna get it.

114
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,024
-From who?

115
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:36,825
You guys?

116
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:38,727
A bunch of puny little kids.

117
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,029
I could take you easy, even
if you teamed up with

118
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:42,731
these guys over here.

119
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:46,168
-Yeah, but we're not the ones
you should be worrying about.

120
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:47,169
-Who's that?

121
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:50,372
-Whoever he is, he sure
is impressive!

122
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:52,040
-It's Angemon.

123
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,710
-I'm gonna be like him.

124
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,879
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): And you
could certainly do worse.

125
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,548
Angemon has a virtuous and
compassionate heart, and few

126
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:03,118
can withstand his Hand
of Fate attack.

127
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:04,186
-OK.

128
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:08,223
Judgement Arrow.

129
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,367
-Time for you to go.

130
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,835
[cheering]

131
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:27,633
-I thought I told
you to leave.

132
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:30,803
-I'll remember this!

133
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:32,105
-Wow.

134
00:05:32,138 --> 00:05:33,473
-Wow and a half.

135
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:35,508
-Awesome job Angemon.

136
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:36,509
-Are you kids OK?

137
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:37,677
What?

138
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:39,278
Wait a second.

139
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:40,513
-Hey, look.

140
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:41,214
It's Tommy!

141
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,849
-Huh?

142
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,685
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Looks like
more friends for Tommy.

143
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,186
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): So, wait.

144
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,688
Are you telling me that you've
been in the Digital World the

145
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:50,356
whole time that we've
been here?

146
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,859
You came on the trains too?

147
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,160
-Yep.

148
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:57,830
-Come on.

149
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:58,664
-Huh?

150
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:01,134
-We're gonna get left behind!

151
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:02,301
Wait!

152
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,302
KATSUHARU (OFFSCREEN):
Slowpoke.

153
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:05,705
I shouldn't even bring
you with me.

154
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:09,008
Wherever it is we're going,
well, at least we'll get there

155
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:11,677
in a hurry.

156
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,013
After we got on the train,
we ended up at the Forest

157
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:16,015
Terminal with a bunch of
other confused kids.

158
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:18,851
I mean, we weren't confused
like them, but

159
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:20,186
you know what I mean.

160
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,521
Anyway.

161
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:23,556
We started talking to some other
kids, and that's how we

162
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:26,726
met Teruo and Chiaki.

163
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:29,362
Then this chick told us all to
get back on board and go home,

164
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:31,364
but we were like, forget that.

165
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:32,865
This place rocks.

166
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:34,934
We want to stick around and
see what happens next.

167
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:37,336
So, that's what we did.

168
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,372
Pretty soon, we met Angemon,
and we've been traveling

169
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:40,907
around ever since.

170
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,609
You know, like having
adventures, fighting

171
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:45,912
injustices, that
kind of stuff.

172
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:48,080
-It's just like TV,
only we're in it.

173
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,750
And sure it's been dangerous,
but we have Angemon with us.

174
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:53,419
-Hm?

175
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:54,954
Hey, Tommy.

176
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:57,090
We're sorry about
picking on you.

177
00:06:57,123 --> 00:06:57,890
-Hmph.

178
00:06:57,924 --> 00:06:59,125
-It's not safe here.

179
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,893
You guys really should have
gotten on that train if

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,562
Ophanimon told you to do it.

181
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:04,230
-Ophanimon?

182
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:07,033
Oh, is she the one who's been
sending us those emails our

183
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,534
cell phones?

184
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:11,204
-Yeah, we used to get messages
all the time when we first got

185
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:15,074
here, but we haven't received
any for a while now.

186
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:15,908
-Your phones?

187
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,176
Why's that?

188
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:18,678
Did you have your D-Tectors
stolen or something?

189
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:20,246
-What's a D-Tector?

190
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,748
-Wha--

191
00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:23,916
-All right.

192
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,084
We get to ask some
questions now.

193
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:27,220
Like, what are you doing here?

194
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:29,555
-Actually, we're trying to
restore peace to the entire

195
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,290
Digital World.

196
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:32,291
-World peace?

197
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,460
-Totally groovy.

198
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,896
-How are you guys gonna save
the entire world by

199
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:37,930
yourselves?

200
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:40,600
-Yeah, look what you
have for Digimon.

201
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,235
They couldn't fight their
way out of a paper bag.

202
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:44,237
-Hey.

203
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,439
-Yeah, it looks like the most
that those things could do to

204
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,808
save the world is volunteer
to pick up the trash.

205
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:52,979
-Oh yeah?

206
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,914
Well, we have the spirits
of the 10 legendary

207
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,449
warriors, so there.

208
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:57,483
Well, we do.

209
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:02,788
KATSUHARU (OFFSCREEN):
They probably get

210
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:04,423
hurt even doing that.

211
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:05,258
-Listen.

212
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:06,726
You should go home.

213
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,794
You're just going to get hurt
if you stick around here.

214
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:10,963
-Huh?

215
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,098
-Come on.

216
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:13,566
You guys don't even know
what you're doing.

217
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,269
You've been lucky so far, but
sooner or later, you're gonna

218
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,437
run into something that you
won't be able to handle.

219
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:20,973
-What do you know?

220
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:23,476
-We know there's some real
dangerous stuff here, like the

221
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,011
Royal Knights.

222
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:26,312
-Yeah.

223
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:27,480
They're the reason why pieces
of this world keep

224
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,015
disappearing.

225
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:30,483
-They want to destroy the whole
place and don't care who

226
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:31,984
goes with it.

227
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:33,786
And you guys could be next.

228
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:35,821
-Hey, you guys can't
tell us what to do.

229
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:37,523
You're not our fathers.

230
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,492
-Yeah, we've been doing
just fine so far.

231
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:42,528
Maybe you're the little babies
who need to run home to momma.

232
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,464
We're out of here.

233
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:46,899
-And you know what, Tommy?

234
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:48,501
I'm not sorry for
picking on you.

235
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,973
-Good riddance to bad rubbish,
that's what I say.

236
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,910
Anyway, it's all out
of our hands now.

237
00:08:57,944 --> 00:08:58,978
-J.P.'s right.

238
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,680
We can't be worrying
about those guys.

239
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:01,814
Come on.

240
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:03,816
We have enough worries
of our own.

241
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:05,985
-And besides, we did warn
them after all.

242
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:08,487
It's not our fault if they
didn't listen to us.

243
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,323
-But we can't let them
go off on their own

244
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:11,524
and get into trouble.

245
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:13,025
It just wouldn't be right.

246
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:15,628
-Hey, look, we did everything
we could, OK?

247
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:18,798
Yeah, just trust
me on this one.

248
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:19,498
-Why?

249
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,666
Have you been right before?

250
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,135
-Well, sure, at least once.

251
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,904
ANGEMON (OFFSCREEN): Most times,
the right thing to do

252
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:28,207
is easy to see, if you're
willing to look and to do

253
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:28,708
what's necessary.

254
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,476
-Huh?

255
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:32,378
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Angemon.

256
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:34,213
ANGEMON (OFFSCREEN): Ophanimon
foresaw the wickedness coming

257
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:36,749
to the digital world and knew
she might not survive.

258
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,551
But she nonetheless
stood up against

259
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:40,386
the forces of darkness.

260
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,589
She also saw that humans could
help defeat the evil ones, but

261
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:46,025
she didn't know which humans
would succeed.

262
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:48,427
So she risked putting them all
in danger and called them to

263
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:50,096
the digital world.

264
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:52,798
Luckily, most were brave enough
to swallow their pride

265
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:56,369
and leave when she asked.

266
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:59,071
Those four remained, and as
Ophanimon ordered, I have

267
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:01,274
continued to protect them.

268
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:02,275
-Why?

269
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,043
What you should do is
send them home.

270
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,278
You know how dangerous
this world is.

271
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:08,314
Plus, you could be helping us
fight the Royal Knights or

272
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:10,316
something instead of babysitting
that bunch of

273
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:11,917
selfish brats.

274
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:14,420
You have to explain to them that
they have to go home, and

275
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:15,655
if that doesn't work, then just

276
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:18,291
throw them onto a Trailmon.

277
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:21,160
-I have tried to explain many
times, but they will not

278
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:23,496
leave, so I must protect them.

279
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:25,931
-He's just doing what's
necessary.

280
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,700
-What do you mean?

281
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,302
-You can't blame him if
they decided to stay.

282
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,705
And maybe they're not wrong for
wanting to stay and make

283
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:34,440
something of themselves
either.

284
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:35,841
-He has a point.

285
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,510
-If someone said you were
useless and tried to send you

286
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,445
home, what would you do?

287
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:42,014
-You'd probably stay and try
to prove them wrong, right?

288
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:42,882
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
I don't know.

289
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:43,849
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Well, I do.

290
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,017
That would be the first,
second, and

291
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:46,852
third thing you'd do.

292
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:51,157
At least after yelling and
complaining a lot, you would.

293
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,358
-Argh.

294
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:54,226
Jeez, Bokomon, change
your mind much?

295
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:55,695
Fine.

296
00:10:55,695 --> 00:10:57,196
We'll help them, or send
them home, or whatever.

297
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:58,030
-(THINKING) Great.

298
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,198
We're stuck with
those bullies.

299
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:00,199
-Well.

300
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:01,701
If it isn't little Tommy.

301
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:06,138
What's wrong?

302
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:09,175
Friends not around
to protect you?

303
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:20,144
So, Tommy.

304
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:21,679
-What?

305
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:23,847
-Well, I guess you think you're
all big and tough now

306
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,483
that you found some older
friends to protect you, huh?

307
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,986
So tought you want the
world to yourself.

308
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:31,121
So tough that you think you
can boss us around.

309
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,790
But know what I think?

310
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:36,293
We're staying, and you and
your friends are leaving.

311
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:37,494
That's why you're gonna tell
them you want to go home.

312
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:38,962
-What?

313
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:41,231
-I know how goodie two-shoes
like them work.

314
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,534
Cry hard enough and they'll have
you home faster than you

315
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,235
can yell momma.

316
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,237
And with them gone, we can be
the heroes who save the world.

317
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,373
Now, are you gonna tell them,
or am I gonna have to get

318
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:50,374
rough with you?

319
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:52,176
KATSUHARU (OFFSCREEN): Hey!

320
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,877
TEPPEI (OFFSCREEN): Katsuharu.

321
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,212
CHIAKI (OFFSCREEN): Sure, there
have been times when I

322
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:56,580
wanted to go home.

323
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:59,717
I mean, sometimes I miss my
friends and family, and I've

324
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:01,985
never had to walk so much
in my whole life.

325
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,321
But, here we're living this
incredible adventure, like

326
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,123
something out of a book.

327
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:08,659
-And really, that's just about
all we would go back to.

328
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,894
Books, and school, and
everything else that makes the

329
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:13,230
real world boring.

330
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:16,633
-Well, sure it's exciting, but
it's really dangerous too.

331
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,869
-You guys should be worried
about getting home alive, not

332
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:20,537
about being bored once
you get there.

333
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:22,373
Don't you ever think
about that?

334
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:23,907
-Not really.

335
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:25,576
I mean, Angemon's been there
right from the start to

336
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:29,046
protect us, and he'd
never let us down.

337
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:29,880
-Besides.

338
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:32,549
Katusharu looks out for us.

339
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,351
-Let him go, Teppei.

340
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:37,888
You're not gonna beat anybody
up unless I say so, got it?

341
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:40,891
-Yeah.

342
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,726
-What were you hoping
to do, Teppei?

343
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,027
Start a fight with those guys?

344
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:46,063
There are more of them
than us, remember?

345
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,464
-I know, but I was just
thinking that--

346
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:48,632
-Well, don't.

347
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:50,100
I mean, you are right
about him.

348
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,603
He's just hiding behind
stronger kids.

349
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:55,272
But then, that's what weaklings
like him always do,

350
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,241
and it would be stupid
to expect him

351
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:58,609
to do anything different.

352
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,210
-Argh.

353
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:02,546
-This world is for the strong,
Tommy, and little weaklings

354
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:04,014
like you shouldn't be here.

355
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,185
-You're wrong.

356
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:09,420
-What?

357
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:10,521
-I'm strong.

358
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:12,556
You're the one who's weak.

359
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:15,025
-Huh?

360
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:16,894
-You're hiding behind Angemon.

361
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:17,895
[explosion]

362
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:22,299
-What happened?

363
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:25,436
-Our friend is back.

364
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,436
-That's right.

365
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,938
Your friend is back.

366
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:30,774
But this time, he brought a
few friends of his own.

367
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:34,611
Ooh, you little brats
are in for it now.

368
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:36,280
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Centarumon
isn't to big on

369
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,116
brains, but he's huge on brawn,
and his Solar Ray

370
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:40,951
attack won't brighten
up your day.

371
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:43,453
-It's like a whole army.

372
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:44,988
-This is what you all get.

373
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:48,358
It's payback for not handing
over your obsessions.

374
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:51,094
-You mean possessions,
not obsessions.

375
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:52,095
-I know what I mean.

376
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,331
I have a mind like
a steel flap.

377
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,200
Ready to attack Centarumon?

378
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,201
-Ready!

379
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:58,502
KATSUHARU (OFFSCREEN):
Guys, get back.

380
00:13:58,502 --> 00:13:59,670
-We'll take care of this guy.

381
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:01,438
-Huh?

382
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,473
-Look, just stay
out of the way.

383
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,107
You guys can't handle this.

384
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:04,641
-We can't?

385
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:05,275
Sure we can.

386
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,444
Angemon'll fight them.

387
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:08,912
-I'll handle this.

388
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:10,147
Katsuharu.

389
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,149
You and the others find
somewhere to hole up out of

390
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:13,450
harm's way.

391
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,952
-Fool.

392
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,420
Do you really think you
can take us all on?

393
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,593
Judgement Arrow!

394
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,333
-Should we do something?

395
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,434
-Well, I don't know.

396
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,870
Should we Spirit Evolve?

397
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:35,839
-You just stand back and
watch Angemon go.

398
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,208
-Yeah, he's a fighting machine,
and there ain't no

399
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:41,678
one in the whole world who
could stand up to him.

400
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:43,480
-You see what we mean?

401
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:46,850
-Go Angemon.

402
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,151
Yeah!

403
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,386
Haha.

404
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:53,090
-Hehehe.

405
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,191
Charge!

406
00:14:57,294 --> 00:14:58,662
-It's a trap.

407
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:00,931
-Yeah, and we fell
right into it.

408
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:03,333
-No!

409
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:07,271
-Don't forget about
little old me.

410
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:08,672
-What are you doing?

411
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:09,673
Run!

412
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:10,674
-Yeah!

413
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:11,975
-Solar Ray.

414
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:26,189
-Teppei!

415
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:27,591
-Katsuharu help me!

416
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,100
-(THINKING) I can't.

417
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:38,235
I can't.

418
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,003
Get out of there!

419
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:06,381
-Are you OK?

420
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:07,282
-I guess.

421
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:08,283
Yeah.

422
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:09,551
-Hm.

423
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:12,620
I'm strong.

424
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:14,956
You're the one who's weak.

425
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:17,892
-He was right.

426
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:20,195
-You're a bunch of bullies,
but you're not

427
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:21,229
gonna bother us anymore!

428
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:32,740
Execute!

429
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,175
Beast Spirit Evolution!

430
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:52,927
Korikakumon!

431
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:57,599
-Huh?

432
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:58,299
-Wha?

433
00:16:58,366 --> 00:16:59,767
-Whoa!

434
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:03,404
-Still wanna fight?

435
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:06,708
Not so tough now, huh?

436
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,842
-Come on, let's help him out.

437
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:08,877
-Right.

438
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:16,351
-Execute!

439
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:17,685
Spirit Evolution!

440
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:31,132
-Agunimon!

441
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:43,611
-Lobomon!

442
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,023
-Kazemon!

443
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:07,268
-Beetlemon!

444
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:19,747
-Loweemon!

445
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:23,084
-How about we start
with a hot hoof?

446
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:26,020
Pyro Punch!

447
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:27,422
-Lobo Kendo!

448
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:29,991
-Hurricane Wing!

00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:31,326
-Lightning Blitz!

450
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,328
-Shadow Lance!

451
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:34,529
-No way.

452
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,664
They all turned into Digimon.

453
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:38,533
-They're so brave.

454
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,835
-I'm surprised you know what
courage looks like.

455
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,036
-Huh?

456
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:45,840
-Their bravery is why the
spirits chose them.

457
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,910
-I had no idea these humans
could evolve.

458
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:51,145
ANGEMON (OFFSCREEN): And don't
forget about little old me.

459
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,413
-Huh?

460
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:54,015
-I believe we have unfinished
business.

461
00:18:57,885 --> 00:19:02,490
[groaning]

462
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,992
-All right.

463
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,526
If you guys are smart, you'll
turn around and run

464
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,995
right out of here.

465
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:08,830
-And you run fast.

466
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,831
-OK.

467
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,202
-Man, we are good.

468
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:16,804
-Roar!

469
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:18,139
-Sorry.

470
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:20,241
For real.

471
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,477
I shouldn't have called you
weak, because you're braver

472
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,311
than I've ever been.

473
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:24,846
-You saved my life.

474
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:31,419
KATSUHARU (OFFSCREEN): It would
be an honor if you'd let

475
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:32,720
me call you my friend.

476
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,322
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN):
Sure, you bet.

477
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:35,923
-Well, guys.

478
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,725
Now it's our turn to be brave
and do something we don't

479
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,060
really want to do.

480
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:41,029
We've had a great time here,
but these guys are right.

481
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:42,063
It's too dangerous.

482
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,531
So, I think we should go home.

483
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,033
-Seriously?

484
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,367
-Yep.

485
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,141
[shouting]

486
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:55,977
-How moving.

487
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,378
-The Royal Knights.

488
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,246
-But it would've been even more

489
00:19:58,246 --> 00:20:00,248
moving if you were defeated.

490
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:02,383
-I guess we'll just
have to do that.

491
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,451
-Not so fast.

492
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:11,759
-Angemon, no!

493
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,261
-Ha ha!

494
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:16,331
-Laser Luck!

495
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:17,999
Now, now.

496
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:20,134
Not everyone is lucky enough to
be captured by someone as

497
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:23,171
beautiful as me.

498
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:25,473
Come along.

499
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:26,975
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Tommy!

500
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,309
-Hey, you ugly tin can.

501
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:29,310
Come back here.

502
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,279
-Hm?

503
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:32,447
-Fret not, Dynasmon.

504
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,549
Allow me the pleasure of
handling these knaves.

505
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:40,521
Ah, the sweet smell of defeat,
even if you're

506
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:42,023
not worth the effort.

507
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:43,024
Scarlet Tempest!

508
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,895
So unsatisfying to
fight weaklings.

509
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:54,869
Now, let's finish this world.

510
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,404
-NARRATOR: And it looks
like they just might.

511
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,206
I mean, who can stop them?

512
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,874
Find out who will
win on the next

513
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:02,810
Digimon, Digital Monsters!
