00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,584
NARRATOR: Our were desperate to
save what remained of the

2
00:00:02,584 --> 00:00:03,953
digital world.

3
00:00:03,986 --> 00:00:05,955
The Autumn Leaf Fair was full of
all their old friends, and

4
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:08,624
a few foes, frantically trying
to get to safety.

5
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:11,060
When the royal knights showed
up, some of the fiercest mon

6
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:12,962
around tried to take
them on, but they

7
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:14,630
didn't stand a chance.

8
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:17,132
Takuya and Koji unity of all
for battle while the others

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,767
set up a catapult for backup.

10
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:21,270
Then everyone got hit hard
enough to knock the fractal

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,439
code out of them, all except
Kiochi that is.

12
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:24,940
Crusademon said it's
because he doesn't

13
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:26,609
have a physical form.

14
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:28,944
Anyway, the fair was scanned
and those nasty knights are

15
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,579
out to get the only area left.

16
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:31,613
THEME SONG: Digimon!

17
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:42,491
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

18
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:44,493
digital world.

19
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:49,498
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other we live by

20
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:57,806
the lessons we've learned as we
work towards one solution

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,277
through a spirit evolution.

22
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:03,679
I am the one--

23
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:04,413
huh!

24
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:05,280
I am the one--

25
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:06,615
Digimon!

26
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:09,251
Forever united as one--

27
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:10,653
Digimon!

28
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,188
Together the battles are won--

29
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:14,189
Digimon!

30
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:16,825
Through us let your
spirit evolve!

31
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,163
When we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

32
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:25,501
We're all for one world, there's
a world for us all.

33
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:27,169
I am the one, huh!

34
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:28,504
I am the one--

35
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:30,339
Digimon!

36
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,142
-I'm feeling a little woozy.

37
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:34,309
-Woozy, he says.

38
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,310
I feel downright ill.

39
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,912
Are we there yet?

40
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:38,247
-I wish.

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,716
At least there's no sign of the
royal knights anywhere.

42
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:41,550
-Good.

43
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,818
Maybe we lost them.

44
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:44,420
-My, aren't we just the
loopy optimist?

45
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:46,889
-No more loopy.

46
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:48,257
-Hey, check it out!

47
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,692
-No loopy?

48
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:52,361
-Ophanimon's Castle--

49
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:53,362
finally.

50
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:54,430
-But I was having fun.

51
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:58,100
-You're such a twit.

52
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,469
-Just one more minor
detail and you will

53
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,337
be revived my lord.

54
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:05,507
-I will be most displeased
if you fail me, Dynasmon!

55
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:09,011
I've grown weary of this prison
and long to fulfill my

56
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,079
destiny!

57
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:12,514
-As we long for the
day you are free.

58
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:16,085
We will succeed, my lord, even
if we must risk our own

59
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:17,886
existence to do your bidding.

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,388
-Don't be ridiculous!

61
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:22,191
Our lord is right to trite me,
but those humans are no match

62
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,859
for us!

63
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:26,395
-As you wish, my lord, when you
are revived you will give

64
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,430
us the key to the human
world, won't you?

65
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:31,700
-As you wish, my dear
Crusadermon, but

66
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:32,901
do you doubt me?

67
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,536
How very disappointing.

68
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,871
[evil laughter]

69
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,906
-You shall have what
you desire.

70
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,542
-Crusadermon, you are foolish
to ask questions when you

71
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,977
already know the answer.

72
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,812
Your doubt will make you weak.

73
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,151
-Wow!

74
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:50,285
It's sparkly!

75
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:55,424
-Let's hope it's not just
another pretty face.

76
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:56,458
-You're right.

77
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:57,493
It doesn't look like
much of a fortress.

78
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:59,628
-It's still here.

79
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:01,563
Well, that has to count
for something.

80
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:02,898
-Now that's logical.

81
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:04,900
They just haven't found
it yet, genius.

82
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,201
-But I--

83
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:07,903
I--
-I gotcha.

84
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:09,905
But it doesn't really
matter does it?

85
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:12,074
If they don't know where it
is, they will soon enough.

86
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:13,375
-Right again, my boy.

87
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:14,576
-Wow!

88
00:03:14,643 --> 00:03:15,577
You're starting to make
a habit of that!

89
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,551
-You, Koichi, have no physical
form-- terribly sorry.

90
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:26,054
[evil laughter]

91
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:27,156
-No, then--

92
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:28,457
I'm just--

93
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,958
-A spirit only.

94
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,129
-Koichi, what is it?

95
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:34,930
-Huh?

96
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:37,132
Nothing.

97
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:38,800
It's nothing, really.

98
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:51,313
[gasping]

99
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:52,481
-Wow!

100
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:53,549
-Check this out.

101
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:55,184
-Wow.

102
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,853
-I didn't even know there
were this many books.

103
00:03:57,853 --> 00:03:59,521
-Uh-huh.

104
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:02,291
-Amazing.

105
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,993
-The data just has to be
somewhere in this castle.

106
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:07,596
Don't you think?

107
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,799
-Well yeah, but where?

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,301
[gasping]

109
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,469
-You are the ones sworn
to protect the digital

110
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:15,771
world, are you not?

111
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:16,805
-We are them.

112
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:18,707
Uh-- da-- we-- w--
we are they.

113
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,374
Uh, whatever.

114
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:20,442
Yeah, that's us!

115
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:21,977
-At last.

116
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:22,611
[gasps]

117
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:23,979
-You seem surprised.

118
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,148
Your adventures are
no secret to me.

119
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:29,351
You hold the spirits of the
10 legendary warriors.

120
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,018
-But--

121
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,520
how'd you know?

122
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:35,490
-All knowledge of the digital
world resides here as soon as

123
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:36,558
it is known.

124
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:38,393
-So you're, like,
the librarian?

125
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:40,996
Then you must know the key
to protecting this place.

126
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:42,231
-I'm afraid I don't.

127
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:43,665
I am Nefertimon.

128
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,201
I protect this castle on the
orders of Lady Ophanimon.

129
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,703
-Wait, I don't get it!

130
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:49,538
If you're the protector of this
place, shouldn't you know

131
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,672
how to do it?

132
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:52,274
-Your friend is right.

133
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:54,376
I am like a librarian.

134
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:57,045
I protect this place, but that
doesn't mean I know everything

135
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:58,714
it contains.

136
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:01,350
That would be impossible.

137
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,618
-Of course it would be.

138
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:05,053
Nothing is ever that
simple around here.

139
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,622
-Come on, guys.

140
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:08,891
Nothing worth doing is ever
simple, at least no one is

141
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:10,058
shooting at us.

142
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,994
We're just going to have
to find it on our own.

143
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:14,029
And I don't know about you, but
I'd rather find it before

144
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:15,197
the royal Lonuses do.

145
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,865
-I can't argue with
that logic.

146
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:18,700
Let's split up into
groups of two.

147
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,736
-Right, that's what I was
was about to say.

148
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:22,905
-Bokomon, you guys keep a look
out for the royal knights.

149
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,206
-We'll keep our eyes peeled.

150
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:24,840
-Really?

151
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:26,708
That sounds painful.

152
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:27,943
-Okay.

153
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:30,379
We'll head upstairs,
right Koichi?

154
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:31,213
-Huh?

155
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:32,047
Mm.

156
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:33,181
Are you okay?

157
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,250
You're acting kind of weird.

158
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:36,351
-Am I?

159
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:39,688
Well then, maybe
I'm just weird.

160
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:41,189
-Hmm.

161
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,759
-So Z, shall we check the
inner rooms together?

162
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:46,128
-Uhm, but what about me?

163
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:48,230
-All right.

164
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:51,233
How about I check the basement
with Takuya while you help

165
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:53,435
J.P. check the inner
rooms, okay?

166
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:54,436
-Okay.

167
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:57,272
-Right, so let's get going.

168
00:05:57,272 --> 00:06:00,008
[moaning]

169
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:01,843
-Did I say something
wrong, J.P.?

170
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:04,012

00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:09,184
-How could anything be wrong?

[moaning]

174
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:24,797
-I don't know how we're
supposed to

175
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:25,832
find anything here.

176
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:28,768
Everything looks the same.

177
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:30,136
-Yeah.

178
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,271
-Koichi.

179
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:32,105
-Huh?

180
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,473
Yeah.

181
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:34,541
-Come on, bro.

182
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:35,775
What's wrong?

183
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:37,143
-I told you--

184
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,044
nothing.

185
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,213
-If you say so.

186
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:41,548
I guess you are just weird.

187
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:49,022
-Koji.

188
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,690
-Yeah?

189
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,025
-Uh, nothing.

190
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,027
Nevermind.

191
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,862
[snickers]

192
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:57,530
-Koichi.

193
00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:59,032
-What?

194
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:02,769
-I'm really glad I came to
this world, you know,

195
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:06,539
otherwise I might not
have met you.

196
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:09,042
Now we'll be able to see each
other all the time.

197
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:13,046
I mean, when we're back in
the human world and all.

198
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,013
-Yeah.

199

[snickers]

200
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:19,385
-Oh, man.

201
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:20,887
I don't even know
where to start.

202
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,523
-How about at the beginning?

203
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:28,695
[screams]

204
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,196
-Hey, what's wrong?

205
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:30,997
-Oh, nothing.

206
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,498
-I'm sorry about that, T-Boy.

207
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,366
-Hey, no problem.

208
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,701
-What?

209
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,402
Do you need to take a
break or something?

210
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:39,672
-No, we just got to find that
key, J.P. We just gotta!

211
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:42,809
What happens if the royal knights get her
before we find it?

212
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:44,043
-Ta-da!

00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:59,592
-Uhm.

217
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,327
Guess that didn't
help much, huh?

218
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,328
-What?

219
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,664
Well, you know, you look
kind of freaked.

220

[sighs]

221
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:06,699
-Thanks.

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:07,367
-Anytime partner.

223
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,534
Ha!
Ha!

224
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:09,369
Want to see another trick?

225
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:10,737
I can keep this up all night!

226
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:11,371
Ha!

227
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:12,171
-Hey, J.P.

228
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:12,872
-Uh, hmm?

229
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:13,873
-I'm scared.

230
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,541
What if we mess up?

231
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,378
If we can't stop him this whole
world will be destroyed

232
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:20,513
and with all of us
still in it.

233
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:21,447
I don't know.

234
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:24,083
I guess I'm still just
a scary cat.

235
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,520
-It takes a brave person to
admit he's scared to death.

236
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,922
-Are you scared?

237
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:31,090
-Are you kidding me?

238
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:32,258
[giggles]

239
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:36,429
-I am scared out of my chocolate
coated mind!

240
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:39,465
I haven't changed one bit,
but I'm still here.

241
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:40,767
-Yeah.

242
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,748

-It's like that game.

245
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,555
Uh, what's his name?

246
00:09:02,588 --> 00:09:04,090
Anyway, I always lose.

247
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:06,426
But it doesn't usually
hurt this much.

248
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:08,594
Do you think we have to
check every book?

249
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:09,762
-Yeah, probably.

250
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:12,265
As J.P. says, nothing's
ever easy.

251
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:13,599
-Are you tired?

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,802
-How'd you guess?

00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:17,070
-Gee, I don't know.

255
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:18,571
-You want to take a break?

256
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:21,941
-If I stop looking, I'll start
thinking and I really don't

257
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:22,608
want to do that right now.

258
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,277
[giggles]

259
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:26,446
-Yeah, we can't have you
thinking now can we?

260
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:29,182
-Well, Neemon thinks
I'm good at it.

261
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:30,683
-Yeah.

262
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:33,753
-You know, Zoe, this could
be our last battle.

263
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,488
We've fought well.

264
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:37,190
-It hasn't all been fighting.

265
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:39,492
It's the other things
that I'll remember.

266
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:42,328
Sure, it's way cool to be a
Digimon and kick butt and all,

267
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,630
but it wouldn't have been half
as much fun without you guys.

268
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,999
You're the first real friends
I've ever had.

269
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,969
I never even knew how to be a
friend and now I understand

270
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:52,372
myself a little better
and others too.

271
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:55,007
I don't think I'll ever have
trouble making friends again

272
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:57,844
and it's because I actually
like myself now.

273
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,047
-Well, I really like
you too, Zoe.

274
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,582
-Yeah.

275
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,418
-Like, you know,
not like, like.

276
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:06,419
Uh, oh, come on.

277
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:07,220
You know what I mean.

278
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,388
-Oh.
-Right?

279
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:09,722
-Right.

281
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,928
-I can't believe I said that.

282
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,230
-Uh.

283
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:23,903
Oh.
Takuya.

285
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:29,909
-Well, that figures.

00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:35,815
-Sleep tight.

288
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:39,952
-It's so quiet.

289
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:42,054
-Too quiet if you ask me.

290
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,590
Not that you did ask me, but.

291
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:47,260
Oh.

292
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,462
Please tell me you
found the key.

293
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:52,131
-I wish I could, but we
didn't find anything.

294
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,133
Just a whole lot of books.

295
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,668
-So anybody get lucky?

296
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,136
Nah.

297
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,471
-Nah, a long night with nothing
to show for it.

298
00:10:58,504 --> 00:10:59,305
-Except a mess.

299
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,240
Nefertimon's gonna be mad.

300
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,910
On second thought, I
doubt she'll care.

301
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:06,746
-There's still Takuya and Zoe.

302
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:07,613
Hmm.

303
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:08,981
-So how did it go?

304
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,616
Did you guys find anything?

305
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:14,220
-You know, I just hate it when
I get my hopes up like that.

306
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,756
-I know exactly how you feel.

307
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:17,623
-Come on, guys!

308
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,258
We can't give up!

309
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,127
Are you with me, everybody?

310
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,828
ALL: Yeah!

00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,330
[cheering]

00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:32,338
-Koichi, my dear boy, are
you worrying about what

313
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,307
Crusadermon said to
you yesterday?

[gasps]

00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,684
-Bokomon, promise me you
won't tell the others.

316
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:45,952
-I promise.

317
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:48,688
[cheering]

beautiful white flowers in

319

the dawn light.

320
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,637
Could there be a more
perfect way to

321
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:06,138
begin this day of destiny?

322
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:12,898
-Oh, no.

00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,134
-What is it?

-Children, the royal
knights are coming.

-You can say that again!

329
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,980
-I was certain you'd run away!

330
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,648
-Your courage is
appealing, even

331
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,684

00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:28,652
[gasps]

500
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:30,421
-You little brat!

501
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:31,755
-She's right!

502
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,090
You're nothing but a
spoiled little boy!

503
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,824
-Hmm.

504
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:34,758
-You baby!

505
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:35,659
Uh!

506
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:36,994
-Ha!

507
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:38,629
You're nothing but children
yourselves!

508
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:41,799
-Lord Lucemon, a moment.

509
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,333
Have you forgotten?

510
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:46,336
You promised to give us the key
to the human world if we

511
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,940
gave you the power to return
to this world.

512
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:52,643
-First, there are things
that must be done.

513
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:54,178
[moaning]

514
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:56,313
-I don't want to play with
you weaklings anymore.

515
00:19:56,313 --> 00:19:58,315
You're no fun.

516
00:19:58,315 --> 00:20:01,118
Goody good cry babies,
be gone.

517
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,386
Hmm.

518
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:12,362
[screaming]

519
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:14,732
ALL: Huh?

520
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:18,368
-Liebchen, grab onto me!

521
00:20:18,402 --> 00:20:19,403
-A handle!

522
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,076
-There we go.

523
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,245
It wasn't exactly what
I had in mind, but

524
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,379
they're out of the way.

525
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:30,714
Good enough.

526
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,385
-I'm flying you to the moon!

527
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:36,887
-You're what?

528
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,722
-You didn't want to stay with
that evil child now did you?

529
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:41,525
Besides, without you the digital
world really will be

530
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:42,059
gone forever.

531
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,961
It breaks my heart.

532
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,596
The world, you must
save the world!

533
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,097
Please, mein kinder.

534
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:48,966
Do that for me?

535
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,534
-Buddy, we'll do it
for everyone.

536
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:52,769
Take us to the moon and
we'll find a way.

537
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:53,604
We have to!

538
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:54,238
-Yeah.

539
00:20:54,271 --> 00:20:54,938
-Oh, dear.

540
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:56,240
I can't believe it.

541
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:59,243
They actually destroyed the
whole digital world!

542
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:02,579
You have got to keep watching
"Digimon Digital Monsters!"
