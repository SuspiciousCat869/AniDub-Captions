RIKA NARRATING: Just when they
thought they had beaten that

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,671
rat, Cherubimon, the guys
realized that the worst was

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,173
yet to come.

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,342
So Takuya and Koji unified the
spirits and evolved for the

5
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,843
final battle.

6
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,212
Unfortunately, Cherubimon had
been compressing all the data

7
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:15,215
he'd collected into a little
glowing orb that he shoved

8
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,884
into his forehead, making
him the most

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,218
powerful Digimon ever.

10
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,855
As EmperorGreymon and
MagnaGarurumon, along with the

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,524
spiritual support of the entire
Digi Gang, Taki and

12
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,427
Koji eventually vanquished
the vicious villain.

13
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,697
But they unleashed a whole new
horror in the process.

14
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,266
THEME SONG: Digimon!

[theme music]

16
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:41,241
THEME SONG: Look to the past as
we head for the future to

17
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:44,878
reclaim the Digital World.

18
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:48,916
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:54,121
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,758
As we work towards one solution

21
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,426
through a Spirit Evolution.

22
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,366
Digimon!

23
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,002
Forever united as one.

24
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,571
Digimon!

25
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,940
Together the battles are won.

26
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:13,941
Digimon!

27
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,576
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

28
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:21,114
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:27,888
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,922
Digimon!

31
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,097
-Huzzah!

32
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,099
Huzzah!

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,334
-Yeah!

34
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,336
-Now the Digital World can
be at peace once more.

35
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,471
-Feels like a dream.

36
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,807
Well, wake up, buddy,
because we did it.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,643
Cherubimon's gone, and the
Digital World is safe again.

38
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:50,978
-Yeah.

39
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,012
-That's strange.

40
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,515
-What is, Koji?

41
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,554
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): The land that
was lost should have come

42
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,556
back by now, but the
Digital World's

43
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,091
surface still looks damaged.

44
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,492
-What?

45
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,426
-Hey, you're right.

46
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,095
This doesn't make sense.

47
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,429
When the data was restored,
the land should have been

48
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,731
restored with it.

49
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,569
-I don't believe it.

50
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,403
-That doesn't look good.

51
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,971
-Oh, dear, what now?

52
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,609
-Those mountains just
disappeared.

53
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,314
-What's happening?

54
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,315
-The data was scanned!

55
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,183
-Could Cherubimon
still be alive?

56
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,318
-It can't be!

57
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,990
-Let's go see.

58
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:45,832
-Huh?

59
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,534
-Hey, Taki.
What is it?

60
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,804
-Did you see something?

61
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,405
-I'm not sure.

62
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,706
Let's keep moving.

63
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,375
The mountain-- huh?

64
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:59,246
[gasping]

65
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,148
-Who's there?

66
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,482
-I am Baromon.

67
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,652
I cannot allow you to pass.

68
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,987
-I see.

69
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,155
You're the one who scanned
that mountain.

70
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,662
-Great spirits of the
universe, hear me.

71
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,064
Give me your power!

72
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,203
-Execute!

73
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,237
Spirit Evolution!

74
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,212
-Agunimon!

75
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,718
-Beetlemon!

76
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,722
-Kazemon!

77
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,627
-Kumamon!

78
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,566
-Loweemon!

79
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,537
-Lobomon!

80
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,344
-Don't attack.

81
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,912
I have no intention
of fighting the

82
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:12,385
10 legendary warriors.

83
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,255
I know you are protectors of the
peace, but all of you must

84
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,357
hear what I have to say.

85
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,393
I have a prophecy.

86
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,964
It concerns the rebirth
of an ancient evil.

87
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,065
Lucemon.

88
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,449
-Takuya, speak to me!

89
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,418
-Is everybody all right?

90
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,486
-They look all right.

91
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,755
Thank goodness.

92
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,624
-So Lucemon's coming
back, huh?

93
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,626
-That's not good.

94
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,761
-You got it wrong, pal.

95
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,797
Lucemon was defeated
a long time ago.

96
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,365
-I will show you.

97
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,966
The truth is about to happen.

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,872
-OK.

99
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,140
-Look.

100
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:11,244
This is where the Holy Mountains
once proudly stood.

101
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:14,114
Now our great protectors have
fallen to the evil that

102
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,449
struggles to return.

103
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,251
Listen.

104
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,821
The Digital World is crying
out for your help.

105
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,205
Follow me.

106
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:36,241
-Follow you where?

107
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,543
-You see before you the Digital

108
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:41,079
World's Tunnel of History.

109
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:44,048
-Tunnel of History?

110
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,884
-Yes.

111
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:50,355
This place holds the entire
recorded history of our world.

112
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:52,390
-Whoa.

113
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,060
-At the start, our world began
from 10 spirits and 10

114
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,263
different types of data.

115
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:00,031
There are human and beast
type spirits.

116
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:00,732
-Yes, yes, yes.

117
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:03,168
That much we know.

118
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:06,171
-There is more.

119
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:09,574
The 10 ancient legendary spirits
banded together to

120
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:13,378
defeat Lucemon, and then sealed
him in the world of

121
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:14,879
nothingness, the Dark Area.

122
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:25,723
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): All
of us have heard this

123
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,058
history lesson before.

124
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:28,860
-Be quiet and listen.

125
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:31,529
Behold and learn.

126
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:35,066
Lucemon's demise led do this.

127
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,135
The warriors freed
the spirits.

128
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:40,238
All 10 were released
into our world.

129
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:42,941
The spirits needed to be
protected, so they were

130
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:45,443
entrusted to the three celestial
Digimon who had

131
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:46,778
chosen to rule.

132
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:53,284
Five were given over to
Cherubimon, two were placed in

133
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:56,988
the care of Seraphimon, and the
other three to Ophanimon.

134
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:02,393
And then the warriors fell to
sleep, and it was wonderful.

135
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:05,530
You see, the next period of time
was characterized by a

136
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:08,566
long and lasting peace that
existed throughout the entire

137
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,201
Digital World.

138
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:13,571
But Lucemon was waiting, biding
his time, knowing the

139
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:15,273
day would come when he
would be revived.

140
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:22,046
Waiting patiently
for his chance.

141
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:28,753
Then one day, an opportunity
arose.

142
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:34,292
He projected his aura into one
of the celestial Digimon.

143
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,328
Cherubimon was a
victim of evil.

144
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:41,466
His heart was drowned
in darkness.

145
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:45,637
After that, Lucemon used
Cherubimon to collect the

146
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:48,006
Digital World's data for him.

147
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,676
The result is the ravaged world
you see before you,

148
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:55,513
eaten away by the treachery
of Lucemon.

149
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:59,017
When you vanquished Cherubimon,
the massive amount

150
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:00,618
of data he gathered
was released,

151
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:02,453
and absorbed by Lucemon.

152
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:06,491
-Hey, wait.

153
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,826
So Cherubimon didn't really
know anything.

154
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:11,162
-It was Lucemon, but he acted
through Cherubimon.

155
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,101
-All of this brings
us to the present.

156
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:19,537
Bear witness to the deplorable
condition

157
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:20,605
of the Digital World.

158
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:27,845
-Who is that?

159
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,847
-They're sucking up
the Fractal Code.

160
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:31,182
-The mountains are
disappearing.

161
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,988
-All right, so tell
us, who are they?

162
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:39,390
-I don't know.

163
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:43,161
I'd say now that Cherubimon is
gone, these are the other

164
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:44,662
underlings that have been
sent to collect the

165
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:47,365
Digital World's data.

166
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,367
Now you understand what
is happening.

167
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:52,537
Lucemon will use any means
to achieve his goal.

168
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:55,106
If they succeed, Lucemon
will be revived!

169
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,712
That is my prophecy.

170
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:02,180
-You mean--

171
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,216
-The entire Digital World
will be destroyed.

172
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,718
-The end?

173
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,052
It can't be.

174
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,198
-We thank you, humans.

175
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:23,201
You tried valiantly to help,
but now you must return to

176
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:24,535
your world.

177
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:28,906
Go now, before it's too late.

178
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,575
-We are not leaving.

179
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:32,910
-What did you say?

180
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:35,780
-Ophanimon and Seraphimon helped
us battle to save the

181
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:37,882
Digital World, but now
it's up to us.

182
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:39,717
We haven't come this far
and given this much

183
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:40,752
to let it all go.

184
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:42,453
We will save this world.

185
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:45,056
-But how will you do it?

186
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:46,290
-Easy.

187
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:47,892
We all possess the power of
the spirits of the 10

188
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,427
Legendary Warriors.

189
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:51,729
-Lucemon will never have the
chance to destroy this world

190
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:53,765
while we're here.

191
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:54,666
-Impossible.

192
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:56,501
The prophecy is right.

193
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:58,436
Lucemon will be revived.

194
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,438
-If he is, we'll stop him.

195
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:02,640
-We may look like a bunch of
kids to you, but we can handle

196
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,141
this.

197
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:05,810
-Mm-hm.

198
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:08,813
-If we don't take care of this,
then who else will?

199
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:12,450
You think we're just humans,
but we're Digimon,

200
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:15,653
and proud of it.

201
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,489
-Your pride won't help here.

202
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:20,825
The prophecy will
come to pass.

203
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:30,001
-Them again.

204
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:30,568
-Hurry.

205
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:31,903
We must get outside.

206
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,644
[evil laughter]

207
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:50,478
-Hey!

208
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:51,379
Knock it off!

209
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:52,814
Just who are you two?

210
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:54,883
-I am Dynasmon, the passionate
warrior.

211
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,886
-And I am Crusadermon, the
indifferent warrior.

212
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:01,923
-We are here for Lord
Lucemon's justice.

213
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:04,292
-We have come to fulfill
Lucemon's destiny as his

214
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:07,028
emissaries of evil!

215
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:09,764
-We are supporters of his right
to become this world's

216
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:11,766
supreme ruler.

217
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,502
We serve Lord Lucemon by
collecting Fractal Code.

218
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:17,505
-And we are known to all
as the Royal Knights.

219
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:18,873
-The Royal Knights?

220
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:20,341
-Why?

221
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:23,011
Why would the Royal Knights, who
have always been known as

222
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:25,680
defenders of right, align
themselves with Lucemon?

223
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:28,349
-This world is disordered.

224
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,353
-And the only one who can
fix it is Lord Lucemon.

225
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,360
This is our task, and we
shall complete it!

226
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:40,028
-Stop!

227
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:41,062
Stop it now!

228
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,413
-Execute now!

229
00:11:58,413 --> 00:11:59,714
Fusion Evolution!

230
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:04,852
-Execute!

231
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:06,254
Spirit Evolution!

232
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,928
-Aldamon!

233
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:17,932
-BeoWolfmon!

234
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:24,038
-Beetlemon!

235
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:28,943
-Kazemon!

236
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:34,916
-Kumamon!

237
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:40,488
-Loweemon!

238
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:45,760
-So, i you.

239
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,462
-The humans have been
evolved into the

240
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:50,298
10 legendary warriors.

241
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,734
ALDAMON (OFFSCREEN): You can't
keep up your destructive ways.

242
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,468
BEOWOLFMON (OFFSCREEN):
The digital

243
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,136
world belongs to everyone.

244
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:56,638
KUMAMON (OFFSCREEN): You have
no right to wreck it.

245
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,172
KAZEMON (OFFSCREEN): Don't you
understand what will happen

246
00:12:58,206 --> 00:12:59,774
here if Lucemon is revived?

247
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,442
-For now, there is only chaos.

248
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,411
Lucemon will restore order.

249
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:05,713
-Putting things into their
natural order is necessary,

250
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:06,914
and beautiful.

251
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:09,417
-Lord Lucemon will
be the supreme

252
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,219
salvation for this world.

253
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,253
-Not quite.

254
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:19,927
-Crusadermon, proceed with the
data collection while I handle

255
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:20,995
these nuisances.

256
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:24,499
-Let's do it!

257
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:26,134
-Very nice.

258
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,303
But not effective.

259
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,939
-Thunder Fist!

260
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:33,975
-And now I will take my
leave of you so I

261
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:35,777
can gather more data.

262
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,979
I bid you adieu with
all my heart.

263
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:40,448
[screaming]

264
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:43,117
-Oh, no you don't.

265
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,852
Shadow Meteor!

266
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,788
-Blizzard Blaster!

267
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:49,323
-Hurricane Wave!

268
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:50,324
-Thunder Fist!

269
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:55,630
-I warn you, do not interfere!

270
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:02,136
DNA Disintegrator!

271
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:07,675
[screaming]

272
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:14,282
-Yes.

273
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:15,650
Strength is justice.

274
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:20,288
-Solar Wind Destroyer!

275
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,490
-Frozen Hunter!

276
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,058
-Ha ha ha!

277
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:27,128
You think to challenge me
with such weak attacks?

278
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:28,463
Dragon Thrower!

279
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:36,237
-Oh, dear.

280
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,705
Oh, dear.

281
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:40,208
Patamon, it's time for you
to come back home.

282
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,043
No need to wiggle, my boy.

283
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:42,910
It's for your own good.

284
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:46,714
-My good, too.

285
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:47,715
-Get away!

286
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:57,558
-The forest.

287
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,893
-Oh, no.

288
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,067
-Slide Evolution!

289
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,401
-JagerLoweemon!

290
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:08,536
-Zephyrmon!

291
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:09,737

00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:10,838

-Bolo Thunder!

297
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:24,218
-Please.

298
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:29,891
[laughter]

299
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:36,130
-Spiral Masquerade!

300
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,742
-Justice is beautiful.

301
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,318
-These two are tougher
than I thought.

302
00:15:57,385 --> 00:15:58,820
We've got to find a better
way of going at them.

303
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:02,190
-I feel like an egg.

304
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:03,391
An egg salad.

305
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:04,725
-I know.

306
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,060
Let's give our spirits
to Takuya and Koji.

307
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:14,202
-The wind into flame!

308
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:16,103
-The ice into flame!

309
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:19,106
-The thunder into light!

310
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,241
-The darkness into light.

311
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:36,424
-Uni-Execute!

312
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:37,792
Unified Spirit Evolution!

313
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:44,665
[shouting]

314
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:51,539
-EmperorGreymon!

315
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:52,840
-MagnaGarurumon!

316
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:58,012
-The spirits of the legendary
warriors.

317
00:16:58,012 --> 00:17:01,449
-Honestly, why you sound
surprised, I have no idea.

318
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:04,452
We did try to tell you more than
once, MagnaGarurumon and

319
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:06,587
EmperorGreymon are very tough.

320
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:08,923
They are the greatest champions
that defeated

321
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:09,924
Cherubimon.

322
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:12,860
-I see.

323
00:17:12,894 --> 00:17:14,996
-Oh, a new challenge.

324
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:17,498
This may require us
to get serious.

325
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:19,600
-Dominating our enemies
for Lucemon is

326
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:20,868
truly a thing of beauty.

327
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:26,173
-They'll lose.

328
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:27,875
I have predicted you cannot
beat the Royal Knights.

329
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,657
-You missed.

330
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,592
-Oh, did I?

331
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,993
Dragonfire Crossbow!

332
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:56,771
-Magna Missiles!

333
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:01,976
-He did it!

334
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:04,879
-How is this possible?

335
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:06,213
Hm?

336
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,049
[laughter]

337
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:09,383
-It can't be!

338
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:14,188
-Dragon Thrower!

339
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:15,489
-First of Athena!

340
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,660
-They're so fast!

341
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:20,695
-Unreal!

342
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:25,499
-Hello!

343
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,401
-I predicted this.

344
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:29,070
-You can do it, you two!
-Come on!

345
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,237
-Oh, man.

346
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,372
-I can't believe it.

347
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:32,406
-They got clobbered.

348
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:33,574
-They lost?

349
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:34,875
-No way.

350
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:35,743
-EmperorGreymon.

351
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:37,445
-And even MagnaGarurumon.

352
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:38,913
-But how?

353
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:42,717
-Great spirits of the universe,
give me power.

354
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,751
Meteor Dance!

355
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:49,890
-Hm?

356
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:51,392
Begone!

357
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:52,426
-Your ugliness is intolerable.

358
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:59,467
-What are we gonna do?

359
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,901
-Spirits, hear me.

360
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:03,404
Give me the power to protect
these brave humans!

361
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,256
-He saved us.

362
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:23,257
Everyone all right?

363
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:24,759
Oh!

364
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:26,427
Those brutes knocked the Fractal
Code out of them.

365
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:27,428
-But how?

366
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:28,129
-Yeah.

367
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:28,996
They're humans.

368
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,831
How come their data
is showing?

369
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:33,467
-Human data is exquisitely
beautiful.

370
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:35,803
I had no idea.

371
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:39,640
-So, we can turn even
humans to data.

372
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,675
-Allow me to scan it
right out of them.

373
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:42,810
-As you wish.

374
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:46,480
-No!

375
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,782
-Guys, wake up!

376
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:54,121
-Oh, not you again.

377
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:55,489
-It's not over yet!

378
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:57,324
You've got to go through us!

379
00:19:57,324 --> 00:19:59,660
-How brave and noble you are.

380
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,363
-I think we already
went through you.

381
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:03,731
-Dynasmon?

382
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:06,634
-Breath of Wyvern!

383
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:12,173
-No!

384
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:12,873
Dynasmon!

385
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:14,208
Stop!

386
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:35,930
[screaming]

387
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,931
CRUSADERMON (OFFSCREEN):
Dynasmon!

388
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,699
What are you doing?

389
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:42,136
Don't you realize, everything
will disappear?

390
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:45,106
Everything!

391
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:47,408
LUCEMON (OFFSCREEN): Hurry,
my Royal Knights.

392
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:48,976
The data.

393
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,245
Bring me the data.

394
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:52,279
All of it.

395
00:20:52,313 --> 00:20:54,582
Now.

396
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:56,450
NARRATOR: Man, our heroes'
fate is pretty

397
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:58,119
much up in the air.

398
00:20:58,152 --> 00:20:59,954
Find out where they'll
land on the next

399
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,556
Digimon, Digital Monsters.
