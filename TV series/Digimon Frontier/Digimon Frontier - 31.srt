NARRATOR: As the battle between
Duskmon and BeoWolfmon

2
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:05,377
raged on, Patamon was
doing his best to

3
00:00:05,377 --> 00:00:06,978
lead the gang to Koji.

4
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:10,182
But Cherubimon trapped them
in this spiky dome thing.

5
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:13,552
Then Cherubimon took advantage
of Koichi's amnesia and gave

6
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:15,253
Duskmon his Beast Spirit.

7
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:18,256
When Duskmon Beast Spirit
Evolved to Velgemon, he forgot

8
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:21,226
what little he still knew and
tried to destroy Koji!

9
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:23,361
Thank goodness Ophanimon
intervened in

10
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:24,763
time to stop him.

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,399
Now Koichi remembers that Koji
is his brother, but both of

12
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,567
them are still clueless.

13
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:30,802
Boy, what a mess.

14
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:32,404
THEME SONG: Digimon!

15
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:37,442
[theme music]

16
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:41,113
THEME SONG: Look to the past as
we head for the future to

17
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:44,983
reclaim the Digital World.

18
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:48,954
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:51,123
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:58,296
As we work towards one solution

21
00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:00,298
through a Spirit Evolution.

22
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:07,272
Digimon!

23
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:09,608
Forever united as one.

24
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:10,842
Digimon!

25
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,211
Together the battles are won.

26
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:14,179
Digimon!

27
00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:17,482
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

28
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:21,353
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:25,390
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,861
Digimon!

31
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:34,032
How can this be?

32
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:36,201
A human brother?

33
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:39,271
If it's true,
then who am I?

34
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:42,574
I need some time
to think about this.

35
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:49,447
Duskmon! Who are you?

36
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:50,749
Koji

37
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:51,616
Huh

38
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:56,087
-Are you OK?

39
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:57,455
-Yeah.

40
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:58,924
-That's good news.

41
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,926
-Yeah, we all heard that huge
explosion and thought that

42
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:02,260
maybe you were in it.

43
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:03,428
-Well, I kinda was.

44
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:04,429
-You were?

45
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:06,431
What do you mean?

46
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:07,432
-It was Velgemon.

47
00:02:07,432 --> 00:02:09,234
He used Cherubimon's
power to evolve

48
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,835
from Duskmon and attack.

49
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,938
-Man, I'm sick of that guy.

50
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:14,639
-My boy, there aren't many who
can stand up to Velgemon and

51
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:16,641
still walk away.

52
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:17,642
I'm flabbergasted.

53
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:18,810
-Gazundheit.

54
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:21,012
-Yeah, I guess.

55
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,181
(THINKING) It was really
more Ophanimon than me.

56
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:26,151
If it weren't for her, I'd
have been finished.

57
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:28,520
-Well, hello there.

58
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:29,521
-And who are you?

59
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:31,122
-I'm Patamon.

60
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:33,491
-He hatched out of Seraphimon's
Digi-Egg.

61
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:36,962
-So, really, it's because of him
that you're able to fusion

62
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:38,663
evolve to BeoWolfmon

63
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:40,398
-So that's what it was.

64
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:41,666
Thanks little guy.

65
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,802
-Haha, it's my pleasure.

66
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:46,171
-I can't believe I can finally
say this, but now that Koji's

67
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:48,573
here, we can head to the
Rose Morning Star.

68
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:49,641
-Yeah!

69
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,142
So let's get it in gear, guys.

70
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,979
-Hey, I've been ready
this entire time.

71
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:56,548
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
ready to eat.

72
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,050
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN): Soon it
will all be clear to you.

73
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:00,885
This mystery will be resolved.

74
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:02,887
-(THINKING) Clear to me?

75
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:06,391
What did she mean?

76
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:07,392
Of course.

77
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,894
Duskmon.

78
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,063
He must have answers for me.

79
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:13,898
-Hey, where are you going?

80
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:15,734
Koji, come back!

81
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,370
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Wow, you
sure know how to make him run.

82
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:21,439
-Man, we're never going to get
to the Rose Morning Star now.

83
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:23,775
-Well, maybe he thinks we're
all supposed to race each

84
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:25,043
other there.

85
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,611
-He was thinking hard
about something.

86
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:29,814
-Yeah, probably planning
his escape from us.

87
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:31,616
-When will he learn that he
can't solve his problems all

88
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,585
by himself?

89
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:35,754
I'm gonna go get him.

90
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,489
Why are you looking
at me like that?

91
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:38,657
Just wait here.

92
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:40,125
I'll be back before
you know it.

93
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:41,626
-You can't leave too.

94
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:43,128
-Yeah, it's just like
a scary movie.

95
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:45,096
-It's like a what?

96
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,465
-Never forget the horror
movie rule.

97
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:50,535
-The Boogieman strikes when no
one can hear you scream.

98
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:53,271
That's what happens every time
someone goes off on their own.

99
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:55,106
You break the rule
and you're toast.

100
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:56,608
ALL: Ugh.

101
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,276
-Does it look like
I'm laughing.

102
00:03:58,343 --> 00:03:58,843
-Why would you?

103
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:00,512
I'm being serious.

104
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:03,715
-Yeah, well I'll take my chances
with the Boogieman.

105
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:05,517
-Fine, go.

106
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,851
-Come on, guys.

107
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,653
Let's not fight over nothing.

108
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:09,654
-Zoe's right.

109
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:11,690
There's no need to
get all riled up.

110
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,491
You guys wait here, and I'll
just go get him and

111
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:16,027
be back in a jiffy.

112
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:19,764
-It better not be
a long jiffy.

113
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,333
-I guess that's that.

114
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,702
Well, why don't we just go
ahead and make dinner?

115
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:24,869
-Let's eat, yeah!

116
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:26,271
-Z, you can't be serious.

117
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,273
-Huh?

118
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:30,075
-Listen, I'm going to hang
around here just because

119
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,743
Takuya says we should.

120
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:32,911
No siree.

121
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:34,612
-Oh boy.

122
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:35,513
-We can't leave.

123
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,915
He told us to stay here.

124
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:39,451
-If Takuya told you to shave
your head and run around in

125
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:42,787
circles, would you do it?

126
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,456
Besides, remember these?

127
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,458
We can take care of ourselves
if there's trouble.

128
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:49,594
-But we can't just take off
and leave Koji and Takuya.

129
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:51,262
-Well, duh, Zoe.

130
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:53,498
I never said we should go to
the Rose Morning Star by

131
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:55,567
ourselves or anything like that,
but we don't have to sit

132
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,935
here doing nothing.

133
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:58,737
-So, what do you want to do?

134
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,839
-A scouting mission!

135
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:02,640
-ALL: A scouting mission?

136
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,142
-To get information.

137
00:05:04,142 --> 00:05:06,745
Don't you wonder what the
Rose Morning Star is?

138
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:09,280
We should know what to expect
when we get there.

139
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:11,616
I'll bet that if we look, there
are some Digimon around

140
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:12,817
here who know something
about it.

141
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:14,319
-Are you completely mad?

142
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:15,653
I'm beginning to think
that all of

143
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:17,989
you want to be destroyed.

144
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:19,195
-I think this is
what I'm here.

145
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:19,691
-Hm?

146
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,026
-Seriously.

147
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:23,128
I've been thinking that each
one of us has a certain

148
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:24,162
purpose in this world.

149
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:25,830
Maybe that's true
of any world.

150
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,999
But I've never been able
to figure mine out.

151
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:30,168
-I think he has a point.

152
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:32,504
-I really hated it at first
when everyone but me found

153
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:34,739
their spirits right away and
were able to evolve.

154
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:36,908
It was like being held back
a year in school.

155
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:38,543
I felt useless, you know?

156
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:41,413
Like I was only here with
you guys by mistake.

157
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,014
-Oh J.P..

158
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:45,350
-And then when Koji and Takuya
got this new kind of

159
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:46,918
evolution, I was
happy for them.

160
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,553
I really was.

161
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:50,255
But at the same time, I couldn't
help wondering why it

162
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:53,391
couldn't have been
me who got it.

163
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:55,560
But, after a while, I realized,
maybe there are

164
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:58,430
things that only those guys can
do, which means there are

165
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:00,465
things that only I can do.

166
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:02,233
I think that this
is one of them.

167
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,067
-Hold on.

168
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:04,202
-What's wrong now?

169
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:05,737
-You're not going without me.

170
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:07,806
-Tommy, I don't know.

171
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,140
-Young man, what are
you talking about?

172
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:10,809
I thought you were
on my side here.

173
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:12,110
-No, you're not going!

174
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,445
-All right.

175
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:14,946
-But Zoe.

176
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:16,948
-You're not going anywhere
unless you take me with you.

177
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:22,654
-Oh beans.

178
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:25,123
-Well, we better get going if
we want to get back before

179
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:26,825
Koji and Takuya do.

180
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:27,826
-Mm-hm.

181
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:30,295
-Come back, you nincompoops!

182
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:31,463
-We'll be back soon!

183
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:36,634
-Maybe we smell.

184
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:40,872
-But I'm new.

185
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:49,593
-Jeez, how can we tell if the
Digimon around here know

186
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:50,895
anything if there aren't
actually any

187
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:52,263
Digimon around here?

188
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,102
-Guys, check it out.

189
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:00,804
What are those?

190
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:02,473
-They look like train tracks.

191
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:03,741
-Well, they must
lead somewhere.

192
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,284
I guess I was wrong.

193
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:14,818
They lead nowhere.

194
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:17,421
-Nowhere's too good of a
word for this place.

195
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:18,856
-Hey guys!

196
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,190
Look.

197
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:22,359
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): Well, it
does look like something.

198
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:24,662
-Yeah, but what is it?

199
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:25,496
-It's better than nothing.

200
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,497
Yeah.

201
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,364
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): Let's
check it out.

202
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:36,974
Man, even this is just a
whole lot of nothing.

203
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:38,709
But I guess we ought
to poke around.

204
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:45,482
-What is this weird
place anyway?

205
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:49,086
-Gives me the creeps, like
a haunted house.

206
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:49,720
-Don't be silly.

207
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,322
It's just a junkyard.

208
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,891
[creaking]

209
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:54,992
-Ah!

210
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,593
Now you can't tell me
that was nothing.

211
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:58,862
-No way, I heard
it too, Tommy.

212
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,931
-Calm down, would you?

213
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:03,200
Look, I'll prove that there's
nothing here but rusty metal.

214
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:10,708
GERMAN ACCENTED VOICE:
Ach, [german].

215
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,248
Who disturbs mein sleeping?

216
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:18,882
-Mommy!

217
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,217
Mommy!

218
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,219
-Ah!

219
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:23,454
-Trespassers be gone.

220
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,956
Leave me in peace, or else!

221
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,463
-OK, I'm out of here!

222
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:34,098
-No.

223
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:34,999
No, Tommy.

224
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:36,967
Remember what we've
always said.

225
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,136
Whenever there's trouble, we
have to stick together.

226
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,637
-Why?

227
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:43,307
So all of us can be destroyed
in one easy swipe?

228
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,009
-You [german].

229
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:49,446
Stomping and banging just when
I was about to fall asleep.

230
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,648
What, nothing to say?

231
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:52,116
-Huh?

232
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,118
-Hmph.

233
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:55,719
-Wait, it's just a Trailmon.

234
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:58,122
-It's not a ghost that's
gonna get us.

235
00:08:58,188 --> 00:08:59,523
-Hey, watch it.

236
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,725
I'm not just a Trailmon, and
I'm not a ghost yet either,

237
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,193
you rude little creatures.

238
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:05,362
I'm an burly Trailmon.

239
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:08,365
I'm an angler, thank
you very much.

240
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:09,900
-Burly, huh?

241
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,002
-Yeah, that's not the first
word I would have picked.

242
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:13,003
-Ach nein!

243
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:16,173
You are the rudest creatures.

244
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:20,044
I would teach you some manners
if I had any strength left.

245
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:26,550
But I'm as weak as a baby, and
I'm here all alone in this

246
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:29,086
Trailmon graveyard.

247
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,087
A Trailmon graveyard?

248
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,088
-Scary.

249
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:32,423
-Nein.

250
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:35,259
It's simply the place where the
Trailmon come when they

251
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,928
reach the end of the line and
lack the strength to perform

252
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:38,629
their duties.

253
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,563
It's not scary.

254
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:42,099
At least not to a real man.

255
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:48,072
But I suppose it is
a smidgen sad.

256
00:09:48,105 --> 00:09:51,408
-Gee, can't you just get
repaired or something?

257
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:52,943
-Can we help you?

258
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,079
-Well, a good start would've
been to not wake me up in the

259
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:56,113
first place.

260
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,849
Mein Gott, I'm tired.

261
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:00,918
-Wait.

262
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:04,588
Um, I was wondering if I could,
um, ask you a question.

263
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,990
-This isn't the best time.

264
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,660
-I know, but there's no one
else around here to ask.

265
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,696
-I can hear you just
fine, you know.

266
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:13,831
-Oh.

267
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,833
-I just have a little
question for you.

268
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,036
-Then ask and leave me to my
dreams of Wienerschnitzel.

269
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,171
Even when you're trying to
be nice, you're rude.

270
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:24,341
-But aren't you being rude not
in response to our rudeness?

271
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,510
-Tommy, will you be quiet?

272
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,311
-Yeah.

273
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:28,512
Yeah, that's true.

274
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:29,980
You have moxie, little one.

275
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,348
Now, what did you want to ask?

276
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:33,484
-You see, we were wondering
if you could give us any

277
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:35,719
information about the
Rose Morning Star.

278
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,722
-Th-th-th-the Rose
Morning Star?

279
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:39,990
Why?

280
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,892
You're not thinking about
going there, are you?

281
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,193
-Yeah, we have to.

282
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:43,894
-Why?

283
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:44,762
Is it dangerous?

284
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:47,030
-You do know something,
don't you?

285
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,532
-I--

286
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,267
Lederhosen.

287
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,101
-Please.

288
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:52,369
You have to tell us.

289
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,204
The future of the digital
world depends on it.

290
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,038
[coughing]

291
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,240
-No.

292
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,662
You have to tell us.

293
00:10:57,662 --> 00:10:58,507
Please! Please!

294
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:02,193
-I think that it may
be too late, J.P.

295
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:08,977
[coughing]
-I do--

296
00:11:08,977 --> 00:11:12,558
[coughing]
--know something.

297
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:16,095
But first, can you do one
tiny favor for me?

298
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:17,096
-(GERMAN ACCENT)
Anything.

299
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,731
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
I mean, anything.

300
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:19,698
-Could you help me--

301
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:20,599
[coughing]

302
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:21,934
--stand up?

303
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,769
-Huh?

304
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:25,737
-But how are we supposed
to help a big thing

305
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:28,207
like you stand up?

306
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,241
-This one's mine.

307
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:41,286
Execute!

308
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:42,621
Spirit Evolution!

309
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:02,808
Beetlemon.

310
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:12,151
Man, am I good, or what?

311
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:14,553
Now, the Rose Morning Star.

312
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:16,288
-I didn't realize you
could evolve.

313
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:17,022
-Sure can.

314
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:18,190
-You bet.

315
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,858
And so can the two of us.

316
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:21,627
-Most interesting.

317
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:23,228
[coughing]

318
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:24,830
-You OK, train guy?

319
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:27,166
-You know, there is one
thing I'd like to do

320
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:28,834
before my time is up.

321
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:31,703
-I thought we already did
one thing for him.

322
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:32,538
A bath?

323
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:34,206
-Yeah.

324
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:37,376
I'd love to feel all squeaky and
clean just one last time.

325
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:40,012
-Well, OK, but how are we
supposed to do that?

326
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:41,346
-Yeah.

327
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,048
There aren't any brushes or
water around here anywhere.

328
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:44,216
-Relax, fun boys.

329
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:47,452
There's a lake nearby and
brushes inside me.

330
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,755
-And then you'll tell us about
the Rose Morning Star.

331
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:53,525
-This Rose Morning Star
you speak of--

332
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:55,027
-Remember?

333
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,428
-Oh, yeah, sorry.

334
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:59,932
I'm afraid my memory isn't
what it used to be.

335
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:01,133
[coughing]

336
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,935
-Aw.

337
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:06,305
-I should let you know that if
you three don't hurry up and

338
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,974
wash me, what I was going to
tell you about the Rose

339
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,944
Morning Star might just pop
out of my head entirely.

340
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:12,477
-Fine.

341
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:14,279
We'll get washing.

342
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,347
Thunder Fist!

343
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:24,156
OK.

344
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:25,257
-Hurricane Wing!

345
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,129
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): Kumamon.

346
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,164
-Crystal Freeze!

347
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:46,178
-Great.

348
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:48,480
Just had to be cold water.

349
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:50,415
So, of course that means--

350
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:51,350
TRAILMON (OFFSCREEN): Ah!

351
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,353
You trying to clean
me or freeze me?

352
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:55,721
-It's not that bad.

353
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:57,556
-We're being nice enough
to wash you.

354
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:59,157
Don't complain.

355
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:01,059
-Little to the left.

356
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:02,394
Oh, wunderbar.

357
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:04,363
Yeah, that's good.

358
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:05,897
Oh yeah.

359
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:06,932
-Hurricane Wing!

360
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:12,571
-You know, I, for one, wouldn't
be too upset if you

361
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:15,073
accidentally grazed him
with that attack.

362
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:16,408
-Please, don't tempt me.

363
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:21,880
-Ah, squeaky clean
and scrubbed.

364
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:23,048
-Like a whole new Trailmon.

365
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,050
-You're all shiny now.

366
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,418
-Yep, you're all clean.

367
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:29,121
So maybe now you can tell us
what we want to know, right?

368
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:31,056
-Hm, I can't quite remember.

369
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:33,992
Maybe one little favor
would jog my memory.

370
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:36,128
-Ugh, give me a break!

371
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:39,131
-Well, my memory isn't what
it used to be, I'm afraid.

372
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:40,299
Oh, I'm sorry.

373
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:41,500
Did I already say that?

374
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:42,968
-Forget it, guys.

375
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,269
Come on.

376
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:47,272
He's not gonna help us.

377
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:50,642
-Yeah, we should probably
get going.

378
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,511
-I bet he just wants
to be alone.

379
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:54,112
[whimpering]

380
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:56,315
-But I'm so tired.

381
00:14:56,381 --> 00:15:00,118
[coughing]

382
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:01,119
-Wait!

383
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:02,158
My wheels.

384
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:02,757
They're--

385
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:04,022
They're rusty.

386
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:07,726
And I- Oh, you're not buying
this at all, are you?

387
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,727
-I cannot believe it.

388
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,163
You were faking this
whole time.

389
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:12,230
Weren't you?

390
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:13,899
-No.

391
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:16,535
Maybe I don't feel quite as bad
as I let on, but you were

392
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:19,671
so nice to me I just didn't
want it to end.

393
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:22,507
When you're a Trailmon, everyone
likes to ride on you,

394
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,344
but no one ever treats you
like you really are.

395
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:29,114
A living creature
with feelings.

396
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:32,551
You were the first people who
were ever nice to me.

397
00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:34,286
But you can go if you want to.

398
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,253
I understand.

399
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:37,756
[crying]

400
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:38,357
-Nein.

401
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:40,792
Leave me alone to die.

402
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:44,429
I'm just glad I got the chance
to meet someone nice before I

403
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:47,099
go into the final beyond.

404
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:49,101
-OK, enough.

405
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:50,402
We'll do it.

406
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:53,805
We'd be More than happy to
do whatever you want.

407
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:57,976
-Oh, I'd leap for joy
if only I had feet.

408
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:58,944
-Thunder Fist!

409
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,779
-Oh, that's great.

410
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:02,848
That dent's been bugging
me for years.

411
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:05,851
A little gentler would
be nice, though.

412
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:08,987
-Hey, how would you like
to try some chocolate?

413
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,654
Ah.

414
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:12,190
-Ah.

415
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:13,692
Mm.

416
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:15,193
-So, how does it taste?

417
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:18,296
-Like sweet, milky kindness.

418
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,364
That tickles.

419
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:20,365
-Hey mister.

420
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,633
Quit moving around.

421
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:27,472
-This, I could do without.

422
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:30,008
Yeah, very funny.

423
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:41,920
[snoring]

424
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:44,089
-Well, I guess this
is goodbye.

425
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:47,092
-Even though we got upset,
we had a good time.

426
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,093
-Mm-hm.

427
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:49,327
-Me too.

428
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:50,262
By the way.

429
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,564
About the Rose Morning Star--

430
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:54,232
-Please, don't worry about it.

431
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:56,768
-Yeah, we're not upset with
you for lying about it.

432
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:57,736
-Yeah, right.

433
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:59,871
Don't beat yourself
up about it.

434
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:05,077
-Well, thank you, but I wasn't
lying about having been there.

435
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:06,111
-Huh?

436
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:07,245
-Are you serious?

437
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:08,480
You were there?

438
00:17:08,513 --> 00:17:09,881
-I wouldn't lie about it.

439
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:11,249
-So, spill the beans already.

440
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:12,651
-OK, then listen.

441
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:19,124
[coughing]

442
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:23,962
-What are you doing, pretending
to be sick again?

443
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:26,298
-I don't think he's
faking this time.

444
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,300
-Maybe he's dying.

445
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,302
[coughing]

446
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:31,636
-This is horrible.

447
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,175
-Hold on.

448
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:38,810
-Angler.

449
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:43,148
-I think that my time
has come at last.

450
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:46,485
-Why do we keep losing friends
just when we make them?

451
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:57,695
-Nein.

452
00:17:57,695 --> 00:17:58,195
Nein.

453
00:17:58,429 --> 00:17:59,830
Don't cry.

454
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:02,833
I've had a good life
while it lasted.

455
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:06,737
I'm just sad that I couldn't
help you after all.

456
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:08,072
-Angler, no.

457
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:09,707
-It's not fair.

458
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:25,689
-Huh?

459
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:31,762
-I don't believe it.

460
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,097
-Did that really happen?

461
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,936
-All that, and he's
still alive?

462
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:41,939
-Yeah, well, I guess things
weren't quite as bad as they

463
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:42,740
seemed, hm.

464
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:44,608
In fact, they're wunderbar.

465
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:45,442
Wunderbar.

466
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:46,243
Wunderbar!

467
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:47,611
[whistle blowing]

468
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:49,179
-Yay, I'm young again.

469
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,583
Free to ride the rails and
eat pound after pound of

470
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:54,985
sauerkraut.

471
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:56,820
Uh, heh.

472
00:18:56,854 --> 00:19:00,324
Can't we talk about this,
my little dumplings?

473
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:01,825
-Time for talking's done.

474
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:02,860
-Hm.

475
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,294
-Hm.

476
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:05,863
-Execute!

477
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,297
Beast Spirit Evolution!

478
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:19,643
-MetalKabuterimon.

479
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:25,015
-Zephyrmon!

480
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,554
-Korikakumon!

481
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,923
-I liked you better
all dented up.

482
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:34,491
Now, what can we
do about that?

483
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:35,726
-I have an idea.

484
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,595
Angler's not gonna like
it, but we will.

485
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:40,197
-Haha ha ha.

486
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,598
You really have to learn not
to lie to your friends.

487
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:45,569
-Well, I have to go.

488
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,905
-Not so fast.

489
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:48,539
-Um.

490
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:49,540
I--

491
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:52,076
Oh, I deserve it.

492
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,579
-Jeez, this guy's too pathetic
to beat up on.

493
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:57,247
TRAILMON (OFFSCREEN): Thanks
for forgiving me.

494
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:59,082
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): Just
don't lie anymore.

495
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:01,251
-So, were you really at
the Rose Morning Star?

496
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:02,286
-Without a doubt.

497
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,321
When I was still old,
I was forced to

498
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:05,556
carry a container there.

499
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,624
Forced by Cherubimon.

500
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,326
-By Cherubimon?

501
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,296
-Well, his henchmen, so that's
not really a lie.

502
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:15,499
I was afraid of what they might
do to me-- well, not so

503
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,768
much the cute one-- so I
didn't ask questions.

504
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,637
But the battle between the three
celestial Digimon had

505
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:23,974
just happened, and the way those
henchmen were guarding

506
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,943
the container, I'm sure
it had either

507
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,478
Seraphimon or Ophanimon.

508
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:31,815
Ah, it's shameful that I was
ever a part of that debacle.

509
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,217
-Hey, blame Cherubimon.

510
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,686
-So, if Seraphimon's
now Patamon--

511
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:37,855
-Then it must've been Ophanimon
who was inside of

512
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,022
that container.

513
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:40,557
-I remember there's
a castle there.

514
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:41,125
-Huh?

515
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:41,692
-What?

516
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:42,559
-A castle.

517
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:44,661
That's where they took me.

518
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,230
-That's where they're
keeping Ophanimon.

519
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:47,164
-Oh.

520
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:49,533
-Imprisoned.

521
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,401
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): We're getting
close now, guys.

522
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:55,305
NARRATOR: Yeah, but getting
close to something good or something bad?

523
00:20:55,305 --> 00:20:57,040
Gee, I wonder.

524
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:58,862
But there's only way
to find out.

525
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:02,219
Tune in to the next Digimon,
Digital Monsters.
