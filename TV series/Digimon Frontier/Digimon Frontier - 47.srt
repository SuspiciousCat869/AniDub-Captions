00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:01,617
BOKOMON (NARRATING):
We finally made it

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,918
to Ophanimon's castle.

3
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:06,088
There we met Nefertimon, the
protector of the palace.

4
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:08,424
Too bad she didn't know where
the key to protecting it was.

5
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:10,793
After a night of fruitless
searching, the unified kids

6
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:13,128
were forced to face those
rotten royals.

7
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:15,097
It turns out Nefertimon
was the key.

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,267
Oh, they tried their best, but
the Royal Knights were just

9
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,602
too much for them, and they
succeeded in scanning the

10
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:22,604
castle and reviving Lucemon.

11
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:25,607
That spoiled little brat tried
to destroy us, but thanks to

12
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:28,077
Angler, we're on our
way to the moon.

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,446
I only hope there's still
time to save our world.

14
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:32,081
THEME SONG: Digimon!

15
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:36,085
[theme music]

16
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:40,422
THEME SONG: We look to the past
as we head for the future

17
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,660
to reclaim the Digital World.

18
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:49,031
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:54,036
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:58,007
As we work towards one solution

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,343
through a Spirit Evolution.

22
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:03,345
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

23
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:04,346
Huh!

24
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,280
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

25
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:06,615
Digimon!

26
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:09,651
Forever united as one.

27
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:10,653
Digimon!

28
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:13,322
Together the battles are won.

29
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,256
Digimon!

30
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:16,859
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

31
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:20,863
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

32
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:25,667
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

33
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,668
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

34
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:27,669
Huh!

35
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:28,671
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

36
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,972
Digimon!

37
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:34,476
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): The third
moon that orbits the Digital

38
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,013
World is usually covered with
yellow colored sand, giving

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,084
its surface an atmosphere of
warm, golden appearance Hm.

40
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:47,222
-Yeah, this place
is a bella luna.

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,561
-Ditto me on that,
Z. It's kind of

42
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:53,695
like a slice of heaven.

43
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,897
-Knock it off, JP.

44
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,066
We're not anywhere near
heaven just yet.

45
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:57,733
-Huh?

46
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,401
I just meant it's nice.

47
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,369
-Mm-hm.

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,810
-No.
Then I'm just--

49
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:09,478
-A spirit only.

50
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:17,653
-The Digiworld's had it.

51
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,722
It looks in really bad shape.

52
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,524
-It got wiped out.

53
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:24,059
-Guess it's really over.

54
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:26,695
-No No, it's not.

55
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:28,063
-How can you say that, Takuya?

56
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:29,098
-Because I know better.

57
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:30,532
There just has to be a
way for us to turn

58
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,900
this whole world around.

59
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,268
We can't give up.

60
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:36,438
Winners never quit, and if
we quit, we'll never win.

61
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,907
-But Takuya, the world we did
our best to protect doesn't

62
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:40,409
even exist.

63
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,544
-It's not that we're quitting,
but there's nothing for us to

64
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,379
do here, and no way
left to do it.

65
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:45,414
-Hello.

66
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,449
Have you forgotten that
we're all Digimon?

67
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:49,284
-That's the spirit.

68
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:50,285
-Yeah.

69
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:00,062
-Come on!

70
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:03,398
[beeping]

71
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:04,733
Am I wrong to believe in us?

72
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,148
-Now, what is it?

73
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,883
-My lord, when can
we have the key?

74
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,484
-Possessing the key
to the human

75
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,219
world would be beauteous.

76
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:25,821
-I have heard enough.

77
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:27,456
-I humbly beseech
you, noble one.

78
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:29,158
Allow me to explain.

79
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:31,793
When you first engaged us in
your quest, you promised us

80
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:33,295
that we would ruler Earth.

81
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:36,165
But without the key, we cannot
enter it and begin our reign.

82
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:39,101
You swore that if we destroyed
the Digital World and revived

83
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:40,836
you, the key would be ours.

84
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:42,304
-I don't need you
to remind me.

85
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:43,639
I know what I said.

86
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:44,773
-Yes, but perhaps--

87
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,041
-Lord Lucemon.

88
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:52,481
-I plan on keeping my promise
you, but first I

89
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,350
must destroy them.

90
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:57,119
Now get to that moon
and do your job.

91
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,159
-But when 'tis done, you
will give us the key?

92
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:07,095
-How can you doubt my
word, Crusadermon?

93
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,831
If I didn't have the key, and if
I wasn't going to give you,

94
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:12,134
I would have already said so.

95
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:17,339
Such lack of trust will surely
poison my faith in you.

96
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,775
-How can you doubt our
master's intentions?

97
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:21,476
-I don't--

98
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,879
-Your beliefs bend with each
wind, but I will not be frozen

99
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:25,614
by your fears.

100
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:29,017
We must obey Lord Lucemon
unequivocally.

101
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,953
We fear nothing in serving
you, my lord.

102
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,723
Nothing but our own failure.

103
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:37,559
-Please forgive give
me my doubts, sire.

104
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:40,529
-Now that you are of one
mind, destroy them.

105
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:43,031
-We will.

106
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,234
-What are those floating
things?

107
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,536
-Huh?

108
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:48,670
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Whoa.

109
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,340
Looks like someone's taking
a bubble bath.

110
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:52,207
-Oh, goodie!

111
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:53,609
Bathtime!

112
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:54,676
-Papamon says come back!

113
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:02,351
-Wow, check it out.

114
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:09,191
[playful chirping]

115
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:11,193
-The Digi-Eggs.

116
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:11,660
-Magnifico.

117
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:12,861
They're back.

118
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,193
They're so cute.

119
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,194
-Yeah.

120
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:26,165
-Hey

121
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:27,800
-Hi.

122
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,668
All of these Digimon must
have just hatched.

123
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:30,736
-Yeah, I bet you're right.

124
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:37,209
-It's so great to
see you guys.

125
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,378
You know, sometimes you're not
really sure if your paths will

126
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:42,381
cross again, but it's put a
smile on my face to know that

127
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:43,715
we've all made it here.

128
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:44,550
-Taku!

129
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,387
-And you're a cute little guy.

130
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,056
-Yah, yah, yah.

131
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:53,692
-Wah!

132
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:56,061
-I sure have a way
with babies, huh?

133
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:57,396
-I wonder if he's hungry.

134
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:59,965
Or maybe he needs to-- ah!

135
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:01,333
-Ah, these are about to hatch!

136
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:12,311
Ah!

137
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:13,912
-My name is Lopmon.

138
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:15,347
It's nice to meet you.

139
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,248
And my name is Salamon.

140
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:18,250
So, tell us who you are.

141
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:20,886
-My name's Patamon.

142
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:28,227
[laughter]

143
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,561
-Lopmon fall down, go boom.

144
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,401
-It looks like time has brought

145
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:38,203
these three full circle.

146
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:41,540
Patamon is Seraphimon,
Lopmon is Cherubimon,

147
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:43,776
and Salamon is Ophanimon.

148
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:45,444
-After everything they
went through, they've

149
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:46,778
forgiven each other.

150
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:48,447
-Gee, I guess when they
were reborn, it must

151
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:50,282
have purified them.

152
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:52,251
-I don't know, Z Maybe they
became pure, and that's why

153
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:54,286
they were reborn.

154
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,954
-What do you think?

155
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:57,923
[humming]

156
00:06:57,956 --> 00:06:59,124
-Who knows?

157
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:02,060
-I don't think it really matters
how this happened.

158
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,897
Just as long as they all grow
together as friends.

159
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:06,231
-Mm-hm.

160
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:15,641
-We have to make sure
that happens.

[thunder rolling]

162
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:24,116
-What can we do to bring
it all back?

163
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:25,117
-Just try.

164
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:25,951
-Yeah.

165
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:27,486
We can't give up hope.

166
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,154
-We need a new plan of action.

167
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:31,423
-Right.

168
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:32,658
We'll make it happen.

169
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:54,046
-Huh?

170
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,014
[shouting]

171
00:07:56,048 --> 00:07:56,515
-They're here.

172
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:58,550
The evil ones.

173
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,152
-It's those bad Royal Knights.

174
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,258
-What will you do?

175
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,626
-What do you mean?

176
00:08:07,626 --> 00:08:08,927
-Are you gonna stand
up to them?

177
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:09,962
Or will you run?

178
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:15,300
FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
It's up to you now.

179
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:18,270
Which one will you choose?

180
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:20,038
-I'm so bored.

181
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:21,873
What is this about?

182
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:23,208
Oh, what the heck?

183
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:29,548
FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
The game to determine

184
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:31,516
your future has begun.

185
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,551
-Yeah.

186
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:34,186
Boy, have I been in the game.

187
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:37,656
It became a more serious game
when I found who I really was.

188
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:40,192
Finding out you're not just a
kid, but a Digimon gave me all

189
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,860
kinds of feelings.

190
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:44,830
Feelings of power and
responsibility, but most of

191
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:46,698
all, it gave me the sense
that what I did really

192
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,200
could affect things.

193
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,868
At first it was kind of fun.

194
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:52,704
I mean, it was really exciting
to be exploring the Digital

195
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,740
World, discovering the
Forest Terminal.

196
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:57,075
It was like a big puzzle
trying to decide

197
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,577
which way to go.

198
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,213
But as we made our way through
the dark continent to the Rose

199
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:04,349
Morning Star, we experienced
more challenges.

200
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:07,319
As I look back on our quest, I
realize we've shared so many

201
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:08,820
adventures.

202
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:10,856
Many of my memories are
bittersweet, and some are

203
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,357
downright painful.

204
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:15,027
Seeing so many creatures that
were getting destroyed changed

205
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:16,728
the way I think about evil.

206
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:19,197
Evil can confuse you when you're
standing at it straight

207
00:09:19,197 --> 00:09:20,332
in the face.

208
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:23,268
-You would do that?

209
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:25,003
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): You hope
the face of evil can change

210
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:28,907
itself, but it won't unless
you force it to change.

211
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:30,909
-Guys, what's happening?

212
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:32,778
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): As much as
evil has tried to get the best

213
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,913
of us, we have never
stopped trying.

214
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:37,616
Many times we've had chances
to leave the Digital World.

215
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,085
We could have gone back to our
safe, warm homes and our

216
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:43,622
loving families, but we always
chose to stay, to try to

217
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:44,923
change things.

218
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:50,062
Because evil in all its forms
it must be stopped.

219
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:50,595
-No!

220
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,597
What have you done?

221
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:53,732
-He's too strong.

222
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:54,399
I have no choice.

223
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,934
Zephyrote Crystals!

224
00:10:04,976 --> 00:10:08,080
-We've always tried to stop
evil from running wild.

225
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:10,615
I've faced this decision before,
but I always return to

226
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,184
fight for what's right.

227
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:13,352
TRAILMON (OFFSCREEN):
Well, I didn't

228
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:14,853
think I'd see you again.

229
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:16,655
-Trailmon, you have
to take me back.

230
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:17,656
-Are you sure?

231
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:20,192
This is a one way ticket, kid.

232
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:23,161
I can't turn around if you
get any second thoughts.

233
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,695
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): No way.

234
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:24,863
I've made my decision.

235
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,164
-I guess you have.

236
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:28,066
-So why are you all staying?

237
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,002
-We've still got a lot of stuff
we need to take care of.

238
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:34,039
And as we watched our friends
had back to Earth, there as a

239
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,041
part of us that wished we
were going with them.

240
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,877
But there's a reason
we're still here.

241
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,914
We can make a difference.

242
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:45,250
After everything we've seen, and
all the things we've been

243
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:47,052
through, we're not
about to let evil

244
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:48,086
have the final victory.

245
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,059
-They may think we don't have
anything left, but we're not

246
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:55,927
finished yet.

247
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,396
-Yeah, that's right.

248
00:10:57,396 --> 00:11:00,298
When we combine all of our
strength, we can't be beat.

249
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:02,234
So let's do it.

250
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:03,502
-Mm-hm.

251
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,473
-We have got to look at this
as the final battle.

252
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,208
There's no backing down.

253
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,878
Those royal creeps may think
we're just kids to be bullied,

254
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:13,879
but we're Digimon.

255
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:19,851
This is our world, too, and
we're not gonna let them win.

256
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:21,186
-Then let's show them.

257
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:23,188
Right now.

258
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:26,024
-Yeah!

259
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:26,925
-Wind into flame!

260
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:28,226
-Thunder into light!

261
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,396
-Ice into flame!

262
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:32,397
-Darkness into light!

263
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:45,444
-Unity Execute!

264
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:47,145
Unified Spirit Evolution!

265
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:52,784
[screaming]

266
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,702
-Unity Execute!

267
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:13,071
Unified Spirit Evolution!

268
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:20,045
[screaming]

269
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:26,785
-MagnaGarurumon!

270
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:31,456
-EmperorGreymon!

271
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:34,793
-Well, well, well.

272
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:36,328
Now allow us to show
you knights what

273
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:37,762
real courage can do!

274
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:51,717
Let's get 'em!

275
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,386
-I'm with ya!

276
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,588
-To become the supreme rulers
of the Earth, we must crush

277
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:57,089
these pests.

278
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,090
-Yes.

279
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,793
To get the key, we
must defeat them.

280
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:05,331
[laughter]

281
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:08,167
-How can you doubt my
word, Crusadermon?

282
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,671
Such lack of trust will surely
poison my faith in you.

283
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:13,639
-I must believe him.

284
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:15,641
[shouting]

285
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,310
-Let us get the upper hand.

286
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:20,313
-Oh, of course.

287
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:21,647
-Magna Missiles!

288
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:25,484
-No!

289
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:29,855
Oh, what happened?

290
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,563
-Those that ignore history are
condemned to repeat it, and so

291
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:39,231
you shall be defeated
again by the power

292
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,601
of the Royal Knights.

293
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:42,602
What?

294
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:46,539
How can this be?

295
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:47,406
No!

296
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,075
How can you be stronger?

297
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:51,377
[screaming]

298
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,885
-Crusadermon's doubts have
dissipated our power.

299
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:04,523
-Spiral Masquerade!

300
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:11,397
Fist of Athena!

301
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:17,703
-Are you tired? 'Cause
I'm not!

302
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:40,926
[screaming]

303
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,961
-Crusadermon!

304
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:52,805
My dear fallen comrade, we were
to rule Earth together.

305
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,206
You will pay for this
ruinous wound!

306
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:00,413
Breath of Wyvern!

307
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,755
Ha ha ha!

308
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:10,790
-Pyro Dragons!

309
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:21,634
[screaming]

310
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:37,950
-Dynasmon!

311
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,022
-Now I will purify you.

312
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:44,056
-No, it's mine.

313
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:53,532
Grand Cross!

314
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:00,306
-EmperorGreymon!

315
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:01,373
-MagnaGarurumon!

316
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:07,847
-Master.

317
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,349
-Now I'll absorb the Knights'
data and become unstoppable.

318
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:18,157
-No!

319
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,492
Not that!

320
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:20,726
-He's scanning them!

321
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:30,736
[evil laughter]

322
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,772
-Who's that?

323
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:35,207
-That's gotta be Lucemon.

324
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:37,710
And it looks like
he's evolved.

325
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,378
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
It is Lucemon.

326
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:43,249
But now he's in his more
powerful Chaos Mode.

327
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:46,252
-I want you to understand, every
living creature in this

328
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,087
world is precious to me.

329
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,955
-That is a bold-faced lie.

330
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:52,458
-How can you think it is a
lie, dear young human?

331
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,260
It was difficult to put
those poor knights

332
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:55,728
out of their misery.

333
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,763
But for their eternal
happiness, I had to.

334
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,732
-You wiped them out to
take their power!

335
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,535
-I couldn't have them live a
life in pain, and they didn't

336
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:05,671
accept my loving
rules of life.

337
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:07,873
-So it's follow your
rules or suffer?

338
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,774
-You want to control everyone.

339
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:09,875
It's not right.

340
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,210
-Mm-hm.

341
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:13,179
-Most of you can't control
yourselves, so I'm here to

342
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:14,513
help you.

343
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,781
-It sounds like you don't
want us to act

344
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,449
or think for ourselves.

345
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:20,419
You want us to be slaves, and
to accept living in a world

346
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,021
run by you.

347
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:25,224
-Without a loving being to
shepherd you, this new world

348
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:27,927
order I'm creating could
become chaos.

349
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,131
I'm inviting all of you share
in my view of paradise.

350
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:34,900
It is frustrating to reason with
beasts like you, who only

351
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,803
think of themselves and never
consider that common good.

352
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,339
Now I ask you to join me
and share the vision I

353
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:41,841
have for all of us.

354
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:44,109
You need me, for only
I have the wisdom to

355
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:45,945
command this utopia.

356
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,680
-We've seen what your
evil has done here.

357
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:49,148
We don't want you.

358
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:50,649
-That's too bad.

359
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:53,819
I had hoped you'd hear me
out with an open mind.

360
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:54,854
You've made a mistake.

361
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:02,561
-You're nothing big bully.

362
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:03,762
-You're not that big,
you weirdo!

363
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:07,266
-My utopia won't have room
for upstarts like you.

364
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,134
You cannot survive.

365
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:12,104
To create my paradise, all you
humans and Digimon must be

366
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:12,605
exterminated.

367
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,606
But don't fret.

368
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:16,075
I will give you eternal
happiness.

369
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:18,444
Since you won't accept me as
your master, I've no choice

370
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,846
but to wipe the slate clean.

371
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,817
-We're not gonna let
that happen!

372
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,851
Dragonfire Crossbow!

373
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:30,789
-Starburst Hunter!

374
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,329
[laughter]

375
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:39,331
-That's impossible.

376
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:40,533
-You both look surprised.

377
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,135
You really thought that
would work against me?

378
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:53,178
-No!

379
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:54,713
Don't do it!

380
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:58,217
-You are foolish, but I
will show you love.

381
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,819
Experience my benevolent
compassion.

382
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:01,854
Paradise Lost Punch!

383
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,074
-Takuya!

384
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,269
-Takuya, get away!

385
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:58,911
-My data!

386
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:02,881
-You shall be the first.

387
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:03,949
-Takuya!

388
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:17,830
[screaming]

389
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:23,168
-No, Lucemon!

390
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:24,503
No!

391
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:30,476
-Koji!
-Help him!

392
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:41,720
-The whole place is
falling apart!

393
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:43,022
-Someone help us!

394
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:54,700
BOKOMON (NARRATING): Oh, dear.

395
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,335
Can the Digital World go on?

396
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:58,537
How are any of us going
to survive?

397
00:20:58,537 --> 00:20:59,872
There's only one way
to find out.

398
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:02,708
Watch the next Digimon,
Digital Monsters.
