RIKA NARRATING: While Takuya was
trying to figure out how

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,705
to Spirit Evolve again, he
released this code that

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,107
actually repaired part
of the Digital World.

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,010
JP, unimpressed by the whole
experience, snuck away with

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,712
Tommy to find a way home.

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,381
This brilliant plan to bribe
the Pagumon with chocolate

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,883
backfired in a big way.

8
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,852
Kouji saved them with some
amazing moves, but Raremon was

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,187
too much for him.

10
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,190
Takuya finally managed to Spirit
Evolve to Agunimon to

11
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,158
fight this sewer Digimon, but
couldn't finish the job.

12
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,194
Thank goodness for Kouji.

13
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:30,697
He Spirit Evolved to Lobomon
and deodorized that creep.

14
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,032
THEME SONG: Digimon!

15
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:40,574
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

16
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,710
Digital World!

17
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:49,049
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

18
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,417
by the lessons we've learned.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,957
As we work towards one solution

20
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,725
through a Spirit Evolution.

21
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,330
I am the one!

22
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,665
I am the one!

23
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,565
Digimon!

24
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,302
Forever united as one.

25
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,303
Digimon!

26
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:12,306
Together the battles are won.

27
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,307
Digimon!

28
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:16,476
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,480
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,818
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

31
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,786
I am the one!

32
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,154
I am the one!

33
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,488
Digimon!

34
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,398
-The wind of the Digital World
smells pretty sweet.

35
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,140
-If you really want to go home,
all you have to do is

36
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,709
hop on here.

37
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,010
-It's that easy?

38
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,878
-Neemon, a word, please?

39
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:52,846
What exactly are you
trying to do?

40

[interposing voices]

41
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,719
-I'm taking that bad boy home.

42
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,353
Huh?

43
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,387
How about it, guys?

44
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,391
-Uh.

45
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,361
You don't really want to
stay here, do you?

46
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,196
Ugh. Fine!

47
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,232
You dweebs enjoy your little
digital freak show.

48
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,102
Come on, Tommy, let's blow
this stupid pop stand.

49
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,770
-Aren't you going with him?

50
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,973
-I've decided I want to
stay here with you.

51
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,208
-Huh?

52
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,943
-I thought you wanted
to go home.

53
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,811
-Not anymore.

54
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,079
-Go with JP.

55
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,280
It's dangerous here, Tommy.

56
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,449
Besides, the third grade
is a formative year.

57
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:29,950
-No.

58
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,951
-Go home.

59
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,985
Hurry up now.

60
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,958
Take care of him, JP.

61
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,959
How about you, huh?

62
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,694
-I have a name.

63
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,294
-OK, Zoe.

64
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,763
Are you leaving?

65
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:43,296
-Why?

66
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,798
Would you miss me?

67
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,501
-I won't be responsible for
your safety, you know.

68
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,368
-Good one, Romeo.

69
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,436
I'll be fine.

70
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,937

-Hey, what are you doing here?

-To be honest, I have
absolutely no idea.

-Me neither.

81
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,001
-Well, I'm not going to be
responsible for your safety.

You're on your own.

TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Wait a minute.

85
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,073
Are you mocking me?

86
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,074
You are, aren't you?

00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,575
Man, you try and be
nice to a girl.

-I hope you're planning on
helping us, Mr. Takuya.

-Hm?

90

-You carry with you the spirit
of Agunimon, one of the 10

Legendary Warriors.

92
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,560
You can defeat the Digimon
turned evil by Cherubimon.

93
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,829
Only you have the power
to save us!

94
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,330
You must help us repair the
parts of the Digital World

95

that have been destroyed!

96

-I think you need to
calm down, buddy.

97

-My name's Bokomon, and
I'm not your buddy.

98
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,137
I don't think you understand
the severity of

99

But we need the data from
the Fractal Code.

It's the only way to rebuild
the Digital World.

104

Please, help us get the
Fractal Code back.

105

Save our world before it's
too late, will you?

Neemon, don't just stand there
like a cheap TV antenna!

I need your help! Say something!

-Something.

00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,858
-Are you really that dense,
or do you just do

110
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,293
that to annoy me?

to follow them?

00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:57,657
-To become a Digimon so I won't
be scared all the time.

168
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,926
-What about your mom and
dad waiting at home?

169
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,196
I bet they're worried.

170
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,166
-I miss my parents, but when I
come back, I won't be afraid

171
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,168
anymore, so they'll forgive
me for being gone.

172
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,774
-For such a little kid, he
sure has big problems.

173
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,420
-This is a fine mess.

174
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,022
-So what now?

175
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,856
-Check it out, guys!

176
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,558
That trail leads
to the bottom.

177
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,426
-Looks like a village
down there.

178
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,729
Maybe they can help us.

179
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,196
-Humans!

180
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,530
Human children!

181
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,199
Why, I oughta--

182
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,567
-What are they doing here?

183
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,068
-Well, I'll tell you,
nothing good!

184
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,904
We'd better enlighten
the boss!

185
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,074
-That's weird.

186
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,110
I could've sworn those lights
were coming from right here.

187
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,444
-Looked like that to me.

188
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,879
-Takuya?

189
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:53,947
-Huh?

190
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,985
What is that?

191
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,120
-Kind of pretty.

192
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,620
-Pretty?

193
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,123
Pretty, she says.

194
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,593
These are the marks of the
10 Legendary Warriors.

195
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,962
-The 10 Legendary warriors

196
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,764
-I've never heard of them.

197
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,132
-Are you serious?

198
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,301
The legend of the 10 Warriors is
the first thing we learned

199
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,970
in Digital World History.

200
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,471
-I must've been sick that day.

201
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,973
But they sure are pretty.

202
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,107
-Ugh!

203
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,379
In ancient times, there were
terrible wars between humanoid

204
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:31,484
Digimon and beast Digimon for
control of the Digital World.

205
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:34,688
One day, an angel Digimon
called Lucemon appeared.

206
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,857
He taught them how to resolve
their differences and live in

207
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,859
peace, and the fighting
stopped.

208
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,996
Lucemon was a wise, kind ruler,
but the peace in the

209
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,065
Digital World was short-lived.

210
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,034
Lucemon, obsessed with his
power, began to torment the

211
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,503
peace-loving Digimon until
they could take no more.

212
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,840
It was then that 10 brave
warriors rose up against him.

213
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,442
After a fierce battle, they
defeated Lucemon,

214
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,243
restoring the peace.

215
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,580
The legend says that one day,
the spirits of these ancient

216
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,782
warriors will rise again
in times of trouble

217
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,951
-Read it to me again.

218
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,454
-Mm, no.

219
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,588
-I know that symbol.

220
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,426
-It's the same one we saw
when Takuya Spirit

221
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,461
Evolved into Agunimon.

222
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,432
-And that mark next to it was
the one on Kouji's shoulder

223
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,467
when he turned into Lobomon.

224
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,605
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): I wonder
if I'll be next.

225
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,274
Oh, I hope my Digimon's cute.

226
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,642
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): I want to be
like the biggest, scariest

227
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,844
Digimon ever.

228
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,579
JP (OFFSCREEN): Not
likely, shorty.

229
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:37,984
I mean, there's no way we'll
all get to be Digimon.

230
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,152
-Huh?

231
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,186
We've got company.

232
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,961
-Why have you humans come
to our village?

233
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,295
You are not welcome here.

234
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,131
-We're on our way to the
Forest Terminal.

235
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,332
Sorry to disturb you.

236
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,500
We're just passing through.

237
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,135
-You're melting my heart.

238
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,237
-Ooh, that's a no-no.

239
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,506
-You mean to steal the ancient
artifact from us, don't you?

240
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,174
Well, you won't get
away with it!

241
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,675
-He's right.

242
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,376
The humans must be punished.

243
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,477
-Hey, boss!

244
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,146
You want us to wax him for you?

245
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,648
-Wait! Stop! Let me explain!

246
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,383
These humans have come to help
us save the Digital World, not

247
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,885
steal some artifact.

248
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,420
-But we didn't know
that at first.

249
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,188
-You're not helping.

250
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,557
This may be hard to believe,
but somehow this boy was

251
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,259
infused with the spirit
of one of the 10

252
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,894
Legendary Warriors, Agunimon.

253
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,429
-Did you say Agunimon?

254
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,530
Impossible!

255
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,564
-That's a hot one.

256
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,865
-What if it really is him?

257
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:26,900
-He's pulling our wicks!

258
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,070
-Well, isn't this interesting?

259
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,542
Please forgive our
rude behavior,

260
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,309
my dear young friends.

261
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,645
[laughs]

262
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,313
We are the Candlemon Tribe.

263
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,782
It is our sacred duty to protect
the ancient artifact.

264
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,484
So which of you inherited
the Spirit of

265
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,952
the Legendary Warrior?

266
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,754
-It was this one, Takuya.

267
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,155
-[whimpers]

268
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,457
-Ah.

269
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,492
Well, you certainly have a
brave face, young man.

270
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,496
On behalf of all the Candlemon
Tribe, I bid you all welcome.

271
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,964
Please, be our guest.

272
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,966
-Something doesn't
seem quite right.

273
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,768
-Come along now, don't dawdle.

274
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:14,447
-[chanting]

275
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,016
-Looks like a giant
birthday party.

276
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,351
-It's for you, my friends.

277
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,486
A welcome ceremony. Enjoy!

278
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,355
[chanting]

279
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,389
-Come closer.

280
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,657
Feel the warmth of the flame.

281
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:36,269
[chanting]

282
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,670
-Oh, look at this.

283
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:38,605
It's sleeping clover.

284
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,607
-It's nappy time anyway.

285
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,515
-I can't keep my eyes open.

286
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,115
-Yeah.

287
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,183
-Night.

288
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,057
-So you've claimed the spirit
of Agunimon, have you?

289
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:58,958
Bah!

290
00:10:58,992 --> 00:10:59,759
We'll soon shed some
light on this!

291
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,269
-Let's turn up the heat on
these artifact filchers!

292
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,503
Get them, Candlemon!

293
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,771
-Yeah!

294
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,606
-Hey, we can't stay here.

295
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,008
Come on!

296
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,342
The river!

297
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,977
-Lava loogie!

298
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,313
-Dive in!

299
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:24,183
-I don't know how to swim.

300
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:27,687
-That was a great idea!

301
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,123
-I'll never complain about
my alarm clock again!

302
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,190
-Yeah, nice way to wake up.

303
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,026
Did we really have to
jump into the river?

304
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,361
-Takuya said we had to dive in,
or we were gonna burn up.

305
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,663
-Oh, yeah?

306
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,497
-Oh, did I disturb your
beauty sleep?

307
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,365
-We'll be safe as long
as we stay here.

308
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,801
I bet fire Digimon like
Candlemon can't get near the

309
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,335
water.

310
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,003
-Guess again, human!

311
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,004
Lava loogie!

312
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,339
-Go under!

313
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,977
-Find them!

314
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,714
Don't let them get away!

315
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,481
-Where'd they go?

316
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,149
-I don't know!

317
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,417
They just disappeared!

318
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,251
-Well, they've gotta
come up sometime!

319
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,686
And when they do, we'll--

320
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,887
-I'll distract them.

321
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,922
Then, on my signal, you guys
make a break for it.

322
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,090
-Some plan.

323
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,558
-Hang on a minute,
Mr. President.

324
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,061
I don't remember electing you
leader of this stupid club.

325
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:08,895
Right?

326
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:09,596
-Yeah.

327
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,097
That's right.

328
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,433
We're all in this together, so
any decisions we make, we make

329
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,068
as a team, OK?

330
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,036
-I really want to help,
but I'm too slow.

331
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,305
You guys should just
go on without me.

332
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,573
-That's not an option.

333
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,909
If I Spirit Evolve to Agunimon,
I can snuff out the

334
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:23,776
Candlemon!

335
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,111
-Right, Spirit Boy.

336
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,280
Better read your Digimon
instruction manual before you

337
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,548
try something dumb
like that again.

338
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,449
-He's right.

339
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,783
You shouldn't try
to fight alone.

340
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,151
You're not very good
at it yet.

341
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,119
-Here they come! Duck!

342
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:38,491
-[cackling]

343
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,262
-Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

344
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,999
Just get Tommy out
of here, OK?

345
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,133
-OK, let's move.

346
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,537
-I see one of them!

347
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,973
Get 'em!

348
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,308
-Lava loogie!

349
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,180
-Come on, help me out here!

350
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,548
-Lava loogie!

351
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,183
-Oh, no!

352
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:04,984
My D-Tector!

353
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,185
-Takuya!

354
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,520
-We've got you now, human!

355
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,523
[cackling]

356
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,524
-What?

357
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,859
-Spirit Evolution time!

358
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,835
Execute Spirit Evolution!

359
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,592
Agunimon!

360
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,432
-[cheering]

361
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,133
-Well, I'll be dipped.

362
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,234
The brat really is Agunimon!

363
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,772
-Lava loogie!

364
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,311
-I summon the Pyro Tornado!

365
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:13,152
-[cackling]

366
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,154
-What?

367
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,789
-What's wrong?

368
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,358
-Fire attacks don't
work on Candlemon.

369
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,292
He should know that.

370
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,993
-Yeah, that wasn't too bright.

371
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,328
Come on, I'd better get
us out of this hole,

372
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,964
before we get waxed.

373
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,532
I hate ice skating.

374
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,301
-Be careful, Tommy.

375
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,569
-I'm trying.

376
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,337
-Wow, I didn't see
that before.

377
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,473
-We should be safe from those
hotheads in there.

378
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,912
-Please give me a Spirit.

379
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:40,880
I want to help!

380
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,248
-Give it up, kid.

381
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,383
The spirits of the Legendary
Warriors would never give

382
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,753
their power to a pipsqueak
like you.

383
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,021
Looks like it's really
up to me.

384
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,924
Aw, man, I wish this
came with a manual.

385
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,926
-Paraffin paralyzer!

386
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,896
-That stuff hurts!

387
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:57,897
-Ah! Agunimon!

388
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,931
Hang on!

389
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,238
-I gotcha, buddy!

390
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,873
Look out!

391
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,907
Oh no!

392
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,447
-I can't--

393
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,448
I can't move anything!

394
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,783
-Hang on, Takuya!

395
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:17,784
I'm coming!

396
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:18,785
-Tommy, no!

397
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:19,752
-Stop, kid!

398
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:24,290
-Lights out, you meanies!

399
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:31,297
I won't be just a little kid
in the way ever again!

400
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,298
-Mama mia!

401
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,511
-It's a Spirit!

402
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,521
Spirit, come to me!

403
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,823
D-TECTOR: It is time.

404
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,535
-Execute Spirit Evolution!

405
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,089
Kumamon!

406
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:38,472
-That's amazing!

407
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:39,639
-That's impossible!

408
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,641
-It's Tommy!

409
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:42,309
-Yay!

410
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,044
-What in blazes?

411
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:46,613
-Ah. It is.

412
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:50,784
It's Kumamon, the legendary
warrior of ice.

413
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:52,686
-Time to teach you
bullies a lesson.

414
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,020
Crystal freeze!

415
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,858
-Hey there, teddybear!

416
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:59,025
You want a playmate?

417
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,060
Ha-cha!

418
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,335
-Wizardmon.

419
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:11,037
This mysterious champion level
Digimon can make you disappear

420
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,674
with his Electro-squall and
Magical Game attacks.

421
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,511
-Crystal freeze!

422
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:20,013
-Take off, teddy!

423
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:23,116
-Kumamon!

424
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,918
-Looks like the great Agunimon
has a little

425
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,853
problem with waxy buildup!

426
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,588
How about a little
Magical Game?

427
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:31,458
Ta-ta!

428
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:32,759
-That was weird.

429
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:37,964
-[laughing]

430
00:17:37,998 --> 00:17:38,965
Up here!

431
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:39,766
I know!

432
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,101
Let's play catch!

433
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:48,775
Not bad, Legendary Warrior.

434
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:51,278
But I've got plenty
up my sleeve.

435
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:53,613
Too bad you're going to
lose no matter which

436
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:54,948
Wizardmon you choose!

437
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:56,416
-Which is the real Wizardmon?

438
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,318
-They all look the same to me!

439
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,653
-Agunimon, don't you see?

440
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:01,154
All these Wizardmon are me!

441
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,656
We all look real,
because we are.

442
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:03,490
Just try to run.

443
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,758
You won't get far!

444
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,159
-This is just a game.

445
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:07,828
Only one is real, and I'm
going to find it!

446
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,329
-Every warrior must fall.

447
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:10,497
Your time is up!

448
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,631
Electro-squall!

449
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:16,503
-Agunimon!

450
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,338
Look down here!

451
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,207
Only one of them has a shadow!

452
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:21,875
-Thanks! Game's over!

453
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,149
I never did believe in magic.

454
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:36,423
Here's a trick for you.

455
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:39,025
Fractal code!

456
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,060
Digitize!

457
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:45,398
-Ha-cha-cha.

458
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:46,733
-Yay! Molto bene!

459
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,935
-Yeah, mol-- what she said!

460
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,603
-Ah.

461
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:50,770
Thanks, Agunimon!

462
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:52,205
-No, thank you.

463
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,241
You're one brave little bear.

464
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:56,910
-[laughs]

465
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:58,812
-Well, I guess this proves
that they really are the

466
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:00,714
Legendary Warriors after all.

467
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:02,382
-Yes.

468
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:03,717
I would not have believed it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

469
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,825
You have indeed proven
yourselves worthy of carrying

470
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:13,460
the spirits of the Legendary
Warriors,

471
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,961
my young human friends.

472
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:19,099
Takuya and little Tommy, you
two have truly honored the

473
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:21,635
great names of Agunimon
and Kumamon.

474
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:23,103
I salute you both.

475
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:27,807
-[cheering]

476
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:31,111
-I'm afraid I owe you
all an apology.

477
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:33,480
The truth is, we thought you
might possess the spirits of

478
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,815
the Legendary Warriors, but
we still had to make sure.

479
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,951
I'm sorry we didn't trust you.

480
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:39,519
-So then all of this
has been a test?

481
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,454
-Well, that pretty
much stinks.

482
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:43,456
You're lucky I don't pinch
your lights out for that.

483
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:44,190
-[laughs]

484
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,191
I'm so sorry.

485
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,693
You have every right
to be angry.

486
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:48,028
D-TECTOR: Fractal
code rendered.

487
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,165
-Whoa!

488
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,068
-Wizardmon had the code.

489
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,610
-Wizardmon held within him the
Fractal Code for the bridge,

490
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:06,379
which protected our village
from evil Digimon.

491
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,115
Young Takuya, for many
years, no one has

492
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:10,450
crossed this canyon.

493
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:13,920
But you have my official
permission to use this bridge.

494
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,422
Follow the tracks, and
they will lead you

495
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:16,923
to the Forest Terminal.

496
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:18,625
But it is a perilous journey.

497
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:20,961
-Uh, maybe we should think
about this, guys.

498
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:23,563
There's still time to go home.

499
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:25,932
-You're just jealous because
Tommy found his inner Digimon,

500
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:27,100
and you haven't yet.

501
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,602
-Why would I even
care about that?

502
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,936
Shorty can have it.

503
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:32,072
It's just that being here
is like working.

504
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,940
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): We all know
how you feel about that!

505
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,275
JP (OFFSCREEN): Very funny.

506
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:39,613
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
somebody else just beat us

507
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,247
across the bridge.

508
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,150
I wonder if he's going to the
Forest Terminal, too.

509
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:51,358
RIKA NARRATING: That could've
been a serious meltdown.

510
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:53,793
Hopefully the dream team's
on the right track now.

511
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:57,197
We'll see, on the next Digimon:
Digital Monsters.
