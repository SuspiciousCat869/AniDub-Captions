NARRATOR: While on the way to
the Rose Morning Star, our

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,872
heroes got dumped at the Dark
Gate, the creepy entrance to

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,707
the even creepier Continent
of Darkness.

4
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,376
Once they convinced
Bokumon they could

5
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,577
handle it, in they went.

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,512
Meanwhile, Cherubimon
called a meeting of

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,214
the legendary lunkheads.

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,883
After a little encouragement,
Arbormon decided it was time

9
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,552
to get rid of the gang
once and for all.

10
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,221
But the warrior of wood was
no match for our heroes!

11
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,890
They chopped him down and
stole his bee spirit.

12
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,126
Then, out of nowhere,
Duskmon showed up

13
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,461
and destroyed Arbormon!

14
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,564
With friends like that,
who needs enemies?

15
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,898
THEME SONG: Digimon!

16
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:42,609
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

17
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,778
Digital World.

18
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:48,949
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:56,456
by the lessons we've learned
as we work towards one

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,194
solution, through our
spirit evolution.

21
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,196
I am the one.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,432
I am the one.

23
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:09,336
Digimon, forever
united as one.

24
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,340
Digimon, together the
battles are won.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,877
Digimon, through us let
your spirit evolve.

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,181
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

27
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:28,522
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

-Who is this guy?

30
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:41,168
-(CHUCKLING) I am Duskmon,
legendary warrior of darkness.

31

-Well, that explains
the outfit.

32

33
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,773
Mm-hmm.

34

-You have done well against
my brethren.

35
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,746
Let's see how strong
you really are.

36
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,080
Show me your power.

37

-All he did was swing
his sword!

38

-I've got a bad feeling
about this.

39

-If we defeated Grumblemon and
Petaldramon, then laughing boy

00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,766
over there should be
a piece of cake!

43

Remember, we're legendary
warriors, right?

44
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,337
There's no way we can lose!

-You were weaker
than I thought.

54
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,497
I should at least give you
the chance to surrender.

55
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,067
-You can give it, but
we won't take it!

56
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,036
-You are proving to be very
foolish creatures.

57

-JP, Tommy, switch to
your human spirits!

-Or make him fight harder.

-Your efforts against
me are pitiful.

Surely you have more
power than that.

BURNINGGREYMON (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, we're just

00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,846
I just defeated him.

87

-All of us combined weren't able
to defeat him, and you

KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Man, the Dark
Continent sure is dark.

TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): You know,
guys the more I think about

97
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,544
it, the more I think I really
did beat that guy.

98
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,580
I can't believe an attack that
powerful wouldn't do something

99
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,217
serious to him, you know?

100
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,552
Fine.

101
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,053
-Do you guys hear something
that sounds

-Not me.

104
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,125
But if I did hear that,
I'd say it was

105
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,993
getting pretty annoying.

106
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,495
-Very funny, guys.

107
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,731
You can play your little game
all you want, but I'm telling

108
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,432
you, that guy is toast.

109
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,135
There is just no way he could
stand there and take that fire

110
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,636

111
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,671
-Yeah, right.

Were you at some other fight?

113
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,442
He took all our attacks
and didn't even flinch

114
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,177
-Ah, so you can hear
me now, huh?

115
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,179
Well then riddle me
this, smart guy.

116
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,849
How can you be so sure about
what happened after you made

he's alive?

-There's no doubt
about it at all.

None of us did any serious
damage to him.

-So how are we supposed
to beat him?

-I don't know.

123

We'll find someplace safe
to come up with a plan.

-Then we'll never have a plan.

There's no place safe
in this world.

This is all your fault.

stuck around and worked as a

beaten him!

working as a team?

like a team player when

you went charging it against
Duskmon by yourself, did you?

sign that you're hungry.

-Yeah, I'm wasting
away to nothing.

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:49,881
-Funny.

165
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:51,349
I meant build a fire.

166
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,750
You know, this world can
be tough, but we've

167
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:56,054
learned a lot here.

168
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:58,856
-JP, I'm worried about
Koji and Takuya.

169
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,091
-How so?

170
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:02,026
-Well, that fight
they got into.

171
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,562
-I wouldn't worry about it.

172
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:05,897
-Why?

173
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,799
-When you spend as much time
together as we do, there's

174
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:09,534
bound to be friction.

175
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,203
Besides, if Takuya weren't so
hot-headed and Koji were less

176
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:14,072
calculating, we wouldn't
be complete.

177
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:15,440
You know?

178
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:16,874
-No.

179
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,776
-It's the combination of all of
our differences that make

180
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,445
us such a good team.

181
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,113
We balance each other.

182
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:23,948
-Huh.

183
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,650
-Seriously.

184
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:28,119
Can you imagine what it would be
like if we had two Takuyas?

185
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,987
-Two Takuyas, huh?

186
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:36,294
-All right guys, now everybody
follow me!

187
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:38,496
-Um, I don't know.

188
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:41,866
I mean, this bridge just about
defines "rickety." Is it safe?

189
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,968
-Yeah, shouldn't we
test it out first?

190
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,303
-Nothing ventured,
nothing gained!

191
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:47,305
-Testing's for cowards.

192
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:49,340
-We have bad guys to fight,
so get it in gear!

193
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,341
Come on, guys.

194
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:52,276
Don't let me down!

195
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:54,846
[shouting]

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,215
-This is some great plan!

197
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:59,884
-What're we supposed
to do now, genius?

198
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,886
-You have to learn
to trust me.

199
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,221
-Yeah, it'll all work out.

200
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:04,222
ALL: How?

201
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:05,656
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
It just will.

202
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,858
ALL: How?

203
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:07,558
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Come on, guys.

204
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,559
I can't think of everything.

205
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:09,560
[splash]

206
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,863
-Mm-hmm.

207
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:13,664
-Yeah, see what I mean?

208
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:16,033
-It's not a pretty
picture, is it?

209
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:18,002
-And believe me, it would be
the same if there were two

210
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:19,103
Kojis in the group.

211
00:08:19,137 --> 00:08:20,171
-Hmm.

212
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:21,773
-You don't have to imagine
it, you know.

213
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:24,075
-Whew, that's a load
off my mind.

214
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:26,744
-In a way, we're all balanced
like this fire is.

215
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,179
-OK, you lost me.

216
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:30,081
Just how is a fire balanced?

217
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:33,451
-Well, a fire is made up of
parts, just like our group is.

218
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:36,587
You need something that'll burn,
but the fire also has to

219
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:39,423
have oxygen from the air,
or it'll go out.

220
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:41,726
If the wood's too tight,
the fire smother.

221
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,928
Too loose and the fire
won't even start.

222
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:46,097
Balance.

223
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,731
-Hm.

224
00:08:46,764 --> 00:08:49,433
You know something?

225
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,002
There's more to you
than I thought.

226
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:57,575
-You ought to hear my
thought on love.

227
00:08:57,642 --> 00:08:58,476
I think--

228
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,578
-I think I'll take
a pass on that.

229
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:01,846
-Okey-doke.

230
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:06,017
-Do you really believe
we have a chance?

231
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,318
-Hmm?

232
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,987
-I mean, can we really
beat Duskmon?

233
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:11,322
-What kind of question
is that?

234
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:12,523
-Huh?

235
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,492
-You know, you worry
too much, buddy.

236
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,994
Once we put my new plan into
action, we'll take that guy

237
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:17,862
out in one shot.

238
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:19,463
He won't know what hit him.

239
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:20,665
[groan]

240
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:22,466
-How come I have to
do this myself?

241
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,502
-I'm the one carrying two
buckets, you know.

242
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:25,803
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): But that
doesn't help me carry this

243
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:27,338
one, does it?

244
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:40,718
-Ha.

245
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,187
My search will be
short-lived--

246
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,555
as will they.

247
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,520
-So that is your big plan?

248
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,656
-Mm-hmm!

249
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:56,190
-How long did it take
you to come up with

250
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,325
attack all at once?

251
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:58,359
A second?

252
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,762
-Yeah, we tried that
already, remember?

253
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:02,397
-Now, now, now.

254
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,600
I realize it may look like the
same plan, but once I lay it

255
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:07,402
out for you, you'll see
plenty of differences.

256
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:08,269
-Mm-hmm!

257
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,270
Mm-hmm!

258
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:11,572
-All right, Tommy, show
them the plan.

259
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:13,574
-One plan, coming up!

260
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:16,377
Now, say this is Duskmon.

261
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:17,078
-Wow, Tommy.

262
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:18,246
Did you make that?

263
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:19,047
-Mm-hmm.

264
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,415
-Man, it looks just like him.

265
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:21,449
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): I helped,
too, you know!

266
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:22,717
Now, back to the plan.

267
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,919
I'll spirit evolve into
Agunimon and stop him.

268
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,054
-Do I get my own doll, too?

269
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:28,156
-Yeah, I want one.

270
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:28,890
-Ha ha!

271
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:30,058
-I wouldn't leave you out.

272
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,726
Everyone's in the plan,
so everyone gets one!

273
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,428
But let's get back to my idea.

274
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:36,297
-Apparently we don't
exist, Neemon.

275
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:38,666
-OK, so once I stopped
him, everyone will

276
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,001
beast spirit evolve.

277
00:10:40,034 --> 00:10:43,071
Then MetalKabuterimon and
Korikakumon will move in.

278
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:45,973
Zephyrmon and KendoGarurumon
will sneak up on his flank.

279
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:49,110
Then when I give the signal,
we'll all attack.

280
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:50,344
And that's that.

281
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:52,146
So, any questions?

282
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,981
-Just one-- when do
we get going?

283
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:55,183
-I'm in shock.

284
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:56,818
That looks like it
might really work

285
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:57,819
-I don't know.

286
00:10:57,852 --> 00:10:58,786
There's still a big problem.

287
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,487
-What you mean?

288
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,122
Where's there a problem?

289
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:02,156
-Oh yeah.

290
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:04,158
Just how do you plan on
stopping Duskmon?

291
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:06,160
-I mean, he knocked you all over
the place last time, and

292
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:07,729
that was your beast spirit.

293
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:08,730
-Yeah, well.

294
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:10,031
Last time I wasn't on guard.

295
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:11,699
This time I'll know
what to expect.

296
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:12,533
-Mm-hmm!

297
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,035
-He sure is confident!

298
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:16,371
-Yes, and no one can
figure out why.

299
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:17,338
KOJI (OFFSCREEN):
I don't like it.

300
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,372
[gasps]

301
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:19,340
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Aw,
what's the matter?

302
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:21,509
Not enough running
away for you?

303
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,910
I can't believe him.

304
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,846
When did he become
such a chicken?

305
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,547
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Duskmon's
different than anyone we ever

306
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,749
fought before.

307
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:28,750
Instead of fighting,
we should--

308
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,385
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Wait.

309
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:31,185
You're not really thinking
of running away, are you?

310
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:32,520
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Yes, I am.

311
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:33,721
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
You're pathetic!

312
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:35,223
What makes you think we'd
be able to get away even

313
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:36,557
if we wanted to?

314
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:39,560
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Come
on, don't fight.

315
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,596
-Takuya, let's talk.

316
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:43,097
-Yeah, let's.

317
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:43,798
-Guys?

318
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:45,533
Don't do anything stupid.

319
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,434
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Don't worry.

320
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:47,535
We're just going to talk.

321
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:48,603
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
if he's lucky

322
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:51,439
that's all we'll do.

323
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:52,473
-(WORRIED) Oh!

324
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:08,956
-All right.

325
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:10,124
So start talking.

326
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:15,163
-Why do you think you're
here, Takuya?

327
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:15,997
-Answer me.

328
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,665
I want to know why
you're here.

329
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:18,666
-Well, you know.

330
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,001
We're here to save the world.

331
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,669
-You say that like you don't
know what it means--

332
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:23,337
what's at stake.

333
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,173
This isn't just some video game
you can walk away from if

334
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,641
things don't work out.

335
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:27,675
-I'm not stupid, you know.

336
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:29,977
I know that.

337
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:34,148
-Sometimes I really don't
think you do.

338
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:36,350
There's no second chances
for us, get it?

339
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,519
If we mess up here, it's over.

340
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:40,021
-Yeah, I know.

341
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:42,190
-Then how can you stake our
lives on some plan that you

342
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,758
only assume is going to work?

343
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,326
We don't know anything
about this guy.

344
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,427
-So what?

345
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,695
We'll all be safe
if we run away?

346
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,230
-Oh, I didn't say that!

347
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,231
-Then what are you saying?

348
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,402
-Listen, Takuya.

349
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:56,904
You weren't there when I crossed
swords with him, OK?

350
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:05,112
I doubt he was using even half
his strength against me.

351
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:09,383
That whole fight, all he was
doing was playing with us!

352
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,285
-Yeah, OK, maybe.

353
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:14,388
But we're the good guys.

354
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:15,890
There must be a way to win.

355
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:17,391
-He's too strong.

356
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:19,827
-I know he's strong, but every
time we've run into someone

357
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:21,596
more powerful than us, we've
worked together, and

358
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:23,064
everything has turned
out fine.

359
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,999
I really believe that
if we just attack as

360
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:27,902
one, we can't lose!

361
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:30,137
-Takuya, open your eyes!

362
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:31,305
-Open your own eyes!

363
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:33,107
We're more powerful together
than you think!

364
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:45,119
-You just don't get
it, do you?

365
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,654
Tell me something.

366
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:49,056
It's obvious you don't care
about yourself, but can you

367
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,892
promise me the others
won't get hurt?

368
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:54,161
Cause if you can't, then you
better just go home now,

369
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,297
because I won't let you
risk their lives.

370
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:01,702
-An earthquake?

371
00:14:01,702 --> 00:14:03,037

-How'd he find us so quickly?

378
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:15,376
-Never mind.

379
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:17,678
You won't have long
to worry about it.

380

ZEPHYRMON (OFFSCREEN): Why don't
I find that reassuring?

381
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:22,683
-It'll be OK.

382
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:23,985
Just stick to the plan.

383
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:26,153
-What good is a for all
of us to attack if

384

we're not all here?

Guys, where are you?

away from this guy even if we

wanted to, Koji!

00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:44,064

-It better.

I guess we have to follow
Takuya's plan now.

-Hey, don't worry.

telling you, I really believe

that if we just attack as
one, we can't lose!
