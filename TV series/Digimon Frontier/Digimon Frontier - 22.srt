00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:03,003
RIKA NARRATING: Not only did
Duskmon throw BurningGreymon

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,772
around like a sack of trash,
he took the Digidestined's

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,174
attacks without even
flinching!

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,143
Later, Takuya came up with a
plan to defeat him, but that

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,346
just started an argument with
Kouji, who knew Duskmon was

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,547
too powerful to fight.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,048
But he didn't have much choice,
since the big man

8
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,352
himself showed up and smacked
KendoGarurumon hard, turning

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,220
him back into Kouji.

10
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,855
Then things got weird.

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,191
It was like Duskmon was in
pain, and then darkness

12
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,492
covered everyone!

13
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,327
Takuya woke up alone in the
Dark Terminal, and with

14
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,864
DarkTrailmon offering him a
chance to go home, he took it.

15
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,932
THEME SONG: Digimon!

16
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:41,275
Look to the past as we head for
the future, to reclaim the

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,376
Digital World.

18
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,382
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,083
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,057
As we work towards
one solution,

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,995
through a Spirit Evolution!

22
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:05,933
Ha-ya-moo-ah!
Huh!
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

23
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,000
Digimon!

24
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,403
Forever united as one!

25
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,637
Digimon!

26
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,407
Together the battles are won!

27
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,641
Digimon!

28
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,277
Through us, let your
spirit evolve!

29
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:21,281
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:25,352
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

31
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,353
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,120
Huh!

33
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:27,988
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

34
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,022
Digimon!

35
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,632
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Takuya, can
we really beat Duskmon?

36
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,635
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): You know,
you worry too much, buddy.

37
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,203
Once we put my new plan into
action, we'll take that

38
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,237
laughing eyeball out
in one shot.

39
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,040
He won't know what hit him!

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,380
-Yeah.
That was some plan, all right.

41
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,382
Oh, well.

42
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,383
Doesn't really matter now.

43
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,718
I'm going home.

44
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:07,361
[screaming]

45
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,944
-This is it, kid.

46
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,278
End of the line.

47
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:31,952
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): Huh?

48
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,452
Wait a minute.

49
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,954
This isn't home.

50
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,288
Huh?

51
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,923
Where am I?

52
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:45,132
[gasp]

53
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,870
-Man, I really gotta stop
landing on my head.

54
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,705
-It's up to you now.

55
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,173
Which one will you choose?

56
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,844
-Whoa!

57
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,187
-Boy, destiny sure involves
a lot of running.

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,725
-I get it.

59
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:16,029
This must be where we all left
for the Digital World.

60
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,198
But--

61
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,499
hey, what's up?

62
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,101
Why am I here?

63
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,502
-Bye, kid.

64
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,770
-Hey!

65
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,415
-[laughing]

66
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,087
-No!

67
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:45,926
Open up!

68
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,328
Please!
Let me in!

69
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:48,929
No!

70
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:49,996
Please!

71
00:03:53,967 --> 00:04:00,307
[screams]

72
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,451
ANNOUNCER (ON PA SYSTEM):
Shibuya Station.

73
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,186
This is Shibuya Station.

74
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,525
-Hey.

75
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,460
-Is that some kind of animal?

76
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,629
-It's a kid in a costume.

77
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,331
-Is it trick or treat
time, Ma?

78
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,132
-Just don't get near him.

79
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,166
-Those are some weird feet.

80
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,300
-Looks like a goat creature.

81
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,009
-Oh, man, my hands!

82
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,918
What's going on?

83
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:09,413
-Is this some alternate
universe or something?

84
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:10,882
Wait.

85
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:15,086
It's my hometown.

86
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:17,054
It's all the same.

87
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:18,089
Well, except for me.

88
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,429
Ahh!

89
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:29,066
Leave me alone!

90
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,404
[crowd screaming]

91
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:34,405
-Mom!

92
00:05:34,472 --> 00:05:35,740
Dad!

93
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:52,490
It's-- it's my house.

94
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:55,493
I made it!

95
00:05:55,526 --> 00:05:56,327
-[gasp]

96
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,162
-Whoa.

97
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:59,664
-[gasp]

98
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:01,899
-I'm sorry, I--

99
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:04,502
M-Michi, it's you.

100
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,170
-[screaming]

101
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:07,471
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Wait,
I won't hurt you!

102
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,640
It's me, Takuya!

103
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:11,209
Don't you recognize me?

104
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:12,210
Huh?

105
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,312
My face!

106
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:16,547
No!

107
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:18,683
Come on, do it!

108
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,418
I want to be myself again!

109
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,753
Just turn me back!

110
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:23,921
Oh, that's great.

111
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,189
I'm stuck!

112
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:26,424
What do I do?

113
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,392
I can't go home looking like
some freaked out mutant.

114
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:30,094
-Mom, I'm back.

115
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:31,062
-Huh?

116
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:32,263
Wait a minute.

117
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,798
That's me!

118
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:36,200
I don't understand.

119
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:37,235
Huh?

120
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:41,105
This is-- oh, wow.

121
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:43,374
I'm going crazy.

122
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:44,442
This can't be possible.

123
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:49,313
YURIKO (OFFSCREEN): But honey,
you can't be late tonight.

124
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:50,982
It's Shinya's birthday.

125
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:52,984
-And tell Dad I want
something big!

126
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:54,151
A forklift!

127
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:55,653
YURIKO (OFFSCREEN): Mind
your manners, Shinya.

128
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:59,257
And don't even think about
eating that cake, Takuya.

129
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,958
Now, honey, I know that you're
busy, but how would you feel

130
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:02,126
if the kids didn't acknowledge
your birthday?

131
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:02,760
-Man, I'm bored.

132
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:03,794
My whole life is boring.

133
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:07,965
YURIKO (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
but that time, the kids

134
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:08,532
were away at camp.

135
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:09,767
Oh, come on--

136
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,537
-I don't know how,
but it's true.

137
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,339
This is the day I left.

138
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:19,443
I've come back on the same day
I left for the Digital World.

139
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,813
Mom, I-I remember now.

140
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:25,349
You had to wake me up, because
I'd overslept.

141
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:27,718
As usual.

142
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,353
Shinya.

143
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:31,889
We used to fight all the time,
didn't we, birthday boy?

144
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,861
Dad.

145
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:40,531
You promised that you'd play
soccer with me next weekend.

146
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:43,668
But I left.

147
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:45,002
Why?

148
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:50,508
I could've been at home with my
family, waiting for Shinya

149
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:55,846
to blow out the candles
on his stupid cake.

150
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:56,914
I never should've gone!

151
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:02,086
-5:40?

152
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,788
I'll never make it!

153
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:06,223
-What if I didn't make it?

154
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:08,759
If I don't get on the train,
then everything

155
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:11,128
will go back to normal!

156
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:13,764
I'll be me again!

157
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:15,733
Takuya, you've got
a train to miss!

158
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,474
Don't go!

159
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:24,308
-What?

160
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:25,409
OK.

161
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:30,114
Talk about talking
to yourself.

162
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:32,316
Oh, man, look at what
time it is.

163
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,451
I've gotta jam!

164
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:34,485
-Oh!

165
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:42,960
-The voice said my
destiny's coming.

166
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:44,328
What could that mean?

167
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:48,332
I guess I'll find out at
the train station.

168

[phone ringing]
-Hello?

171
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,003
Huh?

172
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:55,039
-Dad, the ball!

173
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:55,906
-Sorry.

174
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,540
The phone-- that noise!

175
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:01,312
-I'll get it!

176
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,713
Kids these days.

177
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,221
-Don't go.

178
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:16,394
Don't go!

179
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,236
-You OK?

180
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:30,274
-What?

181
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,042
Oh, no!

182
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:33,611
Hey, buddy, what time is it?

183
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:35,046
-What?

184
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:37,481
Uh, a couple before 5:45.

185
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:37,982
-Huh?

186
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,951
Oh!

187
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:44,321
-Hey, kid, where's the fire?

188
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,657
-I gotta figure out a better way
to stop myself, because I

189
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,492
won't stop!

190
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,827
But how?

191
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:52,663
I remember thinking if I
didn't make it, I was

192
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,465
going to miss out.

193
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:57,101
Yeah, miss out on hurting
my friends.

What now?

201
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,615
How can I stop myself if I can't
even think straight?

202
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,616
Don't go!

203
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:34,317
Takuya!

204
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:35,652
Don't go!

205
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,855
-Excuse me!

206
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:49,132
The train's already
on the platform!

Oh, I knew I should have asked
for more allowance!

-Huh?

210
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:03,146
A ticket?

211
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:04,180
Maybe this is destiny.

212
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:10,987
Wait!

213
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:12,889
My destiny!

-I'm out of time!

But I haven't gotten on
the elevator yet!

216

There's still a chance!

217
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,904
Good bye, Mom.

218
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:42,452
Hey, it's Kouji!

219
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:43,787
Wait a minute.

220
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,790
There's two Koujis?

221
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,959
Man, I'm really losing it.

222
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:51,661
He looks so much like him,
but that can't be Kouji.

223
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:58,501
If he's not, then who the
heck is that guy?

00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,662
Hey, wait!

-Huh?

230
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,452
It's the other Kouji!

So weird.

236

Were all these kids called
here the same way I was?

237

-It's already gone too far.

I gotta do something!

OK, here goes nothing.

-It's up to you now.

00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,218
Which one will you choose?

-Hey!

243
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:10,266
-Why do you think you're
here, Takuya?

-I--

-Answer me!

246
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,436
I wanna know why you're here!

-Guys.

252

Why did you guys get
on this train?

253
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:50,306
I mean, was it the message?

254
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,644
-Hey kid, this was the closest
train to the elevator, OK?

255
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,813
Now look, just leave me alone.

-Oh.

Jeez, sorry.

I'm just nervous.

259
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,685
But there must be a reason why
you picked this particular

260
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,554
train, right?

261
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:09,025
-I'm like him, it was closest
to the elevator.

So who are you?

-I'm--

267
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,334
I'm Tommy.

268
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:21,671
But I didn't want to
get on this train.

269
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:26,676
Why are kids always
picking on me?

They need me!

And I won't let you
get in the way!

306

I'm not afraid!

307

I'm not afraid of you!

-Well.

312
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,902
I didn't think I'd
see you again.

313
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:46,005
Thought you wanted to go home.

314
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:46,872
-I did.

315
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:48,374
I went home.

316
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,710
But it was the same,
and I wasn't.

317
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:54,847
I'd turned into this freak
show, because I couldn't

318
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:56,782
figure out who I was.

319
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:57,516
-I see.

320
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,784
-Kouji was right.

321
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,686
I didn't know why I was there.

322
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:02,087
But I do now.

323
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:03,956
Trailmon, you have
to take me back.

324
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,591
-Are you sure?

325
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:09,295
Seems to me that's what got you
here in the first place.

326
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:10,629
-Mm-hmm.

327
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,765
-This is a one way
ticket, kid.

328
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:16,268
I can't turn around if you
get any second thoughts.

329
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:17,603
-That's not gonna happen.

330
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,271
I made my decision.

331
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,240
-I guess you have.

332
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:23,175
All right, then.

333
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:24,276
All aboard.

-I love you, Mom and Dad.

Happy birthday, Shinya.

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,131
See you soon.

337
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:59,011
And Kouji, this time, things
will be different.

338
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:02,081
I know it's not a game now.

339
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:02,982
Hang on.

340
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:04,049
I'm coming.

341
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:08,420
I won't let you down--
any of you!

342
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:11,056
[yells]

343
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,395
-Sounds to me like you figured
things out there, kid.

344
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,731
-[yells]

345
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:19,732
-Not bad.

346
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:22,368
Not bad at all.

347
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:36,215
End of the line.

348
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:38,384
Or maybe not.

349
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,152
I think that's up to you.

350
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:41,287
Good luck.

351
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,794
-All right.

352
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:50,329
This is it.

353
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:51,764
Everything starts now.

354
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:55,501
I've got another chance, and
I'm not going to blow it!

355
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,936
RIKA NARRATING: Looks like
Takuya has finally grown up.

356
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:59,104
I just hope it isn't too late.

357
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:00,472
To find out, tune into the next

358
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:02,808
Digimon: Digital Monsters.
