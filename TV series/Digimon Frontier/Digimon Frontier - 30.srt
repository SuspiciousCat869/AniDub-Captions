NARRATOR: When we last left
Koji, he had Fusion Evolved

2
00:00:03,223 --> 00:00:06,126
into BeoWolfmon and was trying
to catch up with Duskmon.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,662
He wanted some answers from
the dark dude, but blondie

4
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:09,963
gave him the slip.

5
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:12,299
Meanwhile, while everyone was
celebrating the birth of

6
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:14,468
Patamon, Sakkakumon decided
to crash the party.

7
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:16,970
He used the gang's own attacks
against them so he could take

8
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:18,338
away their spirits.

9
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,141
It looked bad for our heroes
until Aldamon figured out that

10
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,644
by combining their attacks, they
might get the upper hand.

11
00:00:23,644 --> 00:00:26,113
Mixing up their attacks
mixed up Sakkakumon

12
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:27,581
and spelled his defeat.

13
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:28,715
Wow!

14
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:31,051
When these guys work together,
it really works.

to reclaim the Digital World.

19
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:49,036
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

20

by the lessons we've learned.

21

As we work towards one solution

22
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:02,282
through a Spirit Evolution.

23

Hi-ya-moo-ah!

24
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:04,785
Huh!

Hi-ya-moo-ah!

Forever united as one.

Through us let your
spirit evolve.

32
00:01:16,797 --> 00:01:21,268
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

33
00:01:21,268 --> 00:01:26,273
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

-Where did he go?

39
00:01:49,663 --> 00:01:50,831
Duskmon!

40
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:14,621
-Who are you?

41
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:17,724
-I could ask you the
same question.

42
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:19,960
DUSKMON (OFFSCREEN): Why
did you follow me?

43
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:23,597
-Because I felt I had to.

44
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,866
DUSKMON (OFFSCREEN): Your
presence is painful to me.

45
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:28,869
-Is that why you hide from
me in the shadows?

46
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:30,103
-It is not.

47
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:31,371
-Then why?

48
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:35,242
-Destiny.

49
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,610
-Destiny?

50
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,512
DUSKMON (OFFSCREEN): Darkness
hides from the light until it

51
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:40,213
is ready to destroy it.

52
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:43,717
You, warrior of light,
are my destiny.

53
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,385
Darkness will prevail.

54
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,321
Your light shall be
extinguished.

-At least we're mostly
all together.

I'd hate to be out
there alone.

-Me too.

61
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,462
-I bet it doesn't bother Koji.

62
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,198
-Well, yeah, if he's OK.

63
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:32,366
-Mhmm.

64
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,233
-Let's go.

65
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:33,734
Let's go.

00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,035
Let's go!

67
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:37,371
-We'd love too, but we kinda
have to know where.

68
00:03:37,404 --> 00:03:38,405
-Yes.

69
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:40,874
Let's not go rushing off
in all directions.

70
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:42,042
-You can do that?

71
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:43,343
-Let's see.

[shouting]

73
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:48,148

in this world

-Let's just pick a direction
and get moving.

-I pick this way!

77

-Works for me.

-Aw.

of curiosity down here!

I'm out of ideas.

What about you, Beetlemon?

-No joy.

86
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:09,911
Koji could be anywhere.

87
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,246
Or nowhere.

-Patamon.

90
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:18,553
You're too young to be flying
off on your own.

91
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,955
-You might get more
lost than us.

92
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:22,924
-But the light boy's this way.

93
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:23,525
-Huh?

00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:24,926
-The light boy.

The light boy, buddy!

-Is he saying light boy?

-Does he mean Koji?

99
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,705
-Yeah, but how would he know?

100
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:37,639
-Duh.

101
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:40,141
Because it's all bright
this way.

-I don't know, he seems pretty
sure of himself.

105
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,148
-Of course he's sure
of himself.

106
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:50,151
After all, Patamon was born
in Seraphimon's egg.

107
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:52,587
It wouldn't surprise me in the
least if he has some sort of

108
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,356
special powers.

109
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,691
And besides, he's my baby.

What did you expect?

00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:02,330
-Are we gonna stay
here or what?

-Beans, they've gone off
without us again.

-Oh, did you say they
have beans?

114

Ooh, beans will be really
good right now.

persistent, but

00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:32,827
they have interfered
for the last time.

120

-I'm just saying.

121
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:35,230
I didn't know anyone
could waddle and

122
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,998
fly at the same time.

123
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:39,334
-J.P., I can do anything
I want.

-Do you think maybe you could
do it a little faster?

-Sure, here goes.

126
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:43,972
Wee!

00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:45,807
-Yeah, wee.

-I'd hate to see him
in slow motion.

you if you point us in

the right direction.

-No way.

This is fun.

169
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:47,147
I'm not going to stay
stuck in this place

170
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:48,215
like a rat in a trap.

171
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:49,583
How about you guys?

172
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,851
Ready?

173
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:10,170
Execute, now!

174
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:13,640
Fusion Evolution!

175
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:15,642
-Execute!

176
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:16,910
Spirit Evolution!

177
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,833
-Aldamon!

178
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:47,808
-Kozemon!

179
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:56,783
-Beetlemon.

180
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:06,493
-Kumamon.

00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:09,496
-Atomic Inferno!

00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:10,964
-Tempest Twist!

183
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:12,966
-Thunder Fist!

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,234
-Frozen Tundra!

185
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:20,574
-Man, what's up with
this wall?

186
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:23,076
-With all of us working
together, we didn't even dent

187
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,378
this stupid thing.

188
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:28,048
-Gotta dig, gotta dig, gotta
dig, gotta dig, dig, dig.

189
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:29,549
-Blech.

190
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,550
-Playing in the dirt.

191
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,052
Isn't that cute?

192
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:32,886
-Patamon, really.

193
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,689
What on Earth are you doing?

194
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:38,258
-Silly, I'm trying
to dig a tunnel.

195
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,226
-A tunnel?

196
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:40,694
-Of course.

197
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:43,130
-If the wall is only
ground level--

198
00:11:43,163 --> 00:11:44,731
-Then we can dig
right under it.

199
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:48,235
-I take back everything I
said about him earlier.

200
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:49,970
-Ha ha.

201
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,371
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Patamon,
how clever of you.

202
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:53,874
I'm so proud of you,
I could just cry.

203
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:54,508
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): I forget.

204
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,342
Which one are you?

205
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,810
The momma or the poppa?

206
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:59,646
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): That's
actually a good question.

207
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,116
-Duskmon, it is time for you to
remember the day you came

208
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,085
to the Digital World.

209
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:06,753
Allow me to assist you.

210
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:15,929
-Argh!

211
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:19,533
Hello.

212
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,735
Is someone here?

213
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:23,036
Anyone?

214
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:28,175
P-Poppa?

215
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,377
You are my dad, right?

216
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:31,878
Poppa, I--

217
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:38,885
Grandma?

218
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:40,120
Grandma!

219
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:48,862
Koji.

220
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,365
You're Koji, right?

221
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:52,099
Koji.

222
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,767
I wanted to meet you.

223
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,269
I know you don't know me, and
I know it sounds a little

224
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:59,840
weird, but I know you.

225
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,441
No, don't go!

226
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,943
Koji, don't leave me!

227
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,423
Why won't anyone pay
attention to me?

228
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:18,291
Pay attention to me.

229
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,794
-You have my attention, boy.

230
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:23,096
The darkness in your heart
drew me straight to you.

231
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:26,700
Your loneliness and sadness,
your angry soul.

232
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,568
It's like honey to me.

233
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:31,671
Sweet, pained darkness.

234
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:33,006
-Darkness?

235
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,307
-I like you.

236
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:39,012
-Who are you?

237
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,381
-I am the one who will
set you free.

238
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:45,385
I will release the darkness in
your heart, and it will give

239
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:47,020
you great power.

240
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,991
You will become one with this
spirit of darkness.

[screaming]

242
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:57,397
-It hurts because you
still remember your

243
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:58,398
pathetic human heart.

244
00:13:58,398 --> 00:13:59,399
Let go.

245
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,303
Let its darkness
fill your soul.

246
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,773
This time, your heart shall
not trouble you.

247
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:19,352
Yes.

248
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:20,587
Now you see.

249
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:22,422
You are a creature
of darkness.

250
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:23,924
My creature.

251
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:25,659
With this spirit, you
will become a

252
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:27,360
true warrior of darkness.

253
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:32,332
You will not have to fear the
light, Duskmon, ever again.

254
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:35,068
-Duskmon Slide Evolution,
Velgemon!

-What are you?

00:14:57,757 --> 00:14:59,826
-Yeah, baby!

257
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:01,061
-Really?

258
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,265
VELGEMON (OFFSCREEN): Roar!

259
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:15,942
-W-what was that?

260
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:16,910
-Something big.

261
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:18,211
-Something big, he says.

262
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,813
How about huge?

263
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:21,515
That can't be a Digimon.

264
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:22,749
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Of course
it can, young man.

265
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:25,385
Haven't you learned anything
in this world?

266
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:29,623
Have you forgotten Sakkakumon
so soon?

267
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:30,557
-I haven't.

268
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:31,458
Let's get going.

269
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:32,826
We gotta help Koji.

270
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:40,823
-Velgemon.

271
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,093
It is time to make this a
world of true darkness.

272
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,095
Destroy the light.

273
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,396
-Velgemon?

274
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:58,074
-Light.

275
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,909
Enemy.

276
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,044
Destroy light!

-Why isn't it ever just
an earthquake?

281
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,042
-But Koji's there.

282

-Koji!

-Wait, wait, wait.

284
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,284
Wait.

285
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:29,465
-Koji.

Destroy!

must remember now.

Remember.

291
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:14,343
Remember your life in the
human world, Velgemon.

292
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,811
-What does she mean?

The human world?

294

Could that thing
still be human?

What is it, grandma?

Koichi.

303

You have a brother.

304

You must find Koji.
