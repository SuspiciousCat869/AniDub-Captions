NARRATOR: After a wild and
watery ride on a Trailmon, our

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,038
heroes found themselves trapped
in an underground

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,707
cavern with a very
unhappy Whamon.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,676
Unfortunately, Arbormon and
Grumblemon had figured out

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,179
where they were, and decided
to wage another attack.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,348
Grumblemon unleashed an angry
horde of Golemon, and it

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,817
looked like the DigiDestined
were doomed!

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,820
Then Whamon blasted Grumblemon
and coughed up a spirit that

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,188
he had accidentally munched
before he was

10
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,389
sucked into the cave.

11
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,492
JP's Beast Spirit evolved
into the mighty warrior

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,862
MetalKabuterimon and wiped out
the grouchy Grumblemon once

13
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,163
and for all!

14
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,164
THEME SONG: Digimon!

00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:36,670
[theme music playing]

16
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:40,274
THEME SONG: Look to the past as
we head for the future to

17
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:44,111
reclaim the Digital World.

18
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,081
With faith in ourselves, and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,584
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:57,558
As we work towards
one solution,

21
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,892
through a spirit evolution!

22
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,433
Digimon!

23
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,802
Forever united as one.

24
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,070
Digimon!

25
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,806
Together the battles are won.

26
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,007
Digimon!

27
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,610
Though us let your
spirit evolve.

28
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:20,514
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:24,651
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all!

30
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,956
Digimon!

31
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,166
[shouting]

32
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,968
-Just look at him.

33
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,569
How pathetic.

34
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,539
-I told you, he's all mouth,
no moxy, sugar.

35
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:50,077
-Methinks that his tongue doth
far outstrip his technique.

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,045
-That's what I just said,
you shiny twit.

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,213
But that's not the point.

38
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,215
The point is it's
up to us now.

39
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:58,852
-Thou mayest not dampen my
enthusiasm, queen of puddles.

40
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,554
I remain your loyal ally.

41
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,390
-Then why don't you prove it?

42
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,524
Find Arbormon.

43
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,959
He's thick-headed, but useful.

44
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,695
I don't have time for
his nonsense.

45
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,199
-Methinks this mere subterfuge,
my drizzly damsel.

46
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,202
-Mercurymon, try speaking
English.

47
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,939
-Shalt thou listen to make a
change, my lady, I will tell

48
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,274
you what you wish not to hear.

49
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,611
It is thine lack of a beast
spirit that doth

50
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,747
truly plague thy mind.

51
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,282
-What are you trying to say?

52
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,319
-I'm saying you're scared,
you murky headed nit!

53
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,789
You're afraid you'll end up
just like Grumblemon.

54
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,090
-That's ridiculous!

55
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,759
I think you've polished
your face one

56
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,460
too many times, sugar.

57
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,129
Of all the nerve!

58
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,966
How dare you compare me to that
incompetent rockhead!

59
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,869
-I dare because I know
it to be true.

60
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,270
-Your brain is rusting.

61
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,373
Those whiny children will
never defeat me!

62
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,809
The little darlings will beg
me to take their spirits

63
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,144
before I'm done.

64
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,378
-Hm.

65
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,546
Do as you wish, my lady.

66
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,819
-I always do as I wish, and he's
just plain wrong about me

67
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,853
being afraid.

68
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:15,362
But that metal head Mercurymon
is right about one thing.

69
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,597
I might as well be a silly lawn
sprinkler for all the

70
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,200
damage I can do without
my Beast Spirit.

71
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,235
But where can it be hiding?

72
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,071
My loyal fans have searched
everywhere.

73
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,772
I've searched everywhere.

74
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:26,339
Rivers, nothing.

75
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,407
Streams, nothing.

76
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,443
Ponds, nothing, nothing,
nothing.

77
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,578
It's really quite
embarrassing.

78
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,215
Honestly, even three of those
bratty babies have Beast

79
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,051
Spirits, and I, the queen of the
seas, the darling of the

80
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,586
deep, the prettiest pearl
in the ocean's

81
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,089
oyster, I have nothing.

82
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,757
I have shame and despair.

83
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:44,758
[beeping]

84
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:45,725
I haven't looked there.

85
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,261
This puts a whole new
spin on things.

86
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,931
Now to find a local
devoted fan club.

87
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,766
Oh, this is simply divine.

88
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,802
Those boys would trade their
tailfeathers for a wink.

89
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,805
They can search for my
Beast Spirit for me.

90
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,241
Oh, how I adore being adored.

91
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,176
It's so much nicer
than working.

92
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,316
See ya, buddy!

93
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,284
-Aloha!

94
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,619
-Ciao, Whamon!

95
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,827
-So, there he goes.

96
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,230
-Nice of you to point
out the obvious.

97
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,231
-Don't be such boys!

98
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,800
-My dear Zoe, that has
gotten into you?

99
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,536
-You can't blame a girl for
feeling good on such a

100
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,405
beautiful day, especially a girl
who has her Spirit back.

101
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,075
-And let us not forget who
has a Beast Spirit now!

102
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,877
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Let's
hear it for JP, the

103
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,378
princely beast of thunder!

104
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,681
JP (OFFSCREEN): And Zoe,
princess of the summer breeze.

105
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,016
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): And
Takuya, king of

106
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,551
I'm gonna be sick.

107
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,019
-Did you hear that?

108
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,054
-We're standing right here
beside you, geek boy.

109
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,389
Of course we heard it.

110
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,590
-The Beast Spirit!

111
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,726
-Ranamon will be so happy.

112
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,397
-Thanks, boys.

[swooning]

114
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:05,105
-She might even come to our
island and visit us!

115
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,642
She'll be so happy, she might
even talk to us, with those

116
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,945
beautiful lips, and that
cute, cute, cute voice.

117
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,979
Oh!

118
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,615
Cute voice.

We love you, Ranamon!

124
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,800
L-O-V-E, love, love, love you!

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,438
-Ah, what a night.

126
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,040
What a night!

127
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,176
-And just think how happy she'll
be if we give her that

128
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,010
Beast Spirit.

129
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,045
She'll come here
and sing to us.

130
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,180
She might even kiss us!

131
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,548
-Dream on, doofus.

132
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,350
Just how do you plan to get
the Beast Spirit away from

133
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,885
those kids?

134
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,820
-Yeah, there are a lot of them,
and they're awfully big.

135
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,523
Isn't there an easier
way to get a kiss?

136
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,357
-Chicken heart.

137
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,658
I got everything covered.

138
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,102
-You know, I can't help but
notice that it's summer, and

139
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,403
we're at a beach.

140
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,938
-I noticed that.

141
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,006
-Yeah.

142
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,507
You know what that means?

143
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,775
-Summer vacation!

144
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,414
-The waves!

145
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,717
-Shell hunting!

146
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,919
-Lots of sunshine!

147
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,120
-Yeah!

148
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,122
Put it all together, and
what do you got?

149
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,624
The beach, baby!

150
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,225
-Takuya, aren't you forgetting
something?

151
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,427
We're supposed to be
on a mission here.

152
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,563
We'd be stupid to let
our guard down.

153
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,265
-Come on, you gotta
lighten up, buddy.

154
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,233
-Hey!

155
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,335
-Yeah, stop being
a party pooper.

156
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,070
-Wait, wait, don't!

157
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,071
I'm not, guys.

158
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:45,639
I--

159
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:46,806
I just think that--

160
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,507
-Yes, you are.

161
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,908
You're being pooey.

162
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,477
-Stop it! Huh?

163
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,145
-It can't hurt to take
a short break.

164
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,480
We've earned it.

165
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,314
-Zoe's right.

166
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,982
We have earned it.

167
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:56,983
-Fine, whatever.

168
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,452
I'm obviously outnumbered
here.

169
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,320
-That's it, then.

170
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,354
All in favor, say I!

171
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,956
-Aye, aye!

172
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:03,438
-Oh!

173
00:07:03,438 --> 00:07:05,892
-Oh, indeed. Look.

174
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,998
-Whoa.

175
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,066
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): What's
summer vacation

176
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,701
without a beach house?

177
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,636
-This is a little
too convenient.

178
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,371
-I don't know about that, but
it sure looks awfully

179
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,706
comfortable.

180
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,740
-Welcome!

181
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,245
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, goody.

182
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,513
It's the Toucanmon.

183
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,548
Gaudy looking creatures,
but very timid.

184
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,384
Their attack is Crazy Crest.

185
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,253
Sounds rather silly,
doesn't it?

186
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,389
-Honored guests, we welcome
you to Toucan Paradise.

187
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,058
-Thank you, Mr. Toucanmon.

188
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,559
We're honored you're honored.

189
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,729
-Yeah, we're honored,
but we're broke.

190
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,730
-Oh, please.

191
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,565
What's a few DigiShackles
among friends?

192
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,866
And it just so happens
that today,

193
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,868
everything is on the house.

194
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:49,936
By which I mean free.

195
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,372
Not served on the roof.

196
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,774
-We know what it means.

197
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,109
-Sorry! So sorry!

198
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,444
It was just a small joke.

199
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,278
Very small.

200
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,579
-It's OK.

201
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,947
-No, no, no.

202
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,449
We are humiliated.

203
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,118
There is absolutely nothing we
won't do to make it up to you.

204
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,287
-Oh, wow, really?

205
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,624
-Really, really, really,
double really!

206
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,293
TOUCANMON (OFFSCREEN):
A little of this.

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,462
-A smidge of that, and--

208
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,963
-Ladies and gentlemen--

209
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,198
-Your lunch is served.

210
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,466
-Whoa!

211
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,867
All right!

212
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,870
What are we waiting for?

213
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,338
-Let's dig in!

214
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,106
-Yeah!

215
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:26,840
Where do we start?

216
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,312
Delicious!

217
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,047
-Oh, man!

218
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,216
I am so enjoying these
overcooked ramen noodles with

219
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,985
rubbery egg!

220
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,854
-Mm, mm, mm.

221
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,890
This is the best lumpy
curry I've ever had.

222
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:44,858
-You're weird.

223
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,027
Is that supposed to
be a complement?

224
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,361
-Dude, don't you get it?

225
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,697
It's real food, like home, not
some kind of crazy, meat

226
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,198
tasting rabbit food.

227
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,434
-Every bit of it looks
exactly like what it

228
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,102
is, lumps and all!

229
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,071
Besides, it's a beach
house, buddy.

230
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,573
The food could have sand, and
bugs and stuff all over it,

231
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,075
and nobody would care!

232
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,743
-Bring on the bugs!

233
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,378
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): And sand!

234
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,112
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
And stuff.

235
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,213
Bring on the stuff!

236
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,387
-You ate a lot.

237
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,588
-I'm eating for two now.

238
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:16,723
My selfish days are over.

239
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,559
If I must pig out,
then so be it.

240
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,560
-It was wonderful!

241
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,561
-Don't mention it.

242
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,763
It was our pleasure.

243
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:27,100
-My tummy feels like a melon.

244
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,468
-Tommy, did you get enough?

245
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,335
-Mm-hm.

246
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,639
-Oh, enough, and more!

247
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,841
-Well, I guess it's
time to split.

248
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,476
-Wha?

249
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,311
-We've imposed enough
on you already.

250
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,979
-Go on, impose!

251
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,448
-Please, we're begging
you, here.

252
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,949
Impose, already.

253
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,151
-Thanks, but we're
stuffed as ticks.

254
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,319
-But you're growing kids.

255
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,154
It won't be long before
you're hungry again.

256
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,656
What kind of hosts would
we be if we let you

257
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,157
leave without supper?

258
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:51,958
-Supper?

259
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,659
Are you nuts?

260
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,160
I won't be hungry for hours.

261
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,229
I might never eat again!

262
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,299
-You say that now, but after
being in the sun--

263
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,235
I'm sure you will agree with
me, and might I suggest you

264
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,905
take advantage of our super
value summer special.

265
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,040
-Huh?

266
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,712
-What he's saying is free beach
rentals for everybody!

267
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,580
-Man!

268
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,547
-Wow!

269
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,082
-Man, check this out!

270
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,219
-Wow, look at that!

271
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,888
-Complimentary baskets are
available for your valuables,

272
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,756
so just go out and
have a good time.

273
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,091
Leave the worrying to us.

274
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,795
-Banzai!

275
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,968
-Now this is the life!

276
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,703
Hey, are you sure you don't
want to race me, Tommy?

277
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,971
I'll give you a 10
innertube start!

278
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:38,605
Come on!

279
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,774
-Naw, I'm on vacation.

280
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,276
-Are my ears getting burned?

281
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,277
-Why worry?

282
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,746
Your brain's already cooked.

283
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,580
Huh?

284
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:48,481
I don't see Zoe.

285
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,916
Have we lost one?

286
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,950
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Mm.

287
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,860
[giggling]

288
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:20,847
[humming]

289
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,181
-Hm?

290
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,051
Now, in this one I'd look
like a race queen.

291
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:28,054
The stripes are nice, but
white is so boring.

292
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,523
Well, this is kind of cool.

293
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,159
Super athlete!

294
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,360
then again, maybe not.

295
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,196
It's not really a fun in
the sun sort of suit.

296
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,165
Next!

297
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,734
Que bella, but not much there.

298
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,270
Hm, now this one's nice.

299
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:48,241
In fact, it's just perfect!

300
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:54,080
[humming]

301
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,748
-Hm?

302
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,417
Huh?

00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,752
[screaming]

304
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,087
-Huh?

305
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,725
-Zoe, what's wrong?

306
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,660
-Are you OK?

307
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,895
[screaming]

308
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,764
-Get out, get out, get out!

[shouting]

310
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,137
-I am so sorry.

311
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,505
-So, what happened?

312
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,174
Why did you scream before?

313
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,842
-Because someone's
a peeping Tom.

314
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,143
-You're kidding!

315
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:24,844
-Let me at the creep.

316
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,812
How dare he.

317
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,447
-Hm.

318
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,348
-Hm.

319
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,148
-Hm?

320
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,984
-Mm-hm.

321
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,485
-What are you all lookin'
at me for, huh?

322
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:32,986
Huh?

323
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,287
Huh?

324
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,822
-You must admit, it
looks suspicious.

325
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,957
After all, you are the
most likely culprit.

326
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,826
-Mm-hm.

327
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:40,994
-He makes a good point, JP.

328
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,296
Why don't you just admit it?

329
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,398
-Because I just didn't
do it, that's why!

330
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,667
-Come on, guys. it couldn't
have been JP.

331
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,036
He was swimming with us the
whole time, remember?

332
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,371
-I forgot.

333
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,207
-We all have the same alibi.

334
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,243
-Then by the process of
elimination, it was no one?

335
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,045
-Are you calling Zoe a liar?

336
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,680
-Now, of course not, JP.

337
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,181
It's obviously we're
not alone here.

338
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,017
-Of course we're not
alone, Einstein.

339
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,251
Did you forget the Toucanmon?

340
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,525
-Where'd they all go?

341
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,059
-Now, this is

342
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:17,530
suspicious -Oh, no!

343
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,565
The bird boys tricked us.

344
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,701
-Oh, man.

345
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,603
-My detector's gone.

346
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,771
-Oh, man.

347
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,105
Mine's gone, too.

348
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,874
This is awful.

349
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,243
-This goes well beyond
awful, young man.

350
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,612
How could you let those
Toucanmon trick you like that?

351
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,413
-Stop it.

352
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,647
They fooled all of us.

353
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,782
-That's right!

354
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,286
[awkward shouting]

355
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,589
BOYS (OFFSCREEN): Get out,
get out, get out!

356
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:48,528
[laughter]

357
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,129
-That was almost too easy.

358
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,265
Those silly kids never
had a chance.

359
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,866
We finally proved ourselves
worthy of

360
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,201
our ravishing Ranamon.

361
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:59,539
-(SINGING) Ah, Ranamon,
the ravishing!

362
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,175
-All right, hold it right
there, you thieves!

363
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,476
-Uh-oh.

364
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,511
-Just what do you mean by
Ranamon the ravishing?

365
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,713
Huh?

366
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,315
-Give our detectors back
to us right now!

367
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,717
-No way, no how.

368
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,853
These little babies are our
ticket to a date with Ranamon.

369
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,022
-Take it from me, you
guys are delusional.

370
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,056
Now give them back.

371
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:17,890
-Mm-hm.

372
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,192
-You can't make us.

373
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,526
Now, scram.

374
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,595
-Maybe we should scram.

375
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,529
-Scramming!

376
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:23,996
-Wait!

377
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,198
Come back here!

378
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,866
-This is so dumb.

379
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,940
-That doesn't look good.

380
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,877
-Oh, dear.

381
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,747
It's Ranamon.

382
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,716
-Hi, y'all.

383
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,285
-She's the warrior of water,
and very evil.

384
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,587
-Well, of course see is.

385
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,789
-She sure has lousy timing.

386
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,257
-What a pleasant surprise.

387
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,494
I have so looked forward
to seeing y'all again.

388
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,163
I'd hoped to have my Beast
Spirit to show you first, but

389
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,264
everything happens
for a reason.

390
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,500
We can't have everything.

391
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,302
Just be good little children
and hand over your spirits.

392
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,805
I'd love to stay and chat, but
frankly, you bore me to tears.

393
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,241
Now, how's that sound?

394
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:08,808
-Hmph!

395
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,643
Sounds stupid to me.

396
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,945
-But we don't have
our detectors.

397
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,181
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): I'll
handle her.

398
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,783
-Zoe.

399
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:17,950
-Don't worry, JP.

400
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,119
I'll take care of
her in no time.

401
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,154
-Goodie, goodie.

402
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:25,024
This is going to be a treat.

403
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,994
[muffled groans]

404
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,295
-Oh, man.

405
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,663
This was supposed to
be a vacation!

406
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,231
-This is very, very bad.

407
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,567
As long as she's near water,
her offensive power is

408
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,202
exponentially enhanced!

409
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,904
-I'm guessing that's
a bad thing?

410
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,905
-I just said that.

411
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,906
Didn't I just say that?

412
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,140
-I don't know.

413
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,875
-Water woman sure has
a nasty temper.

414
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,077
-Zoe, you can't!

415
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,513
-Look, I haven't been able
to Spirit Evolve.

416
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,514
I need to make up
for lost time.

417
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:52,051
-Oh, goodie, goodie!

418
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,388
-I've never felt this
helpless before.

419
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,391
-Just leave it to me!

420
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:05,698
[music playing]

421
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,900
-Execute!

422
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,268
Spirit Evolution!

423
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,119
Ha!

424
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,454
Kazemon!

425
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,626
-Sugar, do you think you
can take me on alone?

426
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,794
-That's a silly question.

427
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,462
Of course I do, sugah.

428
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,630
-So now you're gonna mock me?

429
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,965
-I wouldn't dream of it.

430
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,266
I'd rather fight!

431
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,009
-Don't you want to play
with me anymore?

432
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,426
-Look, Ranamon!

433
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,938
-Over here, we're over
here, Ranamon!

434
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,645
I think I'm gonna faint.

435
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:18,004
TOUCANMON (OFFSCREEN):
She's so beautiful.

436
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,840
So sweet, so perfect.

437
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,074
-Enough dancing.

438
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,043
We have to get the Beast
Spirit to her.

439
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,077
-Let's hurry.

440
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,212
She'll be so pleased with us.

441
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,413
We'll give her the
Beast Spirit, and

442
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,315
then she'll kiss us.

443
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,918
-Ah.

444
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,052
-Whipping Waves!

-Hurricane Wing!

446
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,897
-Well, you're actually
pretty good at this.

447
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,065
-Oh, Ranamon.

448
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,067
That means so little
coming from you.

449
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,201
-You little brat.

450
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,370
I'm going to take you
apart wing by wing.

451
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,213
-Go, Ranamon, go, Ranamon,
go, Ranamon, go, go!

452
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,481
-Feeling a little more polite?

453
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,921
What's that calling to me?

454
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,325
Could it be?

455
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,927
Out of my way, brat!

456
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:15,628
-Oh, great.

457
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,662
What's she up to now?

458
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,773
-It really is my Beast Spirit.

459
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,476
And the little thing actually
looks happy to see me!

460
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,716
Beast Spirit Evolution!

461
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,719
Ha ha ha!

462
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,687
It's all over now, honey!

463
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,689
Too bad, I was actually
starting to

464
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,725
enjoy our little spat.

465
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:46,892
-What's happening?

466
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:51,897
RANAMON (OFFSCREEN): Ready
or not, here I am!

467
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,066
In all of my radiant beauty.

468
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,868
Aren't you impressed?

469
00:18:55,935 --> 00:19:00,006
[groaning]

470
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,843
-I can see by your faces you
still need convincing.

471
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,780
Maybe you just need a closer
look at sweet Calmaramon.

472
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,782
I'm just happy to oblige!

473
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:14,220
[laughter]

474
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,431
[laughter]

475
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,100
-I think I'm gonna be too busy
for the Ranamon fan club from

476
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,934
now on.

477
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,270
-Yeah, me too.

478
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,606
TOUCANMON (OFFSCREEN):
Me three.

479
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,940
TOUCANMON (OFFSCREEN): And to
think, we almost had to go on

480
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,510
a date with her.

481
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,145
-That Kazemon was
kind of cute.

482
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,247
-Definitely cute.

483
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,748
-That is one ugly--

484
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,683
-She is not very nice, either.

485
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,018
-And she smells awful.

486
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,119
Did you notice that?

487
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,354
-Who do you think you are?

488
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:52,191
You can't insult Calmaramon
and get away with it!

489
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,526
-Whoa!

490
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,499
-I'm so sorry, sugar pie!

491
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,501
Are you not enjoying
our little dance?

492
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,469
Too bad!

493
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,471
Maybe I should turn
up the music.

494
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,806
-Zoe, look out!

495
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,840
-Ta ta, honey!

496
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,081
-Titanic Tempest!

497
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:18,050
[shouting]

498
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:22,388
This can't be happening!

499
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,924
-Uh--

500
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,258
-OK.

501
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,193
-Whoa!

502
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,863
Don't you know who I am?

503
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,399
-Um, what just happened here?

504
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,568
-I'm guessing that Ranamon
isn't any better at

505
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,570
controlling her Beast
Spirit than you lot.

506
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,038
-Well, then I'm guessing--

507
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,906
-We're OK!

508
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,309
-Guys, what happened
to the Toucanmon?

509
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,310
-Oh, no.

510
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,778
They're gone.

511
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:46,378
-Rats!

512
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,114
I forgot all about them.

513
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,449
-Those feathered fanboys still
have our detectors.

514
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,451
-The way they waddle, they
couldn't have gotten too far.

515
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,621
-Well, then let's go get 'em!

516
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,790
NARRATOR: About time these guys
caught a break, but I

517
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,925
wouldn't depend on it
if I were them.

518
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,852
Keep watching Digimon,
Digital Monsters!
