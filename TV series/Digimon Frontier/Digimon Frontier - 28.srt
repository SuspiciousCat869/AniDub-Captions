00:00:01,197 --> 00:00:02,999
NARRATOR: Koji and Takuya were
still stuck inside that

2
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:04,868
bug-eyed Sakkakumon.

3
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:07,670
Zoe, JP and Tommy Spirit Evolved
to help them, but they

4
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:08,671
couldn't get back inside.

5
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:10,673
Unfortunately, Dusmon did.

6
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:13,042
Desperate to determine his
connection with Koji, he

7
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:15,345
squeezed Koji's memories
about his dad and

8
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:16,846
step-mom out of him.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,148
Duskmon was about to destroy
Koji when Bokomon's baby

10
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:21,150
unleashed a new power source.

11
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:23,887
Lobomon and KendoGarurumon
Fusion Spirit Evolved into

12
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:25,655
BeoWolfmon!

13
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:28,424
Meanwhile, Takuya battled and
beat IceLeomon, but couldn't

14
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,827
get to Koji in time to help.

15
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,362
THEME SONG: Digimon!

16
00:00:32,428 --> 00:00:37,333
[theme music]

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,603
THEME SONG: We look to the past
as we head for the future

18
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:44,741
to reclaim the Digital World.

19
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:49,078
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

20
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:51,381
by the lessons we've learned.

21
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:57,921
As we work towards one solution

22
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:59,255
through a Spirit Evolution.

23
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:03,259
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

24
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:04,260
Huh!

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,261
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

26
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:06,496
Digimon!

27
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:09,232
Forever united as one.

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,466
Digimon!

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,236
Together the battles are won.

30
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:14,470
Digimon!

31
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,473
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

32
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:20,977
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

33
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:26,104
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

34
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:26,816
Ha-ya-moo-ah! Huh!

35
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:28,117
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

36
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:29,352
Digimon!

37
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:35,825
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Ugh, this
is driving me crazy.

38
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:38,161
Why I can't I get out of
this stupid place?

39
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:40,530
I can't even tell which
is up anymore.

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,031
Oh, who am I kidding?

41
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:44,567
I don't know which way is up,
down, sideways, inside out, or

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,971
any other kind of way
in this darn maze.

43
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:49,072
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN):
Precisely.

44
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:53,376
[laughter]

45
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:55,078
Trapped like the rat thou art.

46
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:57,213
Methinks it's time for the
cat to have his sport.

47
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,190
-Huh?

48
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:08,191
Ay-yi-yi.

49
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:09,559
Which is the right one?

50
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:19,202
Huh?

51
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:24,440
Whoa!

52
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:26,109
Great choice, Takuya!

53
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,419
I can't believe I
survived that.

54
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:39,122
Huh?

55
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:41,424
Jeez, how many mirrors
does one world need?

56
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,866
Just a mirror.

57
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,334
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN):
Or is it?

58
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:52,935
-Huh?

59
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,003
Mercurymon!

60
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,340
What do you want?

61
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,008
-Just a trifle, really.

62
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,711
To defeat thee, destroy
thy companions,

63
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,179
and claim this world.

64
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,515
But first, I have
a little secret.

65
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:06,549
-Hey.

66
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:07,517
Do you think this would bounce?

67
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,217
-Ugh.

68
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:10,820
Give me that.

69
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:12,188
Do you think this will bounce.

70
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:13,256
You nincompoop.

71
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:15,758
-Zoe?

72
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,427
Are you OK?

73
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,830
-I'm just wondering if we can
get in there and help Takuya,

74
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:22,498
and if he'll ever make
it out without us.

75
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:23,733
-Look!

76
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,001
Something's happening.

77
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,402
JP (OFFSCREEN): Something's
always happening, kid.

78
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:27,094
-Huh?

79
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:27,837
Takuya!

80
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:28,938
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN):
Not just Takuya.

81
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:32,375
Check it out!

82
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:34,410
-Keep your stupid secret,
metal brain.

83
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,379
It's time you and I
went head to head.

84
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:38,748
I've been itching to defeat
you since day one.

85
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:41,751
-If only thy mouth were thy
weapon, then surely thou

86
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:43,386
couldst never be defeated.

87
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,588
-Enough talking!

88
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:47,223
-Eager to perish?

89
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:50,393
For truly, there is no other
option, if thou art so foolish

90
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:51,894
as to face me alone.

91
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:54,497
Thou hast days of experience
with this world.

92
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,399
I have a lifetime.

93
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:59,302
My knowledge could fill a book,
and of course, chapter

94
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:01,637
one would begin with an
attention catching surprise.

95
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:04,507
Like this.

96
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,642
Impressive, is it not?

97
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:09,479
Thou couldst never hope to
move with such speed.

98
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,782
Thou art doomed to failure
before thou even starts.

99
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:14,350
-Oh, yeah?

100
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,185
Huh?

101
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:18,287
Man, you sure like
to talk a lot.

102
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,989
Must be because you're
too afraid to clam

103
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,159
up and fight me.

104
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,060
All right, fine.

105
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:25,328
I get your little joke.

106
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:30,399
I guess you're ready
for a fight, then!

107
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,372
Huh?

108
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:38,708
[laughter]

109
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,210
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN): I see
thou hath reached chapter two,

110
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:45,081
about the futility of sparring
with me in mine own world.

111
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:47,383
Here I can move with
ease from any

112
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:48,918
polished surface to another.

113
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:51,554
I can dodge thy punches,
strike without warning.

114
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:52,555
Look around thyself.

115
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:54,557
I can be anywhere.

116
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:55,892
Even right behind thee.

117
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:00,930
[laughter]

118
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:02,198
AGUNIMON (OFFSCREEN):
Quit cheating!

119
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,933
Come out and fight like a
man, fair and square.

120
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,101
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN):
Peek-a-boo.

121
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:05,535
-Ah-ha!

122
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:07,603
There you are.

123
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:11,107
-What's fair for me
is deadly to thee.

124
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,076
And so is this.

125
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,646
See if thou can dodge these.

126
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:17,980
Dance for me, fool!

127
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:27,623
Ha ha ha!

128
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:31,627
Chapter three, the so-called
hero runs for his life, even

129
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:33,429
though there is no escape.

130
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,498
I am everywhere in this world.

131
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:39,335
Here I have absolute power,
and thou hast nothing!

132
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:41,003
Well, 'tis not quite true.

133
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:42,505
Thou hast the chance
to be destroyed.

134
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:43,550
Ha ha ha!

135
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,162
-You're the one who's
going down!

136
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:52,144
Come out and fight!

137
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:53,379
-Very well.

138
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:01,354
Then chapter four shall be about
how I crush thee like a

139
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,689
boot crushes the tiniest bug.

140
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:05,858
Oh-ho!

141
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:06,926
No!

142
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:18,404
Nice try, but breaking mirrors
will only bring thee bad luck.

143
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:20,740
-I have plenty of bad luck
to send your way.

144
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,609
You're going to find that I'm
more than you bargained for.

145
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:24,710
-Heh.

146
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:27,413
-So let me start by
heating things up.

147
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,380
Pyro Punch!

148
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:31,217
-Didst thou forget this?

149
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,753
-Dark Reflection!

150
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:35,888
A taste of thine own medicine.

151
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,157
[screaming]

152
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,063
-Now, follow me to
the next chapter.

153
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,631
-What for?

154
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:47,733
-'Tis time to bear witness
before thou art defeated.

155
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,139
-How about I defeat
you, first?

156
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,312
-Plan to sneak up on
me, didst thou?

157
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:05,885
-Know nothing know it all!

158
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,324
[screaming]

159
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:17,363
-Where am I now?

160
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:19,231
How many places are there
in this stupid place?

161
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:27,740
Whoa.

162
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:31,877
Is this what he wanted
to show me?

163
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,546
Aw, who am I kidding?

164
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:36,348
I'm sure whatever it is is gonna
be a lot less pretty,

165
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:38,350
and a lot more painful.

166
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:39,718
All right, Mercurymon.

167
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,187
Let's get this over with!

168
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:44,890
Mercurymon!

169
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,928
[organ sounds]

170
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,029
-Come on.

171
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,031
Aren't you sick of hiding
from me yet?

172
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,265
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN):
Who's hiding?

173
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,467
-Stop doing that!

174
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:57,937
-My aren't thou jumpy?

175
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,907
One might accidentally get the
notion that thou art afraid.

176
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:05,444
-Quit messing around, or I'll
burn this place down!

177
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:09,081
-Very well, but surely thou
can ask nicer than that.

178
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,115
-Quit stalling!

179
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:19,792
-Huh?

180
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:23,495
-Chapter five, Revelation.

181
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:25,531
-It's Seraphimon.

182
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,499
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN):
Very good.

183
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:30,836
It seems thou art not quite
as dull as I thought.

184
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,338
AGUNIMON (OFFSCREEN): But
that's not possible.

185
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:33,339
He was turned into a Digi-Egg!

186
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:37,877
-Strike of the Seven Stars!

187
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:43,015
-It's impossible!

188
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:45,351
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN): How
little thou knowest of the

189
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:46,585
Digital World.

190
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:48,187
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Seraphimon?

191
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:49,321
-It can't be.

192
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:51,357
I mean, it can't be, right?

193
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:54,159
-It's probably another one
for Mercurymon's tricks.

194
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:57,563
-My eyes are stuck.

195
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:59,832
-Release him now!

196
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,601
-Alas, 'tis not really
a him to release.

197
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:04,570
-What do you mean?

198
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:06,872
-'Tis only a shadow,
a copy of his data.

199
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:09,708
But, if thou insist.

200
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:13,245
It need not be restrained
for me to use it thus.

201
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:39,138
-No!

202
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,306
This can't be!

203
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:42,107
-But it is.

204
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:46,011
I have become more powerful
than thou canst imagine.

205
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,348
I am ShadowSeraphimon!

206
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:53,652
Wish to fight me now,
pathetic whelp?

207
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,987
Ha ha ha!

208
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:04,042
Prepare for thy doom.

209
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:07,946
-People keep saying that,
but I'm still around.

210
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:10,315
-Well then, let's change
that, shall we?

211
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:22,294
[screaming]

212
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:27,599
[screaming]

213
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,867
-Takuya!

214
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:31,603
-Why is Seraphimon fighting
Agunimon?

215
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:34,172
And how is Seraphimon even there
if we have his Digi-Egg?

216
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:35,340
-He's not.

217
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:38,443
Mercurymon is using Seraphimon's
data to evolve

218
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,945
that evil no-goodnik.

219
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:41,213
-How'd he do that?

220
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:44,149
-I'm not sure, but I'd recognize
that felonious fiend

221
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:47,486
even if he were disguised as a
little girl selling cookies.

222
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,021
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Cookies.

223
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:51,823
-Had enough?

224
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:54,192
-I'm just getting started.

225
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:55,527
Slide Evolution!

226
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:04,703
BurningGreymon!

227
00:11:04,703 --> 00:11:07,105
-Oh, you again?

228
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,173
-Pyro Barrage!

229
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:13,412
-Shadow Starbust!

230
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:18,951
[screaming]

231
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,919
-Ha ha ha!

232
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,589
Nothing in this world can
stand against me.

233
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:26,058
-I won't give up.

234
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:27,793
I can't.

235
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:30,762
-I can't believe we have
to watch this happen.

236
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:33,065
-Mercurymon was so strong
before, but now with

237
00:11:33,098 --> 00:11:37,102
Seraphimon's power, there's just
no way Takuya can defeat him.

238
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:37,936
-Not quite.

239
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:39,438
There is one way.

240
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:40,606
-Fusion Evolution!

241
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:42,908
-You mean like what Koji
used against Duskmon?

242
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,976
-Exactly.

243
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,178
Then he might be powerful
enough to defeat

244
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:47,312
ShadowSeraphimon.

245
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:49,848
-And I bet he'll have a
nifty costume, too.

246
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:51,783
-But will Takuya even
know to try it?

247
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,186
-And can he evolve before
it's too late?

248
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:55,187
-Pyro Barrage!

249
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,826
-Thy antics bore me.

250
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:04,196
Shadow Shockwave!

251
00:12:04,262 --> 00:12:08,734
'Tis time to write thy final
chapter, you meddlesome child.

252
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,670
Strike of the Seven
Dark Stars!

253
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:23,548
[screaming]

254
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:24,850
-Takuya!

255
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:30,722
-Ah, but first, one last gift.

256
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:40,399
A little place for thee to
take a long, long nap.

257
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,568
-You haven't beaten me yet.

258
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:46,238
-Then allow me the pleasure of
correcting that oversight.

259
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,142
-No!

260
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,109
Takuya!

261
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:52,544
-It's all over.

262
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:55,280
How's he supposed to Fusion
Evolve if he can't even pick

263
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:56,148
himself up?

264
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:58,984
-Don't say that.

265
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,620
One thing about Takuya, he
never, ever gives up, no

266
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,788
matter what.

267
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:04,990
So we are not gonna
give up on him!

268
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:06,391
We just have to help
him somehow.

269
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,492
-He's right.

270
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:10,262
We just have to figure
out how.

271
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,330
-Yes, but I don't know if
there's anything we can do if

272
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:14,132
we're so far away.

273
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:16,134
-Well then, let's get
back in there!

274
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:17,803
-Back in?

275
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,538
Do you know how bored I was
waiting for you to get out?

276
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:20,639
-I don't care.

277
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:22,607
-Takuya needs our help!

278
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:24,609
-Execute!

279
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:25,877
Spirit Evolution!

280
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:09,254
-Beetlemon!

281
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:14,226
-Kazemon!

282
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:21,500
-Kumamon!

283
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,501
-Hold on, Takuya.

284
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:24,102
We're on our way!

285
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:26,104
-But how are we gonna get in?

286
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:27,439
-Our old standby.

287
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:29,141
Working together.

288
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:30,242
Lightning Blitz!

289
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,981
-Ready?

290
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:37,282
-Blizzard Blaster!

291
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:38,817
-Hurricane Wave!

292
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,988
-Come on, come on!

293
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:47,459
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Hurry!

294
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:50,695
We don't have much time!

295
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:51,830
-Fear not.

296
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:56,067
Soon it shall all be over.

297
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:57,169
What?

298
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:58,570
No witty quips?

299
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:02,741
-Why waste my breath
on a jerk like you?

300
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:07,812
-'Twill be purest pleasure
to destroy thee.

301
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,580
-If you can hear
me, Seraphimon,

302
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:11,016
please, please help us.

303
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,384
[screaming]

304
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:13,685
-Takuya!

305
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:17,055
-Huh?

306
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,263
My baby helped, too.

307
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:31,903
-What trickery be this?

308
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:36,541
-Huh?

309
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:41,279
My Human Spirit and
my Beast Spirit.

310
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,948
This is a new evolution.

311
00:15:50,622 --> 00:15:52,791
You're in for a big surprise.

312
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:55,660
-Do your worst.

313
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:56,294
What?

314
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:57,629
This cannot be!

315
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:09,998
Thou doth not frighten me.

316
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:10,732
Seriously.

317
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,733
-Oh, yeah?

318
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,368
Well, then tell me something.

319
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:15,037
Do I scare you now?

320
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,672
[screaming]

321
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:32,454
-Execute now!

322
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:33,789
Fusion Evolution!

323
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:54,009
Aldamon!

324
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:54,910
-Impossible!

325
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:55,677
-Yeah!

326
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,345
-Get him, Aldamon!

327
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:59,181
-It really worked.

328
00:16:59,214 --> 00:17:02,250
Of course, I knew it was going
to work all along. hen have I

329
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:03,819
ever steered you guys wrong?

330
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,654
Now, get that data
stealing creep.

331
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:10,358
-Impressive.

332
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:13,862
But thou still cannot stand
against my power.

333
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:16,498
Strike of the Seven
Dark Stars!

334
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:25,841
No!

335
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:28,743
Stay back!

336
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:31,546
-You know, that thing really
seems to be more

337
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:32,881
your size than mine.

338
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:39,888
Atomic Inferno!

339
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,361
[screaming]

340
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:48,897
-It's purification time.

341
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,066
And it couldn't have happened
to a meaner guy.

342
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,972
Fractal Code Digitize!

343
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:05,714
-Hey, look.

344
00:18:05,781 --> 00:18:09,651
-I don't like the looks
of this thing.

345
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:12,621
-I'm sure glad you're in
charge of the egg.

346
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:15,157
-I think we're all glad
about that right now.

347
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,091
Huh?

348
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:17,759
-Is it over?

349
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:18,793
-Not yet.

350
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:24,132
-That plan was ruined.

351
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:26,501
But I can still win here.

352
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:28,103
ALDAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Don't be so sure.

353
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:29,171
-Aldamon.

354
00:18:29,237 --> 00:18:31,106
Looking to repeat
thy defeat here?

355
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:32,307
-No.

356
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:33,608
To teach you what defeat
really means.

357
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:34,643
-Hah!

358
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:36,444
Thou art a confident opponent.

359
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:37,879
I shall grant thee that.

360
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:40,615
But confidence is still
no match for the

361
00:18:40,682 --> 00:18:43,351
skill and power I possess.

362
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:44,853
-Just like you're
no match for me.

363
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:54,062
Solar Wind Destroyer!

364
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:07,342
-This can't be.

365
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,711
-I have a book of my own
with a surprise ending.

366
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,379
You're finished, Mercurymon.

367
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:12,914
-No!

368
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:14,616
Even without my mirrors, I
possess enough power to

369
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:15,951
destroy thee.

370
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,686
-Right.

371
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:18,376
-No!

372
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:19,087
Stop!

373
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,555
Thou cannot get past
my shield.

374
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:22,891
It shall repel thy attack.

375
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:24,426
-Hah.

376
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,294
I'll go around it, then.

377
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:27,629
-No!

378
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:34,569
[screaming]

379
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:39,241
-It's over.

380
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:43,778
You won't hurt me or my
friends ever again.

381
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:46,147
Fractal Code Digitize!

382
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:54,656
Hey, everybody!

383
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:56,825
Guess who just kicked
Mercurymon's patootie?

384
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:57,959
So how are the rest
of you guys doing?

385
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,498
What the heck's wrong
with Bokomon?

386
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:04,699
-We don't know.

387
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:07,836
-He was zapped by Seraphimon's
data.

388
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:09,838
-What is happening?

389
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:10,305
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): The egg.

390
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,506
It's hatching!

391
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:17,012
-You mean Seraphimon's
being born right now?

392
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:20,048
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): This is the
most beautiful thing ever!

393
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:21,082
And the smokiest.

394
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:26,482
-Hey.

395
00:20:26,482 --> 00:20:27,889
Who is that?

396
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:29,724
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, it's Patamon.

397
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:31,726
-Hi, everybody.

398
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:34,529
-He's my-- he's my
little baby.

399
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:37,098
Now come say hi to mama!

400
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:38,566
-Huh?

401
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,236
-You want it to call you mama?

402
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:43,071
-Mama.

403
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:45,407
-Well, who else carried that egg
for weeks while the rest

404
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:46,808
of you lollygagged around?

405
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:47,309
-Lollygagged?

406
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:47,909
-Is he crazy?

407
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:51,146
[arguing]

408
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,113
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Fine.

409
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:53,548
Then no one gets to
play with him.

410
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:55,383
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): But
he's so cute!

411
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,151
NARRATOR: Great.

412
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:57,786
Someone else to worry about.

413
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:00,659
See if they can handle this
crisis on the next Digimon,

414
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,707
Digital Monsters.
