BOKOMON NARRATING: Visiting the
Village of Beginnings, our

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,452
heroes' expectations were
egg-ceeded by the

3
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:06,288
overabundance of babies.

4
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:08,490
The Trailmon normally hauled the
hatchlings home, but with

5
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:10,458
all the scanning going
on, they were afraid

6
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,760
to come out of hiding.

7
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:13,495
So the gang lent Swanmon
an hand with the

8
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:15,497
babies and the Trailmon.

9
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,999
Meanwhile, the Royal Knights
arrived to scan the village.

10
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,602
The kids were fighting a losing
battle when the data of

11
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:22,804
the four evil warriors was
activated, allowing a reunion

12
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:24,639
of the Big Ten.

13
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:27,542
Zoe convinced the Trailmon to
take the tots just in time.

14
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:29,044
But not before the
nasty Knights

15
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:30,712
made the village vanish.

16
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:31,980
THEME SONG: Digimon!

17
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:42,190
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

18
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,559
Digital World.

19
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:49,531
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other we live by

20
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:51,066
the lessons we've learned.

21
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:58,039
As we work towards
one solution,

22
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,943
through a Spirit Evolution.

23
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:03,311
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

24
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,279
Huh!

25
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:05,280
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

26
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:06,882
Digimon.

27
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:09,217
Forever united as one.

28
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,519
Digimon.

29
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,188
Together the battles are won.

30
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:14,389
Digimon.

31
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:17,025
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

32
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:21,329
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

33
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:25,667
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

34
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,668
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

35
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:27,569
Huh!

36
00:01:27,636 --> 00:01:28,169
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

37
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,038
Digimon!

38
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:33,775
BOKOMON NARRATING: Just as it
was foretold, the power of the

39
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:36,111
Ten Legendary Warriors
is alive.

40
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:37,045
Alive!

41
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:38,380
-That's wonderful in theory.

42
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:39,781
But it still didn't help
us save the Village of

43
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:41,249
Beginnings.

44
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:43,685
-Yeah, those royal windbags
swiped all the data, anyway.

45
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:45,287
I don't see where
the win is here.

46
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,588
-Yeah, take a look around.

47
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:47,789
-I don't know about you
guys, but I don't

48
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:49,457
feel powerful at all.

49
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,126
-What are you talking about?

50
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,628
Do you understand the
significance of the Ten

51
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:55,764
Legendary Warriors
being reunited?

52
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:57,766
No one said this was
going to be easy.

53
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,368
I have every confidence you'll
save the Digital World just

54
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:01,569
like in the old legend.

55
00:02:01,636 --> 00:02:03,838
-How are we supposed
to do that?

56
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:05,874
-As long as we're willing to
stay together and continue to

57
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:08,877
believe, destiny will
show us the way.

58
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:11,780
-I wish destiny would show me
the way to a good hamburger.

59
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:14,182
-Now that's something
I could believe in.

60
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:15,583
-Argh!

61
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:17,185
-Ooh!

62
00:02:17,252 --> 00:02:19,521
-Sometimes the echo from your
empty head is deafening.

63
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:21,756
-I want to believe, but is
my spirit strong enough?

64
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,592
-Well, I'm still
willing to try.

65
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,927
-We'll need some help.

66
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:28,730
I can still feel them, even
though I can't see them.

67
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:30,599
The other four warrior
spirits!

68
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:32,634
They stood by us before, and
they'll do it again.

69
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:34,569
If they can fight
then so can I.

70
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:35,971
-There's a point I
can't argue with.

71
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:37,272
[gasps]

73
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:40,442
-Oh, dear!

74
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:41,610
What are they going on about?

75
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:42,510
Enough of that!

76
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:44,245
Tell us what's wrong.

77
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,847
-It's the Village of Flames.

78
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,015
-That's my home!

79
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,149
Oh, dear.

80
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:49,584
Please don't tell me it's
been destroyed.

81
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:51,186
POYOMON (OFFSCREEN): No,
but it's about to be.

82
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:51,987
-What do mean?

83
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:54,255
-A scary Digimon attacked us.

84
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:56,191
-He's big and mean.

85
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:58,159
(IN UNISON) He won't stop
until it's all gone.

86
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,395
Please hurry, before
it's too late.

87
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:02,897
-Ugh!

88
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:03,898
-Don't worry, Papa-Mom.

89
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:08,069
I'm sure there's something
we can do.

90
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,138
-We have to protect
that village.

91
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:13,074
-Yeah, that forest is where
I first became a Digimon.

92
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,776
-Then we'd better get going.

93
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:17,512
-I'm up for sending that
Digi-thug packing.

94
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:19,280
-Well I'm ready when you are.

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,848
-One little problem.

96
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:21,583
We need a Trailmon.

97
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:24,486
-Hello, Liebchens.

98
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,354
[everyone exclaims]

99
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:28,156
CRUSADERMON (OFFSCREEN): Hurry,
my Royal Knights.

100
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:30,659
I grow tired of this prison.

101
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:33,661
Hurry and set me free.

102
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:36,965
-Yes, My Lord, it won't
be long now.

103
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:39,634
-Even as we speak, your servants
are collecting some

104
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,136
beautiful data.

105
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,170
Help them!

106
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:44,139
-Yes, Master.

107
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:45,006
CRUSADERMON (OFFSCREEN):
Fools!

108
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,509
My patience wears thin.

109
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:51,479
But soon, I shall be
free once again!

110
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:54,382
-Mein Liebchen is making
mein tunnel.

111
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:57,752
Why do I always have to
be such a softie?

112
00:03:57,786 --> 00:04:00,655
-What do we do if the Village of
Flames is gone when we get

113
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:01,523
there?

114
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:02,157
-Oh, let's not think
about that.

115
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,358
-I'm scared.

116
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:04,959
-We'll don't be.

117
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:07,128
We have to stay positive and
keep our heads clear.

118
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:09,197
I realize it's something you've
never done before, but

119
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,665
please, at least try.

120
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,200
Besides, I know it's
still there.

121
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:13,168
-How do you know?

122
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,202
-Because I can sense
these things.

123
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,504
Now please, stop asking
questions!

124
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:18,039
-You don't have to mean.

125
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:19,007
TRAILMON (OFFSCREEN): There's
no place like home.

126
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:20,408
There's no place like home!

Come out, come out

wherever you are.

132
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,053
We just need to have a
little conversation.

133
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:32,887
Any volunteers?

134
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:34,422
Hello?

135
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,091
I guess you'll do.

[laughter]

137
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:44,065
SkullSatamon, a frightening
fallen angel Digimon whose

138
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:46,568
lust for power and destruction
is only exceeded by his

139
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:48,103
loyalty to Lucemon.

140
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,307
He's an unnatural disaster, with
his deadly Bone Blaster.

141
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,709
-Where can I find the
data of this forest?

142
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:56,811
-I'm sorry, I don't know.

-Poison ivy!

-And you!

149
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,392
Surely a fine hare like yourself
must know where the

150
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:13,061
data for this forest
is hidden.

151

-No, please stop.

152
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:15,230
Don't make me tell you that!

SKULLSATAMON (OFFSCREEN):
You do know!

-Did I say that?

155
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:18,399
-Don't tell him!

156
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,602
-Maybe it's time for
rabbit stew.

Please don't hurt me.

I'll cooperate, honest.

-I'm in a generous mood.

161
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:26,875
But this is your last chance.

162
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,910
Now tell me where the data is.

163
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,078
-It's in a cave below us.

00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:31,312
I'll show you.

165
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:33,047
-Really?

166
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,616
And where might we find the
entrance to this mystery cave?

167
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:35,650
-He spilled the beans!

168
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:39,287
-Where is it?

169
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,054
Tell me.

170
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,289
-It's right there.

171
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:42,757
Right over there.

172
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,825
SKULLSATAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Aha, ha!

173
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:47,128
Silly rabbit, I've got a
nice reward for you.

174
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:47,996
RABBIT (OFFSCREEN): Uh-oh!

175
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,643
TRAILMON (OFFSCREEN): I'm
so glad that's over.

176
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,378
I'll go hide now.

177
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:56,212
Auf Wiedersehen!

178
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:56,913
-(IN UNISON) Thanks,
very much!

179
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,248
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Thank you!

180
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:00,717
Ta-ta, ta-ta.

181
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,152
-It feels so good to
be home again!

182
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:05,722
And ever better that there's
a home to be at.

183
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:08,124
-Thank goodness the Village
of Flames has been spared!

184
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:09,525
Ha, ha!

185
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,194
-It's great, Papa-Mom.

186
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:12,862
I can't believe I'm
in your hometown.

187
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,398
It's so big, and huge, and--
and flamey, too!

188
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:17,033
Would you show us around?

189
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,334
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
I'd be delighted.

190
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,336
Ah, doesn't it smell
wonderful?

191
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,537
-Wasn't me.

192
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:22,872
Hey, it looks like
the forest is OK.

193
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,040
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Ah!

194
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,409
The green, green forest
of my youth lives on.

195
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:28,511
The majestic trees swaying
in the breeze.

196
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:30,413
The little birdies twittering.

197
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,049
I remember how the tiny forest
creatures would come out and

198
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:34,517
mercilessly nibble at my toes.

199
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,120
Ah, memories.

200
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:38,721
-It's still beautiful.

201
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,257
-Uh, yeah, what's left
of it, anyway.

202
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,092
-Well let's make sure
it stays that way!

203
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,598
[croaking]

204
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:50,600
-This was too easy!

205
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,435
Lord Lucemon will be pleased!

206
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:55,271
Oh how I love my job!

207
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:56,306
Bone Blaster!

208
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:13,389
[laughing]

209
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:19,962
-Somebody's scanning
the forest!

210
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:20,930
-Agh!
My home!

211
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:22,398
Leave it alone!

212
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:23,933
It's vanishing.

213
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:24,967
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): And
disappearing too!

214
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,907
[laughter]

215
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:42,518
-[laughter]

216
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:43,419
Delicious!

217
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:47,090
My master will be proud!

218
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:48,324
-I haven't seen him before.

219
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:49,659
Who is that bonehead?

220
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,994
-According to my book,
it's a SkullSatamon.

221
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:53,830
-Did he nibble on
your toes, too?

222
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:55,665
-Here it comes, My Lord!

223
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:56,699
Yaughh!

224
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,437
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

225
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:12,348
[crying]

226
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:13,249
-It's gone!

227
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:14,617
He destroyed the forest.

228
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:16,285
-Stop the crying and
start moving!

229
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:17,854
-Huh?

230
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,355
-He's not going to stop until
the whole place is gone!

231
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:21,324
You'd better get out
while you can.

232
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:22,592
-(IN UNISON) Get out
while you can!

233
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:25,094
-That scary Digimon has
a big appetite.

234
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,663
And if you don't hurry, you're
going to be his next meal.

235
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,298
-(IN UNISON) Yeah, you're going
to be his next meal.

236
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:29,866
Next!

237
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,200
Next!
Next!

238
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:33,035
-So do you guys have a plan?

239
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:34,170
-I plan to run!

240
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,172
-That's not the answer
I was hoping for.

241
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,507
-(IN UNISON) Crummy answer.

242
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,675
-The only reason we stayed
behind is because we thought

243
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:41,377
you guys could actually
do something,

244
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:42,845
but I guess we wrong!

245
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,714
You're just a bunch
of cowards.

246
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:47,016
-Before we give up, we should
let the humans speak.

247
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:48,684
After all, they did come
here to help us.

248
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:49,685
-(IN UNISON) No way!

249
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,020
Don't even bother!

250
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,656
-I'm not sure there's anything
they can do, Pagumon.

251
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:54,924
-Yeah, they don't
mean to mean.

252
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:56,426
Lucemon's coming soon, anyway.

253
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,060
It's only a matter of time.

254
00:08:58,094 --> 00:08:59,562
-Hm!

255
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,330
We all had high hopes for you
guys when you got the spirits

256
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,865
of the legendary warriors.

257
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:04,700
But I guess you just couldn't
handle it, could you?

258
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:05,635
-Oh yeah!

259
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:06,536
-(IN UNISON) Yeah, he's right!

260
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:08,004
-(IN UNISON) What's
up with that?

261
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:10,206
-If we hadn't trusting you
clowns, we would have had half

262
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:11,340
a chance to save ourselves.

263
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,543
-You're wrong about one thing.

264
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:15,545
One of the reasons I
stayed behind is

265
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:16,679
because this is my home.

266
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:18,714
I've always lived here.

267
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:20,683
I'm going to spend my last
hours here, too!

268
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,851
-Going down with the ship.

269
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:22,652
-Hm?

270
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:23,252
-Very noble, Captain!

271
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:24,987
But I had another plan.

272
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:27,824
Like maybe these guys might
actually come to through.

273
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,892
I have a hard time believing in
anything, but this time I

274
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:31,227
trusted Bokomon.

275
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,062
He convinced all of us that
nothing could beat the

276
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:34,897
Legendary Warriors.

277
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:36,199
But it was too good
to be true.

278
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:37,867
It is only a legend.

279
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,069
-Maybe you should have
run, but running away

280
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:41,771
never solved anything!

281
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:43,773
-We did come back here
to help, you know.

282
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:45,274
If you want to give up, that's
your choice, but

283
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,943
it's not over yet.

284
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:49,445
We're all still willing to
fight, but we need your help.

285
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:51,747
-Please, we can do
this together.

286
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:53,216
-Huh?

287
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,650
-Take it from me, you'd be
surprised at how much power we

288
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,252
can have with a little
bit of team work.

289
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:57,420
-That's true.

290
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:58,421
He's the lazy one
of the bunch.

291
00:09:58,488 --> 00:09:59,922
If he can fight, I'm
willing to try.

292
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:01,457
-(IN UNISON) Really?

293
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,292
-Besides, wouldn't it make you
feel good to know that you did

294
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,127
everything you could to
defend your home?

295
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:07,497
-I'm sorry that you feel like
we failed you, but with your

296
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,132
help we still have a chance to
change the history of the

297
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:11,467
Digital World.

298
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,935
-At this point, what
do we have to lose?

299
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:15,605
Personally, I want to make it
difficult as possible for

300
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:16,639
those data-sucking scum!

301
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:17,974
-Yeah!

302
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:19,475
For what it's worth, I'm willing
to unleash the power

303
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,010
of the pants!

304
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,179
-You really think us little guys
can make a difference?

305
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:24,647
-Definitely, as long
as you believe.

306
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:26,048
-Anything is possible.

307
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:28,217
-Whatever you decide to
do, it's OK with me.

308
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,653
I just want you all to know that
I'll do everything I can

309
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:31,387
to save your home.

310
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,357
I won't give up, I promise!

311
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:36,692
The spirit of the Ten Legendary
Warriors lives

312
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:38,528
inside each and every
one of us.

313
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:40,730
If Lucemon's goons try to take
this place, they're in for a

314
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:42,198
fight like they've never seen!

315
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:43,866
-(IN UNISON) Yeah!
Woo hoo!

316
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:47,069
[laughter]

317
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:49,238
-Ah, so brave.

318
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,740
They're forming a
team, are they?

319
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:52,074
Then I will too!

320
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:53,342
Time to wake up my brother!

321
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,678
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

322
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:02,485
[laughter]

323
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:09,314

this is it.

328
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:19,158
I'm sensing two big Digimon
approaching from the south.

00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:20,125
-Argh!

330

-Well, they are!

355
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,115
They have the power of
all 10 Warriors.

356
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:52,284
And if you believe strongly
enough, they can use your

00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:52,885
power, too.

-Well, well, well.

You must be the weaklings
Crusadermon told us about.

LILITHMON (OFFSCREEN):
So you want to fight?

Ha, ha, ha!

371
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:22,214
I love the smell of competition
in the morning.

Maybe we'll start with
a round of gulf.

golf isn't your game, huh?

What's the matter?

380
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:38,130
Am I so intimidating you
can't even speak?

You're even bigger cowards
than I thought!

SKULLSATAMON (OFFSCREEN): Well,
we might as well destroy

383
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,635
them then, or Lucemon
will bring them back

384
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,671
as new Digimon anyway.

-Of course.

388
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,143
Lord Lucemon would never lie.

-Really?

390
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,544
What did he promise you?

-Huh?

to him, and that's

all you'll ever be.

394
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:57,182
That I could promise you!

[growling]

396
00:13:58,183 --> 00:13:59,551
-Yeah.

397
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,220
I bet combined there isn't one
original thought in those

398
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,088
pathetic skulls of yours.

they promised.

[laughter]
-Stop!

408
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:27,946
I'm giving you one chance to
leave this village and go back

409
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:29,681
to wherever it is
you came from.

410
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:31,049
-But the party's
just starting!

411
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,685
Mm!

412
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,854
-If that's the way you want it,
I'm going to give you the

Yay!

-What do we have to do
to get through those

421

thick skulls of yours?

422
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:08,287
We're not going to let you
take this village.

423

Ugh!

424

Move it!

00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:14,559
-Oh, we'll go.

428
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:16,361
But not until we finish
our mission.

429
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:18,363
You see, we still have
a village to scan.

-Good morning!

431

-What?

433
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:29,708
-Apparently, you two have been
giving my brothers a bad time.

But now that we're
all together, you

435
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:31,877
don't stand a chance.

-I'm fresh out of patience,
so I'll only ask you once.

Now tell me where to find the
flame terminal's data!

-No, please!

-Don't tell him, Biyomon!

-It's time to say,
bye bye, birdie.

Is this the one?

460
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,354
-Yes.

461
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,722
Please let me go!

462
00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:17,789
-Thanks for your help.

463
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:20,125
As a reward, you get to
go back to your egg.

464

Hiya!

465

-I can't believe it.

Biyomon told him, and that bony
bum zapped him anyway.

-Are we going to let them
destroy our home?

up and fight!

00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:20,968
Hiya!

493
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:21,935
-Ugh!

494
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:23,137
[growling]

495
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:24,872
-(IN UNISON) Super
Thunder Strike.

496
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:27,141
-Argh!

497
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:28,475
[growling]

498
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:31,445
-(IN UNISON) Ah phew!

499
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:33,380
-Yuck! putrid punks.

500
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:34,548
Ugh!

501
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:35,782
I don't have time
for you brats.

502
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,050
-Run away, run away!

503
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:38,352
-Ugh!

504
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:39,553
I was going to scan you
last but there's

505
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:40,888
been a change of plans.

506
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:41,889
-Yo, ugly!

507
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:42,723
-Huh?

508
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:44,725
-Pick on someone
your own size!

509
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:52,699
-Argh!
[cheering]

510
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,668
-Ugh, ow.

511
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:55,669
Ugh!

512
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:56,503
-Let's show him--

513
00:17:56,537 --> 00:17:57,704
- --some brotherly--

514
00:17:57,704 --> 00:17:59,606
- --love.

515
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,141
-Ughh!

516
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:02,709
-Leave him alone!

517
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:05,045
-(IN UNISON) Come on, Flamon,
he's our man, if he can't do

518
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:06,947
it, no one can!

519
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:07,848
-Thanks guys!

520
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:09,683
Let's go!

521
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:10,617
Hiya!

522
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:11,552
-Ugh.

523
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:12,186
-Hiya!

524
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:13,153
-What are you doing?

525
00:18:13,187 --> 00:18:14,021
No!

526
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:15,489
No!

527
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:17,224
Ugh!

528
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:18,692
-Huh!

529
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:20,861
Don't ever underestimate
the power of teamwork!

530
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:23,897
Now, time to clean
up this boneyard.

531
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:26,333
Hiya!

532
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:27,668
Pyro Dragons!

533
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:37,177
[screams]

534
00:18:44,785 --> 00:18:47,087
-Well, do you guys believe
in the power now?

535
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,055
-I believe!

536
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,957
-Well, I never had any doubts.

537
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,625
-Yay!

538
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:56,263
[cheering]

539
00:18:56,296 --> 00:18:57,898
[gasp]

540
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:01,001
-It was lovely how you all came
together like that to

541
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:02,669
save your humble hamlet.

542
00:19:02,703 --> 00:19:05,005
Yet the loss of the SkullSatamon
Brothers was

543
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,209
tragic, they're loyalty was
like a beautiful flower.

544
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:13,680
-What's that pathetic pink
psychopath up to now?

545
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:16,917
-Some day Lord Lucemon
will give new life to

546
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:19,920
this sad, sad scene.

547
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:21,288
[screaming]

548
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:33,267
[gasps]

549
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:36,603
-Goodbye, fair hamlet.

550
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,939
Now off you go to
Lord Lucemon.

551
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:42,843
Have a beautiful journey.

552
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:43,911
-(IN UNISON) Ooh!

553
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:49,650
-Master, your exquisite
re-awakening will

554
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,918
soon come to pass.

555
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:52,319
Ta-ta!

556
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,320
[laughter]

557
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,521
-Ugh!

558
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,323
I'm really starting to
hate that laugh.

559
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:03,864
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): I can't
believe it's gone!

560
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,332
Our home is gone.

561
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,000
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

562
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,669
-These guys are going to need
a safe place to hide.

563
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:10,671
Should we take them to
the human world?

564
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:11,505
-I don't know.

565
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:12,806
-Tukuya was right.

566
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,507
-Huh?

567
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:14,508
-Running is never the answer.

568
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:15,842
We have to stay here
and fight.

569
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:17,644
-Yeah.

570
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:18,979
Our home may be gone, but they
can't take away our memories.

571
00:20:19,046 --> 00:20:21,381
Besides, we can always find
another place to live for a

572
00:20:21,415 --> 00:20:22,716
little while.

573
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:24,084
-At least we did everything
we could.

574
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:26,753
Hey, after that battle, I'm
feeling a new sense of hope.

575
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,922
-Maybe these guys aren't
impossible to beat, after all.

576
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:31,525
-(IN UNISON) When we fight
together as one, we can all

577
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:33,093
help get the job done!

578
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:34,728
-Mm, hm!

579
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:36,897
-We're all in this
together now.

580
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,533
Those mean old meanies can do
whatever they want, but

581
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,201
they'll never destroy
the spirits of the

582
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:42,736
Ten Legendary Warriors.

583
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:45,973
As long as we have courage and
still believe, the spirits

584
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:47,908
will live on inside all of us!

585
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:50,043
-Not much longer!

586
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:51,611
Not much longer!

587
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:56,316
BOKOMON NARRATING: Well,
I believe that

588
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,784
we're in big trouble.

589
00:20:57,818 --> 00:21:00,220
Sure hope there's something left
to fight for on the next

590
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:02,889
Digimon Digital Monsters.
