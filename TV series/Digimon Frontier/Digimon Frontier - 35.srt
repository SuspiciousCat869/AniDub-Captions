NARRATOR: At long last, the gang
finally arrived at the

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,872
Rose Morning Star.

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:07,174
After hopping on some floating
rocks, they got to the castle

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,309
gate where a couple of
Phantomon gave them a

5
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,211
welcoming party that they'd
rather have skipped.

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,647
But Koichi in his hero
form saved the day.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,216
Once they got inside the castle,
more creeps tried to

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,852
grab their attention, but their
new bud, Oryxmon, proved

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,054
he was b-a-a-ad to
the bone and took

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,856
them straight to Ophanimon.

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,759
Then Cherubimon showed up, and
things got downright dismal.

12
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,362
He got the kids and their
Legendary Spirits right where

13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,329
he wants them!

14
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,864
And that ain't good.

THEME SONG: Digimon!

16
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:42,242
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

17

Digital World.

18
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:49,283
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:55,956
by the lessons we've learned,
as we work towards one

20
00:00:56,023 --> 00:01:01,862
solution, through a
spirit evolution.

21
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,263
I am the one.

22
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:03,997
Huh!

23
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,866
I am the one.

24
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:06,900
Digimon!

25
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,236
Forever united as one.

Together the battles are won.

Digimon!

29
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,077
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

30
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,081
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

31
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:25,786
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

32
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:26,787
I am the one.

33
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,789
Huh!
I am the one.

34
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:29,790

-Stop!

39
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,141
What are you doing?

40
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,643
-Hah!

41
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,445
Oryxmon has outlived
his usefulness.

42
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,815
He is a pawn who annoyingly
led you here.

43
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,650
His existence is no
longer necessary.

44
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,784
Yah!

45
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,119
-No!

46
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,290
-Oh!

47
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,425
-Huh?

48
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,428
-How novel that you are still
shocked by my brutality.

49
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,765
I will destroy anyone to collect
the spirits of the Ten

50
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,733
Legendary Warriors.

51
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:16,136
Even you, Ophanimon,
are not immune.

52
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,638
-Uh!

53
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,407
-So I was a pawn of
ours as well?

54
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,176
-You were my most willing
puppet, ensuring that my

55
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,145
bidding would be carried
out thoroughly.

56
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,981
By using you, I made certain all
the Spirits would arrive

57
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,515
here.

58
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,850
-You manipulated me!

59
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,019
You heartless, selfish creep!

60
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,988
-As unaware as you were of my
brilliant scheme, you still

61
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,657
turned out to be the best
subject I ever had.

62
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,293
You saw the pathetic creatures
in the lower

63
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,795
depths of this castle.

64
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,730
They were Digimon I
experimented with.

65
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,565
But they couldn't fuse
with the Dark

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,567
Spirit the way you did.

67
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,202
Hah!

68
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,570
Unfortunately, they couldn't
stand up to the intensity.

69
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,639
My experiment broke them.

70
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,876
-How'd you like some of
your intensity back?

71
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,711

-What's going on?

75
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,020
Why is my attack
power so weak?

76
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,989
-It's because there's
no darkness.

77
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,691
The fact that no shadows exist
here has knocked the power out

78
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:12,492
of your attack.

79
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,660

the glorious Spirit of

-It's the light!

105

Because it's so bright, your
attacks got all loopy.

They won't work in here!

-Patamon is right.

108

This light renders your
attacks useless.

-Wonderful!
Stupendous!

-Don't worry, Ophanimon.

177

Our D-Tectors!

190
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,524
That's cheating!

191
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,326
You can't get away with that!

192
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,127
It's not fair!

193
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,328
Give 'em back!

194
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,231
-Do you really think fairness
matters to me?

195
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,900
All I care about is securing
the Spirits of the Ten

Legendary Warriors by whatever
means necessary.

Metal Spirits.

We won't let you do that!

Ophanimon's still in her cage.

BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): We have to
break up that light that's

Just make Ophanimon gets free.

-But I--
-He's right.

I'll distract Cherubimon while
you free Ophanimon.

Korikakumon of Ice.

the Legendary Spirits.

Spirit of Light.

You also have the
Water Spirits,

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,128
I have no choice.

340
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,130
Sefirot Crystals!

341
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,064
Hah!

342
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,399
-Ah!

343
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,638
-Ahhhh!

344
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,946
-Huh uh!

345
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,814
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Cherubimon's done!

346
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,982
He's beaten!

347
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,251
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): I wouldn't
count on that.

348
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,457
-But what happened
to Ophanimon?

349
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,559
OPHANIMON (ON D-TECTOR): His
power was too strong.

350
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,861
-Huh?

351
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,030
-The evil surrounding Cherubimon
was much stronger

352
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,866
than I had anticipated.

353
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,436
I had hoped to purify him,
but alas, I failed.

354
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,537
-Where are you?

355
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,507
-Thank you for journeying so
far and enduring so much.

356
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,376
I am grateful to all
of you for the

357
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,577
courage you have displayed.

358
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:52,545
-Huh?

359
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,714
I thought Cherubimon
was done for!

360
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,383
-As strong as Ophanimon
is, even she

361
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,051
couldn't stand up to him.

362
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,954
And if she couldn't beat him,
then how are we supposed to?

363
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,789
-Children, don't give up.

364
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:08,861
You must gather your Spirits
together, as one.

365
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,529
-How do we do that?

366
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,131
-What's going on?

367
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,534
-I have no idea.

368
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,871
-Just before I fell, with the
last of my strength, I evolved

369
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,041
your two D-Tectors.

370
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,409
-Ophanimon changed
our D-Tectors.

371
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,877
-They're evolved!

372
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,079
-Well, all of ours still
look the same.

373
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,714
-Hey, lookee there!

374
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,182
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): A Digi-Egg!

375
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,050
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Then--

376
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,286
-Ophanimon.

377
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,954
-We know what we have to do.

378
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,524
-Yeah, gather all of our Spirits
together as one.

379
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,592
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): OK.

380
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:40,359
Like this?

381
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,295
-Maybe the book has a clue.

382
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,429
-Let's see.

383
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,364
Hmm.
-Ah!

384
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,365
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): I think
Cherubimon's about to answer

385
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,567
his wakeup call.

386
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:49,435
-Come on!

387
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,404
Can you give us a little
help here?

388
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,306
A hint, a sign, anything?

389
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,440
-Bokomon, read faster.

390
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,641
-Don't rush me.

391
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,109
-Hurry, we're running
out of time!

392
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,478
-Everyone, just be quiet
for a second!

393
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,913
-Huh?

394
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,548
-We all have to search inside
ourselves to find the answer.

395
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,723
-Hmm.

396
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:25,805
-Yes.

397
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,273
If our--

398
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,941
-feelings--

399
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,443
-are one--

400
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,144
-we can--

401
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,946
-evolve.

402
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,281
-That's it!

403
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,456
-Mmmmm--

404
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,458
raawr!

405
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,826
-Ah!

406
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,094
-Shhh.

407
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,428
-I'm opening up.

408
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,331
All of our Spirits
will become one.

409
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,699
-Earth into Flame.

410
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,239
-Water into Light.

411
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,778

-And Metal into the Light.

413
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,418
-Mmmmmmm.

414
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,195
-We have to believe in
Koji and Takuya!

415
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,830
-I'm not ascared!

416
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:25,831

00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:26,866
-Oh.

418

We have all of the Legendary
Spirits on our side!

419
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,808
-We will fight Cherubimon with
the power of the Spirits!

420
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,677
-Wind into Flame!

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,546

422
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,482
