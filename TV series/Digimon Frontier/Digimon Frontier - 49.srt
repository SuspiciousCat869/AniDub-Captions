BOKOMON (NARRATING): After
Lucemon destroyed the last

2
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:04,954
moon, we were all left floating
on this ridiculous

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:07,724
rock, and vulnerable to every
passing magma attack.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,959
Neemon tricked me into telling
Koichi's secret.

5
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:12,629
Luckily, everyone was distracted
when Lucemon opened

6
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:14,330
a window into the real world.

7
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:16,966
Our brave children Spirit
Evolved to stop him, but

8
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,802
Lucemon revealed that
he had the power to

9
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:20,136
combine light and darkness.

10
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:22,805
As has prepared to send our
dear friends to oblivion,

11
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:25,175
Koichi gave up his Spirits
of Darkness to Koji.

12
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:28,645
Lucemon scanned him, but then
Takuya and Koji united their

13
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,114
ancient spirits to become
Susanoomon.

[theme music]

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,357
THEME SONG: Look to the past as
we heard for the future to

17
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:45,395
reclaim the Digital World.

18
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:49,165
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,204
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:57,874
As we work towards one solution

21
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:59,542
through a Spirit Evolution.

22
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,716
Digimon!

23
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:09,452
Forever united as one.

24
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,687
Digimon!

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,456
Together the battles are won.

26
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:14,691
Digimon!

27
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:17,327
Through us let your
spirit evolve!

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,231
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:28,338
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,572
Digimon!

00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:36,279
[shouting]

32
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:40,917
[screaming]

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,228
-Ancient Spirits unite!

34
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:06,943
Susanoomon!

35
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:12,548
[gasping]

36
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:22,959
-And just who are you?

37
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:26,796
-I am Susanoomon, inheritor
of the spirits of the 10

38
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,299
legendary warriors.

39
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,234
-Susanoomon?

40
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,603
Well, I bid you welcome.

41
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:36,272
Allow me to inform you that
all those who live in the

42
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:38,241
Digital World must follow me.

43
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,410
If you serve me, you
shall live forever.

44
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:44,614
If, however, you have your own
ideas, I cannot allow that.

45
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:46,015
To exist, obey.

46
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,918
-We know that you stand
for evil and tyranny.

47
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:51,487
You want to destroy
the Digital World.

48
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:54,524
-I only wish to bring order
to this world of chaos.

49
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:57,660
But that will never happen with
the Digital World in its

50
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:58,828
present state.

51
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,564
To begin it anew, I must
destroy it utterly.

52
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,733
-We won't let that happen.

53
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:08,071
-So, you think you can defy me
and live to get away with it?

54
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,405
Paradise Lost Punch!

55
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,246
-What furious fisticuffs!

56
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,151
It's deja vu again.

57
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:34,664
-Time to pay!

58
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:42,372
-Your Paradise Lost Punch won't
work on us anymore.

59
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,173
All right, guys!

60
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,308
-Susanoomon rocks!

61
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:52,682
-You will not survive.

62
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:53,916
-That's where you're wrong.

63
00:03:58,454 --> 00:03:59,389
What?

64
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:01,924
-I served my time.

65
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,126
And learned this.

66
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:08,865
Oh, yes.

67
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:11,134
I was imprisoned in
the dark area.

68
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,873
For far too long!

69
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:19,342
The hatred!

70
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,245
The fearless [inaudible]!

71
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:26,849
As I waited to be freed,
I added to my powers.

72
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,752
I'm beyond the Lucemon
I was before.

73
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:31,988
-Be careful, Susanoomon.

74
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:35,057
-I really must congratulate
you.

75
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:38,227
You hold the spirits of the
10 legendary warriors.

76
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:40,930
Too bad I can't allow a being
with all that power to exist

77
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:41,531
in my world.

78
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:44,901
So goodbye!

79
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:47,070
[screaming]

80
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,238
-If you had chosen to obey
me, you might have lived.

81
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,744
All the power you possess
must be broken down.

82
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,317
-No, Susanoomon!

83
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,087
[evil laughter]

84
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:11,537
-Guys, get out of there!

85
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:14,507
[evil laughter]

86
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,885
-Even with all the Ancient
Spirits combined, is this all

87
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,487
the strength we have?

88
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:28,488
-Koji, listen.

89
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,390
I want you to promise
me something.

90
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:32,825
When you go back to the
real world, I want you

91
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:33,593
to visit our mom.

92
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:34,727
Will you do that?

93
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:37,096
-Our mom.

94
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,365
-My brother, I can't tell
you what it means to

95
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,867
me to have met you.

96
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,936
I have no regrets, no regrets.

97
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:45,038
-Koichi!

98
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:51,144
Neither do I.

99
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:53,246
-Can we still do this?

100
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:57,316
Is it really possible for us
to save the Digital World?

101
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,951
-I don't think we'd all still
be here if there wasn't

102
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:00,653
something we could
do about it.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,487
-What?

104
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:02,889
What can we do?

105
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:04,424
-Protect our world.

106
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:06,926
That's all I ask.

107
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,230
-We promised you we would,
no matter what it took.

108
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:15,234
-We have to find a way.

109
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:19,072
[evil laughter]

110
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:20,106
LUCEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Excellent.

111
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,208
-Susanoomon's gone!

112
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:26,412
-Behold the punishment for those
who dare to defy me.

113
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:27,380
Hm?

114
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,915
They're alive?

115
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:31,083
But this is not possible!

116
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,553
No one can survive my Ultimate
Sacrifice attack.

117
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,221
This simply cannot be!

118
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:43,796
-Well, they did survive
your attack.

119
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,299
The only way they could was by
separating their own spirits

120
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:48,334
from the 10 Ancient Spirits.

121
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,669
-It can't be done.

122
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:50,803
It's against the
laws of nature!

123
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,916
-I'm back!

124
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,285
Now it's your turn
to be afraid.

125
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,154
Very afraid.

126
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:11,157
-Koichi, you are gonna love
what's about to happen.

127
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:16,462
Ready.

128
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,772
Celestial Blade!

129
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:42,021
[shouting]

130
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,559
-No.

131
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,560
No!

132
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,861
No!

133
00:07:57,537 --> 00:08:05,611
[screaming]

134
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:09,482
-Those pesky children
won't give up.

135
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:12,151
I was so close to my goal.

136
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:15,788
-Lucemon, you are full of
hatred and bitterness.

137
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:18,357
Your evil must be destroyed.

138
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:20,192
Your spirit will be renewed,
and all your

139
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:22,028
evilness will vanish.

140
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:24,864
Now with this energy, you
will be purified!

141
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:27,066
Fractal Code Digitize.

142
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,037
-No!

143
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:07,239
[gasping]

144
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:09,041
-Lucemon's gone.

145
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:10,409
-Yeah.

146
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:11,510
We did it, guys.

147
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:13,679
-It-- it really happened.

148
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:16,515
Susanoomon was able
to take him down.

149
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:19,118
-This is fantastico!

150
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:20,953
-Outstanding.

151
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:25,091
And Koichi, I'll keep
my promise to you.

152
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:28,561
-Oh, Neemon, they fought the
unthinkable and accomplished

153
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:30,563
the unimaginable.

154
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:31,797
-It's just like you said.

155
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:33,432
Yippee!

156
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:33,899
-Great job.

157
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:34,767
-That's right.

158
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,068
-Uh-huh.

159
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:42,908
-So, I wonder what'll happen.

160
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:43,476
-Huh?

161
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,944
-Hey, what's happening?

162
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,848
-What's it doing?

163
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:52,285
-It's rising up like
a loaf of bread!

164
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:53,919
-It's growing.

165
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:54,987
This can't be good.

166
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,456
It looks evil.

167
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:08,091
-I thought Lucemon
had been scanned.

168
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,126
That means his data's
been purified.

169
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,595
So why's this Digi-Egg
acting so weird?

170
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:13,663
-Oh, no.

171
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:14,664
No that!

172
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,265
-What?

173
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:18,634
-When Susanoomon scanned
Lucemon, he may have only been

174
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:21,437
able to scan the data that was
good, which means all his evil

175
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:22,472
data still exists.

176
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,540
And I'd say it's
growing again.

177
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:27,043
-Then if your suspicions
are right--

178
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,344
-He's been stripped
of all goodness

179
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,012
and is now evil incarnate.

180
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,882
His reign of terror will
be unstoppable.

181
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,183
-But I used to like the rain.

182
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:46,195
-Whoa.

183
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,064
He looks like a dragon
to the 10th power.

Unbelievable.

NEEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Where's he going?

187
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:56,706
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
He's trying to go

188
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:57,874

189
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,776
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Oh, no!

190
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,378
-We've got to stop him.

191
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,713
-But how can we?

192
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,947
-I have no idea.

193
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:06,349
-But you know everythign,
Bokomon.

194
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:08,017
-Neemon, calm down.

195
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:09,552
We've got to follow him.

196
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,020
-Well, then let's evolve.

197
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,531
-Execute now!

198
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:23,533

00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,431
Fusion Evolution!

Spirit Evolution!

Kazemon!

213
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,889
-All Digimon are behind you.

214
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,693
You can do it!

215
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,127
Our world depends on it.

216
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,076
-He's faster than I thought.

217
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,881
But if he thinks we're gonna
let him make trouble in the

218
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,883
human world, then he's wrong.

219
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:30,553
We're not gonna let some
overgrown evil lizard take

220
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,221
over the earth and
run our lives.

221
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:34,223
No way!

222
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:37,760
I've gotta protect my family
and stop this creep.

223
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:41,363
-I can't let it stop me from
keeping my promise.

224
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:44,533
I gave my word to Koichi that I
would visit my mom and bring

225
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:47,136
her flowers, and let her know
just how important she is to

226
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:48,237
both of us.

227
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,639
She deserves all my respect.

228
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,308
-I'm doing this for
my friends.

229
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:54,443
And thanks to this adventure,
I know what

230
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:55,811
friendship really means.

231
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:57,646
It's not about chocolate
or magic tricks.

232
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,448
it's about caring.

233
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,850
I'm not afraid of protecting
my friends.

234
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:02,051
That's what real friends do.

235
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,386
-I know who I am now.

236
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,756
And I'm gonna surround myself
with new friends.

237
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:09,425
That lonely girl who couldn't
open up to anyone doesn't

238
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,893
exist anymore.

239
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,562
I'm a new person, and I
want to help everyone.

240
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:16,532
-I've learned not to be
a crybaby or a coward.

241
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:19,468
My big brother always tried
to protect me, but now he

242
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,903
doesn't have to.

243
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,571
I can't wait to show him
how much I've changed.

244
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,875
We've got to win , so
we can all go home.

245
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,382
-We have to work as a team.

246
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:39,655
We're all totally committed
to do whatever it

247
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,756
takes to stop Lucemon.

248
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:46,929
-As humans.

249
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:48,798
-And as Digimon.

250
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,267
-We are here to protect--

251
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,868
-All of the digital world.

252
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:54,637
-And the human world as well.

253
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,874
-We have to succeed!

-I don't know.

257
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,027
To me, the sky looks
kind of bizarre.

258
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:24,832
-What's this?

259
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:27,668
You must choose to follow
me or be destroyed?
