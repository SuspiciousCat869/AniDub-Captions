BOKOMON NARRATING: No one ever
promised our heroes the moon

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:05,327
and the stars, but that's
all that was left.

3
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:07,263
Everyone was wondering
what was next when

4
00:00:07,329 --> 00:00:08,497
we got a happy surprise--

5
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:09,665
baby Digimons!

6
00:00:09,665 --> 00:00:11,333
We frolicked with the cuties.

7
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:13,536
But those nasty Knights crashed
the party and scared

8
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:14,837
off the babies.

9
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:17,006
MagnaGarurumon and
EmperorGreymon had the Knights

10
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:18,874
on the ropes when Lucemon
showed up.

11
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:20,843
He scanned the Knights'
data and evolved

12
00:00:20,876 --> 00:00:22,478
into his Chaos mode.

13
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:25,014
Then he slammed our heroes back
into their human forms.

14
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:27,683
And if that wasn't enough, the
force of the fighting shook

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,851
the moon apart!

16
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:31,520
Who can stop this fiend?

17
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:33,155
THEME SONG: Digimon!

18
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:42,932
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

19
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:45,601
Digital World!

20
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:50,072
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

21
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:56,946
by the lessons we've learned
as we work towards one

22
00:00:57,012 --> 00:01:00,316
solution, through a
spirit evolution!

23
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:07,756
Digimon!

24
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,327
Forever united as
one, Digimon!

25
00:01:11,393 --> 00:01:13,662
Together the battles are won.

26
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:15,230
Digimon!

27
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,234
Through us, let your
spirit evolve.

28
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,104
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:26,275
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all!

-Whoa!

36
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:08,083
Where did that come from?

37
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,251
-Is everybody OK?

38
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:10,252
-Uh-huh.

-[groans]

40
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:11,553
-I guess so.

41
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:12,755
-I'm still standing.

42
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:14,823
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Yes,
you are on my head!

43
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:15,624
-Ooh!

44
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:17,893
-He blasted the moon to bits!

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,794
-Where's Takuya?

46
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:19,795
-And Koji?

47
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:21,797
-Maybe the flying eggs
have seen them.

48
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,631
Hello?

49
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:23,599
Eggies!

50
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:24,833
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
How very tragic!

51
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,002
Lucemon must have scanned
the data of every

52
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:28,937
Digimon on the moon.

53
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:31,774
-Well, I don't see an egg big
enough for Takky or Koji.

54
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:33,442
-Look, what's that?

55
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:35,611
PATAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Here we come!

56
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:37,479
-[laughing]

57
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,347
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Takuya!

58
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:39,648
KOUICHI (OFFSCREEN): Koji!

59
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:40,816
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Man, am
I glad to see you, guys!

60
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:41,984
JP (OFFSCREEN): Hey, not
nearly as glad as

61
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:42,818
we are to see you!

62
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:44,486
[laughs]

63
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:45,721
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): I got to
tell you, it was a little

64
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:47,156
touch-and-go there
for a while.

65
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:50,125
But then Patamon and his
buddies helped us out.

66
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,694
-They stopped Lucemon?

67
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:53,896
They're awfully powerful
for such little guys.

68
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:55,564
-Kind of like you, Tommy.

69
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,866
-Hey, well, don't forget who
these guys used to be.

70
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,069
-Well, you can bet
Lucemon hasn't!

71
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:01,670
He'll be ready for
them next time.

72
00:03:01,704 --> 00:03:03,005
And us!

73
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:06,975
[burbling]

74
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:14,817
-Out of chaos, I bring order.

75
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,391
Beautiful order, my order.

76
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:23,692
-I don't like it out here.

77
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:24,860
-Me either.

78
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:25,961
What do we do now?

79
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,029
-What can we do?

80
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,864
Lucemon is so powerful.

81
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:30,666
-There has to be a way
to defeat him.

82
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,367
We just have to come
up with a plan!

83
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,168
-[sighs]

84
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:34,336
That's what you always say.

85
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:35,537
-Um, Koji?

86
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:41,210
I wanted, uh, I just--

87
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,878
well, it's about our mom.

88
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:44,179
-I made a promise
to only call my

89
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:46,882
step-mom "mom."
-Huh?

90
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:49,184
-But I would really appreciate
it if you'd tell me about our

91
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:50,519
mother, Kouichi.

92
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:54,123
OK?

93
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:55,624
-My mom's terrific.

94
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,593
She works so hard, you know?

95
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:59,294
It wasn't easy.

96
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:01,130
There was just the two of us.

97
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:02,231
We had no one.

98
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:04,533
She raised me by herself.

99
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:07,403
Everything my mother did,
she did for me.

100
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:09,705
-She must be incredibly worried
about you right now.

101
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:13,876
Is that what's been bothering
you lately?

102
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,577
You can tell me.

103
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:17,379
-Hey, Bokomon, you said
the Legendary

104
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,014
Warriors sealed up Lucemon.

105
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:20,349
Do you know how?

106
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:22,551
-The legend only says that
they joined forces.

107
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:24,386
Then it says they
sealed him up.

108
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:26,455
I'm afraid it's not very
enlightening, is it?

109
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,590
-Not at all.
I don't get it.

110
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,292
We have the power of the Ten
Legendary Warriors, so we

111
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:31,693
should be able to do it, too.

112
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,128
-It's light and shadow!

113
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:34,630
-That's it!

114
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:35,931
-The light and the darkness
must become

115
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:38,233
one for it to work!

116
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:40,769
-If it's about the light and
darkness, then Koji and

117
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,070
Kouichi are involved.

118
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:44,072
-It does kind of figure that
those two hold the key.

-(TOGETHER) We don't
really know.

123

-Don't you wonder what
those two are

124
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:54,449
talking about over there?

125
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,251
They look so serious.

-I don't have to wonder.

127
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,755
I'm sure I know what they're
talking about.

00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:00,255
-Really?

129

What?

130
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:03,926
-About what Crusadermon
told Kouichi.

What else could they
be talking about?

00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:07,863
You told them!

You promised Kouichi you
wouldn't say anything.

135

And you just told them!

-I did not!

I didn't tell them anything!

to tell us now.

Kouichi noticed that whenever
the rest of you were hurt,

him that no matter what

00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,261
happened, his fractal
code never appeared.

152

At first, he was just curious.

00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,836
But now, he's worried
and very confused.

really hurt!

just been lucky.

-I'm afraid it is, Zoe.

160

something to do with the

way he came to the
