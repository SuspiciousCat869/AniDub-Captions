RIKA NARRATING: Having survived
his weird trip to the

2
00:00:02,953 --> 00:00:04,155
real world, Takuya returned
to the Digital

3
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:05,656
World a Mon on a mission.

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,626
He realized that being a Digimon
may be fun, but it

5
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:10,127
isn't a game.

6
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:12,296
It's serious, and so was the
trouble that JP, Zoe, and

7
00:00:12,296 --> 00:00:13,464
Tommy were in.

8
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:15,166
They were being tickle
tortured by

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,667
Mercurymon and Ranamon.

10
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:20,004
Then, out of nowhere, Lobomon
appeared to try and save them,

11
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,340
but he was still too weak from
the battle with Duskmon.

12
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:25,142
When it seemed like it was all
over, a new and more powerful

13
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:27,645
Agunimon arrived, with the power
of nature as his ally.

14
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:31,315
He saved his friends, and sent
the bad guys packing.

15
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:32,316
THEME SONG: Digimon!

16
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:42,860
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

17
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:45,196
Digital World.

18
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:49,200
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,868
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,509
As we work towards
one solution,

21
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:02,446
through a Spirit Evolution.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,048
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

23
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:05,049
Huh!

24
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:06,050
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

25
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,418
Digimon!

26
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:09,420
Forever united as one!

27
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:11,088
Digimon!

28
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:13,424
Together the battles are won!

29
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:15,025
Digimon!

30
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:17,628
Through us, let your
spirit evolve!

31
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:21,599
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all!

32
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:26,303
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all!

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,304
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

34
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:28,305
Huh!

35
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:29,273
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

36
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,834
Digimon!

37
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:37,248
Mercurymon, I am so angry
I could just spit!

38
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,416
But I won't.

39
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:40,518
After all, I'm a lady.

40
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:41,752
-Oh, really?

41
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,521
-I've never been
so embarrassed.

42
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:46,357
What do you mean by that, you
pontificating pinhead?

43
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,527
And while you're at it, why
don't you tell me why we had

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,828
to run away like fraidy cats?

45
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:51,862
We could've beaten those
little twerps!

46
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,135
-Ranamon, Ranamon, poor
pathetic simpleton.

47
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:02,973
Dost thou knowest Nothing
They've become aware-- aware

48
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,675
of the true power of nature
that dwelleth within their

49
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,010
Legendary Spirits.

50
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:08,479
-Huh?

51
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,513
You lost me.

52
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,848
Hey, are those snowflakes?

53
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:16,921
-I welcome thy challenge,
humans.

54
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:19,156
Follow, if you must.

55
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,724
-Where are you going?

56
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,059
You didn't answer
my questions.

57
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:23,394
-Ah, thy vanity stuffeth
thine ears, I fear.

58
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:24,695
-Can't you just speak English?

59
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:25,896
So what?

60
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,364
Are you gonna take
them on yourself?

61
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:28,399
I'm a Legendary Warrior, too!

62
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:29,066
Don't I get a vote?

63
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:29,900
Mercurymon!

64
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:31,435
-Farewell.

65
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:33,737
Now, Duskmon, where art thou?

66
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:37,741
Thou remain a mystery
to me still.

67
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,243
-Oh, great.

68
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,877
As if things weren't bad enough,
now we have to worry

69
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,911
about Duskmon?

70
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:53,891
-I don't understand.

71
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:57,495
I am not a being of mercy
and compassion.

72
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:59,997
Why do I feel anything
for this human?

73
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:07,104
-You shall be first!

74
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:08,005
-No!

75
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:09,940
Kouji!

76
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:11,008
-Kouji?

77
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:14,278
-Kouji, why?

78
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:19,483
-This Kouji disturbs
my concentration.

79
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:20,851
Who are you?

80
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:28,626
No matter.

81
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:30,327
I shall find out soon enough.

82
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,700
-Thank heavens you're
back together again.

83
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:39,003
So, is everybody ready to go?

84
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:41,038
-But where are we
going, Bokomon?

85
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,706
-You're going to follow
me and stop

86
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,241
asking ridiculous questions.

87
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,677
-Next stop, the Rose Morning
Star, right?

88
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,046
-And try to keep up.

89
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:49,847
-I'm the leader.

90
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,348
Follow me, everybody.

91
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:53,050
-Oh, well.

92
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:56,520
-One, two, three, four, follow
me as we explore!

93
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:59,089
And five and six and seven and
eight, I cannot stand an empty

94
00:03:59,089 --> 00:03:59,590
plate!

95
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:00,925
-Who elected him?

96
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:01,959
Not exactly inspirational
as a leader.

97
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,928
-It looks like he's just
showing off to me.

98
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:04,962
-What if we don't want to
see what he's showing?

99
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,598
-I want a turn being
the leader.

100
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:08,599
-I don't know.

101
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:09,433
Leadership takes independence.

102
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,801
You ready for that?

103
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,771
-Hey, JP depends on chocolate,
and that didn't stop him.

104
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:15,439
-He's got a point there.

105
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,607
-Well, I guess it's
settled, then.

106
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,942
You're the next leader, Tommy.

107
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:18,442
I sure hope your marching song's
better than that dorky

108
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,443
one he's got.

109
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,945
-Oh, you're so funny.

110
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:36,694
-Whoa!

111
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:37,995
-Neemon, help!

112
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,502
Well, there's something new.

113
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,837
-Whoa!

114
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:53,477
-Do you mind?

115
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,813
Get off me!

116
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:57,014
-Sorry about that, Zoe.

117
00:04:57,081 --> 00:05:00,017
-I really am getting tired
of falling all the time.

118
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,585
-I don't know how we
got here, but it

119
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:02,720
looks like we're trapped.

120
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:03,988
-Are you serious?

121
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:08,559
Ugh, there's got to
be a way out.

122
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,226
Feels kind of spongy.

123
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,395
This isn't normal rock.

124
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:12,730
-Huh?

125
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,370
Ai-yi-yi, dead end.

126
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,739
Whoa!

127
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:23,040
-Zoe, where's JP?

128
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,143
-I saw him go that way.

129
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,479
-The owner's sure got
a scary decorator.

130
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:30,080
JP!
Where are you?

131
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,610
-All right, who's the
punk who pushed me?

132
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:43,145
This isn't what the inside
of an eye looked

133
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,481
like in science class.

134
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:46,448
Guys?

135
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,416
Takuya?

136
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,751
Kouji?

137
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:50,152
Zoe?

138
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,154
Tommy, can you hear me?

139
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:55,124
Hey, what the heck happened
to everybody?

140
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:56,492
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): It's
just you and me now.

141
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:57,493
-Huh?

142
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,128
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
[laughing]

143
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:01,430
-Very funny.

144
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:03,365
Who are you?

145
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,300
Whoa!

146
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:09,605

147
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:12,274
D-TECTOR NARRATING: Volcamon, a
cyborg Digimon who uses his

148
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:15,344
microphone to project his
Magma Bass attack.

149
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:17,312
You'll get a really bad
vibe from this guy.

150
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:24,186
-Hey, what's your
beef with me?

151
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:26,989
-You invaded my space.

152
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,525
I don't have any friends,
just like you.

153
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:30,659
Poor baby.

154
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,327
-What?

155
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:34,530
-I enjoy being alone, but you
actually think you've got

156
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,164
friends.

157
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:37,433
-You don't even know me!

158
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,334
-I know you better than
you know yourself, JP.

159
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,836
-What do you mean?

160
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:42,838
-One of your so-called friends
pushed you through the portal

161
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:43,839
to this place.

162
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,741
They wanted to get rid of you.

163
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:46,675
-Huh?

164
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,010
-Who elected him?

165
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:49,878
Not exactly inspirational
as a leader.

166
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:52,047
-It looks like he's just
showing off to me.

167
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:53,582
-What if we don't want to
see what he's showing?

168
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:57,119
-I want a turn being
the leader.

169
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:58,287
VOLCAMON: Looks like little
Tommy is going to get

170
00:06:58,353 --> 00:06:59,755
his turn after all.

171
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:01,423
You're conceited and selfish.

172
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:02,925
Nobody wants you around, JP.

173
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:04,727
That's why they sent you here.

174
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,828
-Huh?

175
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:07,262
-You know it's true,
don't you?

176
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,430
Why fight it?

177
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:10,599
Why don't you let me put
you out of your misery?

178
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,600
-You're a liar!

179
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,102
My friends have never
felt that way!

180
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:14,470
You're the one who's
miserable!

181
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,647
Execute!

182
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:26,982
Spirit Evolution!

183
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:47,202
Beetlemon!

184
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,704
-You're just a waste of
space to everybody!

185
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,038
Tackling time!

186
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,743
You're only kidding yourself,
little man!

187
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:56,245
You're all by yourself here!

188
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:58,180
-I'm getting real
tired of you!

189
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,251
Thunder Fist!

190
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:06,221
-Life just stinks, don't it?

191
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:08,090
But I'll take care
of that for you.

192
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:12,795
Magma Bass!

193
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:21,937
Hey, at least you're
not alone!

194
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,372
I'll keep you company.

195
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:26,942
At least until I'm done playing
our little game.

196
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:27,943
-My head!

197
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:28,944
Stop it!

198
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:29,945
Please!

199
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:30,946
-You can't escape!

200
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:31,914
You know I'm right!

201
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:32,915
Just surrender!

202
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,116
You can't fight!

203
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:35,818
It's time to say good night!

204
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:39,421
Bye bye!

205
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:40,455
Later, lonely boy!

206
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,295
-I may have some issues,
but I think I know

207
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:47,429
who my friends are.

208
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:50,365
And you're not one of them!

209
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,433
Thunder Fist!

210
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:56,004
Proton Slam!

211
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,017
That's the name of that song.

212
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:10,319
I'm going to purify your
evil attitude, dude.

213
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:15,057
At least you won't be
lonely anymore.

214
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:18,360
Fractal Code Digitize!

215
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:19,995
-I tried to warn you!

216
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,197
Now you have to live with
the sad reality that

217
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:23,265
you're all alone, JP!

218
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:40,415
-No!

219
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:41,950
He was lying!

220
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:43,585
He had to be!

221
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:46,588
My friends would never just
abandon me like that.

222
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:48,557
Would they?

223
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,091
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
I don't know.

224
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:50,092
Would they?

225
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:51,793
-Who said that?

226
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,096
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, I think they would.

227
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:55,731
-What?

228
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:56,698
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Unless
they're real friends.

229
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:59,735
But you've never had any
of those, have you?

230
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:01,470
-Oh, man, I'm losing it.

231
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:02,237
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Perhaps.

232
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:03,505
But think back for a moment.

233
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:06,475
Remember your classmates
at school?

234
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:07,643
-See?

235
00:10:07,643 --> 00:10:10,612
Nothing here but a plain
white handkerchief.

236
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:13,181
Observe as I take it like this,
and gently lay it across

237
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,984
my hand, stir in a little
magic, and ta-da!

238
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:16,685
-Wow!

239
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:17,286
-That's amazing!

240
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,455
-You're great, JP!

241
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,124
-Now, who wants to take
home a monster card?

242
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:26,628
[thunderclap]

243
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:27,496
-Oh, boy.

244
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:28,830
Weather man blew it.

245
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:30,332
-Sure wasn't expecting that.

246
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,334
-Man, it's really coming
down out there.

247
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:34,569
-I didn't even bring
an umbrella.

248
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:35,704
-I have one in my locker.

249
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:37,139
You want to share it with me?

250
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:38,040
-Gee, thanks.

251
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:39,241
-Hey, can I come?

252
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:41,209
I've got some more cards.

253
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:42,210
-So?

254
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:43,545
They got a little distracted.

255
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:44,680
Kids do that.

256
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:45,347
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, really?

257
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,882
-Yes, really!

258
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:48,216
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Remember what happened next?

259
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:55,057
-I'm sure someone will
walk with me.

260
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:56,558
-Later, man.

261
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,559
Thanks, Kenta.

262
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:58,894
-No prob, dude.

263
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,228
-Wait.

264
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:03,436
Huh?

265
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:05,039
Give you some chocolate
if I can walk home--

266
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,201
-See you.

267
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:07,703
-Under your umbrella.

268
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:13,976
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You
wanted everyone to like you,

269
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,711
so you tried to win their
friendship with chocolate and

270
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:17,746
magic tricks.

271
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,748
You have no real friends.

272
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:20,782
You know why?

273
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:23,118
Because you don't think
you deserve them.

274
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:26,088
-[screaming]

275
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:29,091
Leave me alone!

276
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:31,326
[crying]

277
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:37,799
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): It's
time to face reality, JP.

278
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,801
You can't hide from
you anymore.

279
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,603
-I'm Beetlemon!

280
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,839
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, that's a nice, strong hiding place.

281
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:44,940
-Be quiet!

282
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:45,874
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
But I see you.

283
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:48,176
And so do all your so-called
friends.

284
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:51,013
Inside all that armor, you're
just a scared, lonely little

285
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,014
boy.

286
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:53,215
-You don't know anything!

287
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:54,182
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Takuya, Zoe,

288
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:56,485
they're laughing at you.

289
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:57,686
-[yells]

290
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,353
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
That hurt.

291
00:11:58,353 --> 00:11:59,354
[laughing]

292
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:01,023
-Show yourself, you coward!

293
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:03,325
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Come on, chocolate boy.

294
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:06,261
Who are you really fighting?

295
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:07,863
-Who are you?

296
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:08,864
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Just a reflection of

297
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,198
the real you, JP.

298
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,600
I am your shadow.

299
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,836
As long as you are
alive, I exist.

300
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:15,837
-This is crazy!

301
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:28,283
-Takuya, what's the matter?

302
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:30,252
-You hear something?

303
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:31,086
-No.

304
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,120
More like a feeling.

305
00:12:32,187 --> 00:12:34,623
JP's in trouble.

306
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:35,724
Whoa!

307
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:42,431
-Gross!

308
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:44,166
-Guess that feeling was right.

309
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:45,500
-Go away, slimey!

310
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:48,503
Back, back!

311
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:50,138
-Block buster!

312
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:51,473
Oops.

313
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:52,474
-Come on!

314
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:53,809
-Sorry, Takuya.

315
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:03,452
-Execute!

316
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:04,786
Spirit Evolution!

317
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,669
-Agunimon!

318
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,582
-Lobomon!

319
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:45,560
-Kazemon!

320
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:01,643
-Kumamon!

321
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:03,645
-Wanna grab something?

322
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:06,648
Try my Pyro Punch!

323
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:07,949
-Lobo Kendo!

324
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:14,122
-Hurricane Wave!

325
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:15,123
-Crystal Freeze!

326
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:21,930
-These things probably
attacked JP, too.

327
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:23,265
-But where is he now?

328
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:23,932
-The eyeball.

329
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:25,133
-Hm?

330
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,601
-My guess is it's some kind
of portal, and he's

331
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:28,436
on the other side.

332
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:30,338
-I'm not beat yet!

333
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,177
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Missed me!

334
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:39,214
Just like you missed your chance
to have real friends.

335
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:40,182
-You're wrong!

336
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:41,516
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Am I?

337
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,219
-I don't know anymore.

338
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:46,021
Maybe he's right.

339
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,723
Maybe I've been fooling myself
this whole time.

340
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,525
Living my life like
some twisted,

341
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:51,726
sugar-coated nightmare.

342
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:54,996
Is it possible that you guys
are just part of my

343
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,499
self-inflicted bad dream?

344
00:14:57,532 --> 00:14:59,334
Somebody, please wake me up!

345
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:03,605
What now?

346
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:09,244
Oh, this can't be good.

347
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:15,050
Whoa.

348
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,384
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
[laughing]

349
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:18,753
Hiya, handsome.

350
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:19,921
-There you are.

351
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:21,756
Nice of you to show up.

352
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,091
-I've been here all the time.

353
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:24,893
I've always been with you.

354
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:27,729
I've never left your side.

355
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,097
-You're wrong about me.

356
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:33,168
Takuya, Zoe, Tommy, even Kouji
taught me how to be a real

357
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:34,169
friend.

358
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:35,804
-But have you chosen to be?

359
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,575
-You're no friend of mine, JP!

360
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:41,910
You're a fake!

361
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:44,646
-I've never liked you,
and I never will!

362
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,982
-You're just a big bully
and a coward!

363
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:47,949
-This isn't real!

364
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:49,484
This is just part
of my bad dream.

365
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,019
Come on, wake up!

366
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:51,987
-You're busted!

367
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,321
The game's over!

368
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:57,492
[angry chatter]

369
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:58,793
-Nobody likes you!

370
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,328
Nobody ever did!

371
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:01,663
Nobody like you!

372
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,298
-Beetlemon wants a baby!

373
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,499
-Enough!

374
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:06,568
Let's settle this once and
for all, you and me!

375
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,570
-Oh, now you want to fight?

376
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:10,305
But I am you--

377
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,907
your past, your present,
and your future.

378
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:14,809
What do you hope to gain?

379
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:17,212
-My life back, for starters.

380
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:20,015
If I can defeat the old me,
I can rebuild a new one!

381
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,716
-Sounds like fun.

382
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,052
Bring it on, tough guy.

383
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:25,164
Toro!

384
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:28,890
[laughs]

385
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:30,225
-Thunder Fist!

386
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:35,230
-Nice try!

387
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,133
Sorry, big blue, but that
attack is useless on me.

388
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,634
-Oh, great.

389
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:41,770
-I am your shadow, remember?

390
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,204
Equal and opposite.

391
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:45,774
Well, actually, you've
made me stronger.

392
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:49,611
By the way, if you destroy
me, you destroy yourself.

393
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:51,780
-I don't care!

Show no mercy!

Show no mercy!

-Don't you hear them
out there, JP?

402
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,036
How could you have ever thought

403
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,671
they were your friends?

404
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,273
The truth hurts.

405
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,176
But in a few moments, I'll
free you from your pain,

406
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,577
permanently.

-Those aren't my friends.

409
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:32,023
They're a bunch of fakes.

410
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:34,726
I believe in my friends,
and they believe in me.

411
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,228
And there's nothing you could
ever do to change that.

412
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:38,563
[crowd chanting]

413
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:40,064
-Then where are they?

414
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:40,565
-Give it up!

415
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:42,066
Give it up!

416
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,903
-Don't you think they'd be here
if they cared about you?

417
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:47,405
-You never did belong here,
or anywhere else!

418
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:49,607
-You must have done
something to them.

419
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:52,043
They'll be here, and you
can't stop that!

420
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,977
-What?

421
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:54,279
-JP!

422
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:59,951
Are you all right?

423
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:01,419
-Of course I am!

424
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:04,455
-Oh, now that's weird.

425
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:07,659
-What is this, some kind of
evil house of mirrors?

426
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:08,714
Huh?

427

-Hey, about time!

They came!

430
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:13,798
I told you they're my friends.

431
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:16,134
-They probably just want
something from you.

432
00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:17,702
Whatever.

433
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:20,104
I'll dispatch them as soon
as I'm finished with you.

Huh?

What are you, huts?

447
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:17,462
You blow this thing at
this range, we're

448
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:18,763
both going to go down!

-I don't care!

450
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:21,599
It's a risk I'm willing
to take to save my

00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,102
friends from you!

-Did Kouji just call me Jeep?

Hey, you really are
my friends.

-Of course, you bonehead.

-Yeah, but don't tell
anybody, all right?

-I was worried about you, JP!

-I'm just happy you're
all right.

464
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,161
-You mean that?

465

-Sure.

466

-I'm sorry.

467
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:52,497
-Why?

468
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,664
-I doubted our friendship.

469
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:54,832
It was terrible.

470
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:56,401
I felt like nobody
cared about me.

471
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:59,303
-Of course we care about you.

472

-Thanks.

473
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:02,040
I'll never doubt our
friendship again.

You guys are like
family to me.

You're the best friends
I've ever had.

476

Thanks for coming.

477

I love you people!

478
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:11,549
-OK, now I'm uncomfortable.

479

-Sorry.

480
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,085
It's been kind of an emotional
day, you know?
