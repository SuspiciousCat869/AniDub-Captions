1
00:00:01,632 --> 00:00:02,700
NARRATOR: You'd think after
handing Cherubimon a heaping

2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:05,870
helping of defeat everything
would be fine, right?

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,371
Wrong.

4
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:09,740
The gang was soon attacked by
that frozen freak IceDevimon,

5
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:11,709
who only wanted to toy
with them before

6
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:13,244
gobbling up their data.

7
00:00:13,277 --> 00:00:16,580
He froze Koji and Takuya's
D-Tectors then trapped the

8
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:17,882
others in ice so he could pick
them off one by one.

9
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:21,852
JagerLoweemon fought IceDevimon,
but Korikakumon

10
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:25,556
freed the others and luckily
they were able to stop the

11
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:27,191
evil dude from chilling
and purify his data.

12
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:28,525
But then Cherubimon came back.

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,894
Don't these guys ever
get a break?

14
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:32,897
Digimon.

15
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:41,305
THEME SONG: We look to the past
as we head for the future

16
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:44,275
to reclaim the digital world.

17
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:49,580
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other we live by

18
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:53,617
the lessons we've learned.

19
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:56,153
As we work towards one

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,957
solution, to a spirit evolution.

21
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,063
Digimon.

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,099
Forever united as one.

23
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:09,867
Digimon.

24
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:12,636
Together the battles are won.

25
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,974
Digimon through us let
your spirit evolve.

26
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:21,612
If we're all one world there's
a world for us all.

27
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:28,285
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

28
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:29,620
Digimon.

29
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:39,663
-Wow!

30
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:41,865
Look at all those pretty,
floaty thingies.

31
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:43,967
-Sorry to burst your blissful
bubble of imbecility, but

32
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:44,701
those are not thingies.

33
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:45,402
-Oh yeah?

34
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:46,803
Then what are they?

35
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,572
Hm?

36
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:52,709
-Well, um, I don't know.

37
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:55,012
But sea thingies do not glow.

38
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:56,046
-Oh, OK.

39
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:16,900
-Whatever it is, it sure is
sucking up a lot of data.

40
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:22,372
-Whoa.

41
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:23,373
-Oh, boy.

42
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:24,708
Now what?

43
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,048
Cherubimon--

44
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,383
he's definitely up to
something up there.

45
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:34,918
I can feel it.

46
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:36,887
-I don't know about the rest
of you, but I've had just

47
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:38,221
about enough of that guy.

48
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:48,599
-Apparently the space and
gravity data is being affected

49
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:50,467
by some sort of energy wall.

50
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,370
-Or by those glowing thingies.

51
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:54,638
-Oh, Neemon.

52
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,473
Would you please stop it with
your thingy thingy.

53
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:02,179
-I think it's time
to finish this.

54
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:02,713
How about it?

55
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:03,547
Are you with me?

56
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:04,881
-Uh huh.

57
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:07,751
I guess we have to do
something, right?

58
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:09,019
-Definitely.

59
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:12,189
And you and I are the only
ones who can do it.

60
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:16,460
-I bet Bokomon and I could do
it if I only had the nerve.

61
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:19,896
-I bet Neemon and I could do
it if he only had a brain.

62
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:30,107
-Well, all righty then.

63
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,743
-Win this battle and you could
save the digital world.

64
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:36,446
-Yeah, we really could, huh?

65
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:38,782
-You bet.

66
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:41,952
-Well, I'm game if you are.

67
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:43,954
You don't mind staying behind?

68
00:03:43,987 --> 00:03:44,988
-Aw, come on.

69
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:46,456
Why would we mind?

70
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:49,126
After all, you're the ones who
have to fight Cherubimon.

71
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:50,961
EmporerGreymon and
MagnaGarurumon are the only

72
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:51,628
ones strong enough.

73
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:52,629
But don't worry.

74
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:54,164
We'll be here rooting for you.

75
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:56,333
-Wow, I'm touched.

76
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,167
-I'm touched.

77
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,368
Touch this.

78
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,270
Just remember, pally.

79
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:02,939
If you lose, you'll have
to answer to me.

80
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:04,107
-Right.

81
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,810
-Relax, J.P. We got everything
under control.

82
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:08,645
-Yeah.

83
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,480
I'm glad to hear it men.

84
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:13,116
And we'll all celebrate
once you've won.

85
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,753
-Yeah, when you defeat
Cherubimon I'm going to cook a

86
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:17,754
big yummy dinner for everybody

87
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:19,523
-I want to contribute
something.

88
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:20,791
I know!

89
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:22,459
When you win you can
take me on a date.

90
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:24,094
-What?

91
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,296
-Yeah and I'm going to give you
both a great big kiss on

92
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:26,863
the cheek.

93
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:28,332
-That's just wrong.

94
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:30,267
-I'm going to knit you both
matching waistbands to look

95
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,601
exactly like mine.

96
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:32,703
-Bokomon you really shouldn't.

97
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:37,307
-But I--

98
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,511
-Before you go, there's
something I need to tell you.

99
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:42,846
-Mm hm?

100
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,217
-You can do this.

101
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,385
-Yeah.

102
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:51,521
-I believe in you brother.

103
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:53,090
-OK.

104
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:54,024
Well then.

105
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:55,859
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

106
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:57,427
How about it?

107
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,095
-Hm.

108
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,430
Oh yeah.

109
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,499
Now let's go make
some history.

110
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:03,433
-Then go already.

111
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,335
I've got some rooting to do.

112
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:10,807
-We're coming for
you, Cherubimon.

113
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:23,220
-I don't know what's going to
happen up there, but I do know

114
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:24,821
we'll need you guys to
believe in us with

115
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:25,722
everything you've got.

116
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:27,157
You up for that?

117
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,693
-Definitely.

118
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:32,863
-Let's bring peace back
to this world.

119
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,831
-This could be our
last battle.

120
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:37,734
I'm proud to be fighting
it with you, Takuya.

121
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,603
-I guess we'd better
win then, huh?

122
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:41,605
-Yeah.

123
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:43,573
-Go get 'em, guys.

124
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:44,908
We'll be here waiting for you.

125
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:56,119
-Unity execute.

126
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,423
Unified spirit evolution.

127
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:13,937
EmporerGreymon.

128
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:26,750
-Unity execute.

129
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,085
Unified spirit evolution.

130
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:43,667
MagnaGarurumon.

131
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,001
-Are you ready?

132
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:46,169
-Mm hm.

133
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:47,504
-Let's do it.

134
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,275
-Don't mess up, guys.

135
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:53,276
Hey, but no pressure.

136
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:53,977
-Get 'em!

137
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,978
Get 'em!
Get 'em!

138
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:58,181
Get 'em!

139
00:06:58,248 --> 00:06:59,616
-Stay tough!

140
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,085
We believe in you.

141
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:03,086
-Right fast!

142
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,087
-Right hurry.

143
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,121
I'm hungry.

144
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:13,096
-Come back safely.

145
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:13,997
Oh, dear.

146
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,498
Just come back.

147
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:38,021
-The compression of the data
is working perfectly.

148
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:39,489
[evil laughter]

149
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:43,159
-The human children have been
a source of great irritation

150
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:51,368
but oddly, because
of them it seems

151
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:52,636
you're that much sweeter.

152
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:13,323
-I think he knows we're here.

153
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:13,990
-Mm hm.

154
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:15,125
I feel him.

155
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:18,395
[evil laughter]

156
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:20,897
-So you've come back to play.

157
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:23,033
You may have lived a little
longer had you not.

158
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,705
Take a look.

159
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:32,075
Do you know what this is?

160
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:34,044
Well, then let me
enlighten you.

161
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:36,513
This orb contains all of the
data I have collected from the

162
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,214
digital world.

163
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,683
-But why?

164
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:40,684
-Yeah.

165
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:42,385
What exactly do you plan
to do with that?

166
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:44,554
-Make it a part of me.

167
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:45,355
-Great.

168
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:47,390
What does that mean?

169
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,358
-He's insane.

170
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:49,059
-Yes.

171
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,527
Perhaps I am.

172
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,196
But once I've assimilated this
compressed data, I will be

173
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:54,230
invincible.

174
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:04,708
It is done.

175
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:09,079
And now I shall relieve you
of the legendary spirits.

176
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:12,048
-I don't think so.

177
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:15,919
Not as long as I'm breathing.

178
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:17,020
Mega missile.

179
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:26,563
Magna rockets.

180
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:34,938
-Missed again.

181
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,740
-Whoa.
Calm down.

182
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:37,307
Did you really think it
would be that easy?

183
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,308
-You're right.

184
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:39,943
We need to get focused here.

185
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:41,411
-Yeah.

186
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:43,813
-What are those lights?

187
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,483
-The beginning of a very
battle, I'm afraid.

188
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:47,650
-Storm of judgment.

189
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,862
Ah, very well.

190
00:09:58,895 --> 00:09:59,963
Lightning spear.

191
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:09,172
-Is that the best you've got?

192
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:11,474
He's pretty quick.

193
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:12,375
I'll drive him this way.

194
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:13,476
Back me up.

195
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,711
-I'll be ready.

196
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,184
-Hey, ugly.

197
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:22,485
Wanna dance?

198
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:31,161
Sorry, you're not getting
away this time.

199
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:33,363
-For someone with so much
courage, you are a little

200
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:34,764
short on brains.

201
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:36,266
I was merely testing you.

202
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:37,500
-Test over.

203
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:41,271
Time to teach you a lesson.

204
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,239
Gotta get closer.

205
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,107
More power!

206
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,078
I need more power.

207
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:49,212
-I know.

208
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,253
Gotcha!

209
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:01,691
-No!

210
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:08,331
You had me.

211
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:09,933
-Almost ready.

212
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:12,268
Just a little bit more.

213
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:13,570
Dragon fire crossbow.

214
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,041
[screams]

215
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,420
-I hope that worked.

216
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:32,422
[groans]

217
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:33,423
-What?

218
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:34,424
-Valiant effort.

219
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,593
Impressive strategy.

220
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,928
Oh, but did I mention
that I'm invincible?

221
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:40,263
-That's impossible.

222
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,299
-Not when you possess as
much data as I do.

223
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,467
Thank you.

224
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:46,803
That was quite refreshing.

225
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:47,804
-His body--

226
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:49,305
it's regenerating!

227
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,974
-Even stronger.

228
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:52,142
And you will be my
first victims.

229
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:58,481
[roars]

230
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,100
-He's huge.

231
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,868
And he looks mad.

232
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,771
-Tell me, are you afraid now?

233
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:18,672
-No way.

234
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:22,476
I don't care how big you are.

235
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,677
-You don't scare me either.

236
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:24,711
-That will change.

237
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,679
Watch out.

238
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,847
The sky is falling.

239
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,222
Let's swing.

240
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,223
Get ready.

241
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,324
I'm about to rock your world.

242
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,068
-Nice trick.

243
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,070
But you've got to do
better than that.

244
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,238
-Perhaps you'll like this one.

245
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,211
[groans]

246
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,514
-Are castles supposed
to do that?

247
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,815
-No.

248
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,687
-What's happening?

249
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,489
-Just a little demonstration
to show you who's still in

250
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,325
charge around here.

251
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,928
Now, to finish the job.

252
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:15,996
Frozen spears.

253
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,908
[groans]

254
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:28,909
-Aha.

255
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:32,713
Maybe one more.

256
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,248
-Terminal judgment.

257
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,088
-We're not done yet.

258
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,122
No way!

259
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,675
-Where am I?

260
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:03,277
-In the middle of our date.

261
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,611
-Uh our what?

262
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,046
-Silly boy.

263
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,614
Don't you remember?

264
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:10,884
I promised I would go out on
a date with you if you won.

265
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,886
I'm sorry I'm so boring.

266
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,287
-But you're not.

267
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,623
I mean, I guess I'm
just really tired.

268
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,059
-Well, that of quite a battle.

269
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,927
Maybe you should sleep
some more.

270
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,429
-OK.

271
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,766
-Leave me alone!

272
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,235
I risked my hiney
out there, too.

273
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,971
How come Takuya got to
go out on a date?

274
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,306
-Looks like Koji's got his
hands full out there.

275
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,143
But I suppose after what you
guys have been through, he

276
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,178
should be able to
handle anything.

277
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,014
-Yeah, but I got to say, I'd
much rather be doing what I'm

278
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,683
doing than doing what
he's doing.

279
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,151
Guess I will take that nap.

280
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,323
[gasps]

281
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,491
-What?

282
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:52,325
Oh no.

283
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,627
We're still here.

284
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,328
It was just a dream.

285
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,664
We're not done yet.

286
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,399
MagnaGarurumon, wake up.

287
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,569

00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,403
-Amazing.

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,472
You're still alive.

290
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,673
-You're telling me.

291
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,141
Can you still fight?

292
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:08,842
-Yeah.

293
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,644
I think so.

294
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:11,945
-No rush.

295
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,814
Perhaps I should enjoy
my new powers.

296
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,983
You're such willing playmates.

297
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:17,451
-Look!

298
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,318
He's moving.

299
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,486
Oh no!

300
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,822
I think they're in trouble.

00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:22,289
-Oh.

00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,156
-Don't worry.

303
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,324
They'll be all right.

304
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:27,327
But we all have to
believe in them.

305
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,161
-Z's right.

306
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,163
We can't give up on them yet.

307
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,832
I believe.
-Me too.

308
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,069
-Oh!

309
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:38,905
-Fools!

310
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,574
Why do you resist
the inevitable?

311
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,876
Give me your spirits.

312
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,378
-He's too strong.

313
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,213
-Forehead.

314
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,681
-What?

315
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,416
-It's his forehead.

316
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,718
Beams of light seem to shoot
out from it every time he's

317
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,220
about to launch an attack.

318
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,422
It's got to the a source
of his power.

319
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,224
-So what we do?

320
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,192
Our attacks are useless
from a distance.

321
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,161
We've got to strike
at close range.

322
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,663
If we can find a way to release
the compressed data

323
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,633
stored in his forehead, he'll
have a sudden loss of energy.

324
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,201
Then we can take him out.

325
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,236
-OK.

326
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,238
But how are we supposed
to get that close?

327
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:14,241
-I fly in first and distract him
while you come in behind

328
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,209
me and go straight
for the forehead.

329
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,344
-Why should you go first?

330
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,712
My armor's stronger
than yours.

331
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,915
-And what am I supposed to
do once I get there?

332
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:25,185
In case you didn't notice,
my attacks were useless.

333
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,854
The only way to get him
is with your sword.

334
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,524
Once we're up there, it's
all going to be on you.

335
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:31,558
So what do you say?

336
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,527
Think you can handle it?

337
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,629
-Well, sure.

338
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,229
No problem.

339
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,898
-Atta boy.

340
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,399
-I'm tired of waiting.

341
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,734
Good bye.

342
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,448
Come seal your fate.

343
00:16:55,482 --> 00:17:00,687
[roars]

344
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,222
-Bring it on.

345
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,524
I can take anything
you've got.

346
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:11,064
-1,000 spears.

347
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,400
-Hang in there, Koji.

348
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,035
Almost there.

349
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,937
I can do this.

350
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:17,971
-Lightning blast.

351
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,747
-No Takuya!

352
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,624
-Koji!

353
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,292
-Go get him, buddy.

354
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:42,295
[screams]

355
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,363
-Give up your spirit.

356
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,299
I'm going to take it, anyway.

357
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,035
-You're not taking anything
ever again!

358
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,037
-What makes you think
you can stop me?

359
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,339
You're all alone.

360
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:56,676
1,000 spears!

361
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,677
-I'm not alone.

362
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,212
I can feel them.

363
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,948
The spirits of all my
friends are with me.

364
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,251
That is the source
of my power.

365
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,120
As long as they believe,
nothing can stop me.

366
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,588
-No!

367
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,123
-You're done Cherubimon.

368
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:14,594
It's time to restore the peace
of the digital world!

369
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,101
-No!
Stay back!

370
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,503
Get away from me.

371
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,672
-I hope Takuya believes
in himself as much as

372
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:26,940
we believe in him.

373
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:35,882
-Let's finish this.

374
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,694
Good bye, Cherubimon.

375
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,569
I don't know if all that evil
can fit in my D-Tector.

376
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:59,239
If anyone needs purification,
this guy does.

377
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,874
Fractal code digitize.

378
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:10,350
-See ya soon, Cherubimon.

379
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,572
-Hey, you OK?

380
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,573
-Did we get him?

381
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,508
-Oh yeah.

382
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,910
-Well, then I'm fine.

383
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:42,616
-Koji.

384
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,621
-I hope they survived that.

385
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:56,062
-Takuya.

386
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:57,330
-Koji.

387
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,335
-Hey!

388
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,006
-Oh yeah!

389
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:06,639
Oh yeah.

390
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:07,974
Oh yeah.

391
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,227
-Cherubimon.

392
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,895
You pitiful fool.

393
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,163
You failed me.

394
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,831
No matter.

395
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,634
As long as I have the data you
collected, my resurrection

396
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,403
will soon be complete.

397
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,709
Rise up, my royal knights.

398
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,044
It is now up to you.

399
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,888
NARRATOR: Oh, great.

400
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,023
There's somebody worse than
that creep Cherubimon?

401
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:59,025
This ought to be good.

402
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,562
On the next Digimon
Digital Monsters.
