1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,836
NARRATOR: The gang headed off
for the Rose Morning Star, but

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,005
the trip was cut short as the
kids were blown into this

3
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,506
freaky eyeball thing.

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,176
While trying to find an exit, JP
was pushed through a portal

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,677
into another dimension.

6
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,180
There he met Volcamon, became
Beetlemon, then battled and

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,682
beat the belligerent baddie, but
not before getting a big

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,150
dose of self-doubt.

9
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,486
Then his own shadow appeared
with thousands of evil clones

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,822
of his friends, telling him they
never really liked him in

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,023
the first place.

12
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,558
JP fought through his
fears and blew

13
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,159
away the shadow beastie.

14
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,929
But just when the real gang
showed up, they all got shoved

15
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,530
in their own wacky dimensions.

16
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,865
THEME SONG: Digimon!

17
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:41,909
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

18
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,411
digital world.

19
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:49,583
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

20
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:56,456
by the lessons we've learned
as we work towards one

21
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:01,261
solution, through our
spirit evolution.

22
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,263
I am the one.

23
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,432
I am the one.

24
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:09,469
Digimon, forever
united as one.

25
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,806
Digimon, together the
battles are won.

26
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:17,110
Digimon, through us let
your spirit evolve.

27
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:21,114
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

28
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:25,819
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,820
I am the one.

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,822
I am the one.

31
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,225
Digimon!

32
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,226
YUTAKA (OFFSCREEN):
No way, dude.

33
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,228
It just wouldn't be cool.

34
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,831
TV: --Power of the universe!

35
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,299
-That is so cool.

36
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,701
Can I have one?

37
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,869
-Sure, let's buy three.

38
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,870
-For your second bedroom!

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,205
YUTAKA (OFFSCREEN): Not
happening, man.

40
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,573
-Oh, wow, you guys are the
greatest, but I really only

41
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,374
need one--

42
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,909
-Hold on.

43
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,043
Tommy, are you dense?

44
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,411
They were teasing you.

45
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,679
And I'm on the phone here.

46
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:53,513
Could you give it a rest?

47
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,015
I can't hear myself think.

48
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,684
-Yutaka, please don't use that
tone with your little brother.

49
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:58,752
He's just a baby.

50
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,886
You'll hurt his feelings.

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,555
-She's right.

52
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,056
You can plot your romantic
conquests just as well from

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,091
the upstairs phone.

54
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,226
-Yeah, go upstairs!

55
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,394
-Ugh.

56
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,530
OK, fine.

57
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,533
You know, Tommy, you'd be
happier if you didn't always

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,768
get your way.

59
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,269
-What do you mean?

60
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,471
YUTAKA (OFFSCREEN): You
think of yourself.

61
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,774
It must drive your friends
crazy, if you have any.

62
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:21,942
-Ah, you're being pooey.

63
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,111
I have lots of friends.

64
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,780
-Yeah? then why are you the
couch with Mom and Dad?

65
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,614
-Because I want to.

66
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,916
Want to make something of it?

67
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,751
-Hmph.

68
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,586
-[whimper]

69
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,121
-You guys aren't doing him
any favors, you know.

70
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,989
You give him everything
he asks for.

71
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,625
He never has to depend on
himself for anything.

72
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:39,860
-You know that's not true.

73
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,764
I don't need you or anyone
else to take care of me.

74
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:44,798
You're wrong!

75
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,368
Take it back, Yutaka!

76
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,669
You're a bit meanie.

77
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,338
I hate you!

78
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,041
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Tommy.

79
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,509
-This is weird.

80
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,676
Wait a minute.

81
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,677
Where is everyone.

82
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,545
Guys?

83
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,147
Guys?

84
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,548
Come on, you guys.

85
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,150
This isn't funny anymore.

86
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,985
Where are you?

87
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,721
[yelping]

88
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,656
Takuya, help me!

89
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,693
-Uh-huh.

90
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,760
All righty then.

91
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,495
Isn't this place just
full of surprises?

92
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,663
-Takuya?

93
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,864
Koji?

94
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,266
Zoe?

95
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,768
JP?

96
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,570
Where can they be?

97
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,741
-He never has to depend on
himself for anything.

98
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:28,875
-Shows how much he knows.

99
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,446
That's the old me.

100
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,749
The new me is a legendary
warrior.

101
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,618
If anything bad happens here,
I can just spirit evolve.

102
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,720
He doesn't know everything.

103
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,922
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Whatever are those boys

104
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,423
thinking, leading a girl?

105
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,427
Belissimo!

106
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,836
-Well, this is interesting.

107
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:56,803
-Zoe!

108
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:57,675
Tommy!

109
00:03:57,675 --> 00:03:58,138
Taki!

110
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:58,958
Where are you?

111
00:03:58,958 --> 00:03:59,473
Ack!

112
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,474
Oof.

113
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,341
Beans.

114
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,478
This stinks.

115
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,645
-I'm tired of this.

116
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,448
My feet hurt and it's hot.

117
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,239
-Hot?

118
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,484
That's not hot.

119
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,285
Now this is hot!

120
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,156
[growling]

121
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,126
-Oh yeah?

122
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:22,662
[growling]

123
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,331
-Come on, spirit!

124
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,966
Now's good!

125
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:26,967
Whoa!

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,235
No!

127
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,707
-Do you feel like we're
being watched?

128
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:34,875
I don't know.

129
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,511
I feel like we're
being watched.

130
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,714
-I swear, do you ever actually
listen to yourself?

131
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,386
-Boy, look at him go.

132
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,521
Hi!

133
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,588
-This is no time to stand
there and wave.

134
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,056
I just realized who that is.

135
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,025
It's the legendary warrior,
Sakkakumon.

136
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:52,893
This is bad.

137
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,227
This is very, very bad.

138
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,562
It's terrible, even.

139
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,464
-You always say that.

140
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,565
-I do not.

141
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,634
But even if I did--
which I don't--

142
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,270
I'd be right most of the time.

143
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:11,685
-(PANTING) Somebody help me!

144
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:12,720
Oof!

145
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:14,188
Somebody!

146
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:17,024
ASURAMON (OFFSCREEN): Are you
looking for somebody?

147
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:18,592
Are you lost?

148
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,327
Maybe I can help you.

149
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,662
YUTAKA (OFFSCREEN):
Who are you?

150
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:28,335
-My friends call me Asuramon.

151
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:29,837
You OK?

152
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:31,906
-I am now.

153
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:32,506
-Ha ha.

154
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,041
I'm glad to hear that.

155
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,211
You're a very nice boy

156
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:37,711
-Thank you.

157
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:38,979
My name is Tommy.

158
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:40,481
And thanks for savings
me, Asuramon.

159
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:48,422
So, where are we, anyway?

160
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:50,224
-I'm not sure.

161
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,227
I was overcome by darkness
and woke up here.

162
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,430
-That's pretty much what
happened to me, too.

163
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:58,232
-What's wrong?

164
00:05:58,265 --> 00:06:01,702
-I have no idea what happened
to my friends.

165
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,404
-I'm so sorry to hear that.

166
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,972
Maybe we can find
out together.

167
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:06,907
-You mean it?

168
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,209
-Mm-hmm.

[echoing laughter]

170
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:29,463
-Who's there?

171
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:31,132
[echoing laughter]

172
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:31,765
KARATENMON (OFFSCREEN):
Who are you

173
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,601
looking for, little boy?

174
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:34,468
Maybe it's me.

175
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:35,970
Maybe it's not.

176
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:38,305
But I know I'm looking
for you.

177
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:39,607
I know who you are.

178
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:52,186
-Execute spirit evolution!

179
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:12,206
Lobomon!

180
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:16,744
KARATENMON (OFFSCREEN):
Yes, yes, as I said, I

181
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:17,945
know who you are.

182
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,413
I'm even somewhat impressed.

183
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:22,883
You do well for an amateur--
for a puppy.

184
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:26,587
Koji Minamoto, the human boy
who dares to call himself a

185
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,124
legendary warrior of light.

186
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:32,092
Did you miss me?

187
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:35,229
[laughter]

188
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:37,231
NARRATOR: Karatenmon,
a wandering warrior.

189
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:39,733
It's said that he has arcane
abilities gained through the

190
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,403
guidance of many mysterious
masters.

191
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:43,771
-Yeah, yeah, whatever.

192
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,072
So you're the stuff.

193
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:46,340
What do you want from me?

194
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:47,641
-Silly puppy.

195
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,677
I want what everyone
wants from you.

196
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,581
So just hand over your spirit
and I won't have to hurt you.

197
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:54,648
-Yeah, right.

198
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,986
-Oh!

199
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,523
Thanks for the lift.

200
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:03,657
-Don't thank me.

201
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,159
That's what friends are for.

202
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:06,860
Friends are always
there to help you

203
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:08,629
through the rough spots.

204
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:11,966
I'm just glad I was here for you
when you needed my help.

205
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:14,001
-I'm really lucky, aren't I?

206
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:16,670
-Well, luck has nothing to
do with it my friend.

207
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:18,572
-If it's all right with you,
since we're friends, I think

208
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:21,709
I'll keep feeling lucky.

209
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,876
-All right.

210
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:26,714
Your spirit, if you please.

211
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:28,415
-And if I don't please?

212
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,031
-Tommy, are you all right?

213
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,733
You look a little tired.

214
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,568
-I'm fine, really I am.

215
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,970
But it's so hot here, and I'm
getting awfully thirsty.

216
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:52,906
-Why don't you stay here and
rest while I find some water?

217
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:54,441
-That'd be great, but--

218
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:55,876
-Please.

219
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:57,778
What kind of friend would be if
I knew you needed something

220
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,146
and wouldn't get it for you?

221
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,614
-Well, when you put
it that way--

222
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:01,448
-Don't worry.

223
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:02,916
Won't be long.

224
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,486
-Lobo Kendo!

225
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,121
-You're wasting your time.

226
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:09,256
My training has given me
abilities you cannot even

227
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,291
comprehend.

228
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,959
I know things on a
deeper level than

229
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:14,461
you could ever imagine.

230
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,664
Because I know you.

231
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,300
I know your heart,
Koji Minamoto.

232
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:21,435
I know what you do
before you do it.

233
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:24,939
Before you even know
you will do it--

234
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,273
every time!

235
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:34,348
-Tommy?

236
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:35,683
What's wrong?

237
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:39,687
-I'm tired, and I'm hot, too.

238
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:40,487
-Poor baby.

239
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:41,822
Let's rest awhile.

240
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,524
-Jeez Louise, we just rested.

241
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:46,026
-You can never get
enough rest.

242
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,227
-Gee, thanks, Dad.

243
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,228
You're the best.

244
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:49,730
Hey could I have some
orange juice?

245
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,031
And maybe some ice cream?

246
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:53,000
-Would you like something?

247
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:53,667
-No thanks.

248
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:54,702
-OK.

249
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:56,270
We'll be right back, sweetie.

250
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,280
-You're in for some serious
disappointments in life.

251
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,582
You get everything you ask
for any time you want.

252
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:10,117
You don't even realize
that's not how the

253
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,585
world really works.

254
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:14,388
To most people, you're just in
the way-- another kid who

255
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:16,557
needs looking after when they're
already too busy.

256
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,892
-But Mom and Dad don't have
a problem with it.

257
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:20,260
Why should you?

258
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,428
-You're not listening.

259
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:22,596
-Yeah I am.

260
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,598
You're just jealous because
I'm the favorite.

261
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:29,336
-Jeez, Tommy, you really don't
have a clue, do you?

262
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,241
You think that everybody else is
going to take care of you.

263
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:35,309
-I do not.

264
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:36,810
Everybody's just nice to
me because-- well,

265
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,479
because they just are.

266
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:40,647
It's not like I expect
it or something.

267
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,515
-Fine.

268
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,450
Have it your own way.

269
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:44,852
-Where you going?

270
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:46,186
-Home.

271
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,823
You didn't expect me to
stay you, did you?

272
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,692
Why was he always
so mean to me?

273
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,294
I guess it's hard knowing Mom
and Dad love me more.

274
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:55,829
-I'm back.

275
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:56,663
Here, Tommy.

276
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:57,364
Drink this.

277
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:58,966
-Thanks a lot!

278
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:07,674
-Tommy, what's the matter?

279
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:08,876
-It's nothing, really.

280
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:11,045
I was just thinking
about my brother.

281
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,880
He was always picking
on me and saying

282
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:14,815
mean things and stuff.

283
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,384
-Your brother didn't see what
a special person you are.

284
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:18,752
-Guess not.

285
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:20,721
-It sounds like he had no
thought for your feelings or

286
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,022
anyone else's.

287
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,057
That's unforgivable.

288
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,057
-Yup.

289
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:25,058
That sounds like my brother.

290
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:27,394
But he wasn't completely
wrong, either.

291
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:28,262
-I disagree.

292
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:30,364
Such people don't
deserve to live.

293
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:30,931
-Huh?

294
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:32,866
I wouldn't go that far.

295
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,402
-(CHUCKLING) I was
just kidding.

296
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:53,615
[PAINED NOISE]

297
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,316
-Have I made my point, puppy?

298
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,918
[growling]

299
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:02,090
-I will have your spirit.

300
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,258
It's only a matter of time.

301
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:12,534
So I see it is to be the
hard way with you.

302
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,869
I can't say that
I'm surprised.

303
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:18,006
Your Digimon form gives
you away, lone wolf.

304
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:19,941
You're afraid to have friends.

305
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:23,845
That is your weakness.

306
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:25,480
You refuse help even
when you need it.

307
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:28,316
You think that makes
you strong.

308
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:31,186
(CHUCKLING) It makes you weak.

309
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:34,856
A true warrior never closes
the door on loyal allies.

310
00:12:34,856 --> 00:12:37,826
-Asuramon, where are
we going, anyway?

311
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,428
-Right up there, but we're
running out of time.

312
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:42,197
-Don't you think it's
a little hot here?

313
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:43,364
-I think it's nice and cozy.

314
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:45,500
You're just tired.

315
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:48,069
-Tommy, what's wrong with you?

316
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,738
-Asuramon, it's getting hotter
and hotter every minute.

317
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,841
There's no way we're going to
find my friends up there.

318
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:56,744
-I'm your friend, too, and
I need to go up there.

319
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:59,214
I saved your life and helped
you when you needed it, and

320
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:01,049
this is what I get in return?

321
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:03,585
Tell me, is this how you choose
to repay my kindness

322
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:06,421
and friendship?

323
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,089
It's my turn now.

324
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,257
-It's not right.

325
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,792
Something's not right.

326
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,594
-What are you talking about?

327
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,762
-Keeping score.

328
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:15,730
-You're selfish.

329
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:17,432
It must drive your
friends crazy.

330
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:19,567
-If we think about others--

331
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,002
-You know what, Tommy?

332
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,471
You'd be a lot happier if you
didn't always get your way.

333
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:26,975
-I mean, if we actually care
about what other people need,

334
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:30,511
then it doesn't matter that
sometimes they need more than

335
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,481
they can give back
to us a while.

336
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:34,949
-You're being ridiculous.

337
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:36,684
I gave you what you wanted.

338
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:39,320
So you will give me
what I want--

339
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:42,490
now!

340
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:45,660
NARRATOR: Asuramon, a legendary
Digimon with three

341
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:47,295
faces and four arms.

342
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,331
His fire fist of Shiva attack
is a quadruple threat.

343
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,633
-No way!

344
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,206
KARATENMON (OFFSCREEN): Don't
forget, young Koji, I know

345
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,374
your heart.

346
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:00,975
Even when you have friends,
you won't allow

347
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,544
yourself to be happy.

348
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,579
Always in your mind you
prepare for the

349
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:05,880
time they will leave.

350
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,749
That is your greatest
weakness.

351
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:08,383
-Weak?

352
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,084
I call it realistic.

353
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:11,052
Everybody leaves.

354
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:12,253
That's a fact of life.

355
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,088
I just want to be
prepared for it.

356
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:16,257
I don't need friends
or family.

357
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:17,926
-Family?

358
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:19,093
Of course.

359
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,194
How did I miss the signs?

360
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:21,562
Your mother.

361
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,632
[growling]

362
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,367
-All right, let's cut
to the chase, boy.

363
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,702
Hand over your spirit.

364
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,705
-It was my spirit you were after
all along, wasn't it?

365
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:32,273
-Well, of course it was.

366
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:34,943
You don't honestly believe that
anyone would want to be

367
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:37,245
your friend otherwise.

368
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:38,579
-I'm not listening
to you anymore.

369
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:39,914
You're a liar!

370
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:52,126
Execute spirit evolution!

371
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,680
Kumamon!

372
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,651
Blizzard Blaster!

373
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:19,654
Crystal Freeze!

374
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:20,989
-Ha!

375
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:22,490
You're out of your element,
teddy bear.

376
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:25,026
What makes you think an ice
warrior can possibly defeat me

377
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,861
in a fire domain?

378
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:28,529
Fire Fist of Shiva!

379
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,112
[screaming]

380
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,748
-You deny yourself friends
and family.

381
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,249
How very sad.

382
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,284
You force yourself
to be lonely.

383
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:56,424
-Slide evolution!

384
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,093
-It doesn't matter which
form you take.

385
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:01,729
Your heart's an open book, and
I'll read your every move.

386
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:05,600
-Then read this!

387
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,169
-What?

388
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,904
He's faster than I thought.

389
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:16,177
He's serious.

390
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,015
Feather Flare!

391
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:28,322
-Lupine Laser!

392
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:32,326
[crying out]

393
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,728
-Slide evolution!

394
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:40,334
Fractal Code--

395
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,402
Digitize!

396
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,878
KARATENMON (OFFSCREEN):
How very said.

397
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:52,547
You force yourself
to be lonely.

398
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:01,889
-Aah!

399
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:03,224
-He went away.

400
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,402
-I'm sure it's very
hot down there.

401
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:16,637
Maybe we gave up on
our friendship

402
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:18,039
a little too quickly.

403
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:22,610
Why don't you give me your
spirit and I'll help you out.

404
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,146
We'll let bygones be bygones.

405
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:27,949
I forgive you for being
a selfish friend.

406
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,450
Come now, don't be stubborn.

407
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:31,586
We both know I'm your
only friend.

408
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,622
I'll even accept your spirit as
an apology for failing me.

409
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:35,957
-Failing you?

410
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,126
You were never my friend.

411
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:41,195
I don't owe you anything,
and I'm not sorry!

412
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,931
-Don't be a fool.

413
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,134
You don't really mean
that, Tommy.

414
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:48,002
All right, I'll give you
one more chance.

415
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:50,371
Hand over the spirit
and I'll let you--

416
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:56,644
[screaming]

417
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:05,019
[panting]

418
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:18,913
-Is that how you treat
your friends?

419
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:20,882
You're a horrible little boy.

420
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,083
Nobody likes you.

421
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,918
You'll never have any
real friends.

422
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:29,958
-That's what my brother
was trying to tell me.

423
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:33,027
-Tommy, you've got to realize
to most people,

424
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,462
you're just in the way.

425
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:35,897
-Yeah.

426
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,933
-You get everything you ask for
any time you want, and you

427
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,970
don't even realize that's not
how the world really works.

428
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:43,638
-My brother was right.

429
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:45,940
-What are you talking about?

430
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:48,443
Think you baked your brain?

431
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:50,445
-I think I finally understand
what my brother was

432
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,946
trying to tell me.

433
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:53,448
Yutaka was right.

434
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:55,583
I really never appreciated all
the things my parents gave me.

435
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,652
He knew friendship isn't
about what you get.

436
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,755
Friendship is about giving to
the ones you love He knew

437
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,590
there were people just like you
who would take advantage

438
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:05,360
of me-- well, never again!

439
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:07,262
-You're just kidding yourself.

440
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:09,464
You and I are exactly
the same.

441
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:12,100
-I could never be like you
now. i have too many real

442
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:13,535
friends who care about me.

443
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:14,169
They need me.

444
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:15,870
We help each other!

445
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:19,974
But I don't need their help to
take care of you, Asuramon!

446
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:21,509
Slide evolution!

447
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:28,016
-Ha!

448
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:31,653
How's that supposed
to help you?

449
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:32,687
-Right here!

450
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,693
-Fire Fist of Shiva!

451
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:43,598
You're fast for a big guy.

452
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:49,571
Let's see you dodge
in mid-air!

453
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:56,044
-Avalanche Axes!

454
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:02,450
Slide Evolution!

455
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:07,255
You are selfish and a bully.

456
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:09,090
This Digivice will harden
my courage like

457
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,428
ice and purify you!

460
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,643
Thanks, Yutaka.

461
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,979
I wish you were here so I
could tell you that I

462
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:32,313
understand now.

463
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:34,315
You weren't being mean to me.

464
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:36,317
You were trying to help me.

465
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:45,960
-Tommy!

466
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:51,633
-Boy, am I glad to
see you guys.

467
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:53,968
You'll never believe
what happened!

468

NARRATOR: He isn't kidding.

469
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:57,372
And what about Koji?

470
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,374
They're going to have a lot
to talk about on the next

471
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:02,377
Digimon, Digital Monsters!
