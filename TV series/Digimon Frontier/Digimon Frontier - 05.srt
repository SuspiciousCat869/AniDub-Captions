RIKA (NARRATING): The gang tried
to hitch a ride to the

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,438
forest terminal on another

to go, Takuya and Zoe had

5

another zingfest, and
the group split up.

6

Zoe, JP, Neemon, and Bokomon
ended up in Breezy Village.

There, the Floramon used their
heads to squeeze out some

weren't biting.

Then the Mushroomon appeared
and bombed the group with

it, Lobomon showed up and

piece of paper.

165
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:16,149
-Huh?

166
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:20,120
-Now before we get you some
lovely parting gifts, are

167
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,254
there any questions?

168
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,255
ALL (IN UNISON): Yeah!

169
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,790
Where is the cafeteria?

170
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:31,856
-Aahhh.

171
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:37,895
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): So what exactly
do you call this?

172
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,230
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN):
A 9-volt omelet?

173
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:41,732
MINOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Eat up, everybody!

174
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,367
-They're really lovely
batteries, but--

175
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:45,035
-Oh, you'll love them!

176
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:47,004
It's our chef's special!

177
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:48,939
Just look at the Kokuwamon.

178
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,575
It can't get enough.

179
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,244
[gobbling greedily]

180
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:54,512
-Oh.

181
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:56,847
[crackling and sparking]

182
00:05:56,914 --> 00:05:59,183
-Be sure to save room
for dessert.

183
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,284
It's alkaline.

184
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:02,586
-(IN UNISON) We can't
eat this stuff.

185
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:05,122
-Say, don't you have any sugary
treats lying around?

186
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:06,924
You know, for special guests?

187
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,792
MINOMON (OFFSCREEN): How
about a double-A pie?

188
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:09,760
-(IN UNISON) No thanks!

189
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:10,928
-Aaaaahhh!

190
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:11,896
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): I'm worried
we might have

191
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:13,430
offended the Minomon.

192
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:15,633
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): More
than lunch offended us?

193
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,002
-Can we get back to worrying
about my stomach?

194
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:19,103
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Stupid batteries.

195
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:22,740
-Unnh?

196
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,408
[laughs nervously]

197
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:26,010
-Hey, what's that?

198
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:27,077
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Is "a
building with a fence around

199
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,979
it" too obvious an answer?

200
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,014
JP (OFFSCREEN): Well,
let's check it out.

201
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:35,653
-So this--

202
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:37,187
-Is where the Kokuwamon live.

203
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:38,489
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): At least
they're out in the sunshine.

204
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:40,824
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Yes, where
they can sweat and rust.

205
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,159
LITTLE KOKUWAMONS: Ohhh.

206
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,160
-Huh?

207
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,628
-You're kinda funny-looking.

208
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:46,130
[giggling]

209
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:47,498
[slurp]

210
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,133
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, that's good, ohhh.

211
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,467
[slurp]

212
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,570
GOBLIMON (OFFSCREEN):
O, my leader.

213
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:54,004
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
What?

214
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:56,674
-We have reports from Security
of some pink, soft outsiders

215
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,876
who have toured the factory
and are now in

216
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,644
the Kokuwamon barracks.

217
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,379
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I
hate pink, soft outsiders!

218
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,381
[glass shatters]

219
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:08,052
[wind whooshing]

220
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:10,220
ELDER KOKUWAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Where once there was there,

221
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:14,725
there is now here, which is
neither here nor there.

222
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,528
-If I said that made any
sense, I'd be lying.

223
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:18,729
-Yeah, I'm lost, too.

224
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,598
-[clears throat]

225
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:22,066
Sorry.

226
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,067
The Elder's charge is a
little low these days.

227
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,969
Perhaps our story will
make more sense if we

228
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:27,471
begin at the beginning.

229
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:30,574
We Kokuwamon lived peacefully in
the forest for generations.

230
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:34,278
We played among the trees and
had games of Electric Tag.

231
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,380
Until one day, without warning,

232
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,948
the Goblimon attacked.

233
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:41,285
The wind at the Wind Factory
had gotten weaker, and the

234
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,921
energy for the generator
had gotten low.

235
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,956
So their leader had
us rounded up.

236
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,159
They took us all from our
beautiful wooded home and put

237
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:51,261
us to work in the factory.

238
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,130
-Here, not there.

239
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:54,331
-Mmm.

240
00:07:54,398 --> 00:07:55,599
-Man, that just blows.

241
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:57,701
-Yeah, and everything seemed
so normal when

242
00:07:57,735 --> 00:07:59,303
we toured the factory.

243
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,472
-I had a feeling something
was wrong.

244
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,140
My gut told me.

245
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,042
-Great, even your stomach's
a know-it-all.

246
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:06,677
So how come they needed
your labor in

247
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,212
such a modern factory?

248
00:08:08,245 --> 00:08:10,848
-Our labor is more of a bonus
for the Goblimon.

249
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,683
It is not the main reason
they keep us.

250
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:14,051
You must understand.

251
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:16,153
They would never let you
outsiders see what

252
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:17,688
really goes on there.

253
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:21,358
We Kokuwamon are a timid and
cowardly breed by nature.

254
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:24,528
But when we we're frightened, we
emit electrical currents up

255
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,863
to a million volts.

256
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:28,532
So they scare us constantly.

257
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:31,702
Sometimes they even pour water
on us to short us out, then

258
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:34,538
they use the electricity we
give off at the factory.

259
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:37,441
Or even worse, they threaten to
hang us upside down so the

260
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,576
charge rushes to our heads.

261
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,413
And if all of that doesn't work,
they show us pictures of

262
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:44,114
people's feet.

263
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,083
I've gotten so jumpy be these
days, I feel like there's a

264
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:48,886
kangaroo in my pants.

265
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,621
-So that was the noise
I heard when I

266
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:51,889
came out of the bathroom.

267
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,123
ELDER KOKUWAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Scary here.

268
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,225
-We are in the factory
every day.

269
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,761
This really isn't very much
fun for us at all.

270
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:59,763
-It's low pay and hard work.

271
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:01,565
-And no vacations.

272
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:03,500
-Can't go there.

273
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:04,935
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Well,
why don't you leave?

274
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:06,603
-Hmmm?

275
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,605
-Yeah, when the going gets too
tough, the really smart ones

276
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:09,573
take off.

277
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,508
-Are you out of your mind?

278
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:14,011
If they take off, then the
Goblimon will track them down

279
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:16,680
and smash them all into
little pieces.

280
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:17,915
-Let me guess, Taki.

281
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:19,683
You got some bright idea
they should band

282
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:20,651
together and fight back.

283
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:22,152
[both growl]

284
00:09:22,152 --> 00:09:23,520
KOKUWAMON (OFFSCREEN): We're
not really fighters.

285
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:26,156
And as for running away, we
can't, because the Goblimon

286
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:28,158
security is just too tight.

287
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:31,695
-Well, it seems like those are
your only two options.

288
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:34,498
-I suppose if we had to choose,
we would prefer the

289
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:35,632
running option.

290
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,835
-If you run now, you'll
never stop running.

291
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:40,003
But if you fight them, you
could be free forever.

292
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:41,839
You won't have to do it alone.

293
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,340
We'll help you beat them.

294
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,675
-Huh?

295
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:46,577
-Hey, who died and made you
Decision Guy, anyway?

296
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,545
What if we don't want any
part of this fight, huh?

297
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:49,713
-I'm in.

298
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:50,647
-Yeah, when do we start?

299
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:51,915
-Excellent.

300
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:52,883
-Mm-hm.

301
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,018
-Mmm.

302
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:55,886
KOKUWAMON (IN UNISON): Oooh,

303
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,055
-All right, let's do it!

304
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:00,758
-This could be the most
important moment of our lives.

305
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,426
-However short they may be!

306
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:03,727
-Hear, hear.

307
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:05,763
-Well, something tells me those
Goblimon are going to

308
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:08,065
get the shock of their lives.

309
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,233
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): OK,
is everyone ready?

310
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,135
KOKUWAMON (IN UNISON):
Ready when you are.

311
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:11,902
-Hmmph.

312
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:13,070
Ready to get ourselves killed.

313
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:14,571
-I knew it!

314
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:17,708
Anyone who turns down double-A
pie has got to be trouble!

315
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:19,949
Snimon's not gonna like this!

316
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:25,306
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): OK,
everyone, listen up.

317
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,875
We're going to do
this tonight.

318
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:29,644
First, Zoe will cause a
distraction right here.

319
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:32,280
She's going to try to get as
many Goblimon as possible over

320
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:33,648
to the gate.

321
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:36,517
That is, if you think
you can handle it.

322
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:38,019
-No sweat.

323
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,021
-Then the rest of us will move
into the factory and wait for

324
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:41,522
the right moment to attack.

325
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:44,392
And when the signal comes, we
all hit the same target.

326
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,394
Destroy the assembly line,
and that's it.

327
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:47,495
So what do you say?

328
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:48,396
Are you with me?

329
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:49,330
KOKUWAMON (IN UNISON):
Affirmative.

330
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:50,665
-Great!

331
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:52,500
This is teamwork, guys,
and a great plan.

332
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:55,069
Just like the ones I used to
draw up for my army men.

333
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:56,871
Except this time
it's for real!

334
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:58,373
Pretty cool, huh?

335
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:00,875
-Yeah, pretty cool
for you, Takuya.

336
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:01,943
-What's that mean?

337
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,544
-I get it.

338
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:04,779
So if there's no place for them
to work, I guess they'll

339
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:06,114
just get to go home again.

340
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:07,849
-It's not quite that
simple, Tommy.

341
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:10,451
We'll still have the Goblimon
leader to get rid of.

342
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:11,452
-I'm not going.

343
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:12,921
ALL (IN UNISON): What?

344
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:14,522
-Why don't you guys take care of
this one and just holler if

345
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:15,356
you need me.

346
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:16,891
-What are you saying, JP?

347
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,560
-I'm saying that you guys
are on your own.

348
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:20,428
You don't need me.

349
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:22,096
You probably don't
even want me.

350
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:24,732
I can't become a Digimon
like you guys.

351
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,101
I'm just tall, and sweet,
and cuddly.

352
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:30,138
-Man, I will never understand
what your problem is.

353
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:33,908
-My problem is you trying to
make me do what I don't want to.

354
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:35,576
-Oh yeah?

355

BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): You two
loudmouths are going to make

356
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:38,680

357
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:41,816
-We understand what JP
is going through.

358
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:45,086
-You see, before we met you,
we never even dreamed of

359
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:46,821
fighting back.

360
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,189
KOKUWAMON (OFFSCREEN): But you
have given us hope, and that

361
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:50,792
is something we haven't
had in a long time.

362
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:53,661
And you have seen how strong we
can be if we just believe

363
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:54,829
in ourselves.

364
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:55,863
ELDER KOKUWAMON (OFFSCREEN):
We believe.

365
00:11:55,897 --> 00:11:56,998
-You do?

366
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,299
-Hmph.

367
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,367
Believe in yourself.

368
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,035
Like it's just that simple.

369
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:02,303
Give me a break.

370
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:03,972
-Mmmm.

371
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,641
JP (THINKING) Why did I get on
that stupid train, anyway?

372
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:09,010
I can't do anything right
in the Digital World.

373
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:10,845
-Excuse me, sir.

374
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,080
-Hmm?

375
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:15,717
-Can we really go back to
the forest tomorrow?

376
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,919
I miss the trees.

377
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:18,820
-Don't worry.

378
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:20,588
We'll get you back home.

Gee, thanks, Mister.
