00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,069
RIKA NARRATING: The gang finally
got back together on

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,403
the edge of the Forest
Kingdom.

3
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,572
Starving and tired, they decided
to make camp and chow

4
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,574
down on some meat apples.

5
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,510
Then they discovered the forest
was full of these

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,411
freaky TV trees that
showed them video

7
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,746
from the Real World.

8
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,748
While they were sleeping,
Bakumon planted some bad

9
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,183
dreams into Tommy.

10
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,452
Convinced everyone was against
him, he Spirit Evolved to

11
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,187
Kumamon and took
on his friends.

12
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,556
Kouji and Takuya finally
figured out that it was

13
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:23,891
Bakumon causing all
the trouble.

14
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,860
So they Spirit Evolved and ended
the digital nightmare.

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,795
Then Kouji got this weird
email on his D-Tector.

16
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,764
What's that about?

17
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,032
THEME SONG: Digimon!

18
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:42,309
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

19
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,578
Digital World.

20
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:49,116
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

21
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,251
by the lessons we've learned.

22
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,091
As we work towards one solution

23
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:02,095
through a Spirit Evolution.

24
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,430
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,431
Huh!

26
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,432
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

27
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,000
Digimon!

28
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,369
Forever united as one.

29
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,637
Digimon!

30
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,973
Together the battles are won.

31
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:13,974
Digimon!

32
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,177
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

33
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,515
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

34
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:25,852
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

35
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,457
Digimon!

36
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,093
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): What if
something bad happened to him?

37
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,161
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Oh no!

38
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,063
Wait, what if something
bad happens to us?

39
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:36,997
JP (OFFSCREEN): Don't
say that!

40
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,932
You're scaring me--
uh, scaring Zoe.

41
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,435
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): What's that?

42
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,402
-Huh?

43
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,704
-Aahh?
-Huh?

44
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,072
-Ahh.

45
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,206
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): It's
called the sun, Zoe.

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,941
Good eye.

47
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,911
Look, I guess Neemon and
Bokomon are gone, too.

48
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,379
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Hmm.

49
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,049
Hey, it's a note from Kouji!

50
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,218
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): I'm going on
alone so I can actually get

51
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,386
something done.

52
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,721
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Geez,
even in a note, he

53
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,722
sounds like a jerk.

54
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,723
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
We're also going.

55
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,991
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Let me draw it!

56
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:04,992
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Give me the crayon.

57
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,960
-Man, that Kouji sure
can be selfish.

58
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,329
-I guess he likes to
be on his own.

59
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,232
And given this group, sometimes
I understand.

60
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:12,799
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): No!

61
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,102
I'm not done using--

62
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,470
-(ANGRILY) He wants
to be on his own?

63
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,939
Fine!

64
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,941
-At least Kouji can take
care of himself.

65
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,109
-Huh?

66
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,143
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Rrrngh!

67
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,513
But what about Bokomon
and Neemon?

68
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,483
You think Kouji will bother to
worry about protecting them?

69
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,318
Well, I doubt it.

70
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,788
We're gonna have to find them.

71
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,324
Where is that stupid
inscription?

72
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,459
Aha!

73
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:43,397
When the third eye opens,
the spirit will awaken.

74
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,632
Oh.

75
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,337
I just have to find
the third jewel.

76
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,738
Boy, you'd think if they left
an inscription, they could

77
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,206
leave a stupid map.

78
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,245
[neemon humming silly tune]

79
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,246
-Oh.

80
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,514
-Yow!

81
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,382
This tastes bad.

82
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,950
Why are we following him?

83
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,686
-Are you serious?

84
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,388
Aren't you the least bit curious
about that email Kouji

85
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,023
got last night?

86
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,857
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Oh, yeah.

87
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:11,691
Not really.

88
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,193
-Ughh.

89
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,362
That message must have
been very important.

90
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,464
I can't believe you're
not interested.

91
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,465
-Oh, hey!

92
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,533
I am.

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,400
-You are?

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,401
-Sure.

95
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,135
Whatever.

96
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,237
But I have a question for you.

97
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,273
Do these pants make
me look fat?

98
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,146
-It's driving me crazy.

99
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,415
Who sent this email?

100
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,416
Huh?

101
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,420
-Do I jiggle around
when I dance?

102
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,123
-Stop following me.

103
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,790
-Quickly now.

104
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,425
Follow him.

105
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,693
-Aaahh!

106
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,597
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN):
I don't see him!

107
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,431
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Oh,
for Pete's sake.

108
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,333
Your eyes are closed.

109
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,468
-Ow, let go of me!

110
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,307
-Ah?

111
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,975
Ah?

112
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,210
-Whooooaaa!

113
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,516
-Aaahh!

114
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:09,983
-What is that?

115
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,485
-A Gatsumon.

116
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,353
They're living rocks, but
they're basically kids.

117
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,855
-Huh.
-And can be real

118
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,990
troublemakers, let me tell you.

119
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,592
-What do you want?

120
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,559
-Nothing.

121
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,328
So what do you guys want?

122
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:21,761
-Nothing.

123
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:22,596
Why do you care?

124
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,930
-Hm.

125
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,702
-Well, if you're not going
to ask, I will.

126
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,372
Can you tell us how to get
to Forest Terminal?

127
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,874
-Yeah, I could tell you,
but I'm not gonna.

128
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,041
Ha!

129
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,709
-Oh.

130
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,743
Follow him.

131
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,245
Come on, chop chop.

132
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,713
-Don't tell me what to do.

133
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,714
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): But
he knows something.

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,741
-Wha?

135
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,343
[groans]

136
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:58,682
-Huh?

137
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,486
Come on!

138
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,622
He couldn't have gone far.

139
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,357
Huh.

140
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,992
-Look, we know you're here.

141
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:10,126
-Kinda.

142
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,796
-Look, kid, we're not
going anywhere, OK?

143
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:13,496
Just come out.

144
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,865
-Oh, OK.

145
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,501
I'm still not gonna
tell you anything.

146
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,470
-You are just a little rat.

147
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,807
I don't think I've ever seen
such a disrespectful Digimon.

148
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,575
-Yeah, so what if I am?

149
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:26,309
Huh?

-No!

-Hey, just where do you
think you're going?

158
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,275
-He can't get away with this.

159
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,211
I won't let him!

You can't fight that guy.

162
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,215
Leave him to me.

00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,833
-He turned into a Digimon!

170
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,438
And not just any Digimon.

171
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,340
A Legendary Warrior!

172
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,608
Maybe there's hope yet!

173
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,514
-Grumblemon.

174
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:15,718
-It you.

175
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:16,886
Get good.

176
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,122
I have be looking for you.

177
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,456
-So what?

178
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,592
-You get away once before.

179
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,728
But if I defeat and get spirit,
Cherubimon be much

180
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:29,065
grateful to Grumblemon.

181
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,066
Slide Evolution!

182
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:35,104
-Gigasmon!

183
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,981
-Lobo Kendo!

184
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:53,690
-Oh!

185
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,191
You're going to get squashed!

186
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:02,465
-Huh?

187
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:03,666
I'm gonna say him.

188
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:11,174
Hey, get up!

189
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,308
Huh?

190
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,045
It's the jewel!

191
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,316
If I can just get that jewel,
I can release the spirit.

192
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,352
As if I could.

193
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:23,052
GIGASMON (OFFSCREEN):
Where you at?

194
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,354
-Huh?

195
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:25,355
-Aha!

196
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:28,224
There you are!

197
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,193
[cries]

198
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:31,527
-Give to me!

199
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:36,232
Hm?

200
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:40,203
You no hide.

201
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:41,237
-You.

202
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:46,142
-Thanks.

203
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:48,044
-Don't thank me till
we're out of here.

204
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:49,279
-Can't we wait a minute?

205
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:50,947
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): You
want to wait for him?

206
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,716
-You in for much pain
when I find.

207
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,584
LOBOMON (THINKING): Heh.

208
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:55,318
I beat you to it.

209
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,590
-Is there anything we can do?

210
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,091
-No.

211
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,760
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): This'll
make you feel better.

212
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,762
-I don't need anyone's help.

213
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:06,963
-Yeah, I can tell.

214
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:09,132
You did such a great
job yourself.

215
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:09,799
-So?

216
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:10,934
You can't do better.

217
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:11,367
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): I will.

218
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,602
I'll be a hero.

219
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,437
And I don't need any
help like you do.

220
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,205
-Oh!

221
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,373
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): You just
made Grumblemon angry with us.

222
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:18,374
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN):
He's right.

223
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:19,776
Don't make trouble for
the rest of us.

224
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:26,182
-Look, kid, you just don't
stand a chance.

225
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:28,551
GIGASMON (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
maybe I don't, but I can't do

226
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:29,652
any worse than you.

227
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,554
I know that for sure.

228
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,323
Some Legendary Warrior.

229
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:34,724
-Huh?

230
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:38,528
-And the rest of you
are no better.

231
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:39,996
-Well, there he goes.

232
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,831
Off to save the world
on his own.

233
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,232
-Crazy kid's got rocks
in his head.

234
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,934
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): If you ask
me, that Gotsumon is going

235
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:46,703
to get us all destroyed.

236
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,871
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): Yes,
there's no hope for us now,

237
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,341
unless he really does
find the spirit.

238
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,675
-The spirit?

239
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:55,035
If Grumblemon gets that,
I'll never stop him.

240
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:01,207
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): They said
there's an inscription, but I

241
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:02,375
don't see it.

242
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:04,210
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Abraca-hooz-its!

243
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,212
-But that's the same
mark as Lobomon's.

244
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:08,648
I wonder if that means that
Kouji's beast spirit is here

245
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,316
somewhere, yes?

246
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,484
-Sure!

247
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:13,553
[beeping]

248
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:15,755
-What are you doing now?

249
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:17,390
-The D-Tector can
sense spirits.

250
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,393
How can you possibly live here
and not know these things?

251
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:22,061
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): 'Cause
I'm not a D-Tector, am I?

252
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:23,396
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Ohh.

253
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:24,397
Anything?

254
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:25,465
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): Not yet.

255
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:32,772
-Oh, maybe it is hopeless.

256
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,882
-Stupid thick grass!

257
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,384
-Hmm?

258
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:44,984
JP (OFFSCREEN): I'd give
anything for a lawnmower.

259
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,053
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Or a gag.

260
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:49,055
-So, they still all
living, huh?

261
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,727
Well, that not last long, and
then I take all them spirits.

262
00:10:57,597 --> 00:10:58,898
Slide Revolution!

263
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:04,204
-Gigasmon!

264
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:07,507
-Ohhh!
-Oh!

265
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,508
-Ah!
-Aah!

266
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:11,678
-Ah!

267
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:12,712
-Gigasmon's back!

268
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:20,119
It's the third jewel.

269
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:24,023
I could finally get the spirit
and beat Grumblemon.

270
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,026
GIGASMON (OFFSCREEN):
Raaawwwrr!

271
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:29,262
-Uh-oh, not Gigasmon again.

272
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:31,731
-Maybe he's fighting Takuya
and the others.

273
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:32,966
-Come on, let's go.

274
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,300
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Wait,
what about the spirit?

275
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:36,636
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): Later.

276
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:37,904
-OK.

277
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,939
Who to be first beaten
up real good?

278
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:40,907
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Me!

279
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,575
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): No, me!

280
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:43,910
JP (OFFSCREEN): Me too!

281
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:45,245
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): And me!

282
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:56,823

Spirit Evolution!

284
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:48,441

-Kazemon!

286
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:54,113
-Beetlemon!

287
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,885
-Kumamon!

288
00:12:58,918 --> 00:12:59,986
-You want me fight?

289
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,988
You guys not learn
quick, do you?

290
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:06,559
-Pyro Tornado!

291
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,894

00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:25,111
-Aaaaaauuughhhh!

296
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,384
GIGASMON (OFFSCREEN):
You finished!

297
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,119
A-ha-ha!

298
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:38,358
-Auughhh!

299
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:41,294
-Kazemon!

300
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,629
-You done now!

301
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:43,963
Ha ha ha!

302
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,208
-Zoe!

303
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:57,210
-He got her spirit!

304
00:13:57,243 --> 00:14:00,179
-Zoe, no!

305
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:01,247

-Aughhh.

308
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:13,192
Aaaahhhhh.

309
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:19,232
-More tasty spirits for me!

310
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:20,433
Ha!

311
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:22,068
Huh?

312
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,070
LOBOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Why don't
you taste this, first?

313
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,974
Howling Laser!

314
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,976
-That stupid Grumblemon.

315
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:33,579
Things'll be different once
I get the spirit.

316
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,416
Then I'll be a Legendary
Warrior, and he'll get his.

317
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,750
Ha.

318
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,252
LOBOMAN (OFFSCREEN): How'd
you like that?

319
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:40,420
-Not too bad.

320
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,287
-What's the matter?

321
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:43,289
Don't you want my
spirit anymore?

322
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:48,027
-Still got couple tricks
up sleeve.

323
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,929
-Now here's some magic for you!

324
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:52,665
-Huh?

325
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:55,802

Me see how good at fighting!

329
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:08,981
-He's gone now.

00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:09,849
You OK?

331
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:10,750
-Huh?

332
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:12,585
-Yeah, I guess.

333
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,087
It's just--

334
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,824
what good am I to
you guys now?

335
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,492
-Good, but watch that thing.

336
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:20,760
-And that thing.

337
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:22,929
[grunts with effort]

338
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:27,533
Why couldn't you just
fit right here?

339
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,868
-Take your time.

340
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:29,936
But we don't have all day.

341
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:30,870
[crash]

342
00:15:30,903 --> 00:15:31,904
-See what I mean?

343
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:45,751
-Oh, they're close!

344
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:46,819
-Quagmire Twister!

345
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,461
Ha-ha-ha!

346
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:03,102
Got you now!

347
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:04,437
-Huh?

348
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:09,675
-He's done for!

349
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:11,444
-That means we're next?
-Yes!

350
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:12,779
Ohh!

351
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,121
-Rock Fist!

352
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:30,796
Hey!

353
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:32,598
Now put that in the statue!

354
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:35,334
Hurry!

355
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:36,235
-Why?

356
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:38,271
-When the third eye shines, the

357
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:40,239
legendary spirit will awaken.

358
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,240
Take it!

359
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,175
-The spirit?

360
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,809
Why would you do this for me?

361
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:44,744
-Ahh!

362
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,312
-Stop it!

363
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:47,647
-Ow! Ow!

364
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,581
Ow!

365
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:49,515
Hurry!

366
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:52,652
Do it!

367
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:53,786
-You can do it, Kouji!

368
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:55,021
-Can he?

369
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:07,641
[rumbling]

370
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,503
-I hope this is something
good.

371
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,571
-Don't we all?

372
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,808
-That's not good.

373
00:17:25,351 --> 00:17:26,352
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Kouji!

374
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:27,687
[all exclaim with wonder]

375
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:34,861
-The spirit.

376
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,562
-Kouji, your D-Tector.

377
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:37,863
-Oh, boy!

378
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,735
-It-- it's your beast spirit.

379
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:44,036
-Huh?

380
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,207
Beast spirit!

381
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,446
-Me not afraid of
beast spirit.

382
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,448
Huh?

383
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:56,816
-I did it!

384
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,117
[inaudible].

385
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,434
-Execute!

386
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:16,769
Beast Spirit Evolution!

387
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:34,053
-KendoGarurumon!

388
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:39,358
[howls]

389
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:40,359
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
KendoGarurumon,

390
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:42,895
the Beast of Light?

391
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:44,196
-KendoGaru-who?

392
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,534
-Garurumon.

393
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,036
-Whoaa.

394
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:52,438
-Why'd he find his first?

395
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:56,242
-I could have done that.

396
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:57,176
-Hey there.

397
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:57,843
Nice doggie.

398
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,845
Sit.

399
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:03,416
-I hope he can beat Gigasmon.

400
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:04,550
-Rawwwwrr.

401
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,388
Rawwrrrr!

402
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:12,291
Raawwwwrrrrrr!

403
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:13,893
-Ouchy!

404
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:15,227
-Oh no!

405
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,596
Kouji can't control the
beast spirit yet.

406
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,765
-Rrawwwrrr!

407
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:21,233
-Huh.

408
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:24,070
Look like things not so
bad for me after all.

409
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:25,171
-Rrrawwwwrrr!

410
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:31,010
-You should no keep what
you not can control.

411
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,244
-Rrrrrrawwwrrrr!

412
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:36,949
-Now this will be big.

413
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:37,950
-Big, big?

414
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,285
Whoa!

415
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,194
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Does that
answer your question?

416
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:56,469
-Kouji!

417
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:05,978
-Aaaaauuughhhhh!

418
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:06,979
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Kouji!

419
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:14,920
-Raaawwwrrr!

420
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:22,261
-That spirit sure takes
a lot out of a guy.

421
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,705
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): I guess
to be a hero, I needed your

422
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:33,639
help after all.

423
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,375
And you needed mine
to be one, too.

424
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:39,445
Maybe asking for help is
what makes you a hero.

425
00:20:39,478 --> 00:20:41,380
Of course, having a beast spirit
doesn't hurt either.

426
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:45,251
-Can I come up now?

427
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:46,619
-Oh, right.

428
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:47,086
Sorry.

429
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:48,988
-No problem.

430
00:20:49,021 --> 00:20:51,290
You gotta work on your
hero skills.

431
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:53,592
Rescue first, talk later.

432
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:55,928
RIKA NARRATING: One spirit
gone, one spirit gained.

433
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:58,264
Boy, these guys sure know how
to keep things interesting.

434
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:02,301
See what'll happen next, on
"Digimon, Digital Monsters."
