NARRATOR: When Takuya beast
spirit evolved to

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,732
BurningGreymon, he couldn't
control himself at all.

3
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:06,668
So Beetlemon and KendoGarurumon
tried to help

4
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:08,336
him, but they were
pretty useless.

5
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,672
If finally took a lot of
reasoning from little Tommy to

6
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:12,507
get Takuya to tame
the beast within.

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,076
Then it was off to the Forest
Terminal again.

8
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:17,378
But when the gang got stuck in
the mud, Grumblemon showed up

9
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:18,847
and grabbed Tommy.

10
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:21,182
So Takuya beast spirit evolved
and did a little

11
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:22,617
grabbing of his own.

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,186
He took Gigasmon's spirit and
returned Kumamon's to Tommy.

13
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:26,921
But Grumblemon escaped
and met up with the

14
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:27,956
evil Legendary Warriors.

15
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,092
Man, those are some
freaky fiends!

16
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,193
THEME SONG: Digimon!

17
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:41,736
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

18
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:44,239
Digital World.

19
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:49,143
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:56,084
by the lessons we've learned
as we work towards one

21
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:59,420
solution through a
spirit evolution.

22
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:06,427
Digimon!

23
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:09,030
Forever united as one.

24
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:10,031
Digimon!

25
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:13,034
Together the battles are won.

26
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,035
Digimon!

27
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:17,305
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

28
00:01:17,305 --> 00:01:21,309
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:21,309 --> 00:01:25,313
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,151
Digimon!

31
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:35,394
-Hey, where do you think
you're going?

32
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:38,230
Mercurymon ain't done
with yous yet.

33
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,565
-I going Forest Terminal.

34
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:44,436
Must get beast spirit back
from annoying kids.

35
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,939
-(GIGGLING) Ooh, sounds
like fun.

36
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:52,945
-I tried to stop them.

37
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,012
You saw, right?

38
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,347
-Yes, yes.

39
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:56,615
-These be my brethren?

40
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:00,786
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): I
can't believe it.

41
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,287
We're actually here.

42
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,056
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): My
legs can believe it.

43
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:05,224
Oh.

44
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:06,024
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
There's the sign.

45
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:07,059
Forest Terminal.

46
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:14,333
-Um but shouldn't there
be a Trailmon here?

47
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,067
-Yeah, really.

48
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,835
-Huh?

49
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:19,738
Well, maybe they're on their
way back right now.

50
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,541
Or, uh, you know,
they could be--

51
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:25,010
oh, man.

52
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:26,511
-Hey, who cares about
the Trailmon.

53
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:28,013
There's a restaurant here!

54
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,519
-Welcome, weary travelers!

55
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,954
-What do you have to eat?

56
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,190
-Ask instead what I
don't have to eat!

57
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:40,692
Step right up, friends, and
don't worry about money.

58
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:42,694
For you, the first
meal is free.

59
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:45,030
-Hey!

60
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,098
DERAMON (OFFSCREEN): Now there's
a man who knows what

61
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,733
he likes-- or doesn't
care what he eats.

62
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,268
Yolk surprise coming up!

63
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:57,142
Dig on in!

64
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,243
-Hail to the chef.

65
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,244
Haha!

66
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,955
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): We must
respectfully decline your kind

67
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,256
offer of food.

68
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:14,526
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): I can't
feel my tongue anymore.

69
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,694
-All right, all right.

70
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,262
What's the big idea?

71
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,264
I just can't believe all
of you are going to

72
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,699
turn down free food.

73
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:21,967
-That was food?

74
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,969
-I'm insulted!

75
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:25,671
-I'm going to be sick.

76
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:26,638
-Fine, get out of here, kid.

77
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:27,806
You're bugging me.

78
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,042
Go on and go to the
Forest Terminal.

79
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:34,313
They say no one's ever
returned from there.

80
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,480
-Yeah?

81
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:36,648
Well, we'll just take
our chances.

82
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:38,317
I doubt the Forest Terminal
will be any

83
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,519
worse than this food.

84
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:41,987
-Aww, come on, guys.

85
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:44,156
I was just trying to be
nice, that's all.

86
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:46,658
-Being nice has nothing
to do with cooking.

87
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,427
And rumors don't matter to us.

88
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,828
We've already been told
that we have to go

89
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,830
to the Forest Terminal.

90
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,731
-Huh?

91
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:54,032
-Attention--

92
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,701
go to the Forest Terminal
immediately.

93
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,443
-Let's go.

94
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:05,043
-(HESITANTLY) OK.

95
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,545
-Yeah.

96
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:08,413
-Do you really think
it's dangerous?

97
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:09,247
-I don't know.

98
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:09,881
We've come this far.

99
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,483
We can't turn back.

100
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:12,317
-Huh?

101
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:13,552
Hey, don't leave me!

102
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,554
I mean, wait up!

103
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:16,722
JP (OFFSCREEN): This
place is empty too.

104
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:17,723
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

105
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:18,890
And just a little bit creepy.

106
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,463
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Keep
your eyes peeled, guys.

107
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:25,063
JP (OFFSCREEN): For what?

108
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,631
All we can see is fog.

109
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:27,599
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Well,
there have to

110
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:29,101
be some people here.

111
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,470
JP (OFFSCREEN): But what
if they're all ghosts!

112
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:34,006
[frightened groans]

113
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:34,940
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
I guess we have no

114
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,508
choice but to keep walking.

115
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,777
JP (OFFSCREEN): Man, this world
sure loves its walking.

116
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,011
-Huh?

117
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:40,935
JP (OFFSCREEN): Great.

118
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:41,803
Now what?

119
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:42,437
[beeping sounds]

120
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:43,471
-Huh?

121
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:47,876
It's that way.

122
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,682
-Tommy, it's a dead end.

123
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:55,683
-Yeah.

124
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,852
Are you sure it wasn't
the other way?

125
00:04:57,886 --> 00:05:00,188
-Huh?

126
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,823
Wow.

127
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:02,824
[gasps]

128
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:04,392
-And for my next trick.

129
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:10,865
-Man, I can't see anything
in this fog.

130
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:11,733
-I know.

131
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,500
We could be attacked.

132
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:13,735
[beeping noises]

133
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,570
-Hey, maybe my detector's
good for something, too.

134
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:25,213
[gasps]

135
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,248
-I hate it when I'm right.

136
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:35,312
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): This
place is beautiful.

137
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:37,114
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Doesn't
mean it's not dangerous.

138
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:38,248
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): What if this
is where the person from

139
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:39,249
our D-Tector lives?

140
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:40,617
We did get a message
to come here.

141
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:41,818
-Well, should I knock?

142
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:43,320
-I still don't think
it's safe.

143
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:44,755
[beeping noises]

144
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:45,989
-Oh!

145
00:05:52,596 --> 00:05:54,197
-Well, at least they're
polite, I guess.

146
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,432
-Yeah.

147
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:58,302
That or eager to lure
us in there.

148
00:05:58,368 --> 00:05:59,369
-I say we go inside.

149
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:01,204
How bad could it be?

150
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,206
Sleeping Beauty used to live
in a castle in the forest.

151
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,274
-Yeah.

152
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:05,776
Well, so did the wicked witch.

153
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,644
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): We'll never
find out what's in there if we don't go in.

154
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:08,845
-Hmmph.

155
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,815
Says the kid at the
back of the line.

156
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,550
-Maybe no one lives here.

157
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,886
-Maybe you should open up a
wishful thinking store, Tommy.

158
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:22,159
SORCERMON (OFFSCREEN): Get
back, Cherubimon scum!

159
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,361
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Uh,
isn't that Wizardmon?

160
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:25,996
-But he's a different color.

161
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,164
-And meaner.

162
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:29,933
-We can beat him just like
we beat Gigasmon.

163
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:30,867
-Gigasmon?

164
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,903
But he's one of Cherubimon's
goons.

165
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:33,904
-Yeah.

166
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:36,673
-So you're not allies
with Cherubimon?

167
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:39,176
-Are you kidding?

168
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:42,112
-Look, why don't you put
that wand down, OK?

169
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,580
We're all on the same side.

170
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,048
Isn't that obvious?

171
00:06:45,048 --> 00:06:47,084
-This is what comes of
fighting too much.

172
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,885
Everyone seems to be an enemy.

173
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,554
I apologize, friends.

174
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:52,556
How did you find this place?

175
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:54,424
-We got a message that
told us all to come

176
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,726
to the Forest Terminal.

177
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:56,960
But there was no one there.

178
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,562
And when we kept walking,
we ended up

179
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:00,097
here on your doorstep.

180
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:01,898
-Hmm, a message.

181
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:03,166
Could it be?

182
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,235
My solitude has driven common
courtesy from me.

183
00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:06,570
I apologize.

184
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,671
My name is Sorcermon.

185
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:08,972
Please, come in.

186
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:10,674
I have something important
to show you.

187
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:15,979
DERAMON (OFFSCREEN): Whatever
did I do wrong?

188
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:18,615
The recipe's clear--
one egg in pasta,

189
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:19,950
boiled in dirty socks.

190
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,284
Huh?

191
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:22,452
Aha!

192
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:23,620
Welcome, travelers!

193
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,123
Your first meal is free.

194
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:28,658
[growling]

195
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:29,292
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN): They've

196
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,660
gone to Forest Terminal.

197
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:33,230
It will be easier
than I thought.

198
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:34,798
-Where are you taking
us, anyway?

199
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:35,899
-To meet someone.

200
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:37,501
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): I
bet it's a trap.

201
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,403
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): You think
everything's a trap.

202
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:41,571
SORCERMON (OFFSCREEN): Caution
is wise, friends, but only within reason.

203
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:42,739
This is no trap.

204
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:44,040
This is a prophecy.

205
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,711
-Wow.

206
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,014
-Tracks.

207
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:51,848
Fresh.

208
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,017
Little further.

209
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,718
-So where is he?

210
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:57,421
-Up there.

211
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:59,356
Allow me to introduce
our salvation--

212
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,424
Seraphimon.

213
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,363
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Um, are we
supposed to know who that is?

214
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:09,399
-Seraphimon was one of the three
Celestial Digimon chosen

215
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,201
to rule this world.

216
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:13,203
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): So what
are we supposed to do?

217
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,771
He's all frozen up.

218
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:15,705
SORCERMON (OFFSCREEN):
Perhaps not for long.

219
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,607
There is a prophecy.

220
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:20,043
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN): Let
your light shine as one.

221
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,778
-That was Lady Ophanimon!

222
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,314
She's the one who asked me
to watch over Seraphimon.

223
00:08:24,347 --> 00:08:26,249
-Ophanimon?

224
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:28,084
She must be the voice that
told us to come here.

225
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:30,454
-It's all falling into place.

226
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:33,123
I brought you here because the
prophecy says that one day a

227
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:36,159
group of wayward humans
will free Seraphimon.

228
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:36,927
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Typical.

229
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,428
Humans get to do everything.

230
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:39,763
When is my turn?

231
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:41,198
-How bout next week?

232
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:42,299
-Be quiet.

233
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,433
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Just little further.

234
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,935
RANAMON (OFFSCREEN):
So you keep saying.

235
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:47,370
-So what did she mean?

236
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:48,605
-Hey!

237
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:49,840
I bet it has something to
do with our D-Tectors.

238
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:57,647
-Hey, guys.

239
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:58,482
Focus them up there.

240
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:07,657
-The prophecy!

241
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,559
Welcome back, Lord Seraphimon.

242
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:11,928
-It's good to be back,
my faithful servant.

243
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:13,530
You have done well.

244
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:14,831
-Little further.

245
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:16,500
-Will you stop that?

246
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,569
-Sorcermon, tell me-- there's
so little I remember.

247
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:22,506
-My lord, when your defeat
seemed imminent, Ophanimon was

248
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:24,274
able to get you to safety.

249
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:26,843
She sealed you away from danger
so you could be revived

250
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,446
after the trouble had passed.

251
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,380
-Ophanimon!

252
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:31,114
That's right.

253
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:31,915
Has she been harmed?

254
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:33,383
Why isn't she here?

255
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:35,418
-Truth is often unpleasant,
I'm afraid.

256
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:37,254
No one knows where she is.

257
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:39,389
But these humans have been
in contact with her,

258
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,057
so all is not lost.

259
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,459
-These humans?

260
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,427
But they're only children.

261
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,396
-Yes, but they're also
legendary warriors.

262
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:49,332
And if not for them, you'd still
be stuck to the ceiling.

263
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,934
-Legendary warriors?

264
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,502
Impressive.

265
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:53,236
-Hey, listen.

266
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,838
Just what is going on here?

267
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:57,173
We've been led all over getting
our snot kicked out,

268
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:58,742
and we don't even know
why we were brought

269
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,410
into this crazy world!

270
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,178
-Yeah!

271
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:03,013
Someone owes us some answers!

272
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:04,781
-And I think you're
that someone.

273
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:06,182
So tell us what's going on.

274
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:08,485
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Um, please?

275
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:11,788
-Very well, brave ones,
I shall tell you.

276
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:12,856
-No little further.

277
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:14,691
We here now.

278
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:16,960
-What a delightful place to
destroy those kiddies.

279
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:18,395
-They won't know
what hit them.

280
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:19,496
Right, Mercurymon?

281
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:20,730
-They shall know pain.

282
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:23,233
That I promise.

283
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:30,373
-If you want answers,
you will have them.

284
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:33,910
The story begins long ago, when
human Digimon and beast

285
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:36,179
Digimon warred against
each other.

286
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,749
Their battle laid waste to the
Digital World, befouling what

287
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:41,051
was once beautiful.

288
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:42,886
But Lucemon appeared
and brought

289
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,588
an end to the fighting.

290
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:46,556
For a time, he ruled in peace.

291
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,693
But soon, he was corrupted
by his own power.

292
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,528
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): My, this
story sure sounds familiar.

293
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:52,229
CHILDREN (OFFSCREEN): Bokomon!

294
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:53,563
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): What?

295
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,199
SERAPHIMON (OFFSCREEN): The Ten
Legendary Warriors arose

296
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,401
to free the oppressed
and abused Digimon.

297
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:02,973
They battled valiantly, and
after a fierce struggle they

298
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:05,208
were able to defeat the
tyrannical Lucemon.

299
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:12,082
After peace was restored to the
Digital World, champions

300
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:14,251
were chosen to protect
that peace--

301
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:17,253
Cherubimon, Ophanimon,
and myself.

302
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:21,458
But as before, our time of
harmony was short-lived.

303
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:24,427
Cherubimon wanted to control the
Digital World by himself

304
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:25,929
and so attacked me.

305
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:29,199
You know the rest of the story,
thanks to Sorcermon.

306
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:32,302
Ophanimon rescued me and brought
me to safety here,

307
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:34,938
where I have slumbered and
regained my strength until I

308
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:37,774
was awakened by you,
legendary warriors.

309
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:40,677
-Luckily, you came just when
we needed Seraphimon most.

310
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,146
The Digital World is in a
crisis, as you can see.

311
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:50,320
-Man, the Digital World looks
like Swiss cheese.

312
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,888
SORCERMON (OFFSCREEN): And the
future looks even more bleak.

313
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:54,491
You see, Cherubimon has sent
his minions to destroy it.

314
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,826
-This is even more serious
than I'd imagined.

315
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,595
We must find Ophanimon
at once!

316
00:11:58,628 --> 00:11:59,829
-Yes, my lord.

317
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:02,332
Your combined might can surely
defeat Cherubimon.

318
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:04,267
And of course, you'll
have my help.

319
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,336
While you've slept, I've
felt that I have, too.

320
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,672
And I have dreamt only of
fighting at your side against

321
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:10,106
that evil creature.

322
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,108
-Dear, brave Sorcermon.

323
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:13,610
You are a true friend.

324
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:14,944
Thank you.

325
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:17,047
Your courage gives
me strength.

326
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,882
-I am as you taught me.

327
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:21,217
-And I must thank you
for your courage.

328
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,553
All would be lost were
it not for you.

329
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:27,057
But now I must ask that you
do one more favor for me.

330
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,394
Before the fighting begins,
go back to your own world.

331
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:34,564
You task is done, and it's too
dangerous for you to stay.

332
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:36,566
-But we're legendary warriors!

333
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,234
-Yeah, we can't just
walk away now.

334
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:42,806
-Huh?

335
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,741
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN): Good,
whole brat brigade here.

336
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,009
-And ready to fight!

337
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:48,845
-You better be, cause me
introduce other Digimon who

338
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:50,347
defeat you--

339
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,114
Ranamon.

340
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:52,482
-Charmed, I'm sure.

341
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:54,017
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Arbormon.

342
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,453
-You're in for it now, right?

343
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,988
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN): And
lastly, Mercurymon.

344
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:02,625
-So these be the whelps who hast
given me so much trouble?

345
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,460
Pathetic.

346
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,495
-They'll be covered in muck.

347
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:07,063
-Verily.

348
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:09,332
It will be utter delight to
defeat thee and to hand

349
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,968
Seraphimon another drubbing
in Cherubimon's name.

350
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:14,404
-With so many options, I don't
know where to start.

351
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:16,306
-Enough of your meaningless
taunts.

352
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:18,808
Tell me where Ophanimon
is, now!

353
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:20,143
-Me no care about her.

354
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,544
Me just want beast
spirit back!

355
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,012
So give it!

356
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,748
-Why don't you come
get it, buddy?

357
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:25,515
-Yeah!

358
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:26,850
-Yeah!

359
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:37,527
-Execute spirit evolution!

360
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:56,079
-Execute spirit evolution!

361
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:22,272
-Execute spirit evolution!

362
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,490
-Execute spirit evolution!

363
00:14:58,808 --> 00:15:00,076
-Agunimon!

364
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:06,049
-Lobomon!

365
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,055
-Beetlemon!

366
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:17,961
-Kumamon!

367
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,665
-The legendary warriors
have returned.

368
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:25,568
-If that big dufus hadn't stolen
my spirit, I'd show him

369
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:26,903
a thing or two.

370
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:27,904
-Yeah, well did.

371
00:15:27,904 --> 00:15:31,908
And now I show you
thing or three!

372
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:34,244
-You sure you don't want
to get warmed up first?

373
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:37,780
Pyro darts!

374
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:39,115
-Ooh, he's feisty!

375
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,683
-Howling laser!

376
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:43,319
-You might as well just shoot
at the floor, sugar.

377
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:45,288
-Thunder fist!

378
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,856
-Crystal breeze!

379
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:48,691
-Thanks for the overwhelmingly

380
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:51,194
underwhelming lesson in combat.

381
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:55,131
Let me show you how it's done!

382
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:56,466
Draining rain!

383
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,304
-Roundhouse punt!

384
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:06,042
-Oh!

385
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:07,377
-That was too easy.

386
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,478
-Right.

387
00:16:13,387 --> 00:16:15,055
-Go get your beast
spirit, Rockhead.

388
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:16,890
Fetch!

389
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:20,460
-Be careful or you'll get
smashed next, Ranamon!

390
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:21,395
SORCERMON (OFFSCREEN):
Grumblemon, no!

391
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:22,629
You cannot do this!

392
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:24,097
-I beg your pardon?

393
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,400
-You shall not lead us down
the path of ruin.

394
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,902
I've waited a lifetime to see
peace restored to the Digital

395
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:31,238
World, and you're not going
to stop it from returning!

396
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:32,572
Crystal barrage!

397
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,644
-Thou art a fool!

398
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,913
Dark reflection!

399
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,181
-Ugh!

400
00:16:41,214 --> 00:16:42,449
-Sorcermon!

401
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:43,517
-Worry not, my lord.

402
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:48,455
-Have at you!

403
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:56,797
-Strike of the seven stars!

404
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:11,378
Please!

405
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:15,082
I ask again that you return to
your world and leave this to me!

406
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,249
-There's now way we'll leave!

407
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:17,584
-Yeah!

408
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:20,020
Even if we wanted to,
we don't know how!

409
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:22,189
-I can't fight them
and keep you safe!

410
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:25,525
You must go!

411
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,927
-Are you kidding?

412
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:28,528
You can't fight all those
guys by yourself.

413
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:29,429
I mean, come on.

414
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:30,364
You just woke up!

415
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,733
-You need us!

416
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,035
-This foolish compassion
be his weakness.

417
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:38,472
Attack the humans and
keep him distracted.

418
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:40,040
-We should be fighting them.

419
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:44,211
-Fine by us, we fight
you good.

420
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,546
-Draining rain!

421
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:49,249
-Roundhouse punt!

422
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:54,488
-Strike of the seven stars!

423
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:55,922
-Dark reflection!

424
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:02,763
-Oh!

425
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:07,300
-To the victor go the spoils.

426
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,341
-No!

427
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:19,446
-Seraphimon turned
into a Digi-Egg!

428
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:20,781
-Oh!

429
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,017
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN):
How ironic.

430
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,986
Seraphimon sought to
defeat Cherubimon.

431
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:28,722
But now his Fractal Code shall
be used for our ends!

432
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:30,323
-No, it can't be!

433
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:32,325
The hope of the Digital
World is gone!

434
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:35,195
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): No it's not!

435
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,497
Maybe we can bring him back
if we have his egg.

436
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,099
Right, Sorcermon?

437
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:40,267
Hey!

438
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,936
-Yes, we must protect that
egg at all costs!

439
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:46,039
-Oh, thou shan't get
far, trust me.

440
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:48,275
-If we can get the egg to
Ophanimon, she may be able to

441
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:50,677
revive Seraphimon.

442
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:52,512
-All right, come and get it!

443
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:54,014
-Be not stupid.

444
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:55,882
-What's the matter? You chicken?

445
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:57,217
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
you big metal head.

446
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,084
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN):
Very well.

447
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:01,254
Thy fate is sealed.

448
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:03,423
We shall take it by unpleasant,

449
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,125
painful, agonizing force.

450
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:09,129
SORCERMON (OFFSCREEN):
Arrogance

451
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:10,230
will be your downfall.

452
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:15,735
ARBORMON (OFFSCREEN): Wh--

453
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:16,670
what?

454
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:19,072
Oh, they got away, right?

455
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,907
-Them kids always do that!

456
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:25,412
-Quick! This way!

457
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,413
[panting]

458
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,747
-Well, duh!

459
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:34,955
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN):
We come and get you!

460
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:38,625
-Quick!

461
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:40,327
We may escape through here.

462
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,162
[gasping]

463
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:44,297
JP (OFFSCREEN): Wow,
a getaway Trailmon!

464
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:44,965
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Thank goodness!

465
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:46,399
Come on, let's go!

466
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:53,173
-Sorcermon, hurry up!

467
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,574
-I'm not coming.

468
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:55,542
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): What?

469
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:56,977
-The egg is all that
matters now.

470
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:58,578
I must ensure its safety.

471
00:19:58,612 --> 00:19:59,412
Now go!

472
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:00,747
There isn't much time!

473
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,015
-You don't stand a chance!

474
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:02,682
I

475
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:03,517
-Take care of Seraphimon!

476
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,519
He's our last hope.

477
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,353
-No!

478
00:20:06,353 --> 00:20:07,187
We won't leave you!

479
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:15,095
Sorcermon!

480
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:16,863
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Tommy, that
isn't helping anyone.

481
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:25,705
GRUMBLEMON (OFFSCREEN):
We too late!

482
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:27,040
Rats!

483
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:35,615
-I can't believe this is all
that's left of Seraphimon.

484
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,418
I'm never gonna let this go.

485
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:40,420
-That egg may be the most
important thing in the Digital

486
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:41,454
World right now.

487
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,423
It's its last hope.

488
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,458
So all of Cherubimon's
forces are going to

489
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:46,760
be gunning for it.

490
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:49,095
But no matter what happens
we got to protect it.

491
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,932
We can't let Sorcermon's
sacrifice be in vain!

492
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:54,768
I hate to say this, but it's
up to us now, guys.

493
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:56,136
NARRATOR: Whoa.

494
00:20:56,202 --> 00:20:57,637
Talk about carrying the
weight of the world.

495
00:20:57,704 --> 00:21:00,774
See if the gang can handle
it on the next "Digimon--

496
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:03,276
Digital Monsters."
