hunted high and

2
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,003
low for their D-Tectors.

3
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,006
But those birdbrained Toucanmon
flew off with them.

4
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,542
When they tried to swim after
the birds, some Gomamon

5
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,878
stopped them, which is good,
since they were about to swim

6

into some nasty whirlpools.

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,848
So they all set sail on
a raft they built.

But wouldn't you know it?

She knocked Kazemon to
the ocean floor.

But there, Zoe found
her beast spirit

and evolved to Zephyrmon!

13

The whirlpools calmed
and the beastie

14
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,693
Calmaramon was defeated.

15
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,195
But the Toucanmon and the guys'

16

Don't panic.

Come on, you can, oh!

to do with it?

-It was the Toucanmon.

197
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,661
They stole them.

198
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,097
Then they came here and traded
our stuff to you!

199

-Yeah, right.

200
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,566
You should write books
if you can think up

stories like that.

Do you have any proof?

-Not really.

Wait, give me one, and
I'll spirit-evolve!

-Nice try, kid.

211
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,815
I give you this thing, then
you'll run right out

You remind me of me when
I was younger.

stole them.

get out of here!

-Look, I'm running a business.

If you want them, you'll
have to trade for them.

to me for my hat?
