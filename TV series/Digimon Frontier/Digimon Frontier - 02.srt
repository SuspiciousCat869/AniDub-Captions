00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,035
RIKA NARRATING Everybody in
town was getting strange

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,871
messages on their cell phones.

3
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,440
Takuya, being a gogglehead,
followed the directions and

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,343
this other kid, Kouji, and ended
up with JP, Zoe, and

5
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,378
Tommy on a train to
the digital world.

6
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,213
Tommy wanted to go home,
but he picked a really

7
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,648
stupid way to do it.

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,516
Takuya tried to rescue
him, but things got a

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,885
little out of control.

10
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,354
Bokomon and Neemon were running
away from Cerberumon,

11
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,357
a Digimon trying to destroy
something called a spirit.

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,859
To make a long story short,
Takuya merged with the ancient

13
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,428
spirit of flame, and turned
into Agunimon.

14
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,530
Not bad for a gogglehead.

15
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,598
THEME SONG: Digimon!

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,275
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,378
Digital World.

18
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:48,081
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,584
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:57,558
As we work towards one solution

21
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:01,495
through a Spirit Evolution.

22
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,896
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

23
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,830
Huh!

24
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:04,831
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

25
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,099
Digimon!

26
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,468
Forever united as one.

27
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,469
Digimon!

28
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,406
Together the battles are won.

29
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,340
Digimon!

30
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,643
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

31
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:20,847
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

32
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:25,185
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

33
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,956
Digimon!

34
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,330
-Huh?

35
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,871
What just happened to me?

36
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,675
-You mean before or after you
turned into a Digimon?

37
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:49,843
-Me?

38
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,011
-A Digimon?

39
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,914
-Yes, through the process
of digivolution.

40
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,415
-Digi-what?

41
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,250
It had to be something
I pressed.

42
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,885
Huh?

43
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,887
Come on, digivolution, start!

44
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,689
Operation Turn Me
Into a Digimon!

45
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,057
Execute!

46
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,226
OPHANIMON (ON D-TECTOR):
Fractal code, rendered.

47
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,728
[all exclaim with wonder]

48
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,862
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Oh, boy,
I think I broke it.

49
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:09,730
-I knew it.

50
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,131
It's a fractal code.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,708
-Oh!

52
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:41,261
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): There's
no way this is happening.

53
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,797
Whoa, did I do all that?

54
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,835
-What is--

55
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,337
hm.

56
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,339
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): It's the
dawn of regeneration.

57
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,174
PAGUMON (OFFSCREEN): No more
living in a train station.

58
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,877
Trailmon will never go "whoo,
whoo" in my ear again.

59
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,478
-Nice going, my human friend.

60
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,815
By the way, I'm Bokomon, keeper
of the book, at your

61
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,216
service.

62
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,185
-And I'm Neemon, keeper of my
pants, also at your service,

63
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,720
you awesome human.

64
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,556
-On behalf of the digital world,
accept our thanks, O

65
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,224
human who restores what
has been lost.

66
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,926
-Call me Takuya.

67
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,761
And I still don't know why all
this fractal code stuff is

68
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,096
such a big deal, anyway.

69
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:16,697
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): What?

70
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,532
You really don't know?

71
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,734
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Ohhh,
he doesn't know!

72
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,736
-Hey, why are we running?

73
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:23,770
-I don't know.

74
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,072
-Behold!

75
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,941
Before the evil Cherubimon
came, our world was a

76
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,242
beautiful place.

77
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,078
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Flowers,
trees, and butterflies.

78
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,045
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Neemon!

79
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm in the middle of
something here.

80
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,581
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Sorry.

81
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,249
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): His power
made many Digimon go wild, and

82
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,951
our world started to die.

83
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,087
The only way to bring back
everything that was lost is

84
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,121
with the fractal code.

85
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,590
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): And
I made it happen.

86
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,926
With this little device.

87
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:46,993
-Huh?

88
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,161
-Wow.

89
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,930
I wonder if I could
do it, too.

90
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,897
-Hmm.

91
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,766
I know.

92
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,667
Hey, Tommy!

93
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,634
-Ahh!

94
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,136
-Our devices look the same.

95
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,904
-Maybe girls aren't meant
to be Digimon

96
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,738
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Excuse you!

97
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,841
-Hey, Shorty, I have an idea.

98
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,811
[train chugging on tracks]

99
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:05,445
-Hwaah!

100
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,680
Hwaah!

101
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:09,816
[brakes squealing]

102
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,521
[hiss]

103
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,622
JP (OFFSCREEN): This
place sucks.

104
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,158
It sucks to a T. You
with me, kid?

105
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,161
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
well, I guess so. But--

106
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:21,828
-But?

107
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,996
But what?

108
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,798
-When Takuya turned
in to Digimon, he

109
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,333
looked killer cool!

110
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,534
Just like a superhero.

111
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,702
-(DISGUSTED) Gah.

112
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,070
He wasn't that great.

113
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,238
-Well, I--

114
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,039
I've always wanted
to be a hero.

115
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,541
-Kid, take it from me.

116
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:38,011
This hero stuff is way
overrated, and I should know.

117
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,679
It's entirely too much work.

118
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,915
It's dangerous, not to
mention annoying.

119
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,217
And there's always some sap,
yelling, oh, save me!

120
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,585
Save me!

121
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,386
-Mm, I guess.

122
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,854
-Attaboy.

123
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,523
Now what say we find our
way out of this dump?

124
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,224
OPHANIMON (ON D-TECTOR):
Kouji Minamoto.

125
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,959
Commence your search.

126
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:53,793
-Search?

127
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,728
For what?

128
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,029
OPHANIMON (ON D-TECTOR):
The spirit.

129
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,531
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): How do
you know my name, hm?

130
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,199
OPHANIMON (ON D-TECTOR): Find
the spirit, and you will find

131
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,601
the answers to all
your questions.

132
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,969
-Not good enough.

133
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,306
I'm not some lap dog you can
just order around, you know.

134
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,440
[beeping]

135
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,576
-What is this spirit, anyway?

136
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,645
[beeping]

137
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,114
-I mean, how do I know
where to look for it?

138
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:14,948
[beeping]

139
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,083
-Aw.

140
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,318
What's this?

141
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,953
Huh?

142
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,954
[hiss]

143
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,956
-This gets weirder
by the minute.

144
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,324
-Yeah, you said it.

145
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,627
[beeping]

146
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,030
-Yo, Tommy, check this
little guy out.

147
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,632
Hey, egg-shaped dude with
ears, what's shaking?

148
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,501
-Aah! Hnh?

149
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,837
-Listen, this world of yours
isn't really our scene.

150
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,371
Thing is, we don't know
how to leave.

151
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,272
So what do you say?

152
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,040
Can you help us out?

153
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,208
-Buzz off!

154
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,642
-I'll make it worth
your while.

155
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,511
Here.

156
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,679
-Dohhh.

157
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,680
-Heh, heh.

158
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,984
How about a bar of premium
chocolate?

159
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,518
-Yowlp!

160
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,353
-Ahh!

161
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,688
All right, Egg Face.

162
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,523
Talk to me, and you
get the whole bar.

163
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,693
-Mmm, ahmm, ah.

164
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,829
Hmm, take Angle the Trailmon
at the station.

165
