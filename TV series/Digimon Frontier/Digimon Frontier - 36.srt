NARRATOR: When Cherubimon
decided to give ExVeemon the

2
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:05,877
heave ho, Aldamon and Beowolfmon
took the long-eared

3
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:08,046
ninny outside to
keep him busy.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,248
Meanwhile, the other kids tried
everything they could to

5
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:11,550
free Ophanimon.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,519
Then Trubimon turned into
a major klepto and stole

7
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:16,221
everybody's detectors.

8
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:18,557
Ophanimon finally broke out
of her cage and sacrificed

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,392
himself to get them back.

10
00:00:20,392 --> 00:00:22,894
With the last of her strength,
she gave Takua and Koji's

11
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:25,097
detectors the ultimate
upgrade.

12
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:28,366
All the gang has to do is share
their spirits and the

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,702
unified evolution can begin.

14
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,037
THEME SONG: Digimon!

15
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:42,314
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

16
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:44,950
digital world.

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,955
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other we live by

18
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:58,296
the lessons we've learned as we
work towards one solution

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,234
through a spirit evolution.

20
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,236
I am the one, huh!

21
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:05,570
I am the one--

22
00:01:05,637 --> 00:01:06,571
Digimon!

23
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:09,608
Forever united as one--

24
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:10,809
Digimon!

25
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:13,211
Together the battles are won!

26
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:14,813
Digimon!

27
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:17,449
Through us let your
spirit evolve!

28
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:21,453
When we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:25,590
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all!

30
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:27,159
I am the one, huh!

31
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:28,593
I am the one--

32
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:30,629
Digimon!

33
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,631
-We can't feel Ophanimon!

34
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:34,533
-Use your spirits!

35
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:37,035
-Wind into flame!

36
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:39,538
-Ice into flame!

37
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:41,840
-Thunder into light!

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,208
-Darkness into light!

[music playing]

-Ahh.

54
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:50,508
Another beautiful evolution.

55
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:51,943
-You guys rock!

56
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:53,612
-I'll say!

57
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:57,582
-Enjoy it while you can for
shortly all you'll enjoy is

58
00:02:57,582 --> 00:02:58,617
the comfort of the grave.

59
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,353
Ophanimon was a fool to
sacrifice herself!

60
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:02,320
-No!

61
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:04,155
Actually Cherubimon,
you're the fool!

62
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,657
-What?

63
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,026
-You think you can control the
digital world by yourself, but

64
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:09,861
you're going to destroy
it instead!

65
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:13,431
You're so greedy that you'll
end up with nothing!

66
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:16,868
-But don't worry, we'll stop you
long before that happens!

67
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,536
-Pathetic meddling humans!

68
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:20,739
What could you know of
the digital world?

69
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:22,274
-Apparently more than you!

70
00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:24,509
All of us can see that
your selfishness will

71
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:26,411
destroy this world!

72
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:29,781
-But with Ophanimon's power
behind us now, we'll stop you!

-Then prepare for your doom.

77
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,791
No matter what power you have
gained, you are no match for

78
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:42,427
one of the celestial Digimon!

That was a little too
close for comfort!

84
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:59,311
-You see, I can destroy all
of you that easily!

85
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,845

others to safety!

-Hmm.

-Hmm.

Don't be so quick to gloat.

94
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,664
With your friend gone,
it will be twice as

95
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:22,100
easy to defeat you!

96

-All right, guys.

97
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:25,437
You should be safe up here!

Go stop that guy!

we all know, is awesome!

on you guys!

they're our men!

I need to do something

you will perish!

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,137
-Maybe not, J.P. Those attacks
are wild and unfocused like

unless of course you were
actually trying to hit us!

155
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:51,616
So, are you ready
to surrender?

156
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,251
-This is incomprehensible.

157
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:55,987
My attack should have
annihilated you!

158

-Face it, Cherubimon, we're
too powerful for you!

-You're too powerful?

I was ruling this world before
any of you feeble creatures

even existed!

-You don't even know our
secret weapon yet!

You're powerful, it's true.

But you're all alone.

166

We have the strength of our
friends on our side!

-Don't be fools!

168
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:18,643
The power you have comes only
from the spirits and from

Ophanimon's essence, nothing
more, but neither

00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:23,915
one shall save you!

171
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:25,283
Storm of--

172
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:26,417
-Starburst hunter!

173
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,590
[gasping]

174
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:35,126
-Pyro dragons!

175
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:46,604
[fighting]

176
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:47,605
[shivering]

177
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:48,940
-It's coming down!

178
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:50,341
-We have to get out!

179
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:55,180
-Cherubimon, Not now!

180
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:56,481
We have to save the others!

181
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:58,182
-Right!

182
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:02,787
[moaning]

183
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,788
-Come on!

184
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:04,455
What are you waiting for!

185
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:05,657
-You first.

186
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,792
-Uh, okay.

187
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:08,760
-Come on!

188
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,628
-All right, I'm coming.

189
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:14,966
[moaning and screaming]

190
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,267
ALL: Koji!

191
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,679
[grunts]

192
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:29,681
-Koji.

193
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,316
[grunting]

194
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:37,221
-Wow!

195
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,691
We got out of there just
in the nick of time!

196
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:41,025
-So do you think we got him?

197
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:41,693
-No way!

198
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:43,394
It's never that easy!

199
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:46,864
-(THINKING) After all I did,
he still saved me.

200
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,366
-Guys, look out!

201
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,668
[moaning]

202
00:08:58,576 --> 00:09:01,446
[coughing]

203
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:03,348
-Oh, my head.

204
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:05,316
That's the only part of
me that doesn't hurt.

205
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,883
Huh?

206
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:08,519
[grunting]

207
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,988
-Everyone all right?

208
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:11,356
-Yup.

209
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:12,657
-No one got hurt?

210
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,225
Well, I guess there's a first
time for everything.

211
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,493
-What about me?

212
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:16,361
-I'll help!

213
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:17,862
[giggling]

214
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:19,030
-Nincompoops.

215
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:21,265
-So what happened to
Cherubimon then?

216
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,267
-Well, I suppose you guys
really did defeat him.

217
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,002
-No.

218
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:25,870
ALL: Hmm?
-I know him.

219
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,507
There's no way he could be
defeated that easily.

220
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:32,276
-Even so, we destroyed his
hideout and I bet we did a lot

221
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,578
of damage to him.

222
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:35,246
He's probably off somewhere
licking his wounds.

223
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:37,048
-Thanks to Takuya and Koji.

224
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:39,550
-Not just us, it was
you guys too.

225
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,419
-Yeah, you helped us a lot.

226
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,921
Not only did you give us your
spirits, you were there

227
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:46,257
cheering us on only now
we have a problem.

228
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:47,392
ALL: Huh?

229
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:48,559
-Hey, relax guys.

230
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:50,094
I just meant that we have
to get you your

231
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:52,430
spirits back somehow.

232
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:53,431
Huh?

233
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,933
Aww.

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,268
Whoa.

235
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:01,973
-Hey, I got my spirits back!

236
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:04,475
-Well, I guess the spirits heard
me talking and just came

237
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:05,677
back on their own.

238
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,644
-Welcome back, Kazemon.

239
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:07,979
-Gee whizz.

240
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:09,347
I never thought I'd be so happy
to see something that I

241
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,348
can't even eat.

242
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:16,621
[laughter]

243
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:20,692
[groaning]

244
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:22,460
-Ahh, fresh meat.

245
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,461
-So what are we supposed
to do now?

246
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:34,597
-Make a new plan, I guess.

247
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:37,767
-Well, stop guessing
and start thinking.

248
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,502
-Looks to me like you
have something

249
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:40,269
on your mind, Koichi.

250
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:42,004
You want to share it?

251
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:42,672
-Uh.

252
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:43,506
-Aw, come on.

253
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,707
Don't be shy.

254
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,344
I mean, after all we're all
friends here, right?

255
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,513
-Mm.

256
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,348
-Uhm, Koichi.

257
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:53,549
-Hmm.

258
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:55,851
-So, uh, listen.

259
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:57,687
-Yeah.

260
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,721
-Come on, Koichi.

261
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,623
You can trust us.

262
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:03,959
-Well, you see--

263
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:06,095
[screaming]

264
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:07,697
-What are you yelling
for, Patamon?

265
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,198
-Because he's coming!

266
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:10,700
-For dinner?

267
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,601
-Cherubimon's coming?

268
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:15,838
-Uh, beneath us.

269
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:21,844
[moaning]

270
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:26,382
[evil laughter]

271
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:29,985
-Icedevimon, one of the nastiest
Digimon around, don't

272
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:33,255
expect any mercy from this
cold hearted creature.

273
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:35,858
-Cherubimon sent you to
finish us off, huh?

274
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,326
-Cherubimon?

275
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,861
Ha!

276
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,896
I wouldn't compare me to that
weakling if I were you.

277
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,099
-If you're not with him, what
do you want with us?

278
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,433
-Oh, just death and
destruction.

279
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,569
You don't want to know
what it says in here.

280
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:48,604
-How will I know that
until I know?

281
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:49,739
-You make my brain hurt!

282
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:50,740
Just trust me!

283
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:52,208
He's bad business.

284
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:54,710
Uh, the baddest business.

285
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:56,245
ALL: What?

286
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:58,581
-Well, if you must know, he went
on a rampage across the

287
00:11:58,581 --> 00:12:00,983
digital world destroying Digimon
and eating whatever

288
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:02,685
data he could get
his hands on.

289
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:05,354
Eventually, he was captured and
since he was too powerful

290
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:08,190
for even Cherubimon to destroy,
he was sentenced to

291
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,692
imprisonment without end.

292
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,527
Are you happy now, Mr.
and Mrs. Pushy Pants?

293
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:12,695
-Ha!

294
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:13,662
-But wait a minute.

295
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,064
Imprisonment without end?

296
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:17,166
Sure looks like it
ended to me.

297
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:18,734
-So does the book say where
he's supposed to be

298
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:20,102
imprisoned?

299
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:21,737
-It doesn't, but I have
a sinking suspicion

300
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:23,038
that we found it.

301
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:25,241
-Well, let's unfind it.

302
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,575
Oh.

303
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:29,111
-So tell me, you are
humans are you not?

304
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:30,946
-Yeah, what's it to you?

305
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:32,748
-Hold your tongue
little creature.

306
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:35,451
I simply wish to express my
gratitude to those who freed

307
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:37,253
me from that tiresome prison.

308
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:37,920
-Oh.

309
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,954
Well, you're welcome.

310
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:39,822
[grunting]

311
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:40,589
-Ooh.

312
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,224
-You know, it's funny.

313
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:44,426
I didn't know humans could
evolve into Digimon.

314
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:47,396
Uh, do you have tasty data
like those others?

315
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,130
Yummy.

316
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,298
-Watch it, bub!

317
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:50,232
[grunts]

318
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,801
-The data of the Digimon
Cherubimon

319
00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:53,469
captured was so sweet!

320
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:56,639
[screaming]

321
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:59,475
-Are you telling us that you
destroyed all those Digimon?

322
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:02,411
-You betcha, but I wonder if
your data will be sweeter.

323
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:03,946
Ahh.

324
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,714
-You'll never find out so long
as we have a say in it!

325
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:07,416
-And we do!

326
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,753
-First, I must give you all a
little gift for freeing me.

327
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:13,422
[gasps]

328
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:19,995
-My detector!

329
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:21,497
This is a thank you?

330
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,567
-You're powerful so I'll save
you for later that way we can

331
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:27,469
have a good fight after these
distractions are eliminated.

332
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:31,273
And let me tell you, it will be
so joyous all the pain and

333
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,108
the suffering, don't
you agree?

334
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:35,478
-Okay, we crossed over
into Weirdville.

335

00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:18,914
definitely one of us!

507
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,015
-Yeah, welcome to the party!

508
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:25,687
-All right!

509
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:26,889
It thawed out!

510
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:29,958
-Because Icedevimon was
defeated, everything's going

511
00:20:29,992 --> 00:20:31,026
back to normal.

512
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:32,561
-My pants are soggy!

513
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:34,196
-So's your head.

514
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:37,099
[grunting]

515
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:38,767
-Huh?
[sighs]

516
00:20:42,004 --> 00:20:45,574
-What is that?

517
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:46,909
[evil laughter]

518
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:48,777
-I'll give you three guesses.

519
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,078
-I just need one!

520
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:51,947
It's not over yet, guys!

521
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,983
-But it soon will be for you.

522
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,151
NARRATOR: No way.

523
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:57,953
It's never over for
these guys!

524
00:20:57,986 --> 00:21:00,188
Find out if they could come
out on top on the next

525
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:02,791
"Digimon Digital Monsters!"
