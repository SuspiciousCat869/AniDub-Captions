00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:02,702
RIKA (NARRATING): On their way
to Forest Terminal, the gang

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,871
wound up at Wind Factory,
Incorporated.

3
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:07,707
There, they met the Kokuwamon, a
group of machine Digimon who

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,810
were being forced into slave
labor by the Goblimon.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,213
So Takuya came up with a plan
to save the little guys.

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,148
Once the fighting started,
they all met the

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,683
head honcho, Snimon.

8
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,219
Poor JP, being the only one who
didn't have a spirit, felt

9
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,987
totally useless.

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,323
But when the Spirit of Thunder
was uncovered, JP jumped at

11
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,092
the chance to spirit evolve
to Beetlemon.

12
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,429
He used his Thunder Fist to
squash Snimon like the big ol'

13
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,263
bug that he was.

14
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,531
THEME SONG: Digimon!

15
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:41,408
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

16
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,611
Digital World.

17
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:48,882
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we leave

18
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,750
by the lessons we've learned.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,457
As we work towards one solution

20
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,225
through a Spirit Evolution.

21
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:02,829
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

22
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:03,830
Huh!

23
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:04,764
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

24
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,766
Digimon!

25
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,169
Forever united as one.

26
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,403
Digimon!

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,806
Together, the battles are won.

28
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,407
Digimon!

29
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,976
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

30
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,314
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

31
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:25,318
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

32
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,019
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

33
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:26,786
Huh!

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,654
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

35
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:28,788

KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): Hello?
-Huh?

39
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,061
-A hero!

40
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,062
Quickly, please.

41
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,231
You must release us.

42

KARATSUKENUMEMON (OFFSCREEN):
You'll scare him off!

43
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,466
Don't be so pushy!

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,034
KARATSUKENUMEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Don't want to stay in here.

-Aaahhhhh!

48
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,285
What?

49
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,453
No money?

50

-(IN UNISON) Whoooa!

52
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,958
-Please come back--

53
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,361
when you're not just a
bunch of deadbeats.

54
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,198
-But we're really hungry,
and we do have money.

55
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:45,965
See?

56
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,100
Right here.

57
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,434
Awww.

58
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,335
-You have money?

59
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,171
Let me see it.

60
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,005
Oh, mm.

61
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,607
You call this stuff money?

62
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,009
Frankly, I would have
thrown you out of

63
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,143
that restaurant, too.

64
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,345
Ugh.
-Wha?

65
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,681
-So what's money like in
the Digital World?

66
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,883
You're so smart, how do we get
our hands on some, huh?

67
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,318
-Uh, it's simple.

68
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,186
Stop being so lazy
and go to work.

69
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:07,854
-Huh?

70
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,821
-You want us kids to work?

71
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,523
That's what an allowance
is for.

72
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,858
-Can't you just lend us some?

73
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,365
-(IN UNISON) Yeah,
hand it over.

74

by ourselves.

fractal code, and we told him

we don't even know
where it is.

this.

the fractal code?

-We already talked about this.

As I said, the source
of all energy in the

Everything-- mountains,
rivers, villages--

everything that's solid matter
is made up of energy, so it

has fractal code.

136
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,205
Only in some places, the code
is out in the open, and in

137
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,807
some places, it's hidden.

138

of our story to tell.

140

Grumblemon took all of our
women to trade for the

-Man, guys can sure be
jerks sometimes.

144
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,954
So that's why you
wanted our help?

To save your women?

146

-Yes.

your debt, heroes.

Hold on, you want us to
ride through that?

In this?

think it is.

you kidding me?

173
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,930
Sticking to the side of a

we get up to you?

We can't cling to walls.

You're here?

find any food either.

-Hey, don't lump me
in with you guys.

213

These kids aren't going to be
able to help you at all.

214
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,606
-I'll help you, right
upside the head.

215
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,608
-Well, at least give
us a chance.

I mean, look at you.

218
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,946
The only thing you guys'd
do is get in my way.

219
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,615
Can I help it if you're
not up to my level?

My thanks to all of you

some good food to

-I don't know.

232

get to eat.
