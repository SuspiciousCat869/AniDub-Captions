NARRATOR: While Crusadermon
and Dynasmon continued

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:05,422
gobbling up the digital world,
the DigiDestined ran into

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,857
trouble with lame brain
robber, Saggitarimon.

4
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:11,428
Luckily, four kids appeared
with Angermon

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,629
and drove them off.

6
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:13,429
Good news, except that two
of them were bullies

7
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:14,898
who picked on Tommy.

8
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:15,899
And they just got mad when they
were told to go back to

9
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,434
the real world.

10
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:20,637
Even worse, Saggitarimon
returned with a whole mess of

11
00:00:20,703 --> 00:00:22,105
Centarumon.

12
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,307
Tommy saved one of the bullies,
and the new kids

13
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:25,608
realized it was time
to go home.

14
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:27,177
But even that didn't work out,
because the Royal Knight

15
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,611
showed up and carried
them off.

16
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,613
What else could go wrong?

17
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,682
THEME SONG: Digimon.

18
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:41,858
Look to the past, as we head for
the future to reclaim the

19
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:45,128
digital world.

20
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:48,465
The faith in ourselves and
trust in each other.

21
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:55,371
We live by the lessons we've
learned, as we work towards

22
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:58,808
one solution to a spirit
evolution.

23
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:09,919
Digimon, forever
united as one.

24
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,857
Digimon, together the
battles are won.

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,193
Digimon, through us let
your spirit evolve.

26
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:22,165
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

27
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:28,338
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

28
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,206
Digimon

29
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,143
[screaming]
-Tommy.

30
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,645
-Tommy.

31
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,512
-We'll find you.

32
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,514
-That's great.

33
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,414
-Wow, they're gone.

34
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,315
-Ooh.

35
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,049
-We can all see that.

36
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:40,817
-Let's move.

37
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:41,885
-I wouldn't do that.

38
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:53,563
-Yeah, tracking them down
might be dangerous even.

39
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:54,864
-Hey, Trailmon.

40
00:01:54,898 --> 00:01:56,099
-You might as well
just forget 'em.

41
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:57,567
-But they're our friends.

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,303
-They'll probably send you
a postcard someday.

43
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:03,172
-What?

44
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,174
[grunting]

45
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:06,743
-You're doing great, Tommy.

46
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:10,013
You just keep hanging
onto that net.

47
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,015
-Thanks, I've got a good grip.

48
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:12,982
Huh?

49
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:15,318
Wow, I've never seen
a tree that big.

50
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,220
-Oh, it's like Jack
and the beanstalk.

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,490
-Are those buildings?

52
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:24,060
[screaming]

53
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,695
-Beanstalk Village.

54
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,363
-Bingo.

55
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,399
What would you call a village
with a humongous beanstalk

56
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,602
growing up right in the middle
of it, Bean Town?

57
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,203
-That's a beanstalk?

58
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,072
Is there a mean giant too?

59
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:39,375
-Oh, J.P., it goes
into the clouds.

60
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,143
-Whoa.

61
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:41,210
-Well, this isn't in the book.

62
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,545
-It's tall.

63
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,881
-All right, Trailmon, who wants
to be the lucky one to

64
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,249
take us to Beanstalk Village?

65
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:46,883
-What?

66
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,885
-Huh?
-Ah.

67
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:50,219
-I got to do laundry.

68
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,554
-I got a horn buffing
appointment in Breezy Village.

69
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:53,056
-I'm not going there.

70
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:55,625
-Come on, help us out.

71
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:56,326
-That's just great.

72
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,828
Now what?

73
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,363
-Huh?

74
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:02,865
[snoring]

75
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,534
-Sounds like he's counting
some sheep.

76
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,569
-Or buffalo.

77
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,372
-Well, whatever he's counting,
he's our last chance.

78
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:10,773
-Rise and shine.

79
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,575
All aboard for Beanstalk
Village.

80
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:15,078
[sigh]

81
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:15,979
-Here, jigga, jiggle, jigga.

00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,480
[sneeze]

[groaning]

84
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:19,916
-Hey, what was that about?

85
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,150
-Huh?

86
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,319
-Wake up, I'm trying to get
some shut eye here.

87
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,321
-I just love that you're
so outspoken.

88
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,390
You think a big, take charge
Trailmon like you could help

89
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,491
me out?

90
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:29,292
-Why, sure, you could
just call me Wormy.

91
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:31,327
[sighing]

92
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,129
-Actually, we all could
use your help.

93
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,998
We need a ride to Beanstalk
Village.

94
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,967
-No, you practically scare my
wheels off yelling at me, and

95
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,802
now you expect me to
give you a lift?

96
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,437
-Well, that sure would
be nice of you.

97
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,840
-Listen, I never been there, and
besides, I need more rest.

98
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:44,841
[yawn]

99
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:45,975
Nap time, and don't wake me.

100
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,643
Goodnight.

101
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,811
-A moment, Mr. Worm.

102
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,948
Your plate says otherwise.

103
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,350
-You're the Beanstalk
Village express.

104
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,519
My guess is you were still a
little sleepy and just forgot

105
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:57,453
where you were going, right?

106
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,354
[grumble]

00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:00,957
[rattling]

108
00:04:00,957 --> 00:04:02,492
-What a giver.

109
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:03,659
-He's all heart.

-That beanstalk's familiar.

113
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:14,804
-We're in Beanstalk Village.

114
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,506
-You've been here?

115

[gasp]

116
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:22,779
-What's happened?

117
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:25,782
NARRATOR: Mamemon, a small
ball like robot Digimon.

118
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:28,184
They are friendly, but if
threatened, they pack a wallop

119
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,186
with their smiley bomb attack.

120
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,688
-He's been hurt.

121
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,556
-They must have been attacked
or something.

122

[grunt]

123
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:36,025
-You two did this.

124
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,361
Only creeps like you would
do something this low.

125
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:40,396
-They brought it
on themselves.

126
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,065
They wouldn't tell us
where the hey is.

127
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:45,034
-Huh, what key?

128
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:46,569
-You know what I'm
talking about.

129
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,037
Now out with it.

130
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:52,475
Give us the key or you will
suffer the consequences.

131
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:59,570
-Everybody needs a relaxing
scrub now and then, and you,

132
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:01,639
Mr. Worm, are no exception.

133
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,541
Bet you've never had anyone
fully detail you.

134
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,244
You look great.

135
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:08,479
-You're looking so shiny, we
might need sunglasses.

136
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:10,081
-Think of all the compliments
you'll get

137
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,582
in Beanstalk Village.

138
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:14,352
-Rub a dub, duba duba
doo doo day.

139
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,386
-Hey, are you hungry?

140
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,088
I've got a chocolate
bar we could split.

141
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:18,423
-La.

[humming]

143
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:22,560
-I'm betting that chocolate
bar seals the deal for our

144
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,528
ride, right, eh?

145
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:24,896
-You're wrong.

146
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:25,730
-Huh, how come?

147
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,798
-It's too far.

148
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,633
-Why, you lazy train.

149
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,401
-That's it, I'm out of here.

00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:39,544
Now jump.

-Sure did, we got lucky.

Huh?

00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:54,626
-Did everyone make it?

00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:59,130
-Yup, amazing, considering
how fast Worm took off.

-At least now he's
calmed down.

00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:01,199
[screaming]

167
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:07,939
[grunting]

168
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:10,308
-You can enjoy your stay
in there until

169
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,378
you feel like talking.

170
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:15,480
-Great, how do we
get out of here?

171
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:18,616
-I don't know, but I do those
two creeps work for Lucemon.

172
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:21,119
-What's that key he's
asking about?

173
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:21,619
-Yeah.

174
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:23,588
-Oh, Katuharu.

175
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:24,122
-Who's that?

176
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:24,555
[gasp]

177
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:26,290
[chattering]

178
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:27,825
-Mamemon.

179
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:29,794
-Looks like they've
been beaten up.

180
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:32,630
-So tell us just what happened
here, Elder one.

181
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,533
-It's a long story, but what's
important is the Royal Knights

182
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:38,636
think you humans know where
the key is hidden.

183
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:39,871
-Where'd they get that idea?

184
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:43,374
-And just what is
this key anyway?

185
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:46,177
-To understand, I must share
with you a saying we Mamemon

186
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:48,513
have known for years.

187
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:52,016
The light dwells in the great
beanstalk, promising abundance

188
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,186
to the village once
the key is found.

189
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:58,189
We Mamemon had never taken root
anywhere until we decided

190
00:06:58,222 --> 00:06:59,724
to make a home here.

191
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,426
Our life was hard.

192
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,629
We had little left when you
humans first passed through.

193
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:06,764
Meeting you and your
friends took away

194
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,132
all our heavy hearts.

195
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:10,468
Your smiles reminded us that
we should be kind to those

196
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:12,103
that are strange to us.

197
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:14,706
And to celebrate our friendship,
we planted the

198
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:18,342
last bean we Mamemon had.

199
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:21,345
It grew into our magnificent
life giving beanstalk.

200
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,346
-Huh?

201
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,816
-That bean became this
huge beanstalk?

202
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:25,516
-No way.

203
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:26,851
-You mean it?

204
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,853
-Oh, yes, our lives were filled
with joy and abundance,

205
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,988
all thanks to you humans.

206
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:33,858
Then the Royal Knights arrived
and began turning the digital

207
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,861
world into data and taking
over our land.

208
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:39,831
But the beanstalks roots have
spread into the land, so the

209
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:41,999
data is locked and safe.

210
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,869
The beanstalk you planted
is keeping us alive.

211
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:48,573
Without the key, its data
cannot be scanned.

212
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:51,242
The Royal Knights must believe
you humans have the key or

213
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:52,910
know where it is hidden.

214
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:55,580
Oh, I forgot to tell you the
second part of the saying.

215
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,782
Once the key is found,
the land will

216
00:07:57,815 --> 00:08:00,818
once again sleep peaceful.

217
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:03,688
I'd say the Royal Knights know
about our saying and want to

218
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:05,189
prevent it.

219
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:07,658
-Now I understand why they
want that key so bad.

220
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:10,061
-So how are we going to find
the key before they do.

221
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:11,229
[groan]

222
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:16,601
-Well, first, we got to
figure a way out.

223
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:18,536
[sigh]

224
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:19,871
-Oh, man.

225
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,574
-I'm kind of tired.

226
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,009
Sleepy bye nappy time.

227
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:26,744
-Well, I'm tired of your
attitude, Worm boy.

228
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:28,579
Hm.

229
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:29,580
-Attitude shmatitude.

230
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:30,948
If there was tracks,
I'd be more than

231
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:31,415
willing to take you across.

232
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:32,617
Huh?

233
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,585
-Now, that's a plan.

234
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:35,586
Good plan.

235
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:36,921
[laughter]

236
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:40,091
-Huh, what's going on?

237
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:41,926
[chattering]

238
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,628
-Whatever you're doing,
it's not funny.

239
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,096
[chattering]

240
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,597
-Good job.

241
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:47,999
-Hold on.

242
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:48,599
If you tear up that rail, then
how am I going to get back

243
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,903
where I belong?

244
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:53,437
-We need this to repair
the track ahead.

245
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:55,139
-And now you can't run away.

246
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:56,407
-Sit tight.

247
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:59,977
-This'll just take a sec.

248
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:01,345
[grunting]

249
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:04,081
-OK, next one.

250
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:05,883
-How's it coming, J.P.?

251
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:06,450
-Have it for you in a

252
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:12,723
sec, Z.
-Got it.

253
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,292
[cheering]

254
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:15,393
-Uva, you may.

255
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:19,096
-Hey, human.

256
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,431
-What, Worm?

257
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:22,600
-Tell me, why are you guys so
hot to get to Beanstalk

258
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,001
Village anyways?

259
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:25,770
-We got to save our other
friends who got snatched up by

260
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,271
the Royal Knights.

261
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:30,007
They were heading towards
Beanstalk Village.

262
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,309
-And they have an even
bigger task,

263
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:32,810
saving the digital world.

264
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,979
Without the help of these brave
humans, our world would

265
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:35,980
already be gone.

266
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,615
-What a useless cause.

267
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:38,649
-What?

268
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,851
-You can't fight that.

269
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:41,652
Sooner or later, those Royal
Knights will turn

270
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,454
everything into data.

271
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:45,489
Stuff's disappeared every day.

272
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:48,626
The land I run on is starting
to look like Swiss cheese.

273
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,494
My friends--

274
00:09:50,494 --> 00:09:52,864
I tell you, my boiler starts
burning whenever I think of

275
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,333
all my buddies that are gone
down for the count.

276
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,801
Let's face it, your friends
have probably

277
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:57,668
already been scanned.

278
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,570
You might as well
just pack it in.

279
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:01,005
[sigh]

280
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:02,874
-Huh?

281
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:03,975
Takuya.

282
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,309
-Hey, didn't you hear me?

283
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:06,744
Give it up.

284
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:09,247
-I'm not ever going
to give up.

285
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,681
Tommy, Katsuharu and the others
are waiting for us to

286
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:11,849
rescue them.

287
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,551
I'm not going to
let them down.

288
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:15,720
If we just keep believing in
ourselves and going forward,

289
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:17,722
we will win.

290
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,558
We'll do whatever it takes to
save this world, right?

291
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:21,759
-Uh huh.

292
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:23,761
-Yeah, you bet.

293
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:24,762
-That's right.

294
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:26,063
-I mean, let's face it.

295
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:28,032
The digital world is kind
of like our second home.

296
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,134
-Yeah.

297
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,403
-You call this place home?

298
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,405
And you guys really believe
you can save it?

299
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:36,140
You humans got a lot of
moxie, but how can

300
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,808
you save this place?

301
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:40,478
-I don't have a set plan, but if
we humans join up with all

302
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,613
you Digimon, I know
we can do it.

303
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:45,783
And before you know it, you'll
be back to racing around a

304
00:10:45,816 --> 00:10:49,287
digital world that's in
once piece again.

305
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,955
-When you put it that
way, well, that

306
00:10:50,988 --> 00:10:52,823
sounds kind of great.

307
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,458
Guess we'd better make tracks.

308
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:55,459
-Hey.

309
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:56,794
-You're going to take
us all the way?

310
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:58,596
-How about shodding me up
before we head out.

311
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,131
-Not likely.

312
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,399
-Mamemon.

313
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:04,135
[cheering]

314
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:04,969
-[inaudible].

315
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:05,970
Let's move.

00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:08,272
[screaming]

00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:08,939
-Elder.

[grunt]

319
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:12,476
-You silly prune, you don't
posses the strength

320
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,945
to escape from us.

321
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:14,779
-Let him go.

322
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:15,946
-He hasn't hurt you.

323
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:17,281
[groaning]

324
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:18,949
-You need to us where
the key is first.

325
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:20,451
[sighing]

326
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:34,445
-My servants, oh Royal
Knights, give me

327
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:36,447
what I need, data.

328
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:38,883
Give me more data.

330
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:42,954
Lord Lucemon is calling to us.

331
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:45,690
-Then let's be quick about it.

332
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:46,591
-Elder.

333
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:47,692
-Let him go now.

334
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,428
-No, that would be unwise.

-It is simple.

336
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,766
You tell us where the key
is, we let him go.

was, we wouldn't tell you

happens to me.

Now Worm's on our side.

-We should have taken a plane.

355
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:38,943
-This is why I didn't want to
go to Beanstalk Village.

356
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:40,945
It's one of the roughest routes
in the whole digital

358
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:43,514
-That might explain why
the other Trailmon

359
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:44,449
wouldn't give us a ride.

-Why do you care
about Digimon.

366
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:03,801
Certainly I have value, but
common Digimon are just data.

-They're not just data.

368
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:06,304
They have feelings.

369
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,740
They feel hunger, fear,
happiness and sadness, just

370
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:10,274
like the rest of us.

371
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:12,744
When we met, they had hardly any
food, but they shared it

372
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,178
with us like we were
their family.

To us, the Mamemon
are true friends.

And I will do whatever it takes
to make sure you leave

375

them alone.

-Yes, please, let
go of Elder one.

-It's your human Digicode.

It's quite beautiful.

385

If I scan it, me thinks you'll
become a Digiegg, just like

Digimon do.

498
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,501
-Wondrous the data has been
colored by the beauty of

499
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:57,769
friendship.

500
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,103
-Go now, quickly.

501
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:08,980
[horn]

502
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:12,350
-Lord Lucemon will surely be
pleased with all this data.

503
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,853
-To the dark area and
Lord Lucemon.

504
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:16,888
Transmission.

505
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,695
-It's completely gone.

506
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:25,530
-The beanstalk and
your village too.

507
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:27,265
-It's sad.

508
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:30,268
-Katsuharu, now you and your
friends must leave this world.

509
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:32,270
-Not without taking
you Mamemon.

510
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:34,939
We'll find you a
place to live.

511
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,608
-We will not leave the
digital world.

512
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,409
This place is our home.

513
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,245
Our village was destroyed, but
we can always find another

514
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,614
place to build.

515
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:45,717
But if we were to lose dear
friends like you, that would

516
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,886
truly be a tragedy.

517
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,289
We can always plant another
bean and nurture its

518
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,257
possibilities.

519
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:54,926
Who knows?

520
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,561
This one might even grow as big
as the one you planted for

521
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:57,829
us, Katsuharu.

522
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,233
-Why are all of you
staying here?

523
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,401
-Well, we've still got a
lot of stuff we need to

524
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,836
take care of here.

525
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,238
-Hey, Tommy, why don't you
come back with us?

526
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:08,473
-Mm-mm.

527
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:11,142
I want to stay right here
to help save this place.

528
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:12,477
We have lots of Digimon friends
just like you do, and

529
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,612
we can't let them down.

530
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,314
-We're counting on you.

531
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:17,615
-Thanks.

532
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:19,317
-Well, good luck.

533
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:20,818
-Yeah, we're going back home.

534
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:21,686
-Hey.

535
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,522
-Be careful, you guys.

536
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:27,492
Tommy, your turn.

537
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,793
[screaming]

538
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,533
-Give me a shove this time.

539
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:36,467
[giggling]

540
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,236
[horn]

541
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:40,238
-The earthbound express
is hitting the rails.

542
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:41,639
[horn]

543
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:42,640
[laughing]

544
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:43,674
-See ya.

545
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:48,212
[cheering]

546
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:50,214
-Now we're even, Tommy.

547
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:53,217
-Bye.

548
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,552
-Well, what do you know?

549
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:56,220
A happy ending.

550
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,090
But Tommy and the gang still
have a lot of work to do.

551
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,324
See if they can get it
done on the next

552
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:02,660
Digimon Digital Monsters.
