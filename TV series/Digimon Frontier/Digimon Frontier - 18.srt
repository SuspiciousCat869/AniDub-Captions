NARRATOR: After crashing their
raft about a million times,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,606
the gang finally made it to the
Autumn Leaf Fair, but they

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,040
still couldn't find
the Tucanmon.

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,676
Tommy found out that Datamon
had the detectors, but he

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,345
needed something to
trade for them.

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,514
He went out looking, found the
Tucanmon and even saved their

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,850
lives, but those jerks
just ran off again.

8
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,186
Then a big fight broke out
between Datamon and

9
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,888
Petaldramon.

10
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,023
But when Datamon gave the guys
their detectors back and Tommy

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,359
his bee spirit, they all sent
Petaldramon packing.

12
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,527
Now that they have their
detectors again, everything

13
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,695
seems great.

14
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,530
But something tells me
that won't last long.

15
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,499
-Digimon!

THEME MUSIC: Look to the past
as we head for the future to

18
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,578
reclaim the digital world.

19
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:48,949
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

20
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:53,453
by the lessons we've learned.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,825
-As we work towards one solution
through a spirit

00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,400
-Digimon!

24

-Forever united as one.

-Digimon!

00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,073
-Together, the battles are won.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,308
-Digimon!

28
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,944
-Through us, let your
spirit evolve.

00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,626
-Whoa, whoa!

33
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,332
Chug, chug, cherry chug!

34
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,000
-Boy, this train is
really moving.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,970
Of course, the scenery
is kind of boring.

36
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,305
Not like the scenery
back home.

37
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,206
-Whoa!

38
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,842
Ah, ah, whoa!

-Kori Kakumon, my very
own beast spirit!

Together, there's nothing
you and I can't do.

41
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:59,052
-A good little baby,
yes, you are.

42
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,356
-Zephyrmon, you're becoming more
a part of me every day

43
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,523
and I couldn't be happier.

44
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,225
-Um hm.

45
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:09,029
-Kendo Garurumon, what awaits
us at the Rose Morning Star?

-Who's a bouncy-wouncy
la la la la la.

-Have you guys gone nuts?

48
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,135
What are you talking to
your digivices for?

49
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,638
-Don't knock it 'til you've
tried it, my friend.

50
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,374
-Oh, excuse me, Mr.
Bouncy-wouncy.

-Goodly morning!

54
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,948
Now, would anyone like
a little snacky?

-Me!

Wait!

Can't I just owe you for one?

65

-We're almost there.

It's kicking!

out of the pool!

-There was a pool?

84

How come nobody told me?

-Hey, where are we?

86
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,096
-Now, that's a good question.

-Yeah.

Morning Star Express.

Just what is this Great
Trailmon Race?

might as well look around.

-What's going on?

-Seven Trailmon!

-And seven riders.

110
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,675
Each of the Trailmon is
ridden by someone.

111
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,310
They work as a team.

112
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,313
But Trailmon riding is
dangerous business!

-Excuse me, I can't seem
to find my partner.

prize for the winners?

-The cheeseburger!

-Hey!

117
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,288
Right here!

118
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,490
I'll be your partner!

119
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,325
-Well, I--

120
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,726
-Oh!

121

-He's already got a partner!

let me handle this?

NARRATOR: Shadowweregarurumon
is a

126
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,638
particularly nasty character.

127
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,874
His special attack
is shadow claw.

NARRATOR: Dogmon, he's full of
sneaky tricks and can stretch

130
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:41,915
himself like rubber.

131
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,083
-Oh, goodie!

132
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,050
Together again.

133
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,752
And a good thing, too.

134
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,754
I'd never win with a
human riding me.

-Hey!

137
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,091
That's a rude thing to say!

138
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,359
-Forget this!

139
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,894
I'm not racing

Ahh!

141
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,964
-Now I don't have a rider.

142
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,600
-I'll do it, if that's
OK with you.

143
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,268
-Really?

144
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,537
That'd be swell.

-If she's riding, I'm riding.

What do you say, big guy?

-Swell!

-Ha, ha, this sounds like fun!

149
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:10,443
I'm in!

00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,112
-Now don't blow it!

-You, and me?

-Yeah, yeah, whatever.

-Yeh!

ride in the race?

I don't wanna.

because I'm with egg.

-OK.

thing or what?

[cheers]

170
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,378
-Sounds like you're
ready to go.

171
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,480
And so are they!

172
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,851
10, 9, 8, 7--

173
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,321
-I'm not gonna lose to
a bunch of humans!

174
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:59,593
-3, 2, 1, go!

175
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,594
-Hooray.

176
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,928
-Get moving!

177
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:02,529
-Halt!

178
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,496
Halt!

179
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,561
Halt!

180
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,388
-Right behind you there,
tough load!

181
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:13,255
-Moving!

182
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:15,992
-And there they go!

183
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:16,726
Wait!

184
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:17,960
Where's Kettle?

185
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:19,862
-Wake up, man!

186
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:22,298
We can't go 'til you wake up!

187
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:24,333
-Five more minutes.

188
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,369
-You nit, you haven't
got five minutes!

189
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:27,370
-Oh.

190
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:28,371
-Oh.

191
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:30,373
-Pretend we don't know him.

192
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,975
-Well, if you can't wake
him, join him.

193

[yawns]

194
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:38,347
-Looks like the race is
over for Team Sleepy!

195
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:44,720
-Raccoon Dog and Buffalo
are neck and neck!

196
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,654
-Huzzah.

197
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:46,922
Go, JP, go!

198
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:51,260
-With Mole right behind them!

199

200
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:53,896
-Not you!

[chuckles]

202
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:56,866
-Let's see you laugh
at Beetlemon!

203
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,743
Execute!

204
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,811
Spirit evolution!

205
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:27,963
Whoa!

206
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,632
Beetlemon!

207
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,300
Alright, let's kick it!

208
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,101
-Kick it?

209
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:33,002
Sounds so violent!

210
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,303
-Uh oh.

211
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:35,638
-How do you like that?

212
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:36,839
-It's good, I suppose.

213
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,941
But what's the point
of spirit evolving?

214
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:40,276
I'm not really following.

215
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:42,211
-Hey, it's all about style.

216
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:45,281
It's about being cool
and smooth!

217
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:45,881
Whoa!

218
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:46,882
Oh, whoa!

219
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,851
Whoa!

220
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:50,519
-Hm, you were saying?

[grunts]

00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:55,524
-Oh, man!

225
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,725
That stinks!

226
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,360
Awful!

227
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,829
-Very smooth.

228
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:03,532
[screaming]

229
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:05,067
-You know, it's times like
these I'm glad I

230
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:07,069
haven't got a nose.

231
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:08,370
-Coming through! Coming through!

232
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,371
-Whoa, whoa!

233
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:10,206
-Oh, my.

234
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:11,207
-Catch you later, JP!

235
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,375
-Zoe, wait!

236
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,511
How's about you catch me now?

237
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:17,446
Why does this always
happen to me?

238
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,380
[whimpers]

239
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,050
-Raccoon Dog is out
of the race!

240
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:23,953
Buffalo is in the lead, with
Worm right behind!

[groaning]

-Faster, you hunk
of trail junk!

243
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:30,426
-Now's our chance
to pass them!

244
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,261
-I was hoping you'd say that!

245
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:32,895
Later!

00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,603
-You must go faster!

00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,304
[chuckles]

251
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:45,941

[squeals]

253
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:50,279
-Oh, why do these races
always have hills?

254
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,281
I hate hills!

255
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:52,948
I think I can.

256
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:53,849
I think I can.

257
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:54,850
I hope I can.

258
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:55,584
I can.

259
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,852
-Mole, don't give up now!

260
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:57,853
We're almost there!

-Hey, Zoe!

262
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:01,257
Better hurry up!

263
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:02,858
-Argh!

264
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:05,194
-They're up to the canyon bridge
now, where the course

265
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:09,665
narrows to only two rails!

266
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:12,635
-Dogmon, I think it's a
little too peaceful

267
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:14,003
and quiet up here!

268
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,204
-Hm?

269
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:17,640
Who, whoa, whatever.

Yah!

-We're not going to make it.

273
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:26,515
You have to jump in!

-Gah!

298
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:59,174

on the heavy side.

301
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:07,116
-This happens to be my ideal
weight, thank you very much.

302
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:08,517
-You OK?

303
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,119
-Yah, but my nerves are kaput.

-Ah, you did great!

305
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:13,522
-When I get home, I'm
going straight to

This stinks!

I just wanted a cheeseburger,
is that so wrong?

311
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:27,770
-Mole is out of the race!

And the human is throwing
a major hissy!

313
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,610
Worm has to move carefully.

314

it's all over.

Yes!

you cut that out!

00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:34,721
Oh, what a race!

515
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:36,056
What a race!

516
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:36,656
Oh!

517
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:37,691
Oh! Ow!

518
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:38,692
-Woo!

519
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:39,926
Woo!

520
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,764
[laughing]

521
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,200
-That was the most amazing
thing I've ever seen!

522
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,569
Worm has knocked Buffalo out!

523
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:50,570
-Oh, beans.

524
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:51,905
-Huh?

525
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:53,873
[chuckles]

526
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:56,243
Oh!

527
00:19:56,243 --> 00:20:00,313
-Worm is back on the tracks,
and he's going to win the

528
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:01,948
Great Trailmon Race!

529
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:05,619
This team is going straight
into the recordbooks!

530
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:07,954
-Eh, not bad for a human.

531
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:12,792
-So, what do you say?

532
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:15,462
-I say my wheels hurt, my
chassis's bruised, but nothing

533
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:16,630
feels better than winning.

534
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:18,465
-Worm!

535
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:20,100
-Congratulations,
Worm and Takuya!

536
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:22,636
For your bravery and skill, you
have won a year's supply

537
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:26,106
of Digilube and a trip for
seven to fabulous--

538
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:29,376
-Wait a minute, what about
the cheeseburger?

539
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:31,044
-There must be some mistake.

540
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:35,281
The grand prize is a trip to
Hamburger Digimon Village!

541
00:20:35,348 --> 00:20:36,182
-So no food?

542
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:37,784
-Of course there is.

543
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:40,387
You'll soon have more burgers
than you can eat up in a

544
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,021
lifetime!

545
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:41,888
-Oh!

546
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:42,355
Uh!

547
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:44,057
[tummy growling]

548
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,694
[laughing]

549
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:49,195
-Yeah, yeah, laugh
all you want.

550
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:51,564
My grumbling tummy is nothing
compared to the noises I've

551
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:53,867
heard you guys make!

552
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,336
NARRATOR: There's got to
be an easier way to get

553
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:57,871
food in this place.

554
00:20:57,904 --> 00:20:59,839
But at least they'll get some
chow before their next

555
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:03,610
adventure on Digimon
Digital Monsters!
