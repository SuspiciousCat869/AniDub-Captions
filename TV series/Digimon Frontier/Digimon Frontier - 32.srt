1
00:00:01,247 --> 00:00:02,415
NARRATOR: What is it
with these guys?

2
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:04,951
Just when they finally got back
together, Koji ran off

3
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:08,020
after Velgemon, and then Takuya
ran off after him.

4
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:10,590
JP, Zoe and Tommy looked for
information about the Rose

5
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:12,558
Morning Star, but they
only found a

6
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:14,393
creepy Trailmon graveyard.

7
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:17,063
Inside was an old Trailmon who
said he knew about the Rose

8
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:19,765
Morning Star, but it seems he
only said that to scam a bath,

9
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,267
and some other favors.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,936
Then he turned into
a young Trailmon.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,771
Turns out he really did know
something about the Rose

12
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:26,606
Morning Star.

13
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:28,741
It's where Ophanimon is.

14
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:31,077
Man, this is getting good now.

15
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,445
THEME SONG: Digimon!

16
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:37,483
[theme music]

17
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:40,486
THEME SONG: We look to the
past as we heard for the

18
00:00:40,486 --> 00:00:45,024
future to reclaim the
Digital World.

19
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:49,162
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

20
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:51,164
by the lessons we've learned.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,837
As we work towards one solution

22
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:02,408
through a Spirit Evolution.

23
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,409
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

24
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:04,410
Huh!

25
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:05,411
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

26
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:06,812
Digimon!

27
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:09,415
Forever united as one.

28
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:10,416
Digimon!

29
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:13,419
Together the battles are won.

30
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:14,420
Digimon!

31
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:17,723
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

32
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:21,594
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

33
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:26,399
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

34
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:27,011
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

35
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:27,433
Huh!

36
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,734
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

37
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:30,069
Digimon!

38
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:57,597
-Velgemon.

39
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,833
It is time to make this a
world of true darkness.

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,303
Destroy the light.

41
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:05,538
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN):
Remember.

42
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:08,207
Remember your life in the
human world, Velgemon.

43
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:16,449
-Huh?

44
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,451
(THINKING) I don't get it.

45
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:20,286
Why did he freak out
when he saw me?

46
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,027
Why did he make me remember?

47
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:31,197
What does my past
matter to him?

48
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:33,699
Is he using me?

49
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,701
Or is he really me?

50
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:38,371
He looks just like me.

51
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:48,914
-Koji!

52
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:50,850
Koji, where are you?

53
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:59,625
Come on, buddy, give
me a break here.

54
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:00,726
-Nobody.

55
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,461
They didn't even leave a note.

56
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:03,596
-No way.

57
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:04,897
Bokomon and Neemon
are gone too?

58
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,900
-Oh, didn't we tell them
to stay right here?

59
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:10,569
Those two are even
worse than boys.

60
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:11,804
-Well, I guess they
did what we did

61
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:13,406
instead of what we said.

62
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,941
-Shouldn't we be heading for
the Rose Morning Star?

63
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,779
-We should, but Takuya and
Koji need to go too.

64
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:23,149
-Guys, if you can hear me, go
to the Rose Morning Star.

65
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,650
-There's a castle there,
and that's where

66
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:25,751
they're keeping Ophanimon.

67
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:29,488
-Oh, beans.

68
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:30,990
They can't hear us.

69
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:33,326
-Do you think maybe they're
too far away?

70
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:34,827
-What are we gonna do?

71
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,862
-Well, we did promise
them we'd stay here.

72
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:38,798
-I guess we should wait.

73
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:40,700
Well, at least for now.

74
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:41,834
-What do you mean for now?

75
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:43,336
If we're gonna wait,
let's wait.

76
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,837
-Z, do you think we should go?

77
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:47,239
-Oh Bokomon.

78
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:49,308
Where are you when we
need you the most?

79
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:50,976
-Patamon, where are
you, my boy?

80
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,911
-Patamon!

81
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:53,079
-Please come out already.

82
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:54,647
Hide and seek is over.

83
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,215
Please, come out.

84
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:59,251
-Come out, come out
wherever you are!

85
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:00,386
-Patamon.

86
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,154
He has given us the slip.

87
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,557
-Maybe he just got lost.

88
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,726
-I suppose you expected that
to make me feel better.

89
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,528
-Well, maybe not.

90
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:12,398
-Don't you ever think?

91
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:14,066
He's much too young to
be wandering around

92
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,368
on his own out here.

93
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,736
He's just a baby.

94
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:17,570
Patamon!

95
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,738
Oh, my--

96
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:20,573
-And he thinks I don't think.

97
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,142
He's the one calling Seraphimon
his precious baby.

98
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:26,912
-Koichi.

99
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:28,114
You need to know.

100
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:29,382
You have a brother.

101
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:34,053
-I have a brother?

102
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,922
How can that be?

103
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:40,926
Who am I?

104
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,461
-You are Duskmon.

105
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:48,134
What more do you need to know?

106
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,969
-That boy.

107
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:52,271
-What boy?

108
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:53,639
-Koji Minamoto.

109
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,775
He's my brother.

110
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:57,109
My twin.

111
00:04:57,143 --> 00:05:01,013
-So, you remember him.

112
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:04,717
But why should that make
a difference to you?

113
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,287
-You can't expect me to
fight my brother.

114
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:10,823
-Why can't I, Duskmon?

115
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:13,225
Ah, your memory is flawed.

116
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,327
Don't you remember
your mother?

117
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:22,624
Yes.

118
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:23,792
Your mother.

119
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,794
How could you forget
your mother?

120
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:29,130
I'm sure you'll remember
her if you try.

121
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,066
Remember your mother.

122
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,233
Remember her pain.

123
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,705
I'm home.

124
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,239
Mom?

125
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:39,574
I'm home.

126
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,510
-Koichi.

127
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:44,345
-What's wrong?

128
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,380
Are you OK?

129
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,881
-I'm fine.

130
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:50,885
I'm just a little tired,
that's all.

131
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,253
There's just so much to do.

132
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,057
So, h-how was school?

133
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,525
-Mom?

134
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,194
CHERUBIMON (OFFSCREEN): Your
father abandoned you and your

135
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:02,197
mother to begin a new life
with another woman.

136
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,467
Look, Koichi.

137
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,969
-See you later.

138
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:10,305
CHERUBIMON (OFFSCREEN): Look at
your happy brother with his

139
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:11,439
happy family.

140
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,942
What did you get?

141
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:16,444
KOICHI (OFFSCREEN): I
got what I needed.

142
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:19,447
But my mother.

143
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:20,415
-Ah, yes.

144
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,916
Your poor mother.

145
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,154
They are the ones that
did this to her.

146
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:26,821
Koichi.

147
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,124
Koji, your father.

148
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:32,460
They're the ones who
hurt your mother!

149
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:34,462
They hurt her and
they hurt you.

150
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,631
Feel the darkness
in your heart.

151
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:39,300
That darkness is your greatest
weapon, Koichi.

152
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,034
Use it.

153
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:42,003
Use it to destroy the light.

154
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,772
Light is pain.

155
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:48,209
Destroy the light.

156
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:51,646
Destroy your brother of light,
destroy Koji, and your heart

157
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,881
will be healed.

158
00:06:57,352 --> 00:06:58,520
-Duskmon.

159
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,188
Slide Evolution, Velgemon!

160
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:07,829
-That was too easy.

161
00:07:13,368 --> 00:07:14,435
-Oh, there he is.

162
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:15,670
-Patamon!

163
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:17,272
How's the view from
way up there?

164
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:19,440
-Come to momma, my boy.

165
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:20,909
-Patamon come.

166
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:21,509
Haha.

167
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,411
Come see.

168
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,245
-Come see what?

169
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,580
I'm not telling.

170
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,882
If you want to find out what,
you have to come see.

171
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:28,783
Come see.

172
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,084
Come see!

173
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:33,288
-Takuya.

174
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:35,223
-Bokomon and Neemon.

175
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:38,092
-Well, I'm glad that's
out of the way.

176
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,894
I thought I was gonna have
to change my name.

177
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:41,329
-Oh don't be ridiculous
Neemon.

178
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:42,730
Where is Koji?

179
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:44,432
I can't find him anywhere.

180
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:45,600
-Betcha betcha I can.

181
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:46,334
Come see.

182
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:47,468
Come see Koji.

183
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,970
Follow me to Koji.

184
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,138
See?

185
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,340
-Well, it rhymes, but the
syntax is dreadful.

186
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:53,474
-Patamon.

187
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,242
Wait for us!

188
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,176
-Hey!

189
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,979
I bet the little guy can
lead us right to him.

190
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,314
Times a-wasting!

191
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:00,481
-But of course.

192
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,517
He takes after his poppa mom.

193
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,652
My smart boy will lead
us right to Koji.

194
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:05,486
-I'm so proud.

195
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,854
-He's cracked.

196
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,023
Seraphimon by any other name.

197
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,991
Ah!

198
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,826
Wait for me!

199
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:12,460
-Takuya.

200
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,328
Koji.

201
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:16,130
Come on, you guys.

202
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:17,131
-Still nothing?

203
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,667
-Zip.

204
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,536
-We'll just have to
go find them.

205
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,370
-Huh?

206
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,571
-Guys.

207
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:24,739
This doesn't feel right
to me at all.

208
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,474
-What doesn't feel right?

209
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,909
-What do you mean?

210
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,378
-Uh, I'm not really sure.

211
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,546
Yes I am.

212
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:32,714
I'm absolutely sure we
should do something.

213
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:34,716
-Yeah, you're right.

214
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:37,051
It's up to us to make
something happen.

215
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,354
-It's action time.

216
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:40,588
No more sitting around
waiting.

217
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,390
We're legendary warriors.

218
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:43,191
-Mhmm.

219
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:44,425
You know what we should do?

220
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:45,894
We should go back to Angler.

221
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:48,863
-Now that is a great
idea, J.P..

222
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,566
-Yeah, no reason to walk our
tushies off when we can ride

223
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:54,068
instead, am I right?

224
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,136
-Hey, wait for me!

225
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,532
-Execute.

226
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,800
Fusion Evolution!

227
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:47,855
BeoWolfmon.

228
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,190
Please, wait!

229
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:50,892
I have something to ask you.

230
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:57,498
-Your brother made your
mother suffer.

231
00:09:57,532 --> 00:09:59,767
-I know you're human.

232
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:01,903
Aren't you?

233
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:03,604
-Only darkness will free you.

234
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:05,340
-Velgemon, answer me.

235
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:12,914
Listen to me.

236
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:15,383
Cherubimon wants to destroy
this world.

237
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,584
-The light is your enemy.

238
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:21,122
-Velgemon.

239
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:23,091
Slide Evolution, Duskmon.

240
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:28,162
-Beo Saber.

241
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,805
Why do you fight for
the side of evil?

242
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,807
You're human, just like me.

243
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,143
-Be quiet!

244
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,444
I am just like you.

245
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:44,612
-What?

246
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,980
-Haven't you figured it out?

247
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,985
-Who are you?

248
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:54,689
-I am Koichi Kimura.

249
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:57,198
I'm your twin brother, Koji.

250
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,311
-What?

251
00:10:58,311 --> 00:10:59,560
My twin?

252
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:07,081
-Everything's gone all freaky.

253
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,383
Or maybe it's just me.

254
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,618
Haha.

255
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:11,952
-You won't get any
argument from me.

256
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:14,121
Stop goofing around and help
us look for Angler.

257
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,789
-I was looking.

258
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:18,459
-I'll bet now that he's all
young again, he's out running

259
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:19,960
around like a crazy train.

260
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:20,995
-Listen.

261
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:23,263
[horn]

262
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:26,133
-Hello, [german].

263
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:27,468
-Yeah!

264
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:28,769
-Hey!

265
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:31,772
-Yes.

266
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:34,642
I am Koichi, your
twin brother.

267
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,309
-Liar.

268
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,310
I don't have a brother!

269
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:40,381
-I'm not lying.

270
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:43,450
When our parents got divorced,
they each took one of us.

271
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:46,854
I lived with our mom.

272
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:48,222
-Our father took you.

273
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:51,358
I didn't know it either until
just before we came here.

274
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:52,526
Sad, but true, Koji.

275
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:54,528
We're brothers.

276
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:56,664
You thought mom was dead,
but she's not.

277
00:11:56,697 --> 00:12:00,200
At least she wasn't when
I came to this world.

278
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:02,903
She probably thinks
she lost me too.

279
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,071
-My mother.

280
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,206
Alive.

281
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,776
But how can that be possible?

282
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:11,345
You've lived with her
all this time?

283
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:13,781
You're just trying to
trick me, Duskmon.

284
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:15,849
-You think this is a joke?

285
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,185
Our father abandoned our mother
and married that other

286
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,119
woman.

287
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,188
-No, he wouldn't do that!

288
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:23,090
(THINKING) Is this true?

289
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,592
Is he really my brother?

290
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:28,462
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN): Soon it
will all become clear to you.

291
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:32,066
This mystery will be resolved.

292
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:35,269
-This must be the mystery
she was talking about.

293
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:38,772
-You finally believe me?

294
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:45,079
[shouting]

295
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:46,680
-Koji I got what I needed.

296
00:12:46,714 --> 00:12:47,748
But my mom--

297
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:56,290
Deadly Gaze!

298
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:15,509
It's time to end this.

299
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:17,845
Duskmon slide evolution
Velgemon!

300
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:23,417
-No, wait!

301
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,153
Please, if your story is really
true, turn back to your

302
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,920
human form.

303
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:28,555
I want to hear more about you.

304
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:30,891
I want to hear more about mom!

305
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:31,925
-It's too late.

306
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:39,399
Dark Obliteration!

307
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:50,410
-Takuya!

308
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,912
Koji.

309
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:52,980
Ah!

310
00:13:53,013 --> 00:13:55,048
-Whoa!

311
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:56,116
-Just in time.

312
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,217
-Mhmm.

313
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,456
-Argh.

314
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,096
Enough, enough, enough!

315
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:12,332
Boom Bubble!

316
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,300
Boom Bubble.

317
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,301
Boom Bubble.

318
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:15,302
Boom Bubble.

319
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:16,837
Boom Bubble!

320
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:17,671
-Patamon.

321
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:21,108
-Crazy little guy.

322
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:22,042
What is it?

323
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:22,776
Come on.

324
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:24,378
We have to Spirit Evolve.

325
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:26,213
-I can't do it.

326
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:27,147
-What?

327
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:27,614
-Takuya.

328
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:28,382
He's my brother.

329
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:30,184
I can't fight him.

330
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:32,052
-He's your what?

331
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:33,720
-Hey, did I miss something?

332
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:34,721
-My word.

333
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,390
Why didn't someone tell
me this before?

334
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:37,691
-That's impossible.

335
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,860
Koji, you said you were
an only child.

336
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,662
-Yeah, I thought
I was, until--

337
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:43,030
-You can't believe that creep.

338
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,898
He's just trying to mess
with your mind.

339
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:46,834
-He's my brother.

340
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,235
I know it's true.

341
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,504
I knew it the first
time I met him.

342
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:51,872
-But it's so weird.

343
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:54,107
-You're telling me.

344
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:56,844
But there's no doubt
in my mind, he's

345
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:58,545
my brother all right.

346
00:14:58,612 --> 00:15:00,714
And that freak Cherubimon
is using him.

347
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:02,749
He gave him the spirit
of darkness.

348
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:06,587
My twin brother is the
Warrior of Darkness.

349
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:10,090
-Your brother.

350
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:10,757
Come on.

351
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:11,725
It's my turn, Shinya.

352
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:12,426
Give it back.

353
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:13,427
-No it's not!

354
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:14,228
-It is too!

355
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:14,761
Besides--

356
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:15,596
-Mom!

357
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:16,129
-It's my game anyway.

358
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:17,097
-It's not neither!

359
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:17,931
-Let go.

360
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,434
Takuya, what have I told you?

361
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:21,602
You're the big brother.

362
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:24,104
I expect you to behave
like it.

363
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:24,571
-Hmph.

364
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:25,772
-Young man.

365
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,007
-Fine, be that way.

366
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:34,414
Mom always takes his side.

367
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:35,983
It's just not fair.

368
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:42,856
Great.

369
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:45,993
This is just great.

370
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:47,327
Huh?

371
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:55,636
Whatcha doing?

372
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,204
Over there, buddy.

373
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,205
Get it!

374
00:15:58,272 --> 00:16:00,340
-Aw, it got me.

375
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:01,341
-Don't worry.

376
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:02,676
You'll get him next time.

377
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:04,311
-Yeah.

378
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:05,345
-A brother.

379
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:06,513
Wow, Koji.

380
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,382
I'm really happy for you.

381
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:09,383
That's great.

382
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,984
-Huh?

383
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:13,220
-Well, I'm sure you'll fight
a lot, but that's just what

384
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,722
brothers do.

385
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:17,424
Man, I miss my little brother.

386
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:20,427
I never knew how much he
meant to me, you know?

387
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,696
-Wha?

388
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:25,365
You really do live in a
different world, Takuya.

389
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,100
He has an evil spirit.

390
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,069
-Well then, we'll just have
to get it away from him.

391
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:30,704
All your brother really
need is a little

392
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:32,406
Fractal Code Digitize.

393
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:33,974
-I can't.

394
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:35,809
I won't fight him.

395
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:38,211
I can't attack my own brother.

396
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:39,313
-Argh.

397
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:40,414
Listen to me!

398
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:41,782
You'll fight him, and
I'll tell you why.

399
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:43,216
Because he's your brother.

400
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:44,718
You're the only chance
he has, Koji.

401
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:47,411
If his brother won't
save him, who will?

402
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:52,415
Koichi needs you.

403
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:53,616
We need you.

404
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,952
Heck, the whole Digital
World needs you.

405
00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:56,619
-Huh?

406
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:59,088
-Boom Bubble!

407
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,790
I think I ran out of boom.

408
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:02,058
-Run!

409
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:04,393
You little twerp.

410
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:05,595
-Patamon.

411
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:10,766
My brave little boy.

412
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:13,002
I'm so proud of you
I could just cry.

413
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:16,138
-You can stay down here and feel
sorry for yourself, but I

414
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:17,473
have a fight to win.

415
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:28,684
Execute now!

416
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:30,119
Fusion Evolution!

417
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:49,705
Aldamon!

418
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:55,044
-Let me go.

419
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,345
I gotta fight!

420
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:57,013
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
That's crazy talk.

421
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:58,214
Stop wiggling.

422
00:17:58,214 --> 00:17:59,215
-Koji.

423
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:00,549
Please.

424
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:01,884
We have to fight him
to save his life.

425
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:04,520
-But--

426
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:05,554
-Dark Vortex!

427
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:16,065
-Let him go!

428
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:17,900
Aldamon!

429
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,937
-All your brother needs is a
little Fractal Code Digitize.

430
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,439
Koji.

431
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,141
If his only brother won't
save him, then who will?

432
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:39,622
-Execute!

433
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:40,756
Fusion Evolution!

434
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,844
BeoWolfmon.

435
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:03,145
-Now we're talking.

436
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:10,686
Dark Vortex.

437
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:13,823
-Beo Saber!

438
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,530
-We got him now.

439
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:22,598
Solar Wind Destroyer!

440
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:30,673
We got him on the ropes.

441
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,741
It's up to you.

442
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,281
-Frozen Hunter!

443
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:56,932
-What is that?

444
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:01,270
-The spirit of darkness.

445
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:06,142
-Unwilling slave of darkness,
be purified by the light.

446
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:07,910
Fractal Code Digitize!

447
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:13,115
-You did it.

448
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:14,817
My word, you actually did it.

449
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:20,122
-You all right?

450
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:25,795
-Hang on, darlings.

451
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,871
[gasping]

452
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:42,811
-He's the one.

453
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:54,590
How did this happen?

454
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:57,393
-NARRATOR: Man, I hope he
doesn't expect a quick answer

455
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:58,694
to that one.

456
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:00,229
We're just gonna have
to keep watching

457
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:02,865
Digimon, Digital Monsters!
