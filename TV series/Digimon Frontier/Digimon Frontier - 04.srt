gang they could take the train

00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,271
back to reality, but they all
decided to stick it out in the

00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,678
Bokomon took this as his cue
for another lecture.

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,481
Fortunately, he was interrupted
by the Candlemon.

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,651
Unfortunately, the Candlemon
weren't too happy to see them.

9
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,053
They turned up the heat on
Agunimon, who seemed to be in

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,357

evolved to Kumamon and

11

took on Wizardmon and the
whole Candlemon tribe.

12

It turns out it was all
some kind of test.
