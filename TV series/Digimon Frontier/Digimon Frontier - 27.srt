00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,536
NARRATOR: Mirror, mirror
on the wall, who's the

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,538
fairest of them all?

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,874
Well, you'd better say Ranamon,
or she'll sick her

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:09,009
Honeybeemon goons on you
like she did on Zoe.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,845
Luckily, the Honeybeemon weren't
so hot at getting Zoe.

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,313
They even became her friends.

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,516
But Ranamon got Zoe to eat a
poisoned apple and tried to

8
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,518
convince her that no
one liked her.

9
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,653
They ended in a real knock
down, drag out fight, and

10
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,022
Ranamon was finally defeated!

11
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,858
Zoe and her new friends met up
with Tommy and the others, but

12
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,860
Takuya and Koji were still
trapped in their own worlds.

13
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:30,831
And who knows when, or if
they'll be able to get out?

THEME SONG: We look to the past
as we head for the future

17
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:44,778
to reclaim the Digital World.

18
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:49,082
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:51,218
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,591
As we work towards one solution

21
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,926
through a Spirit Evolution.

22
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,563
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

23
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:04,264
Huh!

24
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,165
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

25
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,166
Digimon!

26
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,169
Forever united as one.

27
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,804
Digimon!

28
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,173
Together the battles are won.

Digmon!

30
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,810
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,348
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

32
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,485
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

33
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,486
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,187
Huh!

35
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,488
Hi-ya-moo-ah!

00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,823
Digimon!

37
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,200
-Koji.

38
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,178
-I believe I just saw
Koji up there.

39
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,248
-I believe in Santa Claus,
but I know I saw Koji.

40
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,750
-Ugh, please ignore him.

41
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,385
-Let's get up there.

42
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,920
-Mhmm.

43
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,021
-I'm ready.

44
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,698
-Execute!

-Beetlemon!

48
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,521
-Kumamon!

49
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,822
-You can do it.

50
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,593
-Hang in there, Koji.

51
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,828
We're coming!

52
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,196
-Brace yourself for impact.

53
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,407
-Oh dear.

54
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,910
I believe we need
to rethink this.

55
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,245
-I believe in flying Duskmon.

56
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,080
-Oh?

57
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,381
-What now?

58
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,415
-No idea.

59
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,428
-He made it in.

60
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,730
-Unfortunately, Taki and
Koji don't know that.

61
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:51,598
We've got to warn them.

62
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,566
-No kidding.

63
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,900
But how are we supposed
to do that?

64
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,236
It's not like we can just pick
up a phone and call him.

65
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,405
-Hm.

66
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,573
I wonder.

67
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,509
Maybe we can.

68
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,479
Maybe there's a way to use the
D-Tector to contact them.

69
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,315
(THINKING) I wish this thing
came with instructions.

70
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,683
-Koji!

71
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,284
Zoe?

72
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,186
J.P.!

73
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,821
Tommy!

74
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:15,655
Aw, man.

75
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,823
Where is everybody?

76
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,525
I wish I could talk to them.

77
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,826
[buzzing]

78
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,495
-There's something new.

79
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,130
Huh?

80
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,465
ZOE: Takuya, can you hear me?

81
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,166
I can't believe it.

82
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,534
Zoe, is that you?

83
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,468
-No way!

84
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,636
I mean, yeah!

85
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,872
10-4, copy that, loud and
clear good buddy.

86
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:32,405
TAKUYA: Ha.

87
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,573
-Wow.

88
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,541
TAKUYA: Where'd you learn
to talk like that?

89
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,709
Wait, never mind.

90
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,510
Where are you?

91
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,744
Are you alone too?

92
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,680
-I'm outside with J.P., Tommy,
Bokomon, and Neemon.

93
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,681
But, listen.

94
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,550
You're in danger, Takuya.

95
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,851
You're inside Sakkakumon.

96
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,419
TAKUYA: Sakkaku-wha?

97
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,554
-Sakkakumon.

98
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,056
Mercurymon Beast Spirit
Evolved into a hideous

99
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,059
creature, and you, young man,
are deep inside it.

100
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,530
-That explains the smell.

101
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,564
-This isn't funny.

102
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,132
We gotta get him out.

103
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,801
-Sakkakumon is a
multidimensional being, so

104
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,536
please, stay alert.

105
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,771
Portals to the outside sometimes
appear once you've

106
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,273
won the battle.

107
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,608
Yeah, we all managed to escape,
but now that we're

108
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,310
outside, it seems like it's
impossible to get back in

109
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,645
there to help you and Koji.

110
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,445
TAKUYA: Man.

111
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,947
Well, have you contacted Koji?

112
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,749
-No, but we're about to.

113
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,750
-Koji, come in.

114
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:17,651
-Talk to me.

115
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,252
-Duskmon just went inside.

116
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,787
I think he's after Koji.

117
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:21,988
Please, be careful.

118
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,590
-Thanks.

119
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,925
Hang on, Koji!

120
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,459
I'm on my way.

121
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,130
DUSKMON (OFFSCREEN): Koji.

122
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,132
Who are you?

123
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,935
-Duskmon!

124
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:46,637
-I can't wait any longer.

125
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,807
I need to know.

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,475
What is our connection?

127
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,644
Why do I feel like I know you?

128
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,180
And why did you come
to this world?

129
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:58,649
Give me your memories.

130
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,983
Now!

131
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,166
-Hi, looking for a present
for someone?

132
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,501
It's for your mother, right?

133
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:18,869
-Kinda.

134
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:19,836
-I'm not a which or anything.

135
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,871
I just like to guess
that stuff.

136
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:21,872
Do you want some help?

137
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:23,073
-Uh, yeah.

138
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:24,708
-Oh, I love my job.

139
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,177
All right, let's find something
really pretty.

140
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,178
-Argh!

141
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:29,880
-Let me guess. Birthday?

142
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:30,914
No, anniversary!

143
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:32,716
-Their anniversary's today.

144
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:33,684
How'd you know that?

145
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:34,284
-I don't know.

146
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:35,519
It's my own little game.

147
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,888
So, what, about 10
or 15 years?

148
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:39,556
-Actually, it's three years.

149
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:40,190
-Three years.

150
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:42,125
How wonderful for them.

151
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:42,960
Well, wait a minute.

152
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,294
You must be at least 12.

153
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:46,129
Why have your parents only been
married for three years,

154
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:46,763
huh?

155
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,098
-Um, well.

156
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:48,599
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN): Koji.

157
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,435
Are you there?

158
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:52,636
KOJI (OFFSCREEN):
What is this?

159
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:53,604
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN): This
is part of a game.

160
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:56,139
A test to determine
your future.

161
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:57,241
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): My future?

162
00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:02,246
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

163
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,915
Are you willing to play Koji?

164
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:10,854
Very good.

165
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,491
Now, you must get to the Shibuya
Station by 6:00.

166
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:16,159
Take the elevator
to the basement.

167
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:16,994
What?

168
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:18,595
But I--

169
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:20,197
I have to go to my--

170
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,665
-Hey, flowers are ready.

171
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,220
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): I'll pick
them up later, OK?

172
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,134
-But--

173
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,702
All right.

174
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,005
Bye!

175
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:29,640
-What am I doing here?

176
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:31,975
How can this determine
my future?

177
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,210
-Argh.

178
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:38,548
-What is it?

179
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,522
What is this horrible
human emotion?

180
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:50,761
-Koji!

181
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:52,329
This sadness.

182
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,731
Overwhelming.

183
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,266
-Let me guess, you're looking
for something for

184
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,701
your mother, right?

185
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,203
-Their anniversary's today.

186
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:01,738
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN):
Koji, are you there?

187
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,407
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Actually,
it's three years--

188
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,209
three years.

189
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:08,578
-Why am I even affected?

190
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:12,416
Why should I care about
him or his parents?

191
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,419
What is this connection?

192
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,087
-Get out of my head, Duskmon.

193
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:18,388
Leave my memories alone.

194
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:19,489
-Silence!

195
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:20,557
-Ah!

196
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:28,965
[knocking]

197
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:29,800
-Koji?

198
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,267
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Yeah?

199
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,968
-Coming in.

200
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:32,936
Your mom's photo.

201
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,139
I haven't seen that
in a long time.

202
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,275
Son, I know it's been hard since
your mom died, but you

203
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,811
need to accept your stepmom.

204
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:43,814
-Ugh.

205
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,815
But she's not my mom.

206
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:46,216
She'll never be.

207
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:47,551
I don't need a mother anymore.

208
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,224
Well, can you at least try to
be nice to her for my sake?

209
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:57,127
-Ah!

210
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:58,295
-Ugh.

211
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:00,197
I don't want this burning.

212
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,698
This is his struggle.

213
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:04,568
I don't want to feel
this pain anymore.

214
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:08,705
I've got to put an
end to this, now.

215
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,374
-(THINKING) Why is he
doing this to me?

216
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:11,875
I don't understand.

217
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:14,077
-Am I still stuck
in Sakkakumon?

218
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:17,247
Whoa, bet I can't say that
five times fast.

219
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:18,048
-Frozen Fury!

220
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:19,383
-Whoa!

221
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,620
-That's what I call
a cold reception.

222
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:37,267
FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
IceLeomon, the proud and

223
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:38,935
mighty king of the cold.

224
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:41,738
His chilling attacks will stop
anyone in their tracks.

225
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:44,741
-Frozen Fury!

226
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:47,611
-I don't have time to play
with this nasty kitty.

227
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:50,747
Koji needs my help and I won't
let you stand in my way!

228
00:09:56,353 --> 00:09:58,922
Execute!

229
00:09:58,955 --> 00:09:59,956
Spirit Evolution!

230
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:16,506
Agunimon!

231
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:32,522
He's dazed.

232
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,926
It looks like he's under the
spell of Sukkakumon.

233
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,094
Aw, man.

234
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:40,230
And I thought this place
couldn't get any worse.

235
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:50,711
[shouting]

236
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:51,812
-Duskmon.

237
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,414
You hesitate.

238
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:55,049
You alone posses the
spirit of darkness.

239
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:58,152
Do you realize its full power?

240
00:10:58,219 --> 00:10:59,854
Mercy cannot exist.

241
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:03,023
Remove this obstacle at once.

242
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:05,226
-That's not what you really
want, Duskmon.

243
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:06,427
-Ignore him.

244
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,363
Listen to the darkness
in your heart.

245
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:12,366
Destroy this human and
fulfill your destiny.

246
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,573
-I will cover this world
in darkness.

247
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,908
-I can't let that happen.

248
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:32,586
Execute.

249
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,621
Spirit Evolution!

250
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:44,265
Lobomon!

251
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:45,299
Lobo Kendo!

252
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:58,545
-Get him, Lobomon.

253
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,214
-Take that creep apart!

254
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:01,348
J.P. (OFFSCREEN):
All right, Z!

255
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:05,853
-Come on, Agunimon.

256
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:09,690
Hang in there!

257
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:11,058
-Oh, he's struggling.

258
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:12,893
-Which Agunimon or Lobomon?

259
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,195
They're both fighting.

260
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:18,499
-Neither of them.

261
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:21,669
I'm actually referring
to Seraphimon's egg.

262
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:22,536
Oh dear.

263
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:23,871
I'm feeling faint.

264
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,709
-I know you don't really
want to fight me.

265
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,277
You're being controlled.

266
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:32,680
-Your feeble plea for
mercy won't work.

267
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:34,081
-(THINKING) He doesn't get it.

268
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:36,016
I guess I have no
other choice.

269
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:36,917
-(THINKING) The smug fool.

270
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:40,421
No one controls IceLeomon.

271
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:44,391
-I think it's time to melt
your frozen heart.

272
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:45,759
Pyro Punch!

273
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,061
-Blizzard Breath!

274
00:12:58,105 --> 00:12:59,506
-Missed me, oh master
of darkness.

275
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:09,316
-Is that all you've got?

276
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:10,584
Fight me.

277
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:14,188
-Howling Laser!

278
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:18,325
-Very pretty, but I'm afraid
you'll have to do a lot better

279
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:20,160
than that to defeat me.

280
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:22,997
-I intend to.

281
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,131
-Pyro Torch!

282
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:28,302
Pyro Tornado!

283
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,223
Let's bring you in
from the cold.

284
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:50,190
Goodbye, Kitty.

285
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:54,728
It's time to get purified.

286
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:56,430
Fractal code digitize!

287
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,141
It's the outside.

288
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:10,044
I'm out of here!

289
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:12,613
-Now that we're outside, it
seems like it's impossible to

290
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:13,714
get back in there.

291
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:15,549
-(THINKING) Koji.

292
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:16,617
Can't leave yet.

293
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:21,655
-Slide Evolution!

294
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:27,127
Lupine Laser!

295
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,331
-Bad doggy.

296
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:39,206
I'll give you something
to howl about.

297
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,307
Lunar Plasma!

298
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:45,345
-You're gonna be the one
howling this time.

299
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:49,349
Howling Star!

300
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:04,531
[yelling]

301
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:05,499
-Oh, it's coming.

302
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:06,233
I feel it.

303
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,867
My baby's coming.

304
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,668
Somebody.

305
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:08,869
[groaning]

306
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:10,037
-You're scaring me.

307
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:12,773
-Neemon, I'm the one
having the baby.

308
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:14,842
-Uh, what are we supposed
to do to help him?

309
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,543
-It's a first for me.

310
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,911
-Why's it happening now?

311
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:19,780
I'm too young for this.

312
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:20,781
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Oh no.

313
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:23,283
The light went out in
Agunimon's area!

314
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:25,419
-Bokomon, this really isn't
a very good time.

315
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:27,221
-It's not up to me.

316
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:29,089
Instead of standing there
like a lump of sap,

317
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:30,624
maybe you could help.

318
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:31,959
-Koji!

319
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:37,731
-Anything else you'd
like to try?

320
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:38,765
-Got to do something.

321
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,571
I know it's not supposed
to end like this.

322
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,073
OPHANIMON (OFFSCREEN): This
is part of a game.

323
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:49,009
A test to determine
your future.

324
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,677
-I can't let Duskmon win.

325
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,079
I just can't.

326
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:53,347
Not yet.

327
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:58,652
-It's time to say goodbye.

328
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:07,413
Any final thoughts?

329
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:10,950
-I'm sorry, Dad.

330
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:13,385
It hurt so much when mom died.

331
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:16,088
I guess I'm not over it.

332
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,090
-Well, can you at least try to
be nice to her for my sake?

333
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:24,129
-I tried to do it.

334
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:27,333
I'll pick them up later, OK?

335
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:29,802
I'll go back for
those flowers.

336
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:30,803
It's not their fault.

337
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:33,672
-No, stop it.

338
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:35,341
-I've been meaning to
tell you something.

339
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:38,310
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:40,312
These are for you, mom.

341
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:41,313
-Enough!

342
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:43,849
-I'm sorry!

343
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,185
[groaning]

344
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,820
-Oh?

345
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:48,954
-What's happening?

346
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,132
-Please be careful, baby.

347
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:11,243
-What was that?

348
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:15,714
What is this hideous
force of light?

349
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:16,749
-A brand new power source.

350
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:33,465
That's my spirit of Lobomon,
and KendoGarurumon.

351
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:41,440
I feel them.

352
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:43,442
My humand and beat spirits
have come together.

353
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:55,954
Execute!

354
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:57,022
Fusion Evolution!

355
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:17,476
BeoWolfmon.

356
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,681
-[italian].

357
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:23,982
-It's Koji.

358
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:26,352
-His two spirits have
come together!

359
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:27,519
-He's pretty.

360
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,355
-Actually, combined, they
become BeoWolfmon.

361
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,857
-Hold up.

362
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:34,360
Just how did you find out
his name is BeoWolfmon?

363
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,594
-That's a silly question.

364
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:38,430
What else will you call him?

365
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,398
-Uh.

366
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:40,332
[sniffing]

367
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:42,568
Uh.

368
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,603
-Go get him, BeoWolfmon.

369
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:47,039
-Um, where's the baby?

370
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:49,041
-I underestimated you.

371
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,076
But I don't understand.

372
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,611
You're miserable, Koji.

373
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:55,080
What do you have to fight for?

374
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,416
-I have some unfinished
business to attend.

375
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,885
Maybe you're so far gone that
you've given up on those you

376
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:03,422
care about, but I've been given
a second chance, and I'm

377
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:04,556
gonna take it!

378
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:13,799
-Koji!

379
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:33,952
-Who is that?

380
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:43,896
-Oh man.

381
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:45,397
I'm too late!

382
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,698
Koji, no!

383
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:52,237
-Now where are they going?

384
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,338
J.P. (OFFSCREEN): Koji!

385
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:03,382
-My dear sweet baby.

386
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,917
-He came to me.

387
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:06,051
Does that mean I'm
his uncle now?

388
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:16,128
-Duskmon.

389
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:19,631
Let the darkness embrace you.

390
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:21,433
That is where you belong.

391
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,770
Cover this pathetic world in
darkness, and it shall become

392
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:27,105
your kingdom forever!

393
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:28,240
-Yes, master.

394
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:33,445
My kingdom awaits.

395
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:43,121
-I have to find out.

396
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:46,258
(THINKING) Somewhere deep inside
that dark heart is just

397
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:50,195
a kid in pain, like me.

398
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:51,663
How are we connected?

399
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:54,600
Who is this Duskmon?

400
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,701
NARRATOR: Argh.

401
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:57,336
I can't take this anymore.

402
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:58,270
Now I gotta know.

403
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,172
Maybe we'll all find
out on the next

404
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:02,741
Digimon, Digital Monsters.
