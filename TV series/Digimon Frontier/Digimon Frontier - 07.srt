RIKA NARRATING: While trying to
find food, the gang hooked

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:04,495
up with the KaratsukiNumemon.

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:06,297
They agreed to help rescue
their women from the evil

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,298
Grumblemon for some chow.

5
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,400
Even Kouji helped out.

6
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,602
But when they told the snails
they were Legendary Warriors,

7
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:14,271
they were captured themselves
to be traded for the women.

8
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,307
Turns out the creep who stole
the women was a Legendary

9
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,308
Warrior, too.

10
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:19,977
But Grumblemon had the
power to Beast

11
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:22,179
Spirit Evolve to Gigasmon.

12
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:23,647
He defeated our heroes, and ate
the Fractal Code for the

13
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,282
KaratsukiNumemon's mountain.

14
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,652
With the gang split up, it looks
like the Forest Terminal

15
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,387
will have to wait until
they find each other.

16
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,722
Can't these guys get
anything right?

17
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:32,990
THEME SONG: Digimon!

18
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,700
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

19
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,370
Digital World.

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,708
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

21
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,076
by the lessons we've learned.

22
00:00:55,146 --> 00:00:58,716
As we work towards
one solution,

23
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:03,120
through a Spirit Evolution.

24
00:01:03,154 --> 00:01:04,388
Ha-ya-moo-ah! Huh!

25
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:06,057
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

26
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,691
Digimon!

27
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:10,094
Forever united as one!

28
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:11,696
Digimon!

29
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:14,432
Together the battles are won!

30
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:15,699
Digimon!

31
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:18,736
Through us, let your
spirit evolve!

32
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:22,640
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

33
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:26,077
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all!

34
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,079
Ha-ya-moo-ah! Huh!

35
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:29,447
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

36
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:31,449

38
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:39,423
-Man, is this ever gonna end?

39
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:41,025
-Uh-oh!

-[screaming]

41
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,003
-This looks like more
fun than it is.

42
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:55,039
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): You're
not kidding.

43
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:55,806
-Whoa.

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,508
Is this a big playground?

45
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:01,345
And if it is, what needs
a playground this big?

46
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:04,148
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): We're gonna
find out, aren't we?

47
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:06,750
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Of course.

48
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:09,487
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Cast
us aside, will they?

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,921
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Actually, they already did.

50
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:12,490
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I
was speaking rhetorically.

51
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:13,023
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Oh.

52
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,091
What does that mean?

53
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,226
-Ugh.

54
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,495
Soon, we will go to the
world of the humans.

55
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:20,564
And then we will finally
have our revenge!

56
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:23,100
Revenge on the selfish
human children!

57
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:27,938
[laughing]

58
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:30,608
-Keep your eyes peeled
for Zoe and the guys.

59
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,610
-Something tells me they're not
going to be easy to find

60
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:34,378
in this place.

61
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,412
-What?

62
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:39,116
Hey, maybe that flying
guy has seen them.

63
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:41,418
-A flying toy robot! Neat!

64
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:42,086
-Wait!

65
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:43,487
-Hey, robot!

66
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,222
-I don't know one of
them is worse.

67
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,293
-Check it out.

68
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:51,562
This is awesome!

69
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,296
-Hey!

70
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,631
Where'd he go?

71
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,298
-Don't sit down.

72
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,133
We don't have time for this.

73
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,936
-[laughing]

74
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,504
-What a baby.

75
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:01,472
-I am not!

76
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:03,607
These are just cool toys!

77
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,443
-Yeah, they are cool, but this
probably isn't the best time

78
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,311
to be playing.

79
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:08,479
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, come on.

80
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:10,314
When else can we play with
all these neat toys?

81
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:11,182
-Oh.

82
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:13,317
Is this the flying robot?

83
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:16,387
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Hey, maybe
the cars can play, too.

84
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,788
-Hey, that is cool.

85
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,989
Super robot punch!

86
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,324
-Not you, too.

87
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:21,559
-Uh, well, I--

88
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:23,127
I guess not.

89
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:25,129
Put down those stupid toys.

90
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:26,530
-Huh?

91
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,199
Aww.

92
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:30,201
These guys are worse
than my parents.

93
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:33,737
-I wonder what happened
to Zoe and JP.

94
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:36,674
-I think our only choice is to
head for the Forest Terminal.

95
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:37,875
-Yeah.

96
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,376
I bet we can meet up
with them there.

97
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,377
You think?

98
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:41,212
Huh?

99
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:42,046
-Huh?

100
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,715
-Guys, check it out.

-[snorting]

102
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,451
-Hey, look.

103
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:50,688
We decided this isn't the time
to play around, right?

104
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:51,789
-You decided?

105
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:53,390
-Calm down.

106
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,427
Don't start crying!

107
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,628
-Hmph!

108
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:58,295
-Aw, man.

109
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,430
I feel bad.

110
00:03:59,463 --> 00:04:00,130
-Why?

111
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:01,298
Because of him?

112
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:04,301
Little baby has to
grow up sometime.

113
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:06,737
-Don't be so mean.

114
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,440
I mean, he's only a little
kid, for Pete's sake.

115
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:11,108
-Whatever.

116
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,643
-No, you can't just
say whatever!

117
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,245
Now, listen up!

118
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:16,113
I know you're not used to having
friends, but you're

119
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:18,949
part of a team now, so you'd
better show some support.

120
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,751
-Great idea.

121
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:22,286
Let's support the useless kid
right up until the point where

122
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:24,755
we all die because
of his stupidity.

123
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,524
-No wonder no one likes you.

124
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,659
-What do you know?

125
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:33,430
-Aww.

126
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:36,667
Come on, guys, if you keep
fighting, we'll never get to

-Yeah, some train.

Yeah, very funny.

Just drop it, OK?

on this stupid thing.

-Wow, that's wild, Takuya!

139
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,661
It's a giant walking
teddy bear!

get to Forest Terminal.

-Hey!

-I am still undefeated!

Woohoo.

148
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:28,419
Now we wrestle for the
championship of the world.

-Yeah!

I'm next!

-Are you crazy?

152
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:32,756
It'll crush us!

153
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:33,200
-Yay!

154
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:39,066

The championship!

Oh, I get it.

good at this!

-That bear's dangerous.

160

-And you didn't even get
thrown down by him.

-Well, I don't know.

162
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:57,785
He seemed kind of fun to me.

us on this crazy thing?

the bear instead?

get us off of here!

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,938
-Hey, we're floating.

169
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:18,972
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN):
Not anymore!

170
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:23,944
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
We're done!

171
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,818
I thought we were!

172
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:32,452
Whoa!

173
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:36,390
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Is anyone
else feeling kind of sick?

174
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:39,993
-Oh, get us off of here,
before he loses it!

175
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,462
-Sure, I'll just snap
my fingers!

176
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:43,797
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Uh-oh.

177
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:45,966
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): Don't look
in my direction, kid.

178
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,034
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Don't
point it at me!

179
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:52,506
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): I think
he's gonna be OK.

180
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:53,740
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): [vomiting]

181
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:56,543
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): Oh, get
him off, get him off!

182
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:57,845
-You gonna be OK, kid?

183
00:06:57,878 --> 00:07:00,848
-Uh-huh.

184
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,216
-Come on, you want
a piggyback ride?

185
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:03,083
-Gimme a break.

186
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,718
Make the kid walk.

187
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:05,919
-Look, it's no big deal.

188
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:08,222
He's not feeling well, so
I'll help him out, OK?

189
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,389
-Oh yeah?

190
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,524
And what'll happen if you're
attacked while

191
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:11,391
you're carrying him?

192
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:12,559
You'll be too slow
to run away.

193
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:14,561
That's for sure.

194
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:16,697
You're about the worst leader
I've ever seen.

195
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,599
You never think ahead.

196
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:20,934
-Well, at least I think about
someone besides myself, Mr.

197
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:24,438
Definition Of The
Word Selfish!

198
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,139
-I can walk.

199
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:28,108
-Hey, Tommy, you sure?

200
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:29,109
-Yeah.

201
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:30,811
I mean, I really don't
have a choice.

202
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:32,145
-I got an idea.

203
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:33,614
Let's see if anyone lives
in that house.

204
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,315
Maybe they can help us.

205
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:38,118
-[laughing]

206
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:39,953
Human children on our island.

207
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,923
This couldn't be more perfect.

208
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:45,626
We shall capture all three
of them and use them as

209
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:48,829
bargaining chips when we
get to the real world.

210
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:49,663
Monzaemon!

211
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:51,665
Get them now!

212
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:52,499
-Me?

213
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:54,001
Can't we just play?

214
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,536
-[growls]

215
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,473
-[whimpers]

216
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:02,009
-Now I know what it's like to
be kid in a candy store.

217
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,011
-And it's the best thing ever.

218
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:12,386
-I guess we can take a little
time to have a snack, right?

219
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:14,488
-Here, have some.

220
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:15,756
Here!

221
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:21,828
-We do not have time to sit
around here stuffing our faces

222
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,397
with candy.

223
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:25,732
We have to find a way to get
to the Forest Terminal.

224
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,235
We're not out having fun at
a carnival or something.

225
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:29,836
You understand?

226
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:31,705
Are you listening to me?

227
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:33,941
Man, you're infuriating!

228
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:35,208
-What are we supposed to do?

229
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:37,077
We're floating on an island.

230
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,079
-There's another example
of why you'll

231
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,080
never be a good leader.

232
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:41,581
You just give up!

233
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:44,418
It's like you don't even want
to help your friends at all.

234
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:46,753
I mean, take a look at what
you're doing right now.

235
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:49,089
-Whoa.

236
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:51,592
-I don't see you coming
up with any ideas.

237
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:52,993
-At least I'm not just eating.

238
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:55,462
We need to think about the
other Legendary Warriors.

239
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:56,129
-Legendary wa--

240
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,231
what are you talking about?

241
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:00,634
-What if the other four Warriors
turn out to be on the

242
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,468
enemy's side?

243
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:02,636
-But--

244
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:04,605
-If they are, we'll
need a plan.

245
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:06,974
We have to think about the worst
case scenario, not just

246
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:08,609
play games and eat sweets!

247
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:11,011
Or we might not make it out
of this world alive.

248
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:13,513
-Look, can we not talk
about this now?

249
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,948
-You mean, not in
front of Tommy?

250
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:16,283
I don't care if he's young.

251
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:18,785
He has to learn to
face the truth.

252
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:21,054
-I'm sorry you hate
me so much.

253
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:22,122
-I don't hate you.

254
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:25,158
It's just--

255
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:26,460
-I'm sorry.

256
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:33,400
-I wonder how Takuya and
the others are doing.

257
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,568
-I dunno.

258
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:36,536
-Gee, thanks.

259
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,505
-I'm sure the three of them are
bumbling along, getting

260
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:40,040
into all kinds of trouble.

261
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:41,708
Or causing it, I suppose.

262
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:44,411
And that they'll show up just
fine at the Forest Terminal.

263
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:47,047
-I hope you're right, Bokomon.

264
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:47,881
Huh?

265
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:50,717
JP, what are you up to?

266
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:52,419
-Wouldn't it be great if we
could catch a big old fish for

267
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:53,854
dinner?

268
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,222
-Gracious, do you ever
think with your head

269
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:56,723
instead of your stomach?

270
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:57,524
-Boys.

271
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:58,625
-But-- but I was--

272
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:59,726
-I don't want to hear it!

273
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,532
-[laughs]

274
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,634
-Does anyone want to talk?

275
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:09,102
-Fine.

276
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:10,570
Let's talk about getting to
Forest Terminal and what we're

277
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:12,639
going to do about the other
Legendary Warriors.

278
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:13,473
-Ugh.

279
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:14,574
You're unbelievable!

280
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,109
I told you I didn't
want to talk about

281
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:17,911
it in front of Tommy.

282
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:19,446
-And I told you that you can't
treat him differently than the

283
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,781
rest of us.

284
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,949
-Yeah, but you can respect
that he's just a kid.

285
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:24,451
-So are you!

286
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:25,118
-All right--

287
00:10:25,152 --> 00:10:26,119
-Oh, yeah?

288
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:27,187
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Um, guys?

289
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,855
Help!

290
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,091
-It's that bear again!

291
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:32,125
-No, it's different now!

292
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,760
It looks all funky!

293
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:35,429
D-TECTOR NARRATING: The
ShadowToyAgumon turned

294
00:10:35,495 --> 00:10:37,831
Monzaemon into WaruMonzaemon.

295
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:40,033
His Heartbreak Attack will
really bring you down.

296
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:46,506
-Hey, you big fuzzy creep!

297
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:49,376
Give our friend back!

298
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:50,510
-Heartbreak Attack!

299
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:56,683
-What's the point?

300
00:10:56,717 --> 00:10:58,885
We're never going
to catch him.

301
00:10:58,952 --> 00:10:59,553
-Huh?

302
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,354
-[crying]

303
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:02,155
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): Why
are you crying?

304
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:04,491
What happened?

305
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:07,527
-I just feel really sad!

306
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:08,595
-Heartbreak Attack!

307
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:15,402
-What just hit me, Takuya?

308
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:17,737
I'm so sad!

309
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:20,741
I feel like everything is
so hopeless, you know?

310
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:23,243
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
It is hopeless!

311
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:24,578
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

312
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:27,447
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): No, I'm
sorry I yelled at you.

313
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:30,083
-Huh?

314
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,085
That attack is so not fair.

315
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,920
And now Tommy is gone.

316
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,255
What do we do?

317
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:46,149
-Why do evil things always run
faster than normal things?

318
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:47,784
-I don't see it anywhere.

319
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:49,953
-This is our fault, because
we were fighting.

320
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:53,289
This really reminds me of the
time I lost my little brother

321
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:54,791
at the amusement park.

322
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,327
I've never been so worried
in my life until now.

323
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,461
-I know.

324
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:00,964
Little kids are always
getting in the way.

325
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:02,332
-That's not what I meant!

326
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:03,967
Man, you must be the
most selfish kid

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,335
in the whole world!

328
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:06,703
Two worlds!

329
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:08,972
We have a responsibility to take
care of Tommy, because

330
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:10,473
he's younger than us!

331
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:14,043
Ugh, don't you take care of your
own brothers and sisters?

332
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:16,513
-I don't have any.

333
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:18,681
Happy now?

334
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:20,016
-Oh.

335
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:23,353
-See, I don't know anything
about having brothers.

336
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:26,055
-Well, why don't you just
imagine that Tommy is your

337
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,690
little brother?

338
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,193
And think what it would like for
a little kid to be alone

339
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:31,861
and afraid.

340
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:34,898
Imagine that you could keep
him from feeling that way.

341
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,399
-Hmph.

342
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:39,702
-Hey, wait up!

343
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,004
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): [crying]

344
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:42,872
This world just keeps getting
better and better.

345
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:44,107
What's next?

346
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,176
I'm just gonna blow up?

347
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:50,613
Although I don't know what's
worse, blowing up or having to

348
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,949
tell everyone you were beaten
by a teddybear!

349
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:58,221
[sobbing]

350
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,756
Huh?

351
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:01,791
We've got a problem.

352
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,593
-Hmm.

353
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:06,963
-See, whenever I get nervous,
I have to--

354
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,599
you know.

355
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:11,134
-Huh?

356
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,069
-There's a friendly face.

357
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:15,271
Hey, flying robot, we're
looking for a little

358
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:16,339
kid and a big bear.

359
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:17,674
Have you seen him?

360
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:23,246
-In that creepy castle?

361
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:24,013
-How can it be creepy?

362
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,648
It's lavender.

363
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:26,916
-Never underestimate
your enemy.

364
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,156
-It's just so lavender.

365
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,490
Hey, Tommy!

366
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,159
-Down here!

367
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,193
He can't hear us.

368
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:39,996
We'll have to go in.

369
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:41,197
-Thanks!

370
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:43,333
-You just can't stop playing
with toys, can you?

371
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:47,070
-Nothing's gonna stop us now!

372
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:48,171
Except that.

373
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:53,977
-Whoa!

374
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:05,722
-Once again, I, Pandamon, have
foiled my fiendish foes, the

375
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,924
sinister ShadowToyAgumon.

376
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:08,591
-Yeah, great.

377
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,059
Thanks.

378
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,361
So you saved us just so you
could bring us down here and

379
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:12,562
hurt us yourself.

380
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:15,865
-Buddy, why are you
so paranoid?

381
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,533
Don't pay any attention
to him.

382
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,701
Thanks for helping us.

383
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:20,069
Pandamon?

384
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:22,905
-Pandamon the Protector.

385
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:27,310
Welcome, weary warriors, to my
secret lair, the Panda Cave.

386
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:28,878
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): OK.

387
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:30,280
PANDAMON (OFFSCREEN): I've
hidden here since that

388
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,382
blackhearted ShadowToyAgumon
started heeding that chump

389
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:34,384
Cherubimon.

390
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,286
-Cherubimon.

391
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:39,255
-Because of Cherubimon's
diabolical dogma, those

392
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:42,492
misguided miscreants plan to go
to the real world and wreak

393
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:45,161
their revenge on the children
who stopped playing with them.

394
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:49,332
The rest of us toys just
want to play with kids.

395
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,467
-That's so sad.

396
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:54,470
-Most of the wicked
ShadowToyAgumon are busy with

397
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:58,308
their baneful business of
keeping the city afloat.

398
00:14:58,374 --> 00:14:59,208
-Faster!

399
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:01,444
Our destiny is at hand!

400
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:03,279
-Our destiny is a hand?

401
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:05,214
-Oh, just go away.

402
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:08,451
-With any luck, you two high
powered humans won't wander

403
00:15:08,518 --> 00:15:11,187
into the callous creatures on
your way through the castle.

404
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,355
-Yeah?

405
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:13,489
And just when are we supposed
to get to this

406
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:15,491
castle again, Pandamon?

407
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:17,026
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Kouji!

408
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,829
-The staircase will steer both
of you straight inside.

409
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:21,364
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Thanks, Pandamon.

410
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:22,198
-Don't thank me.

411
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:24,000
Just stop the ShadowToyAgumon.

412
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,106
-Lavender castle,
here we come.

413
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,507
Huh?

414
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,343
D-TECTOR NARRATING: Evil hackers
turned the ToyAgumon

415
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:35,578
into ShadowToyAgumon.

416
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:38,247
Their special attack is Plastic
Blaze, but the pain it

417
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:41,918
causes sure isn't
fun and games.

418
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:43,953
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Are they
just gonna stand here?

419
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,054
-Plastic Blaze!

420
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:49,258
-I guess not.

421
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:01,504
-Execute!

422
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:02,572
Spirit Evolution!

423
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:22,692
Agunimon!

424
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,403
-Execute!

425
00:16:33,436 --> 00:16:34,670
Spirit Evolution!

426
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,391
Lobomon!

427
00:16:58,594 --> 00:17:01,531
-No one's getting revenge
on any kids!

428
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:02,565
Pyro Tornado!

429
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:08,204
Well, that was easy.

430
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,238
Maybe not!

431
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:15,645
Cute.

432
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:16,779
But what can a toy tank do?

433
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,451
Whoa!

434
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:26,956
-I got it!

435
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,661
Lobo Kendo!

436
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:36,132
-Showoff.

437
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:37,600
I could've done that.

438
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:38,601
-Yeah, but you didn't.

439
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:41,471
-I'd have done a better job.

440
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:45,641
Sure you don't need a little
help there, buddy?

441
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,178
Why don't you take me on?

442
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:51,781
Oh, man, you sure look a
lot bigger close up!

443
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:58,521
So how can we beat them?

444
00:17:58,521 --> 00:17:59,856
-Follow my lead!

445
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,371
-Hey!

446
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:16,372
It worked!

447
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:22,278
I hate when toys go bad.

448
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:31,621
Fractal Code Digitize!

449
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:42,098
-Time to be purified
by the light!

450
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:51,774
Fractal Code Digitize!

451
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:03,152
KOUJI (OFFSCREEN): Hurry!

452
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,654
We have to get Tommy before
it's too late!

453
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,990
Who knows what awful things
that bear is doing to him?

454
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,159
Hang on, Tommy!

455
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:10,826
MONZAEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Take that!

456
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:11,694
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): No!

457
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:12,662
MONZAEMON (OFFSCREEN):
And that!

458
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:13,663
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN):
Quit kicking me!

459
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:14,567
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
They're fighting!

460
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,669
[laughing]

461
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:21,304
-I win!

462
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:24,006
Champion of the world!

463
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,308
-Tommy, what are you doing?

464
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:27,677
-What's it look like
I'm doing?

465
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:29,545
-But we thought you
were in trouble.

466
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:31,380
-Mm-hmm.

467
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:32,381
-I know.

468
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,650
I feel just awful about
that, guys.

469
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:36,819
But this little trooper saw
through to the real me and

470
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:38,721
played with me anyway.

471
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:40,723
He's a good boy.

472
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:42,130
-So can we keep him?

473
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,702
-[groans]

474
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:49,898
-Why can't we keep him?

475
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:51,233
-Ah, fantastic friends.

476
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,205
To make up for their monstrous
mistakes, the ToyAgumon insist

477
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,074
they take you off the island.

478
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,742
-[laughs]
-Yeah!

479
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:04,779
-Whoa!

480
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:07,716
-Hey Tommy, how come
you weren't scared?

481
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:10,452
-Well, I'm really not
afraid of airplanes.

482
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:11,820
-I meant when you
were captured by

483
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:13,788
that evil teddy bear.

484
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:16,625
-Well, to be honest, at first I
was so scared of him that I

485
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:18,793
almost wet my pants.

486
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:21,463
But then I figured out that
the big guy only wanted to

487
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:22,998
play video games with me.

488
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:25,000
-Probably only a kid could
figure that out.

489
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:26,468
-You're right.

490
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:28,870
And you thought kids weren't
good for anything.

491
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:32,207
-Guys, if you look down,
you can see the forest.

492
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,475
