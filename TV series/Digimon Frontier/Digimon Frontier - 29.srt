1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,836
NARRATOR: It's bad enough when
Mercurymon corners you in a

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,705
world of mirrors and
beats you up.

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,206
Just ask a Agunimon.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,209
But then he uses Seraphimon's
data to turn into this big old

5
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,844
baddie, Shadow Seraphimon.

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,047
It looked like curtains for
Takuya for sure, but energy

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,351
from Seraphimon's Digi-Egg let
Takuya fusion evolve to

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,853
Aldamon who kicked the Fractal
Code out of Shadow Seraphimon

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,555
and Mercurymon.

10
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,057
Takuya returned to the others
and the Digi-egg hatched, but

11
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,326
inside was only Patamon.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,362
And what good is that little
guy going to be against all

13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,831
the forces of darkness?

14
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,865
THEME SONG: Digimon!

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,242
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

16
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,778
Digital World.

17
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:49,249
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

18
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:56,590
by the lessons we've learned,
as we work towards one

19
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:02,329
solution, through a
spirit evolution.

20
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,263
I am the one.

21
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:03,997
Huh!

22
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,933
I am the one.

23
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:06,967
Digimon!

24
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,236
Forever united as one.

25
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,470
Digimon!

26
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,240
Together the battles are won.

27
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,474
Digimon!

28
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,110
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

29
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:21,448
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:25,352
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

31
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,153
I am the one.

32
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:26,820
Huh!

33
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,789
I am the one.

34
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,023
Digimon!

35
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,330
-There goes Sakkakamon.

36
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,898
-That's a relief.

37
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,132
-He's just backing off.

38
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,204
Well, at least we got an answer
to what was inside

39
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,372
Seraphimon's egg.

40
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,807
-You're sure a cute
little fella.

41
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,208
-And he flies!

42
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,743
-My Papa-mom!

43
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,744
[laughing]

44
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,012
-Oh, isn't that adorable?

45
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,349
My baby thinks of me as both
his papa and momma.

46
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,917
-I'm hungry, papa-mom.

47
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,051
-Oh.

48
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,752
Hmmm.

49
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,353
Well--

50
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,253
-Don't look at me.

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,855
I don't even have pockets.

52
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,892
-We don't even have
a crust of bread.

53
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,528
-That's OK, I can wait.

54
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:09,463
-Oh!

55
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,397
-That's different.

56
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,898
He's so calm.

57
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,899
-What a good boy.

58
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,935
-He sure doesn't have
Bokomon's genes.

59
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,136
-Mmm-hmmm!

60
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,939
-And just what's wrong
with my genes?

61
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,207
-Koji, come in!

62
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,142
Koji!

63
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,577
It's no use.

64
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,245
Wherever he is, I can't
get through to him.

65
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,980
-That doesn't sound good.

66
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,650
-We'd better search for him.

67
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,818
-Hold that thought!

68
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,919
-Ahhh!

69
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,294
-It wasn't a vision.

70
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,296
It had to be real.

71
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,632
How could that boy look
just like me?

72
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,633
-What!

73
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,503
-Duskmon, why are you
running away?

74
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,504
Where are you going?

75
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,541
-What?

76
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,045
-Check it out!

77
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,846
He's twitching like he's
about to strike!

78
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,381
-Why is he doing that?

79
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,518
-I'm not sure I really
want to know.

80
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,019
Hurry, Patamon, get in!

81
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,356
-But papa-mom, I don't think
I can fit in there anymore.

82
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,057
You're too big.

83
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,092
-Oh.

84
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,326
-Ahhh!

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,661
-Ha he ha!

86
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,598
Behold, the legendary
warriors.

87
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:22,436
I must congratulate thee. 'Tis
true, thine efforts have given

88
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,338
me more power than even
I coulds't dream of!

89
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:25,939
-What?

90
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,376
-Ha ha ha!

91
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,711
Thunder Fist!

92
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,413
-Hey, what's the deal?

93
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,415
He's stealing my thunder!

94
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,217
-Yeah, that's Beetlemon's
attack!

95
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,252
-And now one for the ladies.

96
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,221
Hurricane Wave!

97
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,789
-Ahhhh!

98
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,791
-That's just not right.

99
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:45,892
-No kidding.

100
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,994
-Let's show him how
it's really done!

101
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,807
-Activate now!

102
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,175
Fusion evolution!

103
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:15,288
[yelling]

104
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:21,161
[yelling]

105
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,829
-Aldamon!

106
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,164
-Patamon?

107
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,399
Please tell me the rest of us
have the power to fusion

108
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,734
evolve too.

109
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,870
-Regretably, Seraphimon's power
has been all used up.

110
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,307
-I should have brought
batteries.

111
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,542
-I'm sorry.

112
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,843
-Don't worry about it.

113
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,178
-Yeah.

114
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,013
The three of us still have power
enough to take of this.

115
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,047
-Oh.

116
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,891
-Execute!

117
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,225
Spirit evolution!

118
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,310
-Ahhhh hey!

119
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,444
Beetlemon!

120
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,593
-Haaa!

121
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,928
Kazemon!

122
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,009
-Ahh oop!

123
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,010
Ha ha!

124
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,011
Kumamon!

125
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,179
-Hm hm hm!

126
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,214
My turn!

127
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:51,184
[laughing]

128
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,139
-Uh oh.

129
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:59,876
-Blizzard Blaster!

130
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,312
-He's got your attack down, too?

131
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:04,114
-How is he doing this?

132
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:05,549
-Simple.

133
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,252
I lured each of thee into thine
own areas to observe thee in battle.

134
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:21,231
-Oh, how valiantly thou dids't
fight against my minions.

135
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:24,701
Meanwhile, I meticulously
recorded all of the attacks

136
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,171
thou could muster!

137
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:32,008
Alas, not one of thee suspected
the method to my

138
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:35,445
madness, my deeper purpose.

139
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,515
I must admit, your efforts
surpassed even my

140
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,050
expectations.

141
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:43,286
The stronger the foe, the
greater the response, all in

142
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,754
the name of glory.

143
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,090
My glory!

144
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,960
-And now, all of thy power
can be mirrored by me.

145
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,596
-You planned this from
the beginning.

146
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:54,598
So that's why we had to put up
with the stench of fighting

147
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:55,599
inside of you.

148
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,100
You were using us!

149
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,436
-He made us fight so he could
copy our attacks.

150
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:00,637
-Oh, man!

151
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:02,472
You mean we had to go through
all that for him?

152
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:03,240
That stinks!

153
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:04,608
-You said it.

154
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:07,077
-I relish the thought that thine
efforts shall be the

155
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,746
cause of thine own undoing.

156
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,249
Oh, what fools these
mortals be!

157
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:15,485
Gave me thy spirits, and the
Digital World shall bow before

158
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,987
me!

159
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,488
-Hate to soak your blanket,
big mouth, but we're the

160
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,690
originals, and no crooked copy
cat's going to tell us when to

161
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:21,992
call it a day!

162
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:22,993
Yah!

163
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,328
Thunder Fist!

164
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,963
Yah!

165
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,531
-What happened?

166
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:30,000
-Thunder Fist Reflection!

167
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,672
-What can we do?

168
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,674
When we attack, he returns our

-Everybody calm down!

343
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,051
Just calm down!

344
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,919
-Whatever you're going
to do, just do it!

345
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,921
But turn on the lights,
will ya?

346
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:56,257
-Make it stop!

SAKKAKUMON (OFFSCREEN): Ring
around the rosie, a

351
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,268
pocketful of fears.

352
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:08,936
Oh, what's the matter?

353
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:10,138
Scared of the dark?

354
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:11,339
-Huh?

355
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:13,307
-Beetlemon, stop!

356
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,977
-Just because you can fusion
evolve doesn't make you the

357
00:15:15,977 --> 00:15:18,012
boss here, got it?

358
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:20,014
-He's right, you need
to chill out.

359
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:20,648
-Huh?

360
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:21,949
-Splendid.

361
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:25,119
I There's nothing like discord
to depose a leader.

362
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:27,655
-We've never acted this way
towards each other before.

363
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:29,157
Why now?

364
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:31,993
-There is a black, bottomless
pit of doubt and fear in all

365
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:32,660
of your hearts.

366
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,861
-I not the coward here!

367
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:36,164
-You're the one who wanted
to run away.

368
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:38,466
-Well, you're the one who was
trying to freeze us all!

369
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:39,834
-Calm down, you guys!

370
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,002
-Self-doubt.

371
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,236
Jealousy.

372
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,372
Betrayal.

373
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:47,875
Now you will drown in the fear
of your own darkness!

374
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:49,877
-No!

375

00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,541

ain't gonna cut it here.

There's still only one of him.

00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,922
-Yeah, but that hasn't stopped
him from beating

393
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,390
us so far, has it?

394
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:33,925
-Close your eyes.

00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:34,892
-What?

396
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,527
-I said close your eyes!

397
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:42,066
-We are not humans now.

398
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,134
We're Digimon.

399
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,902
Our senses are sharper
than when we were

400
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:46,704
in our human forms.

401
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:49,240
You have to trust the Digimon
inside of you.

402
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:50,441
-You're right.

403
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:53,144
I can feel the strength,
the power.

404
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:54,112
-That sound.

405
00:16:54,112 --> 00:16:54,979
Can you hear it?

406
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,547
He's breathing.

407
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,250
I can hear Sakkakumon's
breathing.

-I hear it.

409
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:06,124
The four of us are not alone.

410
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:09,327
Our power lies in the faith that
we have in one another.

411
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:12,830
Even if you can't fusion evolve,
we can still use all

of our attacks together!

413

-We can use our attacks.

414
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:17,468
-All together.

415
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,937
-To win.

416
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:21,539
-Right.

417
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:23,274
Whenever you're finished, I
believe you have a little

418
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:24,842
something to give me.

00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,210

I don't have that attack
in my records!

-Of course you don't.

That attack's never been
used before, buddy!

-It can't be!

-Ahhhh!

439
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:12,457
-You stopped our attacks
individually, but now that

440
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,760
we're mixing our attacks,
you can't beat us!

441
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:18,262
You'll never steal
our spirits now.

442
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:20,231
Our attacks have changes,
so you can't copy them.

443

Your through, Sakkakumon!

-Don't think so!

446
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,105
The tables have turned here, and
now you're the one who's

447
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,606
afraid and left in the dark.

448
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:31,242
Try to guess what
we'll do next!

449

-I'll still win!

450

I can't lose to the
likes of you.

451
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,652
I am superior.

452

You little whelps
can't defeat me.

453

You will never survive
my power!

always say.

-We're not going to run.

-And we're not afraid!

459

-And together, we'll destroy
you once and for all!

He's never attacked
us from there!

It's always been covered up.

465
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:16,387
That must be where he
controls all the

466

data he's been storing.

467
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:21,225
If we could get him to stop
moving, even for just a

468
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:24,228
second, it might give me
a clear shot at it.

-I have an idea.

still for a while?

-Finally.

487

fears and beat

dissolve the seal.

the darkness wasn't

scary.

-I know what you mean.

-Well, that's what real
friends are for.

-Speaking of friends, we've
got to find Koji.
