1
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:02,666
BOKOMON (VOICEOVER): With only
four areas of the digital

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,202
world left unscanned, it was up
to poor little Gotsumon to

3
00:00:05,236 --> 00:00:06,837
save his home.

4
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:08,639
But even Takuya and the gang
couldn't stop those rotten

5
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:10,875
royals from stealing the data.

6
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:12,977
Seraphimon's castle was next
on the list, so Gotsumon

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,813
joined the team and they all
set off to protect it.

8
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:18,349
Koji and Gotsumon took on the
Knightmon while the rest ran

9
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:20,317
off to find the key to
the castle's data.

10
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:23,220
When Gotsumon evolved to
Meteormon, it looked like the

11
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:25,423
tide had turned, but Dynasmon's
bad breath of

12
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:27,758
wyvern turned the place
to digital dust.

13
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:28,759
Oh, dear.

14
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:30,694
Now there are only
two areas left.

15
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,329
THEME SONG: Digimon.

16
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:42,206
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,775
digital world.

18
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:49,113
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:51,415
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:58,055
As we work towards one solution

21
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,992
through a spirit evolution.

22
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:04,528
I am the one.

23
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:05,329
I am the one.

24
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:06,931
Digimon.

25
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:09,266
Forever united as one.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,568
Digimon.

27
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:13,270
Together the battles are won.

28
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,505
Digimon.

29
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:17,108
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

30
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:21,445
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

31
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,749
If we're all for one world
there's a world for us all.

32
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:27,418
I am the one.

33
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:28,452
I am the one.

34
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,087
Digimon.

35
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:39,396
NARRATOR (VOICEOVER): The
digital world is in ruins.

36
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,300
There's not much left but small
pockets of ravaged land

37
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:46,470
and the occasional
Trailmon track--

38
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,107
all of this destruction caused
by the Royal Knights.

39
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:53,110
[evil laughter]

40
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:55,179
-It's beautiful.

41
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:57,848
-The revival of Lord
Lucemon draws near.

42
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,017
[evil laughter]

43
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:03,087
-My spirit boomerang
lets me see things.

44
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:07,658
And in this case I see
the Royal Knights.

45
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:09,760
This is bad news, my friends.

46
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,228
They are headed this way.

47
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:12,429
-Oh.

48
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:13,898
-Just as we thought.

49
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:14,565
-Yeah.

50
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:15,966
-What do you mean?

51
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:17,635
-See that machine?

52
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:19,904
That's our way of seeing things
from far away, except

53
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,639
it looks busted.

54
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,508
-I look into this box and
see nothing, and yet

55
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,344
I can't stop staring.

56
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:28,479
-Hey.

57
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:35,819
Come one you recycled hunk
of-- ah, there we go.

58
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,355
-It's like we're looking
down from the moon.

59
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,324
-There are only two parts of
the digital world left

60
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:41,959
unscanned--

61
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:45,162
Ophanimon's castle, that's this
green area, and the snowy

62
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:47,865
area here, the Autumn Leaf
Fair, where we are now.

63
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,367
So we had a choice to make.

64
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,869
-OK, so?

65
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:54,572
-So nobody's ever been able to
figure out where the fractal

66
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:57,675
code for the area surrounding
Ophanimon's castle is hidden.

67
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,077
Am I right?

68
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,646
-Right as rain, my
bandana-headed friend.

69
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:05,015
-And that means the Royal
Knights will be heading here

70
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:06,684
first, just like we figured.

71
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,452
And we'll be here.

72
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:12,456
-So that's what you meant by,
just as we thought, huh?

73
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,325
Oh, my friends are so smart.

74
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:17,394
I shall do the dance of smarty
pants, smarty pants, smarty

75
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:17,995
pants.

76
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:19,163
-Uh, dude?

77
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:22,233
We really do appreciate
that a lot, but, uh,

78
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,701
you can stop now.

79
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,069
[nervous laughter]

80
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:35,679
-All full.

81
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:37,381
Move them out, please.

82
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:38,549
-Yeah, baby.

83
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,384
Whoa, we're moving now.

84
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:41,252
Oh, yeah.

85
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:42,052
-Wait!

86
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:43,053
Hey, wait for us!

87
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:43,887
Don't leave.

88
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:45,389
You gotta take us with you.

89
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,291
[whistle blowing]

90
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:48,225
-Wait!

91
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:49,360
-Hold on.

92
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:51,195
And just Where do you
think you're going?

93
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:53,864
-Please save us.

94
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,766
-Hey, don't worry about it.

95
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,801
We're gonna make sure we take
every one of you to a nice

96
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:58,769
safe place.

97
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:00,638
-Do you really mean it?

98
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:01,972
-Of course she does.

99
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,075
Now get in line like
everyone else.

100
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,076
-This is fun.

101
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,711
We should have a sing along.

102
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:09,713
Who knows "Wheels
on the Train?"

103
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:11,715
(SINGING) The wheels on the
train go round and round.

104
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,518
-Neemon, you are really
not helping.

105
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:16,253
-Looking good there, J.P.

106
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,023
NEEMON (SINGING): Round and
round all through the town.

107
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:20,024
Woo, woo!

108
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:20,557
-Neemon!

109
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:22,226
I am going insane.

110
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:25,296
J.P. (VOICEOVER): This is by far
my biggest, coolest magic

111
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:28,966
trick ever-- nothing up my
sleeve, and presto, a whole

112
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,367
new neighborhood layout.

113
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:37,308
-There's more than one way to
protect this fair's data, and

114
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:39,109
this is it.

115
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:40,244
Almost got it.

116
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:41,645
Breaking up this town
will break up it's

117
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,314
fractal code as well.

118
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:45,983
Then the Royal Knights won't
be able to scan it, and the

119
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,451
town will be safe.

120
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:48,485
Do I rock or what?

121
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,124
-Heads up.

122
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:03,300
-Datamon, Does this
thingy go in here?

123
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:04,201
-You got it.

124
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:05,536
-OK.

125
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:10,774
-We got it.

126
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,142
-So what are you guys
working on?

127
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,644
-A snow catapult.

128
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:16,113
-When those Royal Knights show
up here, we're gonna greet the

129
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:18,082
two of them with a face
full of snowballs.

130
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:18,816
Pow!

131
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:20,951
They won't know what hit them.

132
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:21,785
[laughing]

133
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,153
-You mean a snowball fight?

134
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,755
-Yeah.

135
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:26,290
Well, I know it won't defeat
the Royal Knights all by

136
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,592
itself, but it might help,
and it's better than

137
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,127
doing nothing at all.

138
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,128
-Hm.

139
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,296
You're right.

140
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:34,739
EmperorGreymon and
MagnaGarurumon are pretty strong,

141
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:37,334
but they're going to
need every bit of help
we can give them.

142
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:38,502
-Mm hm.

143
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:41,672
[yelling and crashing noise]

144
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:43,674
-Oh, are you OK?

145
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:44,541
-Yeah.

146
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,177
-Here, let me help.

147
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:49,513
-Thank you.

148
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,682
-You're welcome.

149
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:53,317
-Gee, Tommy.

150
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,052
Who would have imagined that
after we stole everybody's

151
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,688
detectors and caused you all
that trouble, we'd actually

152
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,156
end up working together?

153
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:01,425
-It's always best to
forgive and forget.

154
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,426
-Well, we won't forget.

155
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,528
None of us will ever
forget you.

156
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:06,463
You could have just gone home,
but instead you came

157
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:08,032
back to help us.

158
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:10,367
I know we might have gotten off
on the wrong foot, but I

159
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:13,370
sure am glad we got to be
friends in the end.

160
00:06:13,404 --> 00:06:15,038
And you know what?

161
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:17,307
We've been keeping
an eye on you.

162
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,843
And every time we hear about
your victories and progress,

163
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:21,512
it gives us the strength
to keep going.

164
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:26,043
So I guess now we're

-Not yet.

343
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:15,438
I can't get a clear shot because
she won't stop moving.

Oh, man.

351
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,321
He's in trouble all right.

352

Not again.

I remember the first
time this happened.

381
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:56,238
Dynasmon and Crusadermon
unleashed their attacks.

382
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:58,174
And Baromon tried
to protect us.

But instead--

Oh, dear.

They got the fractal code

KOICHI (VOICEOVER): Yeah.

388
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,121
Everyone's data was visible
except mine.

389
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:15,324
I was OK, I mean, relatively
speaking.

390
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,227
Magnagarurumon, EmperorGreymon,
and I were the

391

only ones left conscious to
face the Royal Knights.

392
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:24,300
And then when we wound up on
the moon, everyone was out

393
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:25,835
cold except me.

394
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,069
I don't get it.

395
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:28,404
It just doesn't make
any sense.

397
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,210
-Why?

398
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,711
Why does everyone keep getting
hurt except for me?

399
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,713
-You mean you don't know?

-Huh?

401
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:42,051
-Haven't you realized you're
different from the others?

402
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:43,052
-No.

403
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,620
What do you mean different?

00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,722
-In this world, data comes
only from those with a

406

You, Koichi, have no
physical form.

407
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,761
Terribly sorry.
