00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:02,918
BOKOMON NARRATING: Once again,
Lucemon unleashed another of

2
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:05,921
his palookas to pill for more
piles of Digiworld data, but

3
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:08,424
this time he set his sights on
the village of flame, hometown

4
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:10,893
to myself and Neemon, not
too much of a whole

5
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:12,261
bunch of other Digimon.

6
00:00:12,294 --> 00:00:15,764
As the battle began, the baddy
brought in an identical

7
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:18,100
brother, and soon our heroes
were face to face with a trio

8
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:19,468
of terrible-ness.

9
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:22,137
Koji and Takuya summoned the
power of the 10 legendary

10
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:24,106
warriors and blew away
the bony brutes.

11
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:27,743
Unfortunately, the celebration
was cut short when Crusadermon

12
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:30,946
checked in and took out what
was left of the town.

13
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:32,281
THEME SONG: Digimon!

14
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:37,186
[theme music]

15
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,589
THEME SONG: We look to the past
as we head for the future

16
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:44,626
to reclaim the Digital World.

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,964
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

18
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:53,969
by the lessons we've learned.

19
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:57,973
As we work towards one solution

20
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,341
through a Spirit Evolution.

21
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:03,846
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

22
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,247
Huh!
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,448
Digimon!

24
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:08,851
Forever united as one.

25
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,486
Digimon!

26
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,255
Together the battles are won.

27
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,490
Digimon!

28
00:01:14,523 --> 00:01:17,159
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,030
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:21,063 --> 00:01:25,834
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

31
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,469
Ha-ya-moo-ah!
Huh!

32
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:28,170
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

33
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:29,505
Digimon!

34
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,576
CRUSADERMON (OFFSCREEN):
What a beautiful sight.

35
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,345
DYNASMON (OFFSCREEN): Especially
when scared.

36
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:38,647
[laughter]

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,650
-Lord Lucemon should be most
pleased with our progress.

38
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:43,919
His rebirth is close at hand.

39
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:46,588
-Then we'll finally be done with
those revolting children.

40
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:48,390
I can't wait to claim
their data.

41
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:49,692
-Soon.

42
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:51,727
They cannot stand against
our might.

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,695
Nothing can.

44
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,231
-Look at that wonderful
nothing.

45
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:59,068
-Another gift for our
lord and master.

46
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,335
Transmission!

47
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,474
-Only four areas remain.

48
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:07,509
Come, let's finish this.

49
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:08,577
-With pleasure.

50
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,081
-Is that all you got?

51
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:21,824
I'm not letting you
go any further.

52
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,693
You might as turn around now,
'cause you'll never get your

53
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:26,061
hands on the sacred jewels!

54
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:32,434
You hear?

55
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,769
FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
Knightmon are always ready,

56
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:35,437
willing, and able to fight.

57
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:38,040
They won't hesitate to use their
Electric Slash attack.

58
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:47,883
-Electric Slash!

59
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,318
BEETLEMON (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
that doesn't look fair.

60
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,652
Lightning Blitz!

61
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:54,890
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): Gotsumon!

62
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:55,958
-Huh?

63
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,896
It's Koji!

64
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:02,197
A hero!

65
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:05,934
I can't believe it.

66
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,870
Is it really you?

67
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:09,404
-It's not time for talking.

68
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:10,606
-Yeah.

69
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,641
-Execute!

70
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:14,042
Spirit Evolution!

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,262
-Lobomon!

72
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:50,779
-Loweemon!

73
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:07,963
-Kumamon!

74
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:11,166
-Lobo Kendo!

75
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:15,637
-Wildfire Tsunami!

76
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:20,209
-Nighty night!

77
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:21,810
-Crystal Breeze!

78
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:22,811
-Shadow Lance!

79
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,812
-Great work, guys.

80
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,315
We'll protect this place,
no problem.

81
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,449
CRUSADERMON (OFFSCREEN):
Spiral Masquerade!

82
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,621
Beautiful, isn't it?

83
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:34,122
-The jewels!

84
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:35,824
DYNASMON (OFFSCREEN): Thanks
for reminding me.

85
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:42,564
-There are still Digimon
in there.

86
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:48,570
[screaming]

87
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:51,240
-More data for Lord Lucemon.

88
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:54,042
[screaming]

89
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:54,710
-But they--

90
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,878
those were your own men.

91
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:58,113
Don't you even care about
their destruction?

92
00:04:58,146 --> 00:04:59,348
-Foolish boy.

93
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,516
They were simply expendable
pawns.

94
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:03,385
Nothing matters but us,
Lord Lucemon, and

95
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:05,220
his new world order.

96
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,122
Your useless compassion
for the weak is what's

97
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:08,891
ruining this land.

98
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:11,693
The weak taint this whole world,
tarnishing the beauty

99
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:15,364
of Digimon like myself.

100
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:16,365
DYNASMON (OFFSCREEN):
With this data

101
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:18,500
scanned, only three remain.

102
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,701
ALDAMON (OFFSCREEN): What
do you mean, three?

103
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,738
-There are only three
areas left to scan.

104
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:25,207
The forests, the ice,
and the light.

105
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:28,043
The rest is already
Lord Lucemon's.

106
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,213
-And when the last of the data
is his, he shall awaken, and a

107
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:34,116
pure world will be born.

108
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:36,184
-No way, 'cause we're
gonna stop you.

109
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,452
-Hah!

110
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:40,022
Your paltry powers are
nothing again us.

111
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:42,557
-Maybe you'll fare better at
the Forest Kingdom, but I

112
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:44,259
seriously doubt it.

113
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:48,964
[laughter]

114
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:49,965
-They're gone.

115
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:50,766
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN):
It's all gone.

116
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:54,770
Everything.

117
00:05:57,873 --> 00:05:59,174
-Gotsumon!
-You OK?

118
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:00,042
-I sure hope so.

119
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:01,984
We have to save someone.

120
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,267
-Huh?

121
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,604
-You OK, Gotsumon?

122
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,838
-I can't believe it.

123
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:17,808
It's all gone.

124
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:18,642
-Easy.

125
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:19,977
-Don't try to do too much.

126
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,644
-What do you mean?

127
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,312
I haven't done anything.

128
00:06:22,346 --> 00:06:25,482
My whole world is gone,
and I did nothing.

129
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:27,017
-I'm sorry we couldn't
stop them.

130
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,185
-That's not your fault.

131
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,353
It's those Royal Knights.

132
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,155
They did it.

133
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,857
If it weren't for you guys, I
wouldn't be able to feel sad,

134
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:36,493
'cause I wouldn't
even be here.

135
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:40,731
Thank you, guys, for
saving my life.

136
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:43,100
But you'd better get
going now, right?

137
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,836
They said there were only three
worlds left to destroy.

138
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,337
Well, you'd better get going.

139
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:48,672
You're going to stop
them, aren't you?

140
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:50,541
-Yeah, if we can.

141
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:53,076
Now is when I usually say, of
course we'll beat them.

142
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:54,578
But look at that.

143
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,547
-But we have to try.

144
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,549
-Yeah, and I know you
too well, Takuya.

145
00:06:58,582 --> 00:07:00,517
You wouldn't be able to look at
yourself in the mirror if

146
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:01,652
you didn't give it your all.

147
00:07:01,685 --> 00:07:03,554
-And we'll be there
to back you up.

148
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,888
-Mm-hm.

149
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:06,156
-Right.

150
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,090
We can do it.

151
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:07,691
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

152
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:09,693
We can.

153
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,695
I'm going with you guys,
and you can't stop me.

154
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,997
-But it's really dangerous.

155
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:16,400
-Yeah, it's going to be way
worse than fighting that whole

156
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,268
army of Knightmon, even.

157
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:19,403
-I don't care.

158
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:20,671
What reason do I have to stay?

159
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:21,738
Let me fight with you.

160
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,380
-(THINKING) How would we feel
if our world was gone?

161
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:31,915
He's coming.

162
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:33,083
-You serious?

163
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:34,918
-You really think he'd
just stay behind?

164
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:36,954
And who are we to tell him no?

165
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,288
-Mm-hm.

166
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:40,991
-I understand just
how he feels.

167
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:43,093
I also know the pain
of having my home

168
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,062
destroyed, if you remember.

169
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:48,232
-Well, looks like we've got
ourselves a new teammate.

170
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,500
Time to hit the rails.

171
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:55,772
-Hey, you guys.

172
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,007
I just had a thought.

173
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,809
The Forest Kingdom is where
Seraphimon's castle was,

174
00:07:58,809 --> 00:07:59,676
right?

175
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,044
-I know just what
you're thinking.

176
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:03,046
That's probably where the
Fractal Code is that we have

177
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,281
to protect.

178
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:05,716
-Then we'd better hurry.

179
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:10,287
KNIGHTMON (OFFSCREEN):
Electric Slash!

180
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:18,896
-Will nothing break
these doors?

181
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:19,897
Again!

182
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,964
-Electric Slash!

183
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:27,004
-If you want something
done, do it yourself.

184
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:27,905
-No.

185
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:29,172
-What?

186
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,441
-I just had the most
beautiful thought.

187
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:34,478
The door is well guarded, but
perhaps there's another way we

188
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:36,480
can get in that isn't
so well protected.

189
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,315
Perhaps above.

190
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:39,349
-Yes.

191
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,118
-You Knightmon wait here.

192
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:44,354
I'm sure those brats are bound
to show up and try to ruin

193
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:46,990
everything.

194
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,292
Come.

195
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:52,829
-Awesome.

196
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,299
Now we only have to deal
with the Knightmon.

197
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:56,466
-What's that?

198
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,634
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
I don't know.

199
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:58,802
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Of
course not, but I do.

200
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:00,671
It's a protective barrier
someone left.

201
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:01,638
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): But who?

202
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:02,639
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
I don't know.

203
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,141
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Of course not.

204
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:07,010
-Oh, you're so funny,
I forgot to laugh.

205
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:08,011
-Sorry.

206
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,613
All right, let's do this
together, guys.

207
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:11,114
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): No.
-Huh?

208
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:13,150
Why the heck not?

209
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,986
-Because I'm going to take care
of them all by myself.

210
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,654
-W--why?

211
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,323
-You guys are going to have
to go keep an eye

212
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:20,724
on the Royal Knights.

213
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:23,827
They can't get their hands on
that data, no matter what.

214
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:24,962
-But Koji--

215
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:26,496
-The data is all that
matters now if we're

216
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:27,698
going to save the world.

217
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:30,367
We don't have time to
argue about this.

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,402
-That's all well and good, but
how do you expect to beat all

219
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:34,805
those Knightmon by yourself?

220
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:36,006
-He won't be alone.

221
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,207
-Huh?

222
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:40,077
-I'll be right by his side.

223
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,714
-OK, fine.

224
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:45,515
Next time, buddy, can
you just tell us

225
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,417
without all the dramatics?

226
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:49,019
-Yeah.

227
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:50,554
Are you ready, Gotsumon?

228
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:51,888
-Let's go.

229
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:04,134
-Unity Execute!

230
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,936
Unified Spirit Evolution!

231
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:19,750
MagnaGarurumon!

232
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:25,956
-Wow.

233
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:28,692
And I thought he was
tough before.

234
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:29,860
-All right, gang.

235
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:31,595
Let's go.
-Yeah!

236
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:36,933
-You ready, Gotsumon?

237
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,639
-Yeah.

238
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:44,174
At least I hope I am.

239
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:54,651
-Very well, we are here.

240
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:57,320
What is your plan, exactly?

241
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:59,022
-Patience, please.

242
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:02,092
This type of barrier tends to be
weakest at the top, at the

243
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,794
juncture of its walls.

244
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:05,962
Perhaps if we hammer away
at that point, the

245
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,364
barrier will collapse.

246
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:09,099
-Hammer away how?

247
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,167
-Observe.

248
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:15,772
First of Athena!

249
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:25,716
-Dragon Thrower!

250
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:31,021
CRUSADERMON (OFFSCREEN):
It's working.

251
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:32,522
Beautiful.

252
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:34,691
-Soon, the data will be ours.

253
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:37,027
[laughter]

254
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:39,696
-There they are.

255
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,498
We have to protect the data.

256
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:42,733
-Quick, Takuya.

257
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,901
You should evolve into
EmperorGreymon.

258
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:47,671
-You're right.

259
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:48,572
What's that?

260
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:49,873
-Oh, my.

261
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,744
-What's with the D-Tector?

262
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:56,246
-I don't know, but
it's pretty.

263
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,248
-Someone's calling us.

264
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:01,685
I don't know how, but it feels
like a message from a friend.

265
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:05,922
-A way in.

266
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:10,761
-I knew it.

267
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:11,995
-Wait up!

268
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:13,196
-Yeah!

269
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:14,431
-Hey, what about the
Royal Knights?

270
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:17,000
Koji said we were supposed
to keep an eye on them.

271
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,401
-Listen, you nincompoop.

272
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,604
If we get inside and get the
data before they do, then we

273
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:22,339
won't have to keep an eye
on them, will we?

274
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:25,242
-Last one in's a rotten
Digi-Egg!

275
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:27,077
-I'm always the egg.

276
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,380
-No fair!

277
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:31,414
MAGNAGARURUMON (OFFSCREEN):
Feral Fire!

278
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:38,121
-Rock Fist!

279
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:39,489
Rock First!

280
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:40,757
Rock First!

281
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,661
-Ha ha!

282
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:50,467
You want some more?

283
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:51,802
Magna Missiles!

284
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,309
-Jeez, you think you got 'em?

285
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,944
That was easier than
I thought.

286
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:01,578
-Huh?

287
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:02,913
-Huh?

288
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,090
Uh-oh.

289
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:20,096
-You and your big mouth.

290
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:21,731
-Wow.

291
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:24,668
-Oh, I run all the time.

292
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:27,337
-No, I mean, this place
looks familiar.

293
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,008
-Well, this used to be your home
when you were Seraphimon.

294
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,109
-Which direction?

295
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:34,110
-Well, uh--

296
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,011
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Which way?

297
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:35,812
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Come on, buddy.

298
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:36,847
A little help?

299
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:41,818
Right!

300
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:46,389
-Dragon Thrower!

301
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:57,534
-Rock Fist, Rock Fist,
Rock Fist!

302
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:06,977
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): How
can we beat them?

303
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,144
CRUSADERMON (OFFSCREEN);
You can't.

304
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:09,312
-Huh?

305
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:10,480
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN):
Crusadermon!

306
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:13,016
-Especially not after I
get through with you.

307
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,518
And I can't wait to be
through with you.

308
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:18,522
But at least your trip into
oblivion will be eased by the

309
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:19,890
final vision of my beauty.

310
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,229
-Fine.

311
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:27,330
Let's fight.

312
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:28,698
Ready, Gotsumon?

313
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:29,699
CRUSADERMON (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, goodie.

314
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,368
Two for the price of one.

315
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:31,801
-(THINKING) Ready?

316
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:32,702
Ready for what?

317
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,704
What am I gonna do
against her?

318
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,011
-How cute.

319
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:50,587
-Well, nothing can
stop us now.

320
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:51,922
-It's Cherubimon!

321
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:56,226
-It's the data.

322
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:00,297
-I don't know, Takuya.

323
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,199
Are you sure about that?

324
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,301
-Positive.

325
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,538
-Here, you see what I mean?

326
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:11,341
-So all we have to do
is protect this.

327
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:14,544
-Yeah, and I'm sure it'll
be real easy, too.

328
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:17,213
[shouting]

329
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,548
-It begins to break!

330
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,050
Ha ha!

331
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,686
One powerful shot should pierce
it, and one powerful

332
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,754
shot it shall have!

333
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:25,855
Breath of Wyvern!

334
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:41,271
Ha ha ha!

335
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:44,941
The castle can't hide the data
if the castle is gone.

336
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:49,579
And it and those children
are surely gone.

337
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,147
-Am I alive?

338
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:52,282
-I don't know.

339
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:54,117
It seems like I don't
know anything today.

340
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,652
-We should be used to being
in the dark by now.

341
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,287
-Yeah, but now we're
in the light.

342
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,288
And we're not alone.

343
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,856
It's Sorcermon!

344
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:00,724
-Get back.

345
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,726
Quick, this way.

346
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:03,860
Take care of Seraphimon.

347
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,396
He's our last hope.

348
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:09,866
With the last of my strength, I
have protected this castle.

349
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:12,635
But now I must leave
the rest up to you.

350
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,871
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Sorcermon.

351
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:16,439
-That's twice he's saved us.

352
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:18,241
We'd be gone if it
wasn't for him.

353
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:19,442
-You talk about devoted.

354
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,945
I mean, he was fighting evil
even after he died.

355
00:16:21,978 --> 00:16:25,281
-(THINKING) I wonder if
I could be that brave?

356
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,584
Well, since he saved us twice
then we owe it to him to fight

357
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:30,120
twice as hard to save this world
from those evil guys.

358
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:36,960
-Why don't you start your little
fight with me, then?

359
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:41,364
What?

360
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:43,500
No pithy comeback?

361
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,335
-Oh, I'll give you a comeback.

362
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:46,036
-Do it.

363
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:47,170
-Let's go.

364
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:59,049
-Unity Execute!

365
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,950
Unified Spirit Evolution!

366
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,498
EmperorGreymon!

367
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:26,676
-You do not stand a chance
against me, pathetic human!

368
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,985
Oh, I knew this would be fun!

369
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:42,158
-This is horrible.

370
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:45,528
All I can do is watch.

371
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:47,430
He needs me!

372
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:51,568
-Fist of Athena!

373
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:54,237
-If only I were stronger,
I could help him!

374
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:58,374
-Huh?

375
00:17:58,408 --> 00:17:59,409
-Meteormon!

376
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:03,646
I digivolved?

377
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,315
-Good timing.

378
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:07,984
-All I wanted to do was help you
fight her, and now I can.

379
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:10,220
-Uh-huh.

380
00:18:10,286 --> 00:18:11,688
-Very well.

381
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:13,857
If you have help, then I
shall have help, too.

382
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:16,025
Knightmon?

383
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,827
-Are you ready?

384
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:19,696
-Yeah.

385
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:21,564
-Is that the best you can do?

386
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:22,899
-Not even close!

387
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:30,240
I'm just getting warmed
up, buddy!

388
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,241
-Galactic Blast!

389
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,748
-What have you done to my
beautiful Knightmon?

390
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:40,383
-Same thing we're
gonna do to you!

391
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:46,723
-You catch on quick.

392
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:51,094
But you haven't seen
anything yet!

393
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:54,097
Dragonfire Crossbow!

394
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:55,165
-Dragon Thrower!

395
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:09,118
[laughter]

396
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:09,619
-What's so funny?

397
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:10,620
You missed.

398
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,822
DYNASMON (OFFSCREEN): Did I?

399
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:14,123
-No!

400
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:19,962
-Fools.

401
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,864
Did you really think
you could win?

402
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:26,302
-Oh, no!

403
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,337
-They scanned the castle.

404
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:30,339
-Right you are, pebble brain.

405
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,774
How beautiful.

406
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:34,177
-We win again.

407
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:35,178
-Not yet, you haven't.

408
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:37,180
If you're still here,
we can stop you!

409
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:39,348
-Are you sure?

410
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:45,321
[screaming]

411
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:46,355
MAGNAGARURUMON (OFFSCREEN):
Gotsumon!

412
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:52,195
-It's a simple choice, really.

413
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:54,864
-Will you fight us or
save your friends?

414
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:00,436
-Such predictable cowards.

415
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,940
Come, only two areas remain.

416
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:07,243
-And then the glory of Lord
Lucemon shall be unveiled!

417
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,415
-What's the holdup?

418
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,449
Get on already.

419
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:15,751
Holy [german], get on, kiddies.

420
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,954
Let's go.

421
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,124
GOTSUMON (OFFSCREEN): Well,
I guess this is goodbye.

422
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,925
-Are you sure?

423
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,894
-Mm-hm.

424
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,662
Of course I am.

425
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:28,431
I don't want to be in
your way anymore.

426
00:20:28,431 --> 00:20:29,832
I mean, look at me.

427
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:33,069
What good would I be to
you in this condition?

428
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:35,004
KOJI (OFFSCREEN): You were
never in the way.

429
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:36,739
-I'll be counting
on you, Koji.

430
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:43,946
We all will.

431
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,819
Without you guys, we wouldn't
have any hope.

432
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:54,690
BOKOMON (NARRATING):
Gotsumon's right.

433
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:57,627
I only hope this time to save
the two areas that are left.

434
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,195
See if they can do
it on the next

435
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:02,598
Digimon, Digital Monsters.
