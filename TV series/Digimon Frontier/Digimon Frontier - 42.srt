1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:02,994
-Tommy and his new friends got
a free flight from the Royal

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:04,996
Knights to Beanstalk Village.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,799
So Takuya and the gang wormed
their way onto a Trailmon and

4
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,468
were soon in hot pursuit.

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,003
Turns out Crusadermon and
Dynasmon heard about the key

6
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:13,805
to the village and made
the Mamemon miserable

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,440
trying to find it.

8
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,476
When Tommy and Koji rolled into
town, the unity evolved

9
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:18,810
and the battle began.

10
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:21,179
Things looked grim for our
heros, so Elder Mamemon told

11
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:23,181
the regal rats where
the key was.

12
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:25,984
Luckily, everybody got out
of town just in time, and

13
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:29,054
Katsuharu and his buds
left for home.

14
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:30,889
But we're not through with
the Royal Knights yet.

15
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:31,957
THEME SONG: Digimon.

16
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:42,000
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

17
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,034
digital world.

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,007
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,881
by the lessons we've learned
as we work towards one

20
00:00:55,914 --> 00:01:00,552
solution through a
spirit evolution.

21
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,695
Digimon, forever
united as one.

22
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,032
Digimon, together the
battles are won.

23
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:18,236
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

24
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,573
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

25
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:28,213
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

26
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:30,081
Digimon.

27
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,218
-Woo woo.

28
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,187
Woo weh, whatever.

29
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:42,260
-I hope they all got
home safely.

30
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:43,695
-I'm sure they're fine.

31
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:45,530
-Don't worry, Tommy, I'm sure
Worm wouldn't let anything

32
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:47,432
happen to them.

33
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:48,566
-It's pretty empty out there.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,568
There's hardly anything
left to save.

35
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:52,570
-We've got ourselves
a royal problem.

36
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:53,939
-What are we going to
do about those guys?

37
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:55,407
We can't beat them.

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,574
-I know.

39
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:58,276
-Hey, how can you
even say that?

40
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:02,847
We have to find a way to beat
them no matter what.

41
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,716
-In case you're interested,
the Village of Beginning

42
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,184
should be just up ahead.

43
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:08,053
-Well, the name's interesting.

44
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,220
Huh?

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,956
-It's the place where all
Digibot are born.

46
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:12,190
-Really?

47
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:14,426
-Can a purified Digiegg go
there to start over?

48
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,927
-Very good question, Zoe.

49
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,596
But with all the scanning going
on lately, I'm just

50
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,931
hoping the village
is still there.

51
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,802
-Ooh, yeah, that's a lot steeper
than I remember.

52
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:26,137
I think I can, I think
I can, blah blah.

53
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,776
Well, here we are, folks.

54
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,278
-Get out, and get lost.

55
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:33,945
-Goodbye.

56
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:39,417
[chattering]

57
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,754
-Wow, what a beautiful
place to be born.

58
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,790
-Indeed, it's the only
place for Digimon.

59
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:48,326
The safety of this village and
everything in it is critical

60
00:02:48,326 --> 00:02:50,195
to our very existence.

61
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:52,497
-I don't know about you
guys, but I'm pretty

62
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:53,999
egg-cited to be here.

63
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,834
Egg-cited, egg salad.

64
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,469
-Ugh, cool.

65
00:02:57,502 --> 00:02:58,837
-Wow, I can't believe it.

66
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,472
-They're even prettier
up close.

67
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:02,640
-The village is full of them.

68
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,442
-Egg-straordinary and
egg-ucational.

69
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:06,978
-Stop that.

70
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:08,313
-Ahh.

71
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,949
[scream]

72
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,952
-Hey, who's there?

73
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:15,086
[scream]

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,688
-Step away from the egg
right now, intruder.

75
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,826
NARRATOR: Swanmon-- feathered
yet fierce, this Digimon's

76
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,996
beauty is only rivaled by her
protective instincts.

77
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,831
The feathers will definitely
start flying if you try to

78
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:28,800
mess with this mama.

79
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,335
[screaming]

80
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,170
-He didn't mean anything
by it, honest.

81
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,805
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

82
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,141
-In that case, I bid
you loving welcome.

83
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,976
[sigh]

84
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,512
-I am Swanmon, the caretaker and
protector of the Village

85
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,213
of Beginnings.

86
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,350
-Wow.

87
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,520
-I make sure they receive water
and nutrients every day.

88
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:49,854
They must be carefully
nurtured.

89
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:51,356
These eggs are the precious
treasures

90
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:53,191
of the digital world.

91
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,092
-But there are so many.

92
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,894
How do you take care
of them all?

93
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:58,163
-It is a very difficult
job, and getting much

94
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,265
more so every day.

95
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:02,300
-This one's hatching.

96
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,535
-What?

97
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,839
-Baboo.

98
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:08,840
-Yay.

99
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,675
-Wow, we have a baby.

100
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,043
[giggle]
-Baboo?

101
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,044
-Aww.

102
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,679
-Baboo to you.

103
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,147
-Hey, I want to see,
c'mon, Swanmon.

104
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,583
-It always seems to move me when
I see new life beginning.

105
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:21,820
Makes me reminisce
about my Patamon.

106
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:22,687
[explosion]

107
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:24,689
[laughing]

108
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:25,824
-Wow.
-Hi.

109
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:28,326
-He's my baby.

110
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,929
I'll never forget the first time
he called me his Papamon.

111
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:32,997
-I love you, Papamon.

112
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,101
-I love you too, my baby.

113
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:36,701
[ringing]

114
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,236
-What's happening?

115
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,437
-It's the four evil warriors.

116
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,905
[ringing]

117
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,707
-Their data seems to be reacting
for some reason.

118
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,243
-Zoe, remember the question
you asked me?

119
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,079
The eggs of the evil legendary
warriors you scanned must have

120
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,081
been sent back here
to start over.

121
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,383
-So does that mean they'll
be reborn someday?

122
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,085
-After all that work?

123
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,488
-Wait, when we scan them,
we purify them, right?

124
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:58,756
Plus Cherubimon's gone, so this
time when they're reborn,

125
00:04:58,823 --> 00:05:00,391
there's no way they'll
be evil.

126
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:01,092
-I hope you're right.

127
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,495
-Excuse me.

128
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,764
Sorry to interrupt, but it's
time to feed this little one

129
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:07,432
and get him to bed, and I'm
sure the others are quite

130
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:08,566
hungry by now.

131
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:09,434
-The others?

132
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,035
Well, how many others
are there?

133
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:12,704
Would you like some help?

134
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:14,739
-Oh, I couldn't ask you to do
that, but you're welcome to

135
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,274
come in and see them
if you like.

136
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:18,409
This way.

137
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:19,711
[gasp]

138
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:28,399
[gasp]

139
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:31,168
[crying]

140
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:35,406
-You've got to watch all these
babies by yourself?

141
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,208
-Yes, normally it's only for a
day or so, then the Trailmon

142
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:39,710
take them to their families.

143
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:42,546
But the Trailmon seemed to have
stopped coming lately.

144
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:44,047
-Why would they stop?

145
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,717
-I heard the Beanstalk Village
disappeared recently.

146
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:49,186
The whole digital world seems
to be under attack, and the

147
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,221
Trailmon are frightened and
they've decided to hide in

148
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,356
their tunnels.

149
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,892
-Trailmon act more like
babies than babies.

150
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:57,895
-Anyway, whatever their reason
is, I'm here by myself.

151
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:00,397
And you guys need some
milk, don't you?

152
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:01,732
-Swanmon, let me help.

153
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:02,566
-I love babies.

154
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,567
-Yeah, I can feed them.

155
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,836
-I've got plenty
of experience.

156
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:10,140
-Very well, but it's not
going to be easy.

157
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:11,475
Now, don't let them
drink too fast.

158
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,410
They'll get very cranky
if they get

159
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:14,978
bubbles in their tummies.

160
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:17,047
-I've had to face a lot of
challenges in the digital

161
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,249
world, but this is one I never
imagined myself doing.

162
00:06:19,283 --> 00:06:20,684
[crying]

163
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:22,586
-Hang on, little fella,
I'll be right there.

164
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:23,687
-Come on, baby, it's
good stuff.

165
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,855
Just take the bottle.

166
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:25,889
-May I?

167
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:32,563
-Wow, doesn't it feel like we're
a mom and dad feeding a

168
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:34,064
baby together?

169
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:36,567
Ooh.
-No.

170
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,468
-Guess she's just not
comfortable with

171
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:39,303
her love for me yet.

172
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:42,706
But you love me, huh?

173
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,274
Now that's comfortable.

174
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:45,943
-They're amazing, aren't they?

175
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:47,444
I wonder if this is how we were
fed when you and I were

176
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:49,112
little babies.

177
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:50,447
-Oh?

178
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,451
Hey yeah, I keep forgetting
that the two of us were

179
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:55,452
together when we were born.

180
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:56,119
[cooing]

181
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:56,753
-Here ya go.

182
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:58,922
[cooing]

183
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:01,558
-Calm down, I promise there's
enough for everybody, that is

184
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:05,195
if you can behave yourselves.

185
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,698
-You're so good at making
babies happy.

186
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,201
-Thank you, but I did learn a
lot about babies from you.

187
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:13,937
-Well, they're finally
asleep now.

188
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:16,039
Thank you, everyone.

189
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:18,308
I couldn't have done it
without all your help.

190
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:20,544
-We did it, huh?

191
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:22,446
-I don't know how you
do this alone.

192
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:24,781
-If you'd like a job here,
I'd be happy to hire you.

193
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:27,284
Now who wants some tea?

194
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:29,920
So tell me, is it true that
you've inherited the spirits

195
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:31,588
of the great legendary
warriors?

196
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:33,423
-You bet your booties.

197
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:36,493
-Hey, aren't you going to put
him down so you can eat?

198
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,629
-I would, but he cries
every time I do.

199
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:40,430
-That's cause you spoiled him.

200
00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:43,534
Guess the little booger thinks
you're his mom or something.

201
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:44,968
-Wish my mom were here
to spoil me.

202
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:49,840
[sighing]

203
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,774
-What's the matter
with everybody?

204
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:51,775
Is something wrong
with the food?

205
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:54,011
Oh no, am I going to
be sick again?

206
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:55,279
[sigh]

207
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:56,547
-You really know how
to kill the mood.

208
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,348
-You know what?

209
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,617
This was right.

210
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:02,920
I'm glad I decided
not to go home.

211
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:04,488
Hey, I'm a big kid now,
and being here is a

212
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:06,456
very important job.

213
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:07,624
-You're right about that.

214
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:09,293
I mean, after all, how many
kids can say that

215
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:10,160
they're half Digimon?

216
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:12,129
That is pretty cool.

217
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,964
-I remember how weird
if felt the first

218
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:15,365
time I spirit evolved.

219
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,100
Now it just seems normal.

220
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:18,936
-I can't even imagine
not being able to

221
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:20,137
become a Digimon anymore.

222
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:23,006
I am Beetlemon.

223
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:25,108
-Yeah, it's definitely made
me a lot stronger.

224
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:28,011
I used to be afraid
of everything.

225
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:29,846
-You know what's even better?

226
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,982
We have two birthdays
we can celebrate--

227
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:34,885
one when we were born, and one
when we became Digimon.

228
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:36,853
-Yeah, I know my life will
never be the same.

229
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,060
-That's why we have to stick
together and do everything we

230
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:44,895
can to save the digital world.

231
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:47,264
This is our home too, and I'm
proud to be a Digimon.

232
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:47,831
-Me too.

233
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:49,199
-Yeah.

234
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,001
-Thank you all very much.

235
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:53,270
-Well, gang, what do you say
we go to try to talk some

236
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:55,739
sense into those silly Trailmon
and see about getting

237
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,240
those babies home?

238
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,241
-That would be wonderful.

239
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:13,857
-The Village of Beginnings.

240
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:16,326
-Looks like a tasty
birthday cake.

241
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,894
-It is quite beautiful.

242
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,663
Lucemon will be pleased.

243
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:20,864
It's a shame we have
to scan it.

244
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:27,838
-I can't believe the Trailmon
are wussing out like this.

245
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:30,173
-I suppose even giant Digimon
like them have the right to be

246
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,908
afraid once in awhile.

247
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:34,444
-I think it's a lot creepier
in here than outside.

248
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:36,113
-Man, those guys are weird.

249
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:36,747
Jinx.

250
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,249
[giggling]

251
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,084
-Who, who is there?

252
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,586
-We're looking for
the Trailmon.

253
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,554
-Well, you found them.

254
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:48,058
Ooh, it's just you.

255
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,893
-Angler you have to take
the babies home.

256
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:50,594
-There's just too many.

257
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:52,429
Swanmon is overwhelmed.

258
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,064
-You don't get it,
pal, do you?

259
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:54,998
-We don't want to get hurt.

260
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:56,833
-So true.

261
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,436
-But if you guys stop running,
the bad guys win.

262
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:00,737
And what about the babies?

263
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:01,571
-What about em, huh?

264
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:02,839
What about em?

265
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:05,308
-Yeah, babies are a lot more
resilient than we are.

266
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:07,010
-Sorry, kinder, but it's
just too dangerous.

267
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:09,980
Auf wiedersehen.

268
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:11,181
[sigh]

269
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:12,015
-Welcome back.

270
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,150
That was fast.

271
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,152
So how did it go?

272
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:19,156
-By decree of Lord Lucemon, we
shall now scan this village.

273
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:20,490
-Are you two out
of your minds.

274
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:21,825
This is the village
of beginnings.

275
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:24,528
-Well, for every beginning,
there must be an end.

276
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:27,331
We are here to facilitate
that.

277
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:28,665
-Down tornado.

278
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:33,837
-Spiral masquerade.

279
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,042
-No.

280
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,377
-Cowards.

281
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,311
Guess we'll have to
spirit evolve and

282
00:10:41,378 --> 00:10:42,546
take the babies ourselves.

283
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:47,017
I'm sorry, Swanmon.

284
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,019
The Trailmon just wouldn't
cooperate.

285
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:51,888
-Run, hurry.

286
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:53,223
-Swanmon, what's wrong?

287
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,621
-Look who's here, and
just in time.

288
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:06,123
The party's about to begin.

289
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,492
-Hope you like scrambled eggs.

290
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,260
-Do you have any idea of
what you're doing?

291
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:11,862
This place is sacred.

292
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:13,597
If you harm anything here,
you'll upset the balance of

293
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:14,698
all Digimon life.

294
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:15,932
-Don't you understand?

295
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:17,667
This is where Digimon
are born.

296
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:19,169
-Not anymore.

297
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:22,139
Clones will be easier for
Lord Lucemon to control.

298
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:24,341
That way, true balance
can be achieved.

299
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:25,876
-And you buy that?

300
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,144
-You mustn't do this.

301
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,479
The Village of Beginnings
is irreplaceable.

302
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:31,214
-Yes, he's right.

303
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:32,649
-If you do this, just know that
you're going to have to

304
00:11:32,683 --> 00:11:33,683
go through us first.

305
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:36,086
-Ooh, I'm trembling.

306
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,155
-Your funeral, human.

307
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:40,524
-Well, I'd rather die than allow
twisted sickos like you

308
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,559
to destroy such a
beautiful place.

309
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:45,495
-They're tough, but we've
got to stop them.

310
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:46,830
-We have to protect the eggs.

311
00:11:46,897 --> 00:11:48,231
-I'm ready.

312
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:49,933
-Right behind you, buddy.

313
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:51,401
-Right.

314
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:54,371
-All right, then let's do it.

had enough already?

324
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:39,416
-Better take cover, guys.

[grunting]

326
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,821

[laughing]

328
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:53,830
-So brave yet ignorant.

-We don't intent to
fight you insects.

330
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:56,967
-Say what?

331
00:12:56,967 --> 00:13:00,103
-We only came here to
scan this village.

332
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:02,539
-If you choose to get in the
way, you will share the same

333
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,241
fate.

334
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:05,742
-I suggest you and your little
friends run along, we have an

335
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,744
important mission to fulfill.

336
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,085
-Hey, pal, not on my watch.

337
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,920
-Hold it, where do you think
you're going, pinkie?

338
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,090
Big mistake.

339
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,225
-Hope you're insured.

340
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,294
-Dragon thrower.

-Fist of Athena.

343
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:34,838
-Why would you sacrifice
your own lives to

344
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:36,773
protect these eggs?

345
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,475
-Shall I destroy you not
or would you like your

346
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:41,178
humiliation prolonged?

347
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:43,113
-Hey, why aren't they
fighting back?

348
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:44,314
-Maybe they're afraid the
eggs will be hurt

349
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,149
if they fight here.

350
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,484
There's got to be something
we can do to help them.

351
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:50,620
-At least have this.

352
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:51,955
-You're right, they're
not even trying.

353
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,057
This place isn't safe for
the eggs anymore.

354
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,459
The only way they'll survive
is if we move them. -Good

355
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:58,195
idea, Z.

356
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:00,130
-All right, people, we got to
do this fast and not let the

357
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:02,299
Knights see what we're doing.

358
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,634
-You are pathetic.

359
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,436
-I think it's rather
beautiful.

360
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:07,337
-We can't let them
hurt the eggs.

361
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,972
-That's a big painful duh.

362
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,611
-All right.

363
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:15,512
[grunt]

364
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:16,680
-Keep going, guys.

365
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,281
I'll hold them off
as long as I can.

366
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,951
We'll try to keep
them distracted.

367
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,652
-We've got to get these
Digieggs out of here.

368
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:23,987
I'm going to see the
Trailmon again.

369
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,288
-Good luck.

370
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,823
-Mamoo?

371
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:28,358
-The Village of Beginnings
is under attack.

372
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:31,361
We're collecting the Digieggs as
fast as we can, but we have

373
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:32,696
no way of transporting them.

374
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:36,233
These are innocent little lives
we're talking about, not

375
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:39,035
to mention that they are the
future of the digital world.

376
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:41,004
Please, you have to help us
or they'll be destroyed.

377
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:42,539
You're our only hope.

378
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:44,541
Are you just going to hide
here and let them die?

379
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,577
-Something's happening
to this egg.

380
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:50,013
-It's all pretty and glowing.

381
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:51,581
-What a crummy time to hatch.

382
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:53,550
-That's not what
they're doing.

383
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,884
-Fist of Athena.

384
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:58,955
-Dragon thrower.

is impressive,

but I have a deadline.

388
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:07,530
I'm afraid our little
game is over.

389
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,199
-How can you be so callous
about destroying

390
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:10,333
a place like this?

391
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,501
Have you no conscience?

392
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:13,403
-There is only one
consciousness,

393
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:14,838
that of Lord Lucemon.

394
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,240
He alone has the power
to restore order

395
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,175
to the digital world.

396
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,410
-Yeah?

397
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:21,878
Well it's obvious he's got some
kind of power, at least

398
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,847
enough to brainwash you dubs
into believing that garbage.

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,848
-What?

400
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:27,784
How dare you speak such
blasphemy, you

401
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:28,885

almost there.

to do now?

The rest of you go help
Takuya and Koji.

-Meddling mutants.

You'll pay for that.

You're about to become
egg salad.

off right now.

and Arbormon.

come to help.

-What is this, a joke?

if we combine the

power of all 10 warriors.

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,032
-Keep the sunny side up.

491
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:21,001
Sunny, don't you know?

492
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:23,169
-Excellent job, guys.

493
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,537
[laugh]

494
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:26,639
-Well I escort these babies
with loving care.

495
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:30,010
-Because we are the movers
extraordinaire.

496
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:33,346
-These babies are going home,
and it's all thanks to you

497
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:34,881
wonderful children.

498
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:36,716
-We should be thanking you.

499
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:38,752
-Now behave yourself, Pabumon.

500
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:40,987
-Baboo!

502
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:49,596
-I promise you guys, I will
never give up until my friends

503
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:54,234
and I have found a way to
rebuild the digital world.

504
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,870
-Things seem to be back on
track for the moment, but

505
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:58,705
there's a lot of
pieces missing.

506
00:20:58,738 --> 00:21:00,673
Let's see if they can put them
back together on the next

507
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:03,009
Digimon Digital Monsters.
