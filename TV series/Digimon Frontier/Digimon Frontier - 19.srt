NARRATOR: On their way to the
Rose Morning Star, the gang

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:05,038
made an unscheduled stop at
the great Trailmon race.

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:07,107
Everyone decided to join the
festivities and partnered up

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,041
with a Trailmon.

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,676
Well, almost everyone.

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,678
Bokomon was a little too busy
playing mother hen to

7
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,480
participate.

8
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,183
Anyway, during the wacky ride,
ShadowWereGarurumon and Dogmon

9
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,051
used all kinds of nasty
tricks to take the

10
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,653
gang out one by one.

11
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,522
Finally, Takuya Beast Spirit
Evolved to BurningGreymon and

12
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,224
gave that mean old wolf
and his mutt a taste

13
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,525
of their own medicine.

14
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,860
With the two of them out of
the way, Takuya and Worm

15
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:31,031
crossed the finish line first,
and the crow goes wild!

16
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,032

THEME SONG: Look to the past as
we head for the future to

19
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,411
reclaim the Digital World.

20
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:49,082
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

21
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,051
by the lessons we've learned.

22
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,958
As we work towards one solution

23
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,259
through a Spirit Evolution.

24
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,500
Digimon!

25
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,236
Forever united as one.

26
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,470
Digimon!

27
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,806
Together the battles are won.

28
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,474
Digimon!

29
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,444
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

30
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,981
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

31
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:28,322
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

32
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:28,855
Digimon!

MALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Every
time the three moons align in

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,964
the sky, I am reminded
of only one thing.

35
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,665
Hamburgers!

36
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,702
I gotta eat right now!

37
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,870
Right?

38
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:51,678
[shouting]

39
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,713
-Heh heh heh.

40
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,683
FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
Chamelemon.

41
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,385
With their specialized skin,
they can appear to disappear,

42
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,054
and a tongue lashing from them
is one you'll never forget.

43
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,730
-Wish me luck, dear.

44
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,798
Oh great wooden one.

45
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,701
I bring you the finest burgers,
crafted by my own

46
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:15,769
humble hands.

47
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,909
-Now that is a thing
off beauty!

48
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,478
Come on, Burger Boy.

49
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,946
Not bad, pops.

50
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,782
You're coming to my place to
make enough to fill me up, and

51
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,584
I got a big appetite.

52
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,451
-Honey bun!

53
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,753
Oh!

54
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:33,587
-Daddy!

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,988
-You want him back?

56
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,957
You gotta make an even
better burger before

57
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,625
the moons align tomorrow.

58
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,626
Until then, Chow!

59
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,933
-Ah yeah.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,201
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): So
what's the story on

61
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,669
this Hamburger Village?

62
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,537
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): It's
a Hamburger lover's

63
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,039
paradise, my boy.

64
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,173
-Sounds great!

65
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,508
-Bring on the beef, baby!

66
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,642
-Yeah.

67
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,210
I'm gonna eat my body
weight, maybe even

68
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,311
all of ours, in burgers.

69
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,657
[sobbing]

70
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,691
CHILDREN (OFFSCREEN):
Oh momma!

71
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,263
-What's up with them?

72
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:16,997
-Um, excuse me.

73
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,532
Are you all right?

74
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,001
-Oh, no, dear. a giant Digimon
raided our village.

75
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,904
He said something about the
three moons making him hungry,

76
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,440
so my husband gave him a big
plate of our best burgers.

77
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,908
-Now I'm hungry.

78
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,277
-He liked them so much that he
took my husband away to cook

79
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,412
for him in his mansion.

80
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,413
-Wow.

81
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,915
-Man, that's really messed up.

82
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,284
-Yeah, how are we supposed to
get our hamburgers now?

83
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,785
-Your compassion
is astounding.

84
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,289
-Daddy is coming back,
isn't he momma?

85
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,891
TOGETHER: Isn't he momma?

86
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,160
-Please young man, would you
and your friends be able to

87
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,562
help me find my husband?

88
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,098
-I suppose, but I wouldn't
even know where to begin

89
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,766
looking for him.

90
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,835
-The monster will bring daddy
back is we make a bigger

91
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,636
burger.

92
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,071
-He means a better burger, but
I'm afraid that's impossible.

93
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,640
My husband makes the best
burgers around.

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,310
There's no way anyone could make
a better hamburger than

95
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,478
my husband.

96
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,680
Oh dear, what are
we going to do?

97
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,815
-The monster said that to get
daddy back, we have to have

98
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,317
the bigger burger ready before
he moves three times.

99
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,018
-No, silly.

100
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,621
He said before the three
moons align.

101
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,522
-That's soon.

102
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,156
-He's right.

103
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,958
We must do something.

104
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,227
The three moons will align by
nightfall, and the Chamelemon

105
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,828
will be back for their
master's burger.

106
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,829
-Then it's up to us.

107
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,897
We can make a better burger.

108
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,731
-Huh?

109
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,166
-Come on.

110
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,034
I think we've scarfed enough
burgers in our time to be able

111
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,070
to come up with something that
at least looks right.

112
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,038
And when the Chamelemon take
it to the mansion, we'll

113
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,240
follow them.

114
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,209
-Nice plan, except that I've
never cooked before.

115
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,677
-Me either, but I'm
willing to try.

116
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,912
-Me too.

117
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,715
Hey, I always used to watch
my mom cook back home.

118
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,049
Don't worry.

119
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,751
We'll make a best hamburger ever
and get your daddy back.

120
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,187
-I think this'll be a good
experience for us.

121
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,589
-Anything with food is a
good experience for me.

122
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,925
-Yeah, especially when
it's burgers.

123
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,560
-I don't even know
what's in them.

124
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,228
I guess I'll have
to make it up.

125
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,630
-That's the whole idea.

126
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,065
We can each make one and
have judges taste them.

127
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,635
Takuya, this will be a friendly
competition, right?

128
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,870
-You worry too much, Zoe.

129
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,639
-Yeah, no problem.

130
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,541
-We may be a little rough,
but we're ready.

131
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,141
-Yay!

132
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,776
-Oh, thank you so much.

133
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,645
-Why don't I be your taster?

134
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,980
It would be an honor to lend my
superior palette to such a

135
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:14,981
noble cause.

136
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,484
So bring on the beef, baby.

137
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,920
-That just means
you wanna eat!

138
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,756
-My kitchen is fully stocked,
so help yourself to

139
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:23,423
anything you need.

140
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,959
Now let's get cooking.

141
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:26,913
-Yeah!

142
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:43,043
-I'm getting real hungry here!

143
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,377
What's taking so long?

144
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,846
Where's my burgers, right?

145
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,850
-The master's getting impatient,
Burgermon.

146
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,985
-I'm making them as
fast as I can.

147
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,321
If you expect a gourmet
burger, it takes time.

148
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,389
Well, you don't have time,
so deal with it.

149
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,860
-Oh man.

150
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,364
I'm ready to chow right now.

151
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,366
-Hey, save some ingredients
for cooking.

152
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,567
-Yes ma'am.

153
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,769
-All of this food is
making me drool.

154
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,339
-Yes, but must you
do it on me?

155
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,241
-It looks like some of
them have never even

156
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,543
seen a kitchen before.

157
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,911
-Hm.

158
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,746
I suppose you can never
have too much meat.

159
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,382
-Hey, Z. What kind are
you gonna make?

160
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,083
-Patience is a virtue.

161
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,251
You'll see.

162
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,386
-Smart, beautiful, and confident
in the kitchen.

163
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,455
Can a girl get any
better than that?

164
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,390
-All right, meaty meat burger.

165
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,458
Some of this.

166
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,059
Ha ha, maybe some of that!

167
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,096
And I'm gonna make
me a masterpiece.

168
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,098
Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat.

169
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,501
-That might work.

170
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,003
You look lost.

171
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,471
You need help?

172
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,006
-Well, the outside looks fine,
but I'm not sure what to put

173
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,074
in the middle yet.

174
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,609
I'm thinking ground beef.

175
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:50,310
Oh yeah.

176
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,144
Now I remember.

177
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,313
Mom said onions give
it flavor.

178
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,320
Oh boy, here come the tears.

179
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,290
It all came apart and there's
nothing inside!

180
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,191
-That is the inside.

181
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,494
We'll never get to
see daddy again!

182
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,829
-Never fear, the
blade is here!

183
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,970
-My children can't
stop crying.

184
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:21,374
-Yeah, neither can I.
Cooking's painful.

185
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,177
-Oh yeah, oh yeah.

186
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,345
-Yah, wiyah, ayo!

187
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,081
Easy as pie.

188
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,717
-Ha ha.

189
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,553
-My eyes hurt.

190
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,722
-Aw man, not in my
boiled eggs.

191
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,892
-I'm so sorry.

192
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,859
Oh no.

193
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,562
-Tommy, that was my
salad dressing.

194
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,197
-Do you know what
you're doing?

195
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,732
-Pretty klutzy.

196
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,702
-Aw, I don't know if
I can use this now.

197
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,270
Hey, it's pretty good.

198
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,304
-Whoa, Tommy.

199
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,639
You invented a new flavor.

200
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,040
-What was in that dressing?

201
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,242
-I don't know, but it sure
made a difference.

202
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:59,312
-I'll just fry the ground beef
and but this stuff on top.

203
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,453
-So, do you think
they're edible?

204
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,088
-I'm not gonna try it.

205
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:08,989
You try it!

206
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,323
-I'm not gonna try it.

207
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,458
Let's get--

208
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,126
-Meatloaf and yakisoba
noodles.

209
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,462
Ladies and gentlemen, an exotic
combination for a new

210
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,629
generation.

211
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,131
-Well, J.P., I'm surprised.

212
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,599
It's actually edible.

213
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,669
Here, try my burger Italiano
with cheese, tomato sauce, and

214
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,172
lots of fresh chopped
mushrooms.

215
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,041
-Tastes like chicken!

216
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,643
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Are those
supposed to be hamburgers?

217
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,346
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): I think
I saw one move.

218
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,514
-Are you going to take a bite?

219
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,182
-If they don't bite first.

220
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,317
-Mine's the meaty meat burger.

221
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,351
Steak, pork cutlet,
and ground beef.

222
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,353
I was going for volume.

223
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,522
-My deep sea burger has lobster,
scallops, and shrimp.

224
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,360
-And I topped it all
off with sardines

225
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,194
and some peanut butter.

226
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,864
[gagging]

227
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,532
-My special sauce is
made with pureed

228
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,334
squid and white chocolate.

229
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,668
-Disgusting.

230
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,075
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Hm, interesting.

231
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,577
Is this one yours, Tommy?

232
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,945
-Why does it look bad?

233
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,614
-No, we just need a break
after the last ones.

234
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,749
-Or get our stomachs pumped.

235
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,251
-Would you like some
fresh tea?

236
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,452
-Yeah.

237
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,220
-Why don't we all take
a short break.

238
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,722
I'll bring your drinks outside
for you in a minute.

239
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,057
-These smell good, Tommy.

240
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,092
Let's give them a try.

241
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,561
-Hey, Zoe, I'll taste
them too.

242
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,729
-It wasn't really that bad.

243
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,663
TOGETHER: Mine was better.

244
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,931
Huh?

245
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:25,598
-What are you talking
about, Takuya?

246
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,766
Yours was horrible.

247
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,067
-At least mine was edible.

248
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,469
Yours even smells bad.

249
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,805
You just about killed
Bokomon and Neemon.

250
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,306
-Maybe we should have
a rematch, then.

251
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,174
-Fine, anytime.

252
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,341
You'll lose.

253
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,142
-Yeah, right.

254
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,345
In your dreams, botulism boy.

255
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,181
-It was just too
much for them.

256
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,816
-How will we find daddy now?

257
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,456
The three moons are all
together again!

258
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,690
Momma!

259
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,396
The Chamelemon are coming!

260
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,464
-Times up, kiddies.

261
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,232
The master's very hungry.

262
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,469
I hope for your sake, you've
built a better burger.

263
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,870
Ooh, what's this?

264
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,309
Ah.

265
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,677
Delicious, impressive.

266
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,245
The master will be pleased.

267
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,713
-That's great.

268
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,348
So, when does the Burgermon
get to come home?

269
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,182
Wha--

270
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,217
Hey, wait a minute!

271
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,017
What do you think
you're doing?

272
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,420
-Never mind what we're doing.

273
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,555
You're going to be making more
of those hamburgers at the

274
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:23,590
master's mansion.

275
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,528
-Let us go, you big bullies!

276
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,529
-Yeah!

277
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,064
-What do we do?

278
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,699
-We have to follow them.

279
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,400
Tommy needs our help.

280
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,435
-Tea time!

281
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,369
Ah!

282
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,203
Wait!

283
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,304
Where are you going?

284
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,639
My babies!

285
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,441
I can't take much more of this.

286
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,775
Ugh.

287
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,088
-Move it.

288
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,589
-This is as fast
as I ever move.

289
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,257
-Quiet!

290
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,458
-Hey Zoe.

291
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,459
Maybe we should just
spirit evolve.

292
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,027
-No, not yet.

293
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,363
If we follow along, they'll
lead us to the mansion.

294
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,431
For now, we have to just walking
and do what they say,

295
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,266
all right?

296
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:06,866
-Makes sense to me.

297
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,768
Man, you're smart, Zoe.

298
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,769
-It's hopeless.

299
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,704
Now they're prisoners too!

300
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,706
-Then we're gonna have to fight

301
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,874
the Chamelemon ourselves.

302
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,476
Raise your wing if
you're with me.

303
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,710
TOGETHER: Yeah!

304
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,559
[grumbling]

305
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,826
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, not again.

306
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,529
-How can they make such good
food taste so bad.

307
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,498
-It's no wonder they couldn't
find the mansion.

308
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,433
It's pretty well hidden.

309
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,936
-Jeez, and I thought hiding
chocolate bars was though.

310
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,938
-You can't even see it
from the forest.

311
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:45,572
-Hurry up.

312
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,739
The master's waiting.

313
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,445
-Let's get in there and
rescue our daddy.

314
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,214
TOGETHER: Daddy!

315
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,384
-Hm.

316
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,752
-Hm.

317
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,287
-Hm.

318
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,422
-Heh heh heh.

319
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,726
-Whoa!

320
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,329
-Make another batch of those
burgers for the master.

321
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,997
I'll be back later for them.

322
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,098
-What's going on?

323
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,433
-We came to save you.

324
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,434
-Nice job.

325
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,468
Who are you, anyway?

326
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,402
-I'm Tommy.

327
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,570
We met your family
in the village.

328
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:18,805
They asked for help.

329
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,340
-Are they all right?

330
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,641
They're fine, but right now,
we got to concentrate on

331
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,643
getting you out of this
rotten place.

332
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,144
[shouting]

333
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,312
-Oh, my babies.

334
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,313
-Daddy!

335
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,982
-Lookie what I found.

336
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,483
If you want to keep them
safe, you better start

337
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,118
cooking, old man.

338
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,987
-We'll make as many hamburgers
as you want.

339
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,655
Just promise not to hurt them.

340
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,156
-Yeah, you got my word on it.

341
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,892
-Wait! No! Please!

342
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,795
-They're stinking cowards, using
little kids like that.

343
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,230
-This is all my fault.

344
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,066
Even my very best hamburgers
aren't good enough.

345
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,834
-Tommy.

346
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,369
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

347
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,238
I had no idea any of this
was going to happen.

348
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,741
It was because of my plan
that we're stuck here.

349
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,808
-I don't mind at all.

350
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,744
Besides, it was fun
learning to cook.

351
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,245
I even got to chop
my own food.

352
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,048
Back home, I was just a little
kid who was always in the way,

353
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,550
but since I came to this world,
I've been able to do

354
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,552
things I never even
dreamed about.

355
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:10,056
So, let's make some hamburgers
and make a new plan, OK?

356
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,924
-It smells like a
garbage dump.

357
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,559
-Sorry, that was me.

358
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,395
-I'd leave, but I can't walk.

359
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,562
TAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): All done!

360
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,864
-Just in time.

361
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,198
-Presenting, the
blister burger.

362
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,768
The super spicy burger
made with hot

363
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,136
curry, kimchi, and chorizo.

364
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,305
When you eat it, your
whole body burns.

365
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,773
-And the rainbow burger.

366
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,609
Apples, oranges, melon, bananas,
strawberries, and

367
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,743
garlic sauce.

368
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:31,944
Healthy, colorful,
and guaranteed to

369
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,312
flush out the pipes.

370
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,414
-Oh no.

371
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:37,283
-Mm.

372
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,151
Mm.

373
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,952
What an amazing flavor.

374
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,821
It's so simple, yet delicious.

375
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:42,822
What is the secret?

376
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,257
I must know.

377
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,026
Onions soaked in
salad dressing?

378
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,795
Young man, you've created
a masterpiece

379
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,129
better than my own.

380
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,433
You've captured the bliss
of the burger.

381
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,434
Mm.

382
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,768
Mm.

383
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,505
-Good job, Tommy.

384
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,543
-A preeminent patty indeed, but
not quite yet finished.

385
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:07,380
One more little touch and we
will have achieved perfection.

386
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,816
Placed on a sesame seed
bun, this will be

387
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,070
the ultimate burger.

388
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,985
Magnificent.

389
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:12,725
CHAMELEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Time's up.

390
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,487
-We're almost done. Hold your water.

391
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,022
-Hold this.

392
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,324
Apparently you don't care about
the little bird brats.

393
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,358
Take a look.

394
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,332
-My babies.

395
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,333
-Daddy!

396
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,501
-Quiet.

397
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:32,271
Hand over the burgers or
I'm making them desert.

398
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,407
-All you're making
is a big mistake.

399
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,051

-Execute.

Spirit Evolution!

405
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,720
-Ha ha!

406
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,723
Kumamon.

407
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,058
-Kazemon.

408
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,231
-Beetlemon!

409
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,365
-Yeah!

410
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,272
-Back off.

411
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,307
Huh?

412
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:20,246
-Your turn to get a lickin',
lizard boy.

413
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,249
Bye bye.

414
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,618
-Frozen Tundra!

415
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:26,285
Huh?

416
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,620
Where'd he go?

417
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,156
-Look out!

418
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:30,685
-Uh oh.

419
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,075
Where'd they go?

420
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:37,825
How do they do that?

421
00:16:37,992 --> 00:16:39,293
-Now you see me,
now you don't.

422
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:41,162
-This isn't good.

423
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:41,963
Keep your eye on that one.

424
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:43,297
-Ah huh.

425
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:45,833
-Guys, have you forgotten
about the kids?

426
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,834
-Help us!

427
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:47,468
-I didn't.

428
00:16:47,502 --> 00:16:49,470
-Gotcha.

429
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:51,806
-Nice catch.

430
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:53,541
It's no use.

431
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,576
How am I supposed to battle
those boneheads and babysit at

432
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,078
the same time?

433
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:58,546
Little help here.

434
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,580
-Sorry.

435
00:16:59,614 --> 00:17:00,515
-Wait.

436
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:01,048
Maybe you guys can help.

437
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:02,383
-Huh?

438
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:04,719
-The six of you can cover
the whole area.

439
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:07,555
All you have to do is follow the
Chamelemon and let us know

440
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:08,923
when they appear.

441
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,391
You'll be our eyes and ears, and
we'll take in from there.

442
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:12,560
-OK.

443
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:15,062
-Here's one.

444
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:18,466
-Up here.

445
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:21,202
-Down here too.

446
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:23,104
I've had it with these
scaly skunks.

447
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:25,940
Lightning Blitz.

448

-Crystal Breeze!

00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:35,750
-You did it.

451
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:38,452
We don't have to worry about
those big bullies any more!

452
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:42,990
-We couldn't have beat them
without your help.

453
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:44,325
Like you kept telling us.

454
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:47,795
Time's up.

455
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:51,199

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,012
I still have to feed him.

462
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:08,549
I have to finish
that hamburger.

-Where is he?

I'm hungry!

-You better hurry.

466
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,722
I think that big guy's awake.

467
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,724
-I'm almost finished.

468
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,859
-I hate it when I'm right.

469
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,193
-Where's my burger?

470
00:18:19,227 --> 00:18:20,862
I'm wasting away here.

Hey, wait.

Guess not.

00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:29,564
Don't you even care?

497
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:30,665
-No.

498
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:32,833
-Aw, I didn't think so.

499
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,068
-Stop fighting.

500
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:35,469
We brought your hamburger.

501
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,071
-Mm.

502
00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:39,540
-A dab of ketchup on
top and you've got

503
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,643
the ultimate burger.

504
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,377
-Mm.

505
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:44,679
You've done it.

506
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:46,013
I want more.

507
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,081
I want all of them.

508
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:48,583
-They're in the kitchen.

509
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:49,550
Ah!

510
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:50,918
-Let me at 'em.

511
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:52,553
Coming through!

512
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:53,921
-Time to go.

513
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:54,689
-Whoa.

514
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:55,556
-Wait for us.

515
00:19:55,556 --> 00:19:56,190
-Oh, at last.

516
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:58,559
The ultimate hamburger.

517
00:19:58,592 --> 00:19:59,560
Eh.

518
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:01,562
Oh, criminy.

519
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:03,864
Whoa, nappy time.

520
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:05,199
-Bolo Thunder!

521
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:14,308
Nighty night.

522
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:15,443
-Sleep tight.

523
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:16,277
-Thank you!

524
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,778
You saved them.

525
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:18,612
Oh.

526
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:20,114
-Momma.

527
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:22,149
-I don't know how to thank
you for all you've done

528
00:20:22,183 --> 00:20:23,751
for me and my family.

529
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,120
As much as I love a good burger,
I never thought my

530
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:27,655
life would be saved by one.

531
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:28,990
In honor of you, I'm
naming our new

532
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:30,992
creation the Little Tommy.

533
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:32,493
-Hey, where are the guys?

534
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,096
-My hamburger's the best.

535
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:36,964
-Wrong again, dorkus.

536
00:20:36,964 --> 00:20:40,201
-Which one is it, guys?

537
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:41,435
-Eh, I must've dozed off.

538
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:43,771
I had the most delicious
dream.

539
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:47,174
Ah, those three moons are
beautiful tonight.

540
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:51,012
They look so good up there, I
think I'm ready to eat again.

541
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:52,346
Nah, too tired.

542
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,849
Forget about it.

543
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:57,018
NARRATOR: Something tells me
that nap won't last very long.

544
00:20:57,018 --> 00:21:00,388
To see what happens when the
food wears off, tune in to the

545
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:02,857
next Digimon, Digital
Monsters.
