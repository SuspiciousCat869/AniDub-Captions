00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,436
NARRATOR (OFFSCREEN): After
Whamon dropped the gang off on

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,671
Terra Firma, they decided to
take a little vacation at

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,173
Toucanmon Paradise.

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,475
Too bad the bird boys were
rabid Ranamon fans.

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,512
The food and the free beach
gear were just a plot to

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,981
separate the boys from their
D-Tectors, so they could win

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,716
favor with the evil
warrior of water.

8
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,818
When Ranamon showed up,
Zoe was the only

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,219
able to spirit evolve.

10
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,722
Kazemon was holding her
own until Ranamon

11
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,223
found her beast spirit.

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,026
Calmaramon overpowered Kazemon
but couldn't control herself.

13
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,661
Good thing too.

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,664
Without their D-Tectors, the
boys are pretty useless.

15
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,698
THEME SONG: Digimon!

16
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:41,408
Look to the past as we head for
the future to reclaim the

17
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,411
digital world.

18
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:49,750
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,620
by the lessons we've learned.

20
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:57,624
As we work towards
one solution,

21
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,593
through a spirit evolution.

22
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,600
Digimon!

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,969
Forever united as one.

24
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,571
Digimon!

25
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,973
Together the battles are won.

26
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,174
Digimon!

27
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,144
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

28
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,148
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:28,121
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,624
Digimon!

31
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,658
-Toucanmon!

32
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,460
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

33
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,628
Come out already!

34
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,964
Pretty please.

35
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,298
Ugh.

36
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,803
-Ah, who are we kidding?

37
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,971
We couldn't find them
if they came up and

38
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,373
bit us on the nose.

39
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,374
-Huh.

40
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,679
-Get it off!

41
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:53,347
Get it off!

42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,914
Get it off!

43
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,550
-Where could they be?

44
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,752
-Toucanmon!

45
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,554
-They're not in my
pants, Dorkus.

46
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,924
You're going to big trouble
if the egg got cold.

47
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,892
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): You know,
you really are a good mommy.

48
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,727
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN):
Thanks, I--

49
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,230
oh, hush.

50
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,566
-How could we make
such a mistake?

51
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,101
-Us?

52
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:18,105
How could she turn into that?

53
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,273
Our sweet little Ranamon.

54
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,142
TOUCANMON 1 (OFFSCREEN): Sweet,
cute little Ranamon.

55
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:22,909
TOUCANMON 2 (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

56
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,578
[sigh]

57
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,079
TOUCANMON 2 (OFFSCREEN): We
nabbed those D-Tectors, and

58
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,447
how do we get paid back?

59
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,815
Hugs? Kisses?

60
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:29,783
Invites to slumber parties?

61
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,287
No.

62
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,257
She pays us back by turning
into that hideous thing.

63
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,793
[groans]

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,262
-So what should we
do with these?

65
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,631
TOUCANMON 2 (OFFSCREEN):
Let them rot.

66
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,701
Even if Ranamon would give us a
date for the them, who would

67
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,002
want to date that?

68
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,338
-She's probably out there
laughing at all of us.

69
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,006
-I hate these things.

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,541
-And I hate Ranamon.

71
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,876
-And I hate everything.

72
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,486
-I think my beak's broke.

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,988
-What were you doing?

74
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,022
-I had an idea.

75
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,724
-Not again.

76
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,826
-Ranamon has lots
of other fans.

77
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,528
We can sell these.

78
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,529
-Good Idea.

79
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,096
-Yeah.

80
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:16,863
Lets go.

81
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,200
-(AS A GROUP) Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

82
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,601
TOKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
It's no use.

83
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,503
We'll never find 'em.

84
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,573
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): JP, how's
your, um, you know?

85
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,743
-I don't want to
talk about it.

86
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,612
-Let's just take a break
for a while.

87
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,414
-Ho.

88
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,583
-Hey, don't worry about it.

89
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,251
I'll bet you find your
D-Tector real soon.

90
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,086
-Huh.

91
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,287
What were you saying, Z?

92
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,090
-JP, weren't you thinking
about your D-Tector?

93
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,595
-Oh, uh, well, I was wondering
if you'd be like that.

94
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,596
-Huh?

95
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,597
Be like what?

96
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,635
-Like Calmaramon.

97
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,169
-Calmaramon!

98
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,737
Where?

99
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,740
-I was just wondering if you'd
be scary like that.

100
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,476
You know like when you
got your beast

101
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,512
spirit and all that.

102
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,613
-(GROUP) Huh.

103
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,783
[screaming]

104
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,151
-Stop that!

105
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,986
I can't believe you guys would
think something like that.

106
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,621
I'm nothing like her.

107
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,489
-Of course.

108
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:19,126
-Hey, say that like
you mean it.

109
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,661
-He's not saying you're evil or
anything, just that beast

110
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,163
spirits are hard to control.

111
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,665
-Yes, remember what happened
with Takuya?

112
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,034
-I'll always be a cool and
beautiful girl Digimon.

113
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:28,802
That I know.

114
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:32,973
-But how?

115
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,375
-Cause I'm a girl, and girls
know how to handle power when

116
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,744
they need to.

117
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,912
-Scary.

118
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,913
-Knock it off.

119
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,748
Having power does not
make you scary!

120
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,018
-Geez. You sure?

121
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,420
Hey, it's the Toucanmon.

122
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,555
-Where are they going?

123
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:52,893
-What's the matter?

124
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,394
-We're exhausted.

125
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,462
-You weaklings.

126
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,397
How can you be tired already?

127
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,232
We just took off for
Pete's sake.

128
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,467
Bunch of lame birdbrains.

129
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,202
-Don't be so quick to
point feathers.

130
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,604
You're breathing heavy too.

131
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,940
-I'm just copying you guys,
so you don't feel so bad.

132
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,441
I could keep this flapping
up all day.

133
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,748
But since you're tired,
we'll land.

134
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,749
Oh thank heavens.

135
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,919
I mean you guys are
lucky it's close.

136
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,420
Now stay close.

137
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,322
I don't want to have to go
looking all over the island

138
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,590
for you guys after we land.

139
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,926
Why am I still talking?

140
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,626
-Look.

141
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,961
They're landing over there.

142
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,029
-Right.

143
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:29,796
Don't let them get away.

144
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,764
We can swim over.

145
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,299
-I'll race you there.

146
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,501
-Tommy, you guys wait here.

147
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,535
-Takuya?

148
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,675
[giggling]

149
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,009
-What the heck is that?

150
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,477
-That's Gomamon.

151
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,547
-Well, whoever you are let
go of my foot, OK.

152
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,149
-Sorry, but we had
to stop you guys.

153
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:49,649
-Hi.

154
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,984
-Hi.
-Hi.

155
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,885
-Hi

156
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,852
-Hi.
-Hi.

157
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:53,486
-Hi.

158
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,855
-Hi.
-Yeah, hi.

159
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,656
What are these things anyway?

160
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,025
BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): Gomamon are
cute and curious, but if

161
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,528
you get them mad, they won't
hesitate to attack.

162
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,363
Then again, what does
around here?

163
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,698
-How cute?

164
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,220
TOKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
girls are tough.

165
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,673
CALMARAMON (OFFSCREEN): Well,
well, look at me.

166
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,778
I'm the belle of the
beast spirit ball.

167
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:22,449
There's nothing that can stand
in my beautiful way now.

168
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,951
Wait till Mercurymon
gets a load of--

169
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:33,560
oh my, all this beauty
sure is painful.

170
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,929
-Thou art a true powerhouse,
Calmaramon.

171
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,731
'Tis awe inspiring how
thou canst knock

172
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,065
thyself to the ground.

173
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,667
-Can it.

174
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,904
-Yes, thy beast spirit shall
simply go to waste if thou

175
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,972
cannot control it.

176
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,140
Tread carefully.

177
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,308
-Sorry, sugar.

178
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:52,279
I guess my beast spirit
has a mind of its own.

179
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,480
Look.

180
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,180
Don't get your drawers
all in a bunch.

181
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,181
I'm practicing with it.

182
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,516
Soon I'll be unbeatable.

183
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,955
MERCURYMON (OFFSCREEN): Thou
had better master it before

184
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,991
thou destroy us all.

185
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,726
GOMAMON (OFFSCREEN): We wouldn't
be very good friends

186
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,061
if we let you go out there.

187
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,563
The water looks so cuddly
and inviting, but

188
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,399
really it's very dangerous.

189
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,535
-Um, what do you mean by
dangerous exactly?

190
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,970
-Just look.

191
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,205
All that foam by the island is
caused by a whole bunch of

192
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,741
whirlpools.

193
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,709
TOKUYA (OFFSCREEN):
Whirlpools?

194
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,044
GOMAMON (OFFSCREEN):
Don't worry.

195
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,413
We're safe here, but if you get
too close, they'll suck

196
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,049
you in and never spit you out.

197
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,918
And even if you could get past
them, you'd get slammed up

198
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,054
against the cliffs that surround
the only beach you

199
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,556
can land on.

200
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,225
We know all about it, because
we used to live there.

201
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,227
-So is there some kind
of secret way to

202
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,296
get there or something?

203
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,564
-No, I wish there were.

204
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,633
-You can't get home?

205
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,201
-That's right.

206
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,104
Everything used to be
so wonderful here.

207
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,040
Then one day, when we went out
to play and get some food,

208
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,942
there was a big earthquake.

209
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,446
That's when the whirlpools
started.

210
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,283
We were cut off from our island,
and we haven't been

211
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,617
able to get home since.

212
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,653
-I'd be willing to bet that the
earthquake happened when

213
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,822
the destruction of the
digital world began.

214
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,324
Oh, it seems there's no
one Cherubimon's evil

215
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,793
touch hasn't hurt.

216
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,696
-So you're saying there's no
way to get across, huh?

217
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,631
-Maybe we'll be able to find
some kind of flying digimon

218
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,167
who will take us over
to the island.

219
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,836
-Hey, good idea.

220
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:23,703
-Well, of course.

221
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,004
That should totally work.

222
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,506
-Thanks for your
help, you guys.

223
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,674
You really saved our necks.

224
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,042
-No problem.

225
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:34,013
-We better hurry before the
Toucanmon take off again.

226
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,215
-Aw.

227
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,049
-Zoe, what's up?

228
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:36,716
You OK?

229
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,020
[whining]

230
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,155
-Aw.

231
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,725
Why don't you all
come with us?

232
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,994
I mean, don't you want
to go back home.

233
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,362
-Oh, don't worry about us.

234
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,663
We'll be just fine.

235
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,031
-[sigh].

236
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,167
-If we swim close up to the
whirlpools, we can catch a

237
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,336
really good view of our friends
on the other side.

238
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,437
-You bet.

239
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,605
We get along just fine.

240
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,439
-Come on.

241
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,907
-(ALL TOGETHER) Huh!

242
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,243
-Are you trying to tell me
you're not even a little sad,

243
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,912
watching all your friends from
afar, not even being able to

244
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,080
talk to them?

245
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,916
Well, I don't buy it.

246
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,619
Everyone gets sad without
their friends.

247
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,387
-Ugh.

248
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,589
Yeah, we just try to ignore
that, because otherwise we get

249
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,425
all depressed.

250
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,592
-Listen, guys.

251
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,394
I think I have a quick
and simple

252
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,829
solution to your problem.

253
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,165
You're all going to
come with us.

254
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,233
-Although I appreciate the
sentiment, don't you think it

255
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,802
might be a tad dangerous?

256
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:29,803
-Come on, guys.

257
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,570
We have to try.

258
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:34,174
-We can't even help ourselves.

259
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,443
I mean we don't even have
our D-Tectors anymore.

260
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,977
What good are we?

261
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,280
-That's a great excuse if
you want to give up, but

262
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,016
I'm not going to.

263
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,985
Sure, it's tough, but I
believe that we can do

264
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,687
whatever we put our minds to.

265
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,491
Come on, you guys.

266
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,560
Let's get you back to
your friends, OK.

267
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,962
-After that speech, I don't
think we could say no to you

268
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,497
even if we wanted to.

269
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,233
-I hope it works.

270
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,036
If it doesn't, we'll
make it work.

271
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:03,736
-Zoe's right.

272
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,871
We can help each other out.

273
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,739
We'll make it together.

274
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,708
-Even without our D-Tectors,
I guess there's plenty

275
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,177
we can do as a team.

276
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:11,911
-You mean it?

277
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,046
Really?

278
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,381
-I can't swim well, and
I'm afraid of water,

279
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,749
but count me in.

280
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,519
-Hey, finding flying Digimon
is too much work anyway.

281
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,887
-It's decided then--

282
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,754
finally.

283
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,857
-Guys.

284
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,391
-Don't start crying, because
you know Tommy

285
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,626
will just start crying.

286
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,230
-Yeah, and I will
if he doesn't.

287
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,731
-Awesome.

288
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,661
Then let's get to
work, everybody.

289
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,080
-Heave away.

290
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,619
-There.

291
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,087
-(TOGETHER) Heave ho.

292
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,156
Heave ho.

293
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,325
-JP, what you're doing?

294
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,628
-To make a good boat, you
need a good plan.

295
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,962
-So what have you got?

296
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,130
Great, JP.

297
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,798
That should only take a
few years to build.

298
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,100
-Nah.

299
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,102
It's just like building a
model ship, only bigger.

300
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,004
-Yeah, right.

301
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,507
[maniacal laughter]

302
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,342
-Success at last.

303
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:20,346
I have mastered my
beast spirit.

304
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,515
-And only destroyed
half the lair.

305
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,517
-If I can do that to
rocks, think what I

306
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,152
can do to those kids.

307
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,554
-Thou makest a good point.

308
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,689
Now, thou hast best make
good with a broom.

309
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,524
-Hmm.

310
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,428
Slide evolution.

311
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:39,532
Be careful, or you'll find out
up close what I can do, sugar.

312
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,533
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN):
That was hard.

313
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,734
JP (OFFSCREEN): You didn't
do anything.

314
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,836
NEEMON (OFFSCREEN): Oh yeah.

315
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,339
-Here we go.

316
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,575
-Can we not rock the
boat so much?

317
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,580
-I can't believe you built
this without even

318
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,381
looking at my plans.

319
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,883
-This is great.

320
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,619
-Yeah, I'll say.

321
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,254
-But what about my plans?

322
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,255
-(GROUP) JP!

323
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,389
JP (OFFSCREEN): What?

324
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,427
-So much for fun.

325
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,929
-The Gomamon sure weren't
kidding, huh.

326
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,930
TOKUYA (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

-They said it was bad,
not horrible.

328
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,803
-There must be something at the
bottom of the sea that's

329
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:17,904
causing all this.

330
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:22,141
-Well, maybe we can find
it and fix it.

-Hi there, kiddie pies.

334
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,656
-Oh, man!

335
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,491
-Great, now what do we do?

336
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,661
-Well, if y'all have any last
wishes, now would be the

337
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,462
perfect time to make them.

338
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,397
Don't you think?

339
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,565
-Don't do it, Zoe.

340
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,833
Don't you remember?

341
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,134
You were no match for
her last time.

342
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,469
-For Pete's sake.

343
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,371
Am I the only one here with
even a pinch of optimism?

344
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,639
-But Zoe.

345
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,740
-Don't "but Zoe" me.

346
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,708
Just figure out how to
stop the whirlpools,

347
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,709
while I hold her off.

348
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,011
Hope this works.

but I'll take pity on ya

358
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,534

-No.

363
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,818
This can't happen.

364
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,186
I have to protect the others.

365
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,526
This is impossible.

366
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,528
I can breathe.

367
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,830
Huh.

368
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,198
I got hit so hard,
I'm seeing stars.

369

So beautiful.

370
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,578
It's my beast spirit.

-Zoe!

-It can't be.

375
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,091
-What a bother.

376
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,760
And here I thought I'd
get a chance to test

377
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,894
out my beast spirit.

378
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:55,828
It's really not fair.

379
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,096
-You're toast, lady.

380
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,164
-Thanks.

381
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,600
But I already had
my breakfast.

382
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,303
Hey, maybe I could test out
my beast spirit on y'all.

383
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,304
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN):
Takuya, look.

384
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,639
The whirlpool's going away.

385
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,478
-It's what?

386
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,148
Now, how in the world did
that happen, huh?

387
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:22,121
What is going on?

388
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:22,655
-Oh my.

389
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,490
Could it be?

390
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,491
-It could.

391
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,661
-It's Zoe.

392
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,665
-Yes, I'm back, and I brought
a little friend.

-Who is that?

396
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,435
-That is Zephyrmon.

397
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,772
Behold, the legendary
warrior of wind.

398
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,440
-Oh my.

399
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,441
Why?

400
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,375
You're pretty.

401
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,946
Your beast spirit
made you pretty.

402
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,449
Well, of course, it's not like
you're prettier than me.

403
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,917
I mean that's not
even possible.

404
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,286
But just because you are
prettier than me

405
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,287
doesn't mean anything.

406
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,288
You got it.

407
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,156
Do you have adoring
fans all over the

408
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,158
world who worship you?

409
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,793
I don't think so.

410
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,029
-You know something for a
legendary warrior of water,

411
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:40,466
you sure give off a
lot of hot air.

412
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,701
-That does it.

413

You're going down, sugar.

414
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,635

Have your feathers started
molting yet?

419
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:06,684
Wait a minute.

420
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,819
How come you're not molting?

a little respect.

She's amazing.

-Right. That's it.

-Zoe, get away.

-You won't be so pretty when
I get through with you,

00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:03,440
That's what'll happen
to your friends.

441
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,475
Ready, boys?

442
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:12,583
Oh, what's the matter,
little girl?

443
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:13,851
Did I burn you all up?

444
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:20,257
I'm just too good.

445
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,125
-That witch.

446
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,092
-It's awful.

447
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:23,160
We can't do anything.

448
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,331
-Stop it.

449
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:28,265
Let her go, you scum queen.

450
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:29,433
-Yeah, you ugly fish head.

451

-What?

452
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:33,370
What did you say?

00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,805
-You heard him.

454
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,507
If we call her names and
distract her, maybe Zephyrmon

455
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,508
can escape.

456
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:38,709
-OK.

457
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:41,211
Hey, you slimy dateless
wonder.

458

Oh, you are so dead.

462
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,059
-Hurricane gale.

463
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,735
That's for picking
on my friends.

464
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:07,070
-And go tell your friends, there
will be more of that if

465
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,274
they mess with us.

466
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:14,111
-Now, you're going to get it.

467
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:16,046
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): That's
the scariest thing yet.

468
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,214
-Be quiet.

469
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,117
You brats are in for a heaping
helping of pain.

-Ooh.

472
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:27,825
I am going to enjoy this.

473
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:32,896
-I let you off easy this time.

474
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,298
JP (OFFSCREEN): What was that?

475
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:35,465
ZEPHYRMON (OFFSCREEN): I guess
someone can't control her

476
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,800
beast spirit yet.

477
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,136
Now, let's get everybody
back to that island.

BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): And it's
all thanks to you, Zoe.

481
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:48,779
If you didn't have the courage
to stand up to Ranamon, none

482
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,314
of this would be possible.

How were you able to control
your beast spirit so fast?

-Well, just luck, I guess.

-Not because you're a girl.

-Yeah, maybe.

But I won't tell.

I do right now?

00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:09,233
-No, I'm sicker.

495
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:10,200
-Guys.

496
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,168
-Me too.

497
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:13,036
-Knock it off.

498
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:14,371
-We just wanted to
thank you all.

499
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:16,540
If it weren't for you, we would
never have seen our

500
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:17,407
friends again.

501
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:19,209
-You should be thanking Zoe.

502
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,211
-Yeah, she's the one
who did everything.

503
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:23,380
-Aww.

504
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:27,551
You guys helped me more
than you know.

505
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:28,385
-Uh.

506
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:29,620
Cut it out.

507
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:31,054
-Hey, we helped too.

508
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,856
Where's ours, huh?

509
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,692
-OK.

510
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,594
-Hey, did you guys see
the Toucanmon?

511
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:38,428
-They're gone.

512
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:39,930
-Huh.

513
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,532
-They all left for the
autumn leaf fair.

514
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,867
-The what?

515
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:46,603
-It's a trader's market on the
continent north of here.

516
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:47,604
-Then let's go.

517
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:49,907
-But how?

518
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,275
JP (OFFSCREEN): Why is
nothing ever easy?

519
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:53,610
NARRATOR (OFFSCREEN): And it's
a safe bet that it's just

520
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,078
going to get harder, guys.

521
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:57,981

the fair tune in to the next
