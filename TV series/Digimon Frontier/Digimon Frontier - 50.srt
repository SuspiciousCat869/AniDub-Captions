BOKOMON (NARRATING): When we
pulled together to defeat

2
00:00:02,579 --> 00:00:06,249
Lucemon, voila, Susanoomon
made his debut.

3
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:08,919
But the critics, that is
Lucemon, were unimpressed, and

4
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:10,220
tried to shut him down.

5
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:12,255
Just when it looked like our
hero was going to be

6
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:14,791
cancelled, he made a magical
comeback, scanning Lucemon and

7
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:16,459
turning him into a DigiEgg.

8
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:19,429
But that's rotten egg contains
so much evil that Lucemon

9
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:20,764
transformed again.

10
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:23,266
As he headed for Earth, the gang
hot-footed it to catch

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,403
him, but when they did, Lucemon
tried to fire them.

12
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:27,604
Talk about dragon breath.

13
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:29,773
I hope we can take the heat,
because Lucemon's not done

14
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:31,107
with us yet.

00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:49,492
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

by the lessons we've learned.

Through us let your
spirit evolve.

If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

BOKOMON (OFFSCREEN): I hope.

40
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,697
-Couldn't you just say yes?

41
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:02,132
And what do we do
if they're not?

-A strange disturbance has
been reported near the--

-Near where?

00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:12,575
Did he say where?

-Oh, no.

49
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,404
That means he's in the
real world already.

50
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:42,639
All right, I've had enough!

51

-Takuya, wait.

00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:47,210
-Why?

-Don't you remember?

54
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:49,145
Lucemon's invulnerable.

55
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:51,981
-How could I forget?

56
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:53,616
-I'll stop him!

-But we can't just do nothing.

63
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:30,420
-We can't go charging in
like this, either.

64
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:31,788
We'll be destroyed for sure.

65
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:34,257
-So what should we do?

66
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,125
-Why don't you turn
into Susanoomon?

67
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,428
That would solve everything.

68
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:42,465
-You can't just put whip
up a miracle like that.

69

-Yeah, he's right.

70
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,035
We're done.

We're all out of miracles.

72
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:49,539
There's nothing we can
do to stop Lucemon.

Digital World?

What a joke!

00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,320
We got beaten every step of
the way, and now the same

78
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:07,457
thing happens when we try
to save the real world.

79
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,792
Come on, why won't you move?

80
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,794
It's not fair!

00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:15,598
The whole world is gonna
be destroyed.

-Not true.

You did everything
that you could.

It just wasn't meant
to be, I suppose.

You can't blame yourselves.

-Well, I can.

AGUNIMON (OFFSCREEN): I never
thought you were a quitter.

That's right.

93
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,028
When things are at
their worst, you

94
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,362
just have to try harder.

95
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:53,536
See that?

96
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:55,705
Your heart is stronger
than your head.

97
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:58,341
You just have to have faith.

98
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:01,211
So, are you gonna quit?

99
00:05:01,244 --> 00:05:02,779
-Try and make me.

-And you won't be alone.

-That's for sure.

our strength.

-Got that right.

-Working as one.

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,688
-Teamwork.

106
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:12,522
-Believe you can.

00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:13,990
-And you will.

108
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:14,524
-Yeah.

109
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:17,226
I lost heart there.

110
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,830
But good think I didn't
lose my friends.

111
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:24,667
Without them, and without
you, too, I'd be lost.

112
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:27,670
And now, thanks to you
guys, I know just how

113
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:29,038
amazing I can be.

114
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,440
Now, let's save the world.

115
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:32,108
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

116
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:37,413
-Um, excuse me?

117
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,616
Doesn't anyone think it's weird
that the spirits came to

Ow, that hurt.

-I'm so thankful that
we're together.

122

But how are the five of
us going to beat him?

123
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,450
-Did you already forget what
we just talked about?

124

-Besides, there are more than
just the five of you and the

125

remember his weakness.

In this form, he is evil
without consciousness.

strength, bravery, and

cunning to defeat him.

hold our fate.

-And us, too.

Today, we all are going to
write a whole new legend.

00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:13,590
Right?
-Yeah!

-Yeah!

-I told you it would work.

162
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:53,730
-Right, Susanoomon.

163
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:56,132
Now go clobber that evil slug.

about his weakness?

speak before.

than meets the eye.

he might be wrong.

-Why?

-The wormhole that Lucemon
opened to the

00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:31,094
real world is closing.

305

This is a horrible way

Will we ever see you again?

-That is not for me to say.

310
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:43,639
If we are fated to meet
again, we will.

You have to hurry and leave.

Wait, hurry and leave?

Wait!

00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:55,818
I'm going with you!

-Bokomon, no!

318
00:15:57,286 --> 00:16:00,289
You said that Digimon can't
survive in the real world.

319
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,525
And besides, you
can't leave me!

320
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:03,426
-I don't care!

321
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:04,894
I want to go!

322
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:06,396
-Well, I do!

323
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:09,866
If you leave, then who's gonna
snap my waistband?

-Whoa!

325
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:17,373
No, don't go!

326
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,408
Come back!

327
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:23,146
Fret not!

328
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:24,547
I'll write it all down
so we'll never

forget what you did!

I'll make sure everyone knows
the legend of the humans that

saved the Digital World and
became the best friends that a

00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,291
-Aw.

334
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:37,627
-I can't believe we're
going home.

335
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:38,628
-Home.
-Home.

336
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:39,962
-Home.
-Home.

337
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:41,297
-Koji.

338
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,470
Koji, listen to me.

339
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,005
Koichi is still alive.

340
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:50,640
-Are you sure?

341
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,142
-The bond between
us is strong.

342
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,311
Even though we've been
separated, I can sense he's

343
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:55,945
still alive.

344
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:57,480
Go to him, Koji.

345
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,681
Hurry.

346
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,283
-He's alive.

347
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:01,551
Koichi's still alive!

348
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:02,385
-Yeah!

349
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:03,286
-That's great news!

350
00:17:06,322 --> 00:17:08,925
-The disturbance was apparently
the result of a

351
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,326
electrical discharge.

352
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,962
When asked why an electrical
discharge looked like a giant

353
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:15,631
dragon, a city spokesman said,
that's what electrical

354
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:16,933
discharges do.

355
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:23,606
ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN):
Shibuya Station.

356
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:24,640
Shibuya.

357
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:31,047
-Is this--

358
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:34,851
it is.

359
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:36,686
It's Shibuya Station.

360
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:40,189
And it's the same time
and day as we left.

361
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:42,191
Everything is exactly
the same.

362
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:43,226
Huh?

363
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:47,530
Come on.

364
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:48,831
This way!

365
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:57,373
Oh, no.

366
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,708
Koichi.

367
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:06,382
-Too late.

368
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:07,450
We're too late!

369
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,515
My brother!

370
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:17,483
My brother.

371
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:18,984
Is he--

372
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:20,319
where is he?

373
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:24,356
NURSE (OFFSCREEN): I'm not
getting a rhythm, doctor.

374
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:25,658
DOCTOR (OFFSCREEN): All right.

375
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:26,992
Charge to 200.

376
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:28,360
-Charging.

377
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:29,695
-Clear.

378
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:32,231
-Nothing.

379
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:34,500
Still no change, doctor.

380
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,567
-Come on, kid.

381
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:36,635
Fight.

382
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:41,473
-Koichi!

383
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,542
-Huh?

384
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,210
-Huh?

385
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:46,578
-Koichi.

386
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:48,414
Koichi, wake up.

387
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,715
Koichi!

388
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:53,752
You have to come back.

389
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,387
I'm here now.

390
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:56,755
It's OK.

391
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:58,257
It's OK.

392
00:18:58,323 --> 00:19:00,392
Please.

393
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:03,329
-Huh?

394
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:04,329
-Koichi.

395
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:14,073
-K--Koji?

396
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:22,548
I didn't think that
I'd see you.

397
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,349
But you're here.

398
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,923
-What's happening?

399
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:33,759
It's a miracle!

400
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:36,595
[cheering]

401
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,811
-Everything's going
to be OK now.

402
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:53,779
-OK nothing.

403
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,080
Are you kidding me?

404
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:57,449
It's going to be super
awesomely great.

405
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:00,285
Can you believe I actually can't
wait to see my family?

406
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,787
Even my little brother.

407
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:03,455
-Oh, stop spitting, Shinya!

408
00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:05,257
Just blow out the candles.

409
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,160
-I always had trouble making
friends, but now I know I'm

410
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:09,628
gonna have loads of them.

411
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:14,800
Now I know what real friends
look like, thanks to you guys.

412
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,635
-Hey, quit copying me!

413
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:20,172
Well, I'm going to have a
bunch of friends, too.

414
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,775
Mostly because you guys taught
me the importance of caring

415
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,343
about other people.

416
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:26,545
-I won't be alone and
angry anymore.

417
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:29,715
Koichi, my friends and my
family, there's just too much

418
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:31,984
good in my life to stay mad.

419
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:32,484
WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, Koji.

420
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:33,819
Thank you.

421
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:37,022
-Now that I'm happy, I'm going
to help mom be happy.

422
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:39,992
And I"m going to start by making
us a family again.

423
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,193
Mom.

424
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:42,694
-I thought I'd never
see you again.

425
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:45,030
-I am not gonna cry again!

426
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:47,199
Well, unless I stub my
toe or something.

427
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:49,768
But I'm not gonna cry all
the time, because

428
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:52,337
I'm not afraid anymore.

429
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:53,572
TAKUYA (NARRATING): But
even if I spend

430
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:54,740
time with my family.

431
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,175
ZOE AND JP (NARRATING):
Or other friends.

432
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:57,509
KOJI AND KOICHI (NARRATIN):
Or with our family.

433
00:20:57,576 --> 00:20:59,578
TOMMY (NARRATING): Or just
hanging around not crying.

434
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:01,337
TAKUYA (NARRATING): I'll be best
friends with you guys!

435
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:02,838
ALL (NARRATING): Forever!
