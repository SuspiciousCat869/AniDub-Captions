00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,269
NARRATOR: That freak Cherubimon
knew that Duskmon

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,204
was slipping out
of his control.

3
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,874
So the evil dude made Koichi
remember how much his mother

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:09,042
had been hurt by the breakup
of their family.

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:12,212
Duskmon slide evolved to
Velgemon and set off to avenge

6
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,547
his mother by destroying
his brother.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,516
Now that's logic for ya.

8
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,553
Anyway, Takuya showed up just
in time to save Koji but the

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,021
fight was far from over.

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,489
Koji didn't want to fight
Velgemon now that he knew that

11
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,492
Kalichi was his brother, but
Takuya convinced him it was

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,028
the only way to save
his brother's life.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,931
Man, this is one funky
family reunion.

14
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,366
THEME SONG: Digimon!

15
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:42,776
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,078
digital world.

17
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:50,751
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other we live by

18
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,754
the lessons we've learned.

19
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:57,391
As we work towards one solution

20
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,093
through a spirit evolution.

21
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,600
Digimon.

22
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,303
Forever united as one.

23
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,304
Digimon.

24
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,639
Together the battles are won.

25
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,840
Digimon.

26
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:17,177
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,449
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

28
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,519
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

29
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,990
Digimon.

30
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,663
-What have I done?

31
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,899
How could I have let
this happen?

32
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,367
-Um, is it he?

33
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,071
Oh, man.

34
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,706
He's Duskmon?

35
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:46,907
-Huh?

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,407
-I remember.

37
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,009
It's him--

38
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,544
the guy that came after you
on the train to Shibuya.

39
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,012
How could I forget that face?

40
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,714
It looked just like you.

41
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,381
-Wait!

42
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,682
-I was there.

43
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,518
Well, I wasn't exactly myself,
but I was there.

44
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,058
Hm.

45
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,794
-All right, spill it.

46
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:08,862
Is it true?

47
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,397
I have to know.

48
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,065
And I need to hear
it from you.

49
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,233
Are you my brother?

50
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,535
And if you are is our
mother still alive?

51
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,870
Tell me right now!

52
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,774
Hey!

53
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,809
What's the matter with you?

54
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,111
Say something!

55
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,618
-It's all true.

56
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,125
-You need to know Koichi.

57
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,960
You have a brother.

58
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,096
His name is Koji.

59
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,966
-Koji?

60
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,769
That was all my grandma said.

61
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,504
It was all she could tell me.

62
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,376
But I wanted to know more.

63
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,680
I wanted to know who you were,
and why we were separated.

64
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,848
But I had to find
out on my own.

65
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,003
[barking]

66
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,548
-You all right, Koji?

67
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,549
-Yeah.

68
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,283
-Ouch.

69
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,117
That had to hurt.

70
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,919
You OK to walk?

71
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,586
-I'm fine.

72
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,921
Let's go.

73
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:47,060
-I wanted to say something,
but I never could.

74
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,428
I didn't tell anyone.

75
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,931
I was afraid to.

76
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,933
I couldn't talk to
my mom about it.

77
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,734
She had enough problems
to deal with.

78
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,505
-Thank you.

79
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,506
Much better.

80
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,007
So what did you do today?

81
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,343
-Uh, nothing.

82
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,779
Hey, Mom what do you say we go
out there and find you a less

83
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,180
stressful job?

84
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,181
-That's sweet.

85
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,950
What made you say something
like that?

86
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,153
-Well, it seems lousy that they
won't let you off, even

87
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,354
if you're really sick.

88
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,456
-I can't just take off
any time I want.

89
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,624
They need me.

90
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,993
Now, why don't you help
me get dinner ready?

91
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,466
-Poor mom.

92
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,068
-She never complains.

93
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,536
Anyway, it was later that
same day that I

94
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,472
saw you on the train.

95
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,640
-I was right.

96
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,542
You were the same one I
saw trying to get in!

97
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,249
But wait--

98
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,550
you didn't get on that train.

99
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,718
So how did you end
up in the digital

100
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,052
world without a trailmon?

101
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,057
-Actually, I can't remember.

102
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,633
-Koji.

103
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:10,324
It's all like a giant
blur after that.

104
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:13,193
Next thing I know, I'm here.

105
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:16,830
I thought I had died, that this
world was the afterlife,

106
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:20,000
and that I was just some spirit
floating around in it.

107
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:23,337
I didn't know where to
go or what to do.

108
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,773
[laughter]

109
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:27,374
-They had to choose Koji.

110
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,013
Mother!

111
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,920
All alone in a strange world.

112
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:43,257
I felt angry and betrayed.

113
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:45,225
But then I met him.

114
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,560
What do you want?

115
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,896
-I can help you.

116
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:50,731
[gasping]

117
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:52,432
-Who are you?

118
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:55,068
-I am the emancipator
of darkness.

119
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:58,472
Your burden is heavy, Koichi,
but you can turn your pain

120
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,408
into great power with this--

121
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:04,344
the spirit of darkness.

122
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,280
[screams]

123
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:14,822
[evil laughter]

124
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:19,359
[train whistle]

125
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:21,328
-I wish we would just
get there already.

126
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:22,162
-I know.

127
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:23,864
Hey guys, I can see it.

128
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:27,634
It looks like there's a castle
under the rose morning star.

129
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:30,337
-Yeah, Punimon's
waiting there.

130
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,906
-My baby's so perceptive.

131
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,074
-Uh huh.

132
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:35,976
-What's that mean?

133
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,078
-Can't wait.

134
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,813
-Come on, people.

135
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,216
Why don't you lighten up here?

136
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:43,550
-I'm light.

137
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:52,426
-The resemblance between them
is kind of creepy, huh?

138
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,394
-And they look the same.

139
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:56,230
-It's still hard for me to
believe that Duskmon turned

140
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:58,265
out to be Koji's brother.

141
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,100
Hey, he looks so sad.

142
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,869
Maybe you should
say something.

143
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:02,603
-Yeah.

144
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:03,604
But what do I say?

145
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,209
-Oh, I'm so hungry.

146
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:11,411
I've got the grumbly tumbly.

147
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,145
Oh.

148
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:12,913
-Ah, chocolate--

149
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:14,448
the original fast food.

150
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:15,816
Perfect for those in a hurry.

151
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:21,288
-I really feel bad for
Koji and his brother.

152
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,757
Isn't there anything we can
do to help them get along?

153
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,292
-Beats me.
-Good question.

154
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:26,660
-I say leave them alone.

155
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:29,463
-Well that's real
helpful, J.P.

156
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:31,665
-I just think their problem is
a private one and out of

157
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:34,101
respect, we should keep
our noses out of it.

158
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:37,104
They'll eventually work it out
if we just give them time.

159
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:40,374
-Well, out of respect I
need to do something--

160
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:41,642
now.

161
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:45,279
-Hey.

162
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:46,980
-Huh?

163
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:49,683
-I hope I'm not being too nosy
but I just wanted you to know

164
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:50,784
that I'm here if you
want to talk.

165
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:51,852
-Oh, yeah.
Great.

166
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:52,853
He's annoyed.

167
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,187
-Stop it!

168
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:56,323
-And there's one more thing--

169
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:57,691
uh, I'm sorry.

170
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:00,661
-What are brothers
supposed to do?

171
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:01,561
-Huh?

172
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:03,196
-I mean, I really don't know.

173
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,898
I was raised alone.

174
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:07,067
-Well, you just do what comes
naturally, I guess.

175
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:09,202
I have a little brother and
most of the time we can't

176
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:10,370
stand each other.

177
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,039
Let's see.

178
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:13,707
In my case, my brother always
wants to hang around with me

179
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:14,841
and my friends.

180
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:15,609
But I don't let him because
he's just a

181
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:17,110
bratty little pest.

182
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:19,112
And when I do play with him, I
usually end up making him cry.

183
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:20,614
And I can't really help it.

184
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:21,782
The twerp just bugs me.

185
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:23,684
I suppose I really should
work on that.

186
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,252
Oh, but he still likes me.

187
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:26,420
Does that help?

188
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:28,588
-I guess.

189
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:31,058
-Guys, I have a brother, too.

190
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,627
He's in college so we don't
see each other much.

191
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,795
And sometimes he's
kind of mean.

192
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,564
But I guess he's just that
way for my own good--

193
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:40,100
not that it feels good, but
you know what I mean.

194
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,802
-Hey, at least you guys
have siblings.

195
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:43,937
I wish I did.

196
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,239
-I don't know that I'd want the
responsibility of having a

197
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:48,942
little brother or sister to
take care of, unless they

198
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:51,278
turned out just like
me, of course.

199
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:53,580
-Well, I'd love to have a little
brother or sister.

200
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:54,982
-Better get busy.

201
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:58,151
-What exactly are you saying?

202
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,320
-Hey, thanks a lot you guys.

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,655
-No problem.

204
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:02,990
Look, there's no right
way to be a brother.

205
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,825
You have to do it and eventually
you'll find out

206
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:06,360
what works, you know?

207
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:07,661
What do you call it when you
try a bunch of different

208
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:08,795
things?

209
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:10,497
-Oh, are you talking about
trial and error?

210
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:12,532
-That's it, trial and error.

211
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,500
-Right.

212
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,835
Hmm.

213
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:19,339
-Don't worry.

214
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:20,407
It just takes time.

215
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:26,647
-Why don't they hate me?

216
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,915
After everything I did--

217
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:31,485
I tried to destroy them.

218
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,654
I can't even stand
me right now.

[train whistle]

220
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:45,899
-Did you know that light
and dark are brothers?

221
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:47,067
It's true, Koichi.

222
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,603
One can't even live without
the other one.

223
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,605
Darkness isn't a bad thing
unless you choose to

224
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:53,073
make it that way.

225
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:54,541
-You're right.

226
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,410
And I guess you would
know, having been a

227
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,645
great celestial Digimon.

228
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,414
Unless you're just trying
to make me feel better.

229
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,615
Did you really mean that?

230
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:03,150
-Really, silly.

231
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:05,952
-Thanks, Patamon.

232
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:07,454
Something wrong?

00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:09,956
-Yeah, and that something's
coming and it's big and scary!

00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:31,712
-What happened?

00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:32,779
-Cherubimon.

00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:34,781
-He looks mad.

00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:37,717
-Hey, what do you say we kick
it for a while and talk this

242
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:40,187
through, huh?

243
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,788

-Well, he is the big boss.

267
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:42,414
We got to tag team him.

Korikakumon, I think it's time
to break out our combo attack.

-Thanks.

00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:15,647
We'll need more than that
to beat this guy.

Now stay back.

could get a bit messy.

-Well, I'm disappointed.

I expected at least a shred
of challenge today.

And you, how pathetic
losing to them.

Don't!

-I lost when I listened
to you.

You made me fight
my own brother.

-It was your choice.

325
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:18,403
Isn't that what you wanted?

326
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:19,237
-No!

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,405
You lied to me.

You used me.

-You're wrong.

I merely set the stage.

The spirit of darkness
chooses its owner.

332
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:32,784
To be selected, one must possess
a very dark heart.

333
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,820
Otherwise, the spirit's
powers are useless.

I offered it to many before you,
but the spirit rejected

00:15:39,157 --> 00:15:41,426
them one after another.

336
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:44,529
The power of darkness is
your destiny, Koichi.

337
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:45,964
It's where you belong.

338
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:51,002
Accept it and be my
servant once more.

339
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:52,804
You've only tasted
a fraction of the

340
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:54,672
great power of darkness.

341
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:55,974
I'll teach you everything.

342
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:00,845
Time to choose.

343
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:04,349
What's it going to be, Koichi?

344
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,483
-Don't listen to him!

345
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:05,984
He's lying!

346
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:07,352
-No, it's true.

347
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:10,321
My heart was filled with anger
and jealousy and darkness

348
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:12,390
became the only comfort
from my pain.

349
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:18,596
[evil laughter]

350
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,100
-But that's in the past.

351
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,901
I don't want revenge anymore.

352
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,103
I'm done hiding in the dark.

353
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:35,046
I'd rather die than
betray my brother.

354
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,048
-Hm, so be it.

355
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:46,082
Koichi!

356
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:01,097
The spirits of darkness
are changing.

357
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:09,438
A D-Tector!

358
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:11,073
Koichi!

359
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:15,011
I can feel it-- the
power of darkness.

360
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:17,013
But it's different now.

361
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:19,415
It doesn't have to be evil.

362
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:20,583
The pain is gone.

363
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,318
I'm not afraid anymore.

364
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:25,855
-He has discovered the
spirit's true power.

365
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,156
-Yeah.

366
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:40,002
Execute spirit evolution.

367
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:04,560
-I'm having trouble
keeping up here.

368
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:06,595
Didn't he used to be Duskmon?

369
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:07,396
-He used to be.

370
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,065
Now he's a completely new one.

371
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,237
-Impossible!

372
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:18,140
Somehow you've awakened the
true power of darkness.

373
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:23,779
-Shadow meteor.

374
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:30,753
Shadow meteor.

375
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:36,292
Keep it going, Loweemon.

376
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:41,931
-This nightmare's over.

377
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:46,435
-Lightning spear!

378
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,280
-Loweemon slide evolution,
JagerLoweemon.

379
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,555
Prepare to be illuminated.

380
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:10,192
Ebony blast!

381
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:13,195
How does the darkness
taste now?

382
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:22,838
Dark master!

383
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:33,015
[groans]

384
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:34,416
-He did it!

385
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,451
-Sure did.

386
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:36,519
-Wait!

387
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:37,620
Something's wrong.

388
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:39,121
-Huh?

389
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:41,123
-He's dissolving but I don't
see a fractal code .

390
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:46,262
-That wasn't the real Cherubimon
we were fighting.

391
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:48,097
It was like some kind
of projection.

392
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,932
Unfortunately, he's still
very much alive.

393
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:52,401
I can feel him.

394
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:54,937
-If that was just a projection,
I don't think I

395
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:56,939
want to meet the real one.

396
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:58,507
-You have impressed
me, Koichi.

397
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,444
Awakening the true spirit of
darkness is no small feat.

398
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,414
But make no mistake, you'll
never be a match for me.

399
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:07,483
I look forward to meeting
you in person at the

400
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:10,820
Rose Morning Star.

401
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:11,821
-Wait!

402
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:12,955
What are you doing?

403
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:14,156
-I have to face him alone.

404
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:15,624
You guys should just leave.

405
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:16,492
-Sorry, bro.

406
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:18,294
I can't let you do that.

407
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:19,829
The only thing that can
defeat him is the

408
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:21,130
true power of darkness.

409
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,798
You'll only be in the way.

410
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:24,533
-I have to help.

411
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,702
True darkness must depend
on the light.

412
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,304
-Sorry, but I'm going, too.

413
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:30,506
Somebody has to get in there
and save Ophanimon.

414
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:32,141
-I want to go, too.

415
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:34,243
I mean, after all we've been
through, we should help fight

416
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,911
the bully that caused
all of this, right?

417
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:37,479
-Kid's got a point.

418
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,381
And of course, if he goes, I
have to come along, too,

419
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:40,716
because I'm the oldest.

420
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:43,052
Besides, I've got to make sure
he stays out of trouble.

421
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:45,354
-And I have no intention
of going home now.

422
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:49,225
Can't let you boys have all
the fun now, can I?

423
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:51,393
-We're coming and that's final.

424
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:52,928
Yeah!

425
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:56,232
NARRATOR: All for one
and one for-- wait!

426
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:57,900
Are they out of their minds?

427
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:01,570
Let's see if they survive this
one on the next Digimon

428
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,672
Digital Monsters.
