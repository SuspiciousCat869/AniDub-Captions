NARRATOR: After losing a fight
with Grumblemon and tumbling

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,671
down hole like Alice, you'd
think it couldn't get much

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,539
worse, right?

4
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,207
Wrong.

5
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,643
Takuya, Koji, and Tommy fell
into a world of living toys,

6
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,312
where they fought, and fought,
and fought with each other!

7
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,981
And then an overgrown teddy
bear working for the

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,717
ShadowToyAgumon captured
Tommy.

9
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,553
Takuya and Koji Spirit Evolved
and made quick work for the

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,189
bad toys, but when they got to
Tommy, they found him playing

11
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:22,689
with his captor.

12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,358
Oh, well.

13
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,993
At least they all got a free
ride to the Forest Kingdom.

14
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,262
Now all they need to do is find
the rest of the gang.

15
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,764
Yeah, good luck.

16
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,099

18

THEME SONG: We look to the past
as we head for the future

19
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,378
to reclaim the Digital World.

20
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:48,415
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

21
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:53,921
by the lessons we've learned.

22
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,925
As we work towards one solution

23
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:01,895
through a Spirit Evolution.

24
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,263
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

25
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,264
Huh!

26
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,232
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

27
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,233
Digimon!

28
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,835
Forever united as one.

29
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,470
Digimon!

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,173
Together the battles are won.

31
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,474
Digimon!

32
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,443
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

33
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:21,348
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

34
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,118
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

35
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,119
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

36
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,020
Huh!

37
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,021
Ha-ya-moo-ah!

38
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:28,855
Digimon!

39
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,728
-The entrance to the Forest
Kingdom should come up after

40
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,796
this field.

41
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,797
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): Field?

42
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,731
This is more like a jungle.

43
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,399
-To succeed, one must
have faith.

44
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,701
One must stay positive.

45
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:41,568
One must--

46
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,442
JP (OFFSCREEN): Get
off my head.

47
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:43,036
-Hm?

48
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,705
-For a little guy,
you weigh a ton.

49
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,140
-Party pooper.

50
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,909
-Don't worry, Z. I'm sure
we'll find the way.

51
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,077
You want to know why?

52
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,245
-(SIGHING) Why?

53
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,513
-Because we're fighters,
that's why!

54
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,716
We don't give up, and
we never quit.

55
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:56,883
I give up.

56
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:57,851
I quit.

57
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,052
Ugh.

58
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,189
-What happened to that
fighting spirit?

59
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,557
-It got hungry.

60
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,226
-We'll take a break after we
get out of this field, OK?

61
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,895
-If I can make it that far.

62
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:12,799
-Now what?

63
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,469
We don't have time
to horse around.

64
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,103
Here.

65
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,437
-Huh?

66
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,309
Whoa!

67
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,078
What in Pete's name
is that thing?

68
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,581
-Tsunomon, come back
at once, young man.

69
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,117
I've had enough of your
shenanigans for one day!

70
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:30,984
Huh?

71
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,986
Oh, oh!

72
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,789
My goodness gracious, what
a lovely surprise.

73
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,957
You're humans.

74
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,292
-Human beings?

75
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,260
Aw, come on.

76
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,294
Let me go.

77
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,296
I'm never going back to
that nasty school.

78
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,464
-Huh.

79
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,133
I didn't know Digimon
had to go to school.

80
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,201
-That's where they learn the
skills they'll need as

81
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,436
full-grown Digimon.

82
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,837
-What kind of skills
do they learn?

83
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,838
Jumping and eating?

84
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,106
-How exciting.

85
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,675
I've never seen real
live humans before.

86
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,810
I know.

87
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,211
Why don't you come to
the school with us?

88
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,213
I'm sure the children would
love to meet you.

89
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:00,847
-Not me.

90
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,848
I'd rather go home.

91
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,517
I'd rather watch grass grow.

92
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,852
-We'd love to see the school,
but I'm afraid we don't have

93
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,320
time to stop and chat.

94
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,856
You see, we're headed for
the Forest Kingdom.

95
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,427
-This is an important mission,
one that cannot be delayed.

96
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,428
-You know, things to
do, people to see.

97
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,862
You understand.

98
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,032
-Oh, I was hoping you'd join us
for afternoon snack time.

99
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,567
-Afternoon snack time?

100
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,568
Why didn't you say so?

101
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,936
We are there, lady.

102
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,239
-JP, could you not think with
your stomach for once?

103
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,575
Of all the people I could be
stuck with, why'd it have to

104
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,876
be you?

105
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,545
-Because it was written
in the stars?

106
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,579
-Save it.

107
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,620
-That's the Digimon
school over there.

108
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,123
-Huh.

109
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,458
-That's it?

110
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,926
It looks like one of
the houses the

111
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,327
three little pigs built.

112
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,995
I've seen garages bigger
than that.

113
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,097
-JP!

114
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,432
Keep your voice down.

115
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,235
-(SINGING) Welcome, humans, to
our school where we learn and

116
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,636
play all day.

117
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,140
We think our teacher's really
cool, so we hope

118
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,975
you'll want to stay.

119
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,979
Welcome, humans, to our school
where we learn the Digi-Rule.

120
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,448
Stay and play, that
would be cool!

121
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,453
-You are so cute.

122
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,059
-Huh.

123
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,161
-YukimiBotamon, if I've told
you once, I've told you a

124
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:21,995
thousand times!

125
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,296
Don't ice the visitors.

126
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,998
I am so sorry.

127
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,333
-Oh, it's OK.

128
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,634
-I'm sorry.

129
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,136
-Poor thing.

130
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,303
Did I frighten you?

131
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,071
-Yeah.

132
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,639
Just a little bit.

133
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,040
-Hah.

134
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,575
I was all by myself when
I ran into the humans,

135
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,176
and I wasn't scared.

136
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,878
Not even a little.

137
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,846
-Whatever.

138
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,048
-Show-off.

139
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:42,883
-Kids today.

140
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:43,583
So young.

141
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,918
So mean.

142
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,386
But with proper guidance, that's
they'll love school as

143
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,687
much as I did.

144
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,556
-Didn't you get tied
to a flagpole?

145
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,557
-That was a rumor.

146
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,063
-Storytime!

147
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,199
Class, we're in for a
real treat today.

148
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,469
Instead of a regular old story,
our human guests will

149
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,771
tell us all about the wonders
of the human world.

150
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,639
Would you like that?

151
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,606
-Yes, please!

152
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,041
-Yeah!

153
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,077
-Well, perhaps the big blue
human would like to go first?

154
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,280
-Do you mean me?

155
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,648
The name's JP.

156
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,082
-Very well, Professor JP.

157
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,784
The class is yours.

158
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,119
-Professor?

159
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm no professor.

160
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,788
I'm only in the seventh grade.

161
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,290
-Oh, don't be so modest.

162
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,091
Your class awaits, professor.

163
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:25,959
-Professor.

164
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,527
-Professor.

165
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,429
CHILDREN (OFFSCREEN): Professor,
professor!

166
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,463
Yay!

167

JP (OFFSCREEN): (THINKING)
All right.

168
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,837
Just stay calm.

169
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:38,939
How hard can this be?

170
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,874
They're just a bunch
of little kids.

171
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,843
I mean, they're so little, they
don't even have feet.

172
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,978
Here goes nothing.

173
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:53,854
So, uh, the human world has a
lot of cool things, like, um,

174
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,188
pinkies to wipe your
nose with.

175
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,523
If you had those.

176
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,261
And toothpaste that
fights plaque.

177
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,929
Awesome stuff, am I right?

178
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,598
-These kids need leadership.

179
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,533
Children, I am Bokomon.

180
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,069
I am here to talk to all of you
about the responsibilities

181
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,403
of a young Digimon.

182
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,105
One day you will evolve
into a big, strong

183
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,840
Digimon like myself.

184
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,942
You'll join the effort to
restore the Digital World to

185
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,712
its glory, and like the
legendary warriors of yore, we

186
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,213
shall prevail!

187
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,748
Oh?

188
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,716
Hm.

189
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,051
Where did they go?

190
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,387
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

191
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,221
Please--

192
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,389
-So young, so mean.

TOGEMON (OFFSCREEN): Recess!

195
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,568
-That was fun!

196
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,803
-Let's go again!

197
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,172
-So tell me, what do you
guys want to play now?

198
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,474
-Digi-Wrestling,
Digi-Wrestling,

199
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,475
Digi-Wrestling, yeah!

200
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,776
-That sounds great!

201
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,815
-Galactica Manum Tail!

202
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,155
-Oh, you got me that time.

203
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,664
-Hey, buddy.

204
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:11,898
Tsunomon, what are you doing?

205
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,702
Why don't you come over
and hang with us?

206
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,038
CHILDREN (OFFSCREEN): Not him!

207
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:18,872
-Hey, guys.

208
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,974
Where are you off to?

209
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,375
-Fine.

210
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,044
I didn't really want to play
with those losers, anyway.

211
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,045
Digi-Wrestling is lame.

212
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,717
-I just don't get it.

213
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,918
-Way to go, JP.

214
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,253
-What?

215
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,521
We were having fun.

216
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,222
I didn't want him to
feel left out.

217
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,924
-Not everyone wants to
be part of the fun!

218
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,731
-So, what's gotten into you?

219
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,866
TOGEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Time for P.E.

and which are the kids.

00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,277
-I'm open.

223
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,114
Pass it here, Kapurimon.

224
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,483
Aw, hey.

225
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:08,121
-Atomic Bomber Tail!

226
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,290
-Whoa!

227
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,624
-Ha ha!

228
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,529
What did you do that for?

230
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,433
-Whoa.

231
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:24,204
-Kapurimon, are you OK?

232
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,439
-But I'm the one who got hit.

233
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,007
-Poor Tsunomon.

234
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,976
I don't get why the other kids
won't play with him.

235
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,812
-They all probably think he
doesn't fit in with them.

236
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,647
I know just how he feels.

237
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,982
-You?

238
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,550
I would have guessed you were
the most popular girl in

239
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:38,551
school, Zoe.

240
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,820
ZOE (OFFSCREEN):
You'd be wrong.

241
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,855
-Hey, Zoe.

242
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,324
You wanna come to the
bathroom with me?

243
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,492
-I don't need to.

244
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,194
You can go by yourself,
can't you?

245
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,330
-Yeah, I guess I could go.

246
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,366
-These dolls are so
totally cute!

247
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,200
-Hey, Zoe.

248
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,602
You should get one, too.

249
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,237
We're both gonna buy one.

250
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,004
-I don't think so.

251
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,407
It's not really my thing.

252
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,210
-What a snob.

253
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,413
-I guess everyone thought
I was uppity

254
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,048
because I lived abroad.

255
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,883
-Well, where did you live?

256
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,084
-Italy.

257
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,386
My family lived there since
I was a little girl.

258
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,621
We moved to Japan a year ago.

259
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,422
-Wow, Italy, huh?

260
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,290
That sounds pretty cool.

261
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,892
-Tell that to my classmates.

262
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,428
They just want me to
act like them.

263
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,929
-Well, then act like them.

264
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,731
It can't hurt if it helps
you make friends, right?

265
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,433
-JP, I won't pretend
to be someone I'm

266
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,402
not just to be popular.

267
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,804
-Yeah, I guess that
would hurt.

268
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,140
-Still, no one likes
to feel lonely.

269
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,508
-Snack-time!

270
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,310
All right now, everyone.

271
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,978
You know the drill.

272
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,947
Open wide!

273
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,282
-Ahh!

274
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,452
-Here they come.

275
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,187
-Does that include us, too?

276
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,488
-I guess.

277
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,126
-Togemon Jab!

278
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,394
-Yum!

-Huh?

00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,537
-Hey, come on.

281

Chin up there, little guy.

282
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,374
I'll bet I have just the
thing to cheer you up.

283
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,843
Everybody, listen up.

284
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,911
-Huh?

285
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,247
-I have a bar of chocolate here
for anyone who will play

286
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,881
with Tsunomon.

287
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,716
-You doofus!

288
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,518
You can't just bribe
kids like that.

289
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,519
-Why not?

290
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,520
I mean, what's the big deal?

291
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,222
-Because, you just can't!

292
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,690
-Thanks a lot.

293
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,391
Now I'm the freak that those
guys won't play with even if

294
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,726
you pay them.

295
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,197
-We wouldn't play with
Tsunomon, anyway.

296
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,298
He's not like us.

297
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,533
-Got that right.

298
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,868
-Mm-hm.

299
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,607
-Children, how could you?

300
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,977
-That poor little guy.

301
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,111
-Mm-hm.

302
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:45,945
-Man.

303
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:46,913
Now what have I done?

304
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,221
-Tsunomon!

305
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,556
Come back!

306
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,458
Just hear us out!

307
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,394
-Or at least slow down!

308
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,197
Come on, buddy!

309
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,199
-Tsunomon, please!

310
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,001
-I just want to be left alone!

311
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,202
Leave me alone!

312
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,404
-Your plan to get him friends
totally backfired.

313
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,207
Nice going.

314
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,342
Tsunomon!

315
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,076
-Aw, come on, kid.

316
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,545
Let me make it up to ya.

00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:20,914
-It's Tsunomon!

319

-Yeah, he's over there!

320
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,050
-I can't get out!

321
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,385
Help me!

00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,186
-Tsunomon!

323
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,555
-I'm coming!

324
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:32,525
-What are you gonna do?

00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,096
-Hold on!

327
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,464
Just a little more.

328
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,799
I've almost got you.

329
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,105
-'Atta way, Zoe!

330
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,106
What do I do now?

331
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,620
Huh?

332
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,329
-OK, boys.

333
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,598
No peeking.

334
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,433
-Wow, I didn't know you
could Digivolve.

335
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,001
-I sure wish I couldn't.

336
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,303
It's been nothing but a royal
pain in the neck.

337
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,304
-Aw, come on.

338
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,173
You don't really mean that.

339
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,507
-Yes I do.

340
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,346
-What should we do?

341
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,214
-I don't think I can reach it.

342
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,182
-Hey, guys.

343
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:29,716
Don't worry.

344
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,017
I can get it down.

345
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,857
-Whoa!

346
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,758
-Check it out.

347
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,525
I can Digivolve.

348
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,893
Is this cool, or what?

349
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,332
There, piece of cake.

350
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,667
Huh?

351
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,204
What's wrong?

352
00:12:54,073 --> 00:13:00,079
So I Digivolved to help them get
their ball back, but all

353
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,547
they saw as a big,
freaky monster.

354
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,750
Now they won't even play with
me because they're afraid.

355
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,654
ZOE (OFFSCREEN): I
wasn't afraid.

356
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,922
I don't know what would have
happened if you hadn't

357
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,492
Digivolved and pulled
me out of the water.

358
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,227
You saved my life.

359
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,996
Thanks, Tsunomon.

360
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,899
-Now, what do you say we
get back to the others?

361
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,501
-Yeah, maybe there will
be more snacks.

362
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,469
[thunder rolling]

363
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,804
Uh-oh.

364
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:30,943
-Oh, perfect.

365
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,845
And I just got my
clothes all dry.

366
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,649
Are you kidding?

367
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,817
You use electric attacks
all the time.

368
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,453
You can't be afraid
of lightning.

369
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,788
-I'm different when
I'm a Digimon.

370
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,791
Haven't you figured
that out yet?

371
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,658
Ah!

372
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,226
-Really, JP.

373
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,195
Just when I thought you couldn't
get anymore quirky.

374
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,396
-This isn't good.

375
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,698
-Huh?

376
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,300
-I gotta get back to school.

377
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,234
-Tsunomon?

378
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,670
Hey, what's the big hurry?

379
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,172
The water's so high.

380
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,207
-No kidding.

381
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,843
-Miss Togemon said when it
rained this hard before, the

382
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,545
water overflowed and
flooded the school.

383
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,413
If it keeps up, they'll
all be washed away.

384
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,415
-Washed away?

385
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,417
JP, we've got to do something.

386
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,219
-We have to Spirit Evolve.

387
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,454
-Huh?

388
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,889
-We'll get to them
faster if we fly.

389
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,725
Then we can use our combined
strength to try to save the

390
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,427
school from the floodwaters.

391
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,764
-Good thinking, JP.

392
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,965
Mm-hm.

393
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,609
-Execute!

394
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,944
Spirit Evolution!

395
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,196
-Beetlemon!

396
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,147
-Kazemon!

397
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,350
-You Digivolved.

398
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,518
Awesome.

399
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,587
-Oh, I wish I knew that Tsunomon
was all right.

400
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,189
-Well, if my eyes don't
deceive me,

401
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,590
they're coming back.

402
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,260
And they've brought Tsunomon
with them.

403
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,327
-Oh!

404
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,737
-Oh, my.

405
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,039
I didn't know humans
could Digivolve.

406
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,040
-Uh, hello?

407
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,275
A little help?

408
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,486
-Here you go, kid.

409
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,188
-Thanks a lot, Beetlemon.

410
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,690
-We'll have to divert the water
with something big, like

411
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,159
one of those rocks.

412
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,495
If we work together, we should
be able to save the school.

413
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,899
-Why JP, you're pretty brave
when you want to be.

414
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,200
-Uh, thanks.

415
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,107
-Let's move it!

416
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,742
-I summon the power
of Thunder Fist!

417
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,597
All right, let's rock.

418
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,234
-I can't believe that JP and
Beetlemon are the same person.

419
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:46,738
He was scared before, and now
he's not afraid of anything.

420
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,840
-Now tell me, where would
you like this?

421
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,642
-How about a little
to the left?

422
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,977
-You've got it.

423
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,249
Hey, Z, a little help?

424
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,284
-At your service.

425
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,319
Hurricane Wave!

426
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,159
-They did it!

427
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,527
-Excellent work.

428
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,528
-Whoa!

429
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,529
-Kapurimon!

430
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,530
No!

431
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,532
[screaming]

432
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,833
-Help!

433
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,804
-Kapurimon!

434
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,172
Please, just hang on, dear!

435
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,174
I'm coming!

436
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,809
-Togemon, don't do it.

437
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,810
You'll be swept away.

438
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:25,544
The current's just too strong.

439
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,814
-But Kapurimon!

440
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,549
BEETLEMON (OFFSCREEN):
Tsunomon! Go get him!

441
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,218
-Huh?

442
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,189
-You're the only one
who can do it!

443
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,190
-I can't.

444
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,191
-You saved me.

445
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,193
You can do the same
for Kapurimon.

446
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,138
-Someone help!

447
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:56,141
-Tsunomon!

448
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:59,111
-You can do it!

449
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,212
-I can't hold on!

450
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,151
-Tsunomon!

451
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,126
-Tsunomon, Digivolve
to Gabumon!

452
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,133
Time for Blue Blaster!

453
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,719
It's OK, Kapurimon.

454
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,689
I'll get you back to
safety in no time.

455
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,690
-Oh, thanks, Tsunomon.

456
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,824
Thanks so much.

457
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,371
-Teach me to Digivolve!

458
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,672
-Gabumon, you were terrific!

459
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,873
-No kidding?

460
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:02,841
-Is that really you, Tsunomon?

461
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:04,609
-You mean I don't scare
you anymore?

462
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,078
-Not a bit.

463
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,080
-You were really awesome.

464
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,016
-We're sorry for being
scared of you.

465
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,918
-Aw, shucks, guys.

466
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,420
-Gabumon?

467
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,790
Thank you for saving me.

468
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,093
I can't wait for the time
I can Digivolve, too.

469
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,729
Hope I'm as cool as you are.

470
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,597
-Kapurimon.

471
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,765
You're making me blush.

472
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,742
-We made this boat for
you in craft class.

473
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,143
We hope it'll help you.

474
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,511
-Thank you, madame.

475
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:42,147
We'll get to the Forest
Kingdom in no time.

476
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,483
-And I won't have
to carry you.

477
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,451
-It was nice meeting
all of you.

478
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,319
-Hey, Tsunomon.

479
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,620
You're not afraid
to Digivolving

480
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,022
anymore, are you, buddy?

481
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,123
-Nope.

482
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,657
I'm gonna keep on Digivolving.

483
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:56,461
One day I'll be as strong as
the legendary warriors.

484
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:01,333
-Actually, Zoe and JP are
two of the legend--

485
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,000
-Bokomon!

486
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,170
-Zip it, would ya?

487
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,139
-Thanks for everything,
you guys.

488
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,507
-It was our pleasure.

489
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,876
-Bye!

490
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,377
-Thanks for the snacks!

491
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,378
-Be careful!

492
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,213
-I'm flying like a
mighty fruit bat.

493
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,883
Ha ha ha!

494
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,584
-This feels great.

495
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,719
-Yeah.

496
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,053
You know, I'm sure glad
those kids changed

497
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,688
their minds about Tsunomon.

498
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,557
-You want to know what else?

499
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,892
-Uh, sure, Zoe.

500
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,728
-I think I've changed my mind
about you a little, too.

501
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,029
-Really?

502
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,364
-Just a little.

503
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,370
-(THINKING) Tsunomon changed
peoples' minds about him by

504
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,404
showing his true colors.

505
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,239
Maybe I could do that.

506
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,207
-Oh.

507
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,110
Look, our comrades
have returned.

508
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,278
-What is that?

509
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,213
-It looks like a boat.

510
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,781
-It's Zoe and the others.

511
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,782
-Good timing.

512
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,954
NARRATOR: So JP redeemed
himself in the

513
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,289
eyes of fair Zoe.

514
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,590
Wonder how long that'll last?

515
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:02,461
Find out on the next Digimon,
Digital Monsters.
