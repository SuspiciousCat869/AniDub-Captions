1
00:00:01,283 --> 00:00:02,584
NARRATOR: Finally, the guys made
it to Forest Terminal.

2
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:04,586
Only no one was there.

3
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:07,089
Down the road at a castle,
they met Sorcermon and

4
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:09,058
Seraphimon, who told everybody
how the legendary warriors

5
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:10,592
came to be.

6
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:13,228
But then Grumblemon and the
other goons attacked.

7
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:15,264
Mercurymon beat Seraphimon
and all that was

8
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:17,399
left him was a Digi-Egg.

9
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,802
Takuya and the others escaped
on a trailmon but Sorcermon

10
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:21,437
stayed behind to fight.

11
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,807
So here they are, left alone
again with nothing but a

12
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:26,275
Digi-Egg to keep them company.

13
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:27,109
And they won't even know what
to do with it until they can

14
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,277
find Ophanimon.

15
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:31,013
Too bad no one knows
where she is.

16
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:32,348
THEME SONG: Digimon!

17
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:40,823
We look to the past as we head
for the future to reclaim the

18
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:43,993
digital world.

19
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:48,631
With faith in ourselves and
trust in each other, we live

20
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,666
by the lessons we've learned.

21
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:56,638
As we work towards
one solution,

22
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:58,340
through a spirit evolution.

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,981
Digimon.

24
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:08,584
Forever united as one.

25
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:10,219
Digimon.

26
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:12,588
Together the battles are won.

27
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:14,223
Digimon.

28
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:17,226
Through us let your
spirit evolve.

29
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:25,034
If we're all for one world,
there's a world for us all.

30
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:28,737
Digimon.

31
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:35,793
-Whoa!

32
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,698
-Hey, bud.

33
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,533
Could you possibly
go any faster?

34
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:43,234
-No problem.

35
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:44,802
Just hang on your bandana.

36
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,137
-Koji!

37
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:47,705
-What?

38
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:50,541
-Whoa!

39
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:54,044
-I was being sarcastic.

40
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:56,881
-Zoe, is everyone
OK back there?

41
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:58,249
-We've all been better.

42
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:00,751
-One way is fun, the other
way we're done.

43
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,019
-Oh, man.

44
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:03,387
There's two of them.

45
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:04,388
-What?

46
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:05,723
-How do tell which
is the right way?

47
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,224
-Don't know.

48
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:10,027
The direction of the trails
is up to the rails.

49
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,562
We're on the right track now.

50
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,204
-Well, at least it's a little
bit smoother in here.

51
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:23,774
[whimpering]

52
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:25,776
-Hm.

53
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,611
May I have a word?

54
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:28,579
I want you to give me
Seraphimon's egg.

55
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:30,414
I'll take care of it now.

56
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:31,782
-Huh?

57
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:33,951
-I'm sorry, but I happen
to know more

58
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:35,252
about its special needs.

59
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:36,453
-Special needs?

60
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:37,922
Like what?

61
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:40,291
-It must be protected and
nurtured by someone with life

62
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,258
experience.

63
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,127
-Have you been a mommy before?

64
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:44,361
-You sure look like one.

65
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:45,629
-Hands off, bub.

66
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:48,199
We must wash our hands before
touching the egg.

67
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:49,333
Honestly, what were
you thinking?

68
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,669
You might get germs on him.

69
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:52,770
Don't worry, baby.

70
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:55,172
Mama will keep you
safe from them.

71
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,807
-Hold on, guys.

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,175
It's getting rough again!

73
00:02:58,175 --> 00:02:59,810
-Mama's got you.

74
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:01,712
Mama's got you.

75
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:03,714
Huh?

76
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:04,848
Hm.

77
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:10,721
This is definitely not
good for the baby.

78
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:13,524
-I always say one good track
deserves another.

79
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,499
End of the line and
all is fine.

80
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:23,734
Happy trails.

81
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:25,836
-Bye.

82
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:27,504
-That's pretty scary.

83
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:29,707
He's got to go backwards
all the way home.

84
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:37,581
-Hey, everybody.

85
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:39,583
There's an opening up ahead.

86
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:40,918
-Let's just hope it
gets us outside.

87
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:41,886
-Yeah.

88
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,087
-Hey--

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,923
Huh?

90
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,157
Aw.

91
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:48,425
-This doesn't look like
outside to me.

92
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:50,427
Does this look like
outside to you?

93
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:51,262
-Well, duh.

94
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,064
It's an underground cavern.

95
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:55,466
-Where's the exit?

96
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:57,901
-Must be one somewhere.

97
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:58,469
-Right.

98
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,137
-Hey, wait for me!

99
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:03,140
If Grumblemon finds us down
here, we'll be in big trouble.

100
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,108
-Let him find us.

101
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:05,676
I'm not afraid of that
stupid runt.

102
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,144
-Wow.

103
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:09,313
Are you trying to impress me
with a show of courage, J.P.?

104
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:10,481
-I'm not trying to
show anything.

105
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,815
Give me a break, will you?

106
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,784
Grumblemon stole your spirit
and I want to get it back.

107
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:14,985
It's as simple as that.

108
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:16,954
-I'm uh--

109
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:18,689
-Maybe we should just turn back
and fight him and get

110
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:20,157
this over with.

111
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:21,992
-Do you really mean that?

112
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:25,629
-Yeah, you better believe it.

113
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:28,198
-Well, it's your funeral.

114
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:29,366
-Can I change my mind?

115
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:34,471
-Which way those brats go now?

116
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:37,541
Why my life have to
be so difficult?

117
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,577
Only matter of time before
me get back beast spirit.

118
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:43,681
Me find them no matter
where they hiding.

119
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:45,382
Where you going?

120
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,051
Me not finished talking,
Arbormon.

121
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:47,885
-Talk is cheap.

122
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:48,919
Come on.

123
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:50,354
Time waits for no mon, right?

124
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:53,057
-Him make no sense but maybe
him know right direction.

125
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:57,394
-Mercurymon?

126
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,530
Anybody in there?

127
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:01,699
You holding out on me, spiky?

128
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:02,700
Hm?

129
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:03,934
So, tell me.

130
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:05,769
What are you going to do the
data you swiped from

131
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,538
Seraphimon?

132
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,106
I mean, you are planning
to give it to

133
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:11,775
Lord Cherubimon, right?

134
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:13,444
-Dost thou not trust me?

135
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:14,078
-Take it easy.

136
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,079
I was just wondering.

137
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:18,949
Come on.

138
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:19,750
What's the big secret.

139
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:21,418
You must be hiding something.

140
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:22,286
-Ah.

141
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:23,287
Alas, poor Grumblemon.

142
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:24,621
-Huh?

143
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:26,757
-He searcheth in vain
for yon children.

144
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,625
-Well, even if he found them,
what would he do?

145
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,028
The brats pilfered his beast
spirit last time.

146
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:32,763
Some warrior.

147
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:33,964
[laughter]

148
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,599
-Hm.

149
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,001
Thou shouldst take care to speak
ill of Grumblemon when

150
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:40,771
thou has yet to find thine
own beast spirit.

151
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:41,772
-Hey.

152
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,208
That was a mean thing
to say to me.

153
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:47,344
-'Tis not mean. 'Tis but the
simple truth, Ranamon.

154
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:50,848
-When I want your truth,
I'll ask for it, sugar.

155
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:52,149
-What fools these mon can be.

156
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,251
-Doesn't seem to be
any give at all.

157
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:01,986
These walls are made
out of solid rock.

158
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,022
-Yeah, this stupid cave
is a dead end.

159
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:05,657
Beans!

160
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,025
-Guess we got to go back.

161
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,560
-That's what I was saying.

162
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:11,496
-I wonder if we passed an exit
somewhere back in the tunnels.

163
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,064
It's worth a try.

164
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,268
-Tommy!

165
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:18,203
-Tommy!

166
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:19,104
-Tommy!

167
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:20,405
-I don't feel so

168
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,573
good, J.P.
-Oh, Jeez.

169
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:23,041
Are you all right, little man?

170
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,375
-Mm hm.

171
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,244
-Hey, how come nobody
yelled out my name?

172
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:27,879
[screams]

173
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:33,418
-Mama mia!

174
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:37,088
-Definitely not good.

175
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:39,390
[roars]

176
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:42,727
-What's Whamon doing
down here?

177
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:44,329
He lives in the ocean.

178
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,663
-Who is Whamon?

179
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,165
-He's a whale, Digimon.

180
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,334
And he seems to be quite
out of his element.

181
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,635
-I can't stand it anymore.

182
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:51,469
Do you hear me?

183
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:52,637
I can't stand it.

184
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,005
-He's ordinarily a
gentle Digimon.

185
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,341
Something really must
be upsetting him.

186
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,475
-I want to go home.

187
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:57,976
I want to go home.

188
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,310
I want to go home.

189
00:06:59,344 --> 00:07:00,945
-We've got to stop him.

190
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,180
-Um, all right.

191
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,448
I'm ready to go when you are.

192
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,361
-Execute spirit evolution.

193
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,353
-Execute spirit evolution.

194
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:02,607
-Lobomon.

195
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,481
-Agunimon.

196
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:11,916
-All right big guy.

197
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,518
Just calm down.

198
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:16,087
Yeah, what is the
matter with you?

199
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,121
-Leave me alone!

200
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:18,289
-More same.

201
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:19,791
Which way this time?

202
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,660
-I say we choose the path
of least resistance.

203
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,662
-Why for you always
make things up?

204
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,531
-Yeah, I'll don't make this
stuff up on purpose.

205
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,666
It just sort of comes
to me, right?

206
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,834
-What?

207
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,503
Now me more confused
than before.

208
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:32,804
Huh?

209
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,543
What that noise?

210
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,811
Oh, the trailmon.

211
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:41,312
Now I see.

212
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:42,380
Brats in cave.

213
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:43,848
But that did end.

214
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,984
Go get them.

215
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,018
[singing]

216
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,525
Me know where you stop.

217
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,262
Me find there no escape.

218
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:59,931
-You seem to be feeling a little
bit better now, Whamon.

219
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:02,500
Can you tell us why
you were so upset?

220
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,270
-Oh, I hate this place.

221
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:09,073
I just want to go back to
my home in the ocean.

222
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:11,576
Until very recently,
I was swimming--

223
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,912
happy and free under the sea.

224
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:16,414
Not a care in the world.

225
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:19,450
Then one day, I saw
these delicious

226
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,418
looking glowing plants.

227
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,654
I couldn't help myself.

228
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,590
I decided to take
a little nibble.

229
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:27,492
Oh, they were good.

230
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:33,064
-Mm hm.

231
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:35,300
This look like good place
eat fractal code.

232
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,135
Me hungry.

233
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:38,503
Seismic sledge.

234
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,149
Tasty.

235
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:57,055
-Whoa.

236
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,056
What--

237
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,392
what's happening to me?

238
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,394
Help me!

239
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:04,729
Whoa.

240
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,241
Next thing I knew, I was stuck
in this place with no way out.

241
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,343
No!

242
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:20,244
-Here we go again.

243
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,880
You don't have to be such
a big cry baby.

244
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,612
-He's sure losing a lot of water.
Is that normal?

245
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,051
-No idea.

246
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:28,186
-This is embarrassing.

247
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:29,520
Does he really think all
that blubbering is

248
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:30,855
going to help him?

249
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:33,624
-Hey, are you OK, J.P.?

250
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:36,294
-I'll be fine once I get
this pain to go away.

251
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:39,630
-And-- and-- and-- it's all my
fault that you guys got hurt.

252
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,799
I'm so sorry.

253
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,967
-You're forgiven, all right?

254
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:46,070
-Well, at least you have
some company now.

255
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,438
We're stuck here, too.

256
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,607
Maybe with your help we can
figure out a way to escape.

257
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,241
-Huh?

258
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,276
OK.

259
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,946
[screams]

260
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:57,815
-What is happening?

261
00:10:57,882 --> 00:10:59,150
-Whamon!

262
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:01,185
-Now that is not normal.

263
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,826
-Grumblemon!

264
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,775
-Nowhere hide now.

265
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:17,676
-Me find you.

266
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,112
Me so glad we see each
other again.

267
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,282
Only this time, me steal
your spirits good.

268
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,583
-You're an annoying
little gnome.

269
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:25,117
You know that?

270
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:25,818
-Yeah.

271
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,252
What he said.

272
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,987
Oh, by the way, you're not
stealing anything from anyone

273
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:30,322
ever again.

274
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:33,158
We're not afraid of you
anymore, Grumblemon.

275
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,960
-Na na na Grumblemon.

276
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:38,297
You will be.

277
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,531
Looking good.

278
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:51,310
You may taken Gigismon spirit,
but me have other powers.

279
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,911
You no can beat me.

280
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,246
Your spirits be mine.

281
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,183
Me first to find you, so
Mercurymon and others no will

282
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,585
have you now.

283
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,586
Me too late for them.

284
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,987
Meet my new friends.

285
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:12,197
Get them!

286
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:16,101
-Let's turn these rocks
into pebbles.

287
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,536
Pyro tornado.

288
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,880
-Lobokendo.

289
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:39,825
-Excuse me, gentlemen.

290
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,994
We could use some assistance
over here.

291
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:42,995
-Be right there.

292
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,129
-We're on the way.

293
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:55,140
-Prevention is always the
best medicine, right?

294
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,941
-Hey!

295
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:57,209
Let go!

296
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:58,377
-No!

297
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,811
You can't fight in
this condition.

298
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:00,813
-She's right.

299
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,314
The best thing we could
do now is hide.

300
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,382
-Hey, good hiding.

301
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,216
You're invisible.

302
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,851
-Over here, brainiac.

303
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,286
-Oh, wow.

304
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:08,453
You're pretty fast, too.

305
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,122
-You meat head.

306
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,524
The only reason I'm hiding is
because I have to protect

307
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:13,392
Seraphimon's egg.

308
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,993
-Mm hm.

309
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,397
-I refuse to just hide
and give up.

310
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,033
-J.P., you're too badly
hurt right now.

311
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,334
Agunimon and Lobomon will
think of something.

312
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,440
We have to trust them.

313
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,671
-Come on, Zoe. Think.

314
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:30,008
If only I could spirit evolve.

315
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,010
-Come here.

316
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:36,348
How about a little dance?

317
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,049
Dance!

318
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,285
Come on, dance.

319
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,019
There.

320
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,288
That's better.

321
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,923
-Stay on ropes, Arbormon.

322
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,925
Keep going.

323
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,894
-These guys are very graceful.

324
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:55,968
-Me can smell spirits.

325
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,270
Hurry up and get for me.

326
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:01,573
-I don't know how long they
can keep this up.

327
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,308
-J.P. what are you doing?

328
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,109
-Tommy--

329
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,277
-Yeah.

330
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,111
-I'm going in.

331
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,279
You watch out for Zoe.

332
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,780
-He's lost it.

333
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,414
-Yeah.

334
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,283
He can't stop them.

335
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,484
-That it biggy boy.

336
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:13,752
Spirit evolve.

337
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:14,353
Fight me!

338
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,421
Or is you too weak?

339
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,256
-He's just egging you on.

340
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:19,491
Get out of there.

341
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,159
-I'm not going to let him win.

342
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,829
I won't stand here and let
Grumblemon hurt my friends.

343
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,497
-I'm with ya.

344
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,865
-Are you sure?

345
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,166
-Uh huh.

346
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,414
-Execute spirit evolution.

347
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:09,274
-Execute spirit evolution.

348
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,827
Oh, Kumamon.

349
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,801
-Beetlemon.

350
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:36,802
-Go Golemon!

351
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,805
-You ready to rock
these blockheads?

352
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,807
-Yup. Let's roll.

353
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:42,808
-Thunder fist.

354
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:47,813
-Crystal breathe.

355
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,221
-I'm tired of playing
with you.

356
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:59,524
I'm going to make you pay
for what you've done.

357
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,193
-You're kidding right?

358
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,194
-Thunder fist.

359
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,228
-Super plume.

360
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,835
-Weak human.

361
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,839
Fighting you I not even
work up sweat.

362
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,842
Arbormon, take care of them
while me get spirit.

363
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,276
-I'm on it Grumble.

364
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,613
But first I gotta change into
something more comfortable.

365
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:25,117
Arbormon slide evolution.

366
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,953
Petaldramon.

367
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,254
-Huh?

368
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,923
-Much better.

369
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:34,259
-Seismic sledge.

370
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,594
-Blasting spout.

371
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,801
-No way!

372
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,436
Whamon.

373
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,438
I can't believe it .

374
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,773
The beast spirit.

375
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,642
Could that be mine?

376
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:56,477
-Hey! No fair.

377
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:57,687
That spirit mine.

378
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:59,689
-Oh, so that's what it was.

379
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:03,696
It did taste a little
gamey for a plant.

380
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:20,530
-You can't have spirit.

381
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:23,399
It's mine, mine, mine, mine.

382
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,434
-Not today.

383
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:26,536
It's my turn to play.

384
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:32,041
-Ow.

385
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,589
-Execute beast spirit
evolution.

MetalKabuterimon.

387
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:09,812
-Oh my.

388
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:11,981
It's the legendary beast
warrior of thunder.

389
00:18:11,981 --> 00:18:13,850
-Molto bene.

390
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:15,285
J.P. turned into him?

391
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:21,157
-Ball of thunder.

392
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:24,160
-Yikes!

393
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,495
Run for your lives!

394
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,306
-Uh oh.

395
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:37,006
He's completely out
of control.

396
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:37,974
Head for cover.

397
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:40,376
-Right behind you.

398
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,645
-Into every life, a little
ice must fall, right?

399
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:48,851
-Don't he hasty now, friend.

400
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:51,387
-You're no friend of
mine, Grumblemon.

401
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:53,389
You don't even understand the
meaning of friendship.

402
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,364
Electron cannon.

403
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:11,574
[screams]

404
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:14,777
-MetalKabuterimon
slide evolution.

405
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:20,316
Beetlemon.

406
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,918
It's back to the egg
for you, pal.

407
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,329
Fractal code digitize.

408
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,856
-Hey, welcome back.

409
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:00,823
[grunts]

410
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:05,728
-J.P. J.P. are you all right?

411
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:07,363
-Got your spirit back.

412
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:09,699
At least I did something
to make you happy.

413
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:11,334
-That's so sweet.

414
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:14,671
Thank you, J.P. I
really mean it.

415
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:16,005
-Happy day.

416
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:16,773
-Friends!

417
00:20:16,806 --> 00:20:19,879
Dim your hearing!

418
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:29,002
-Did we die?

419
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,171
-I don't think so.

420
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:32,672
It smells like something did.

421
00:20:32,705 --> 00:20:34,007
Pee yew.

422
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:36,810
-Whoa.

423
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:37,811
-It's the ocean.

424
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,846
-It's Whamon.

425
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:43,550
-I don't know how you saved
us, but thank you.

426
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,518
-Yeah, and welcome
home, Whamon.

427
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:48,254
-Oh, I'm the one who should
be thanking you.

428
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,090
Without your help, I might
have been stuck

429
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,024
in that cave forever.

430
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,492
Hold on everybody.

431
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,327
We should be reaching the
island very soon.

432
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:55,697
-Uh, island?

433
00:20:55,697 --> 00:20:57,810
NARRATOR: Now that Grumblemon is
out of the way, you'd think

434
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,148
it'd be smooth sailing.

435
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:01,445
But I bet there's another storm
brewing on the next

436
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:03,814
Digimon Digital Monsters.
