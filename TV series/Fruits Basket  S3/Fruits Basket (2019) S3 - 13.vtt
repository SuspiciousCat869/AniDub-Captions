[TOHRU]
Kyo, quick!

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
Look over here.
It's a mini Isuzu!

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:19.185 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Found a pony, huh? It's tiny.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50% align:center
Tiny and cute!

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
Okay, so, which animal
should we go and visit next?

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
Depends--what do you
wanna see most?

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.360 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
That's how we're doing it?

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
All right, then,
elephants, for sure.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:30.780 position:50% align:center
Why are there no giraffes?

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.283 position:50% align:center
Nobody asked you,
wheels three and four.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:35.035 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] What could possibly
be more important

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.369 position:50% align:center
than elephants, you loser?

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.746 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
I wanted giraffes.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.123 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] You should've picked a
better spot for your first date,

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
like an amusement park.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
Someplace more
exciting and-- Ah!

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
Okay, that's enough.
Stop shouting, will you?

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.796 position:50% align:center
I know what the problem is.

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
You think heights
are scary, don't ya?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
(Bleep)-shriveling and
(Bleep)-tightening!

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Are you crazy?!

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.927 position:50% align:center
You can't go around yelling
stuff like that in public!

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.054 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Giraffes.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.305 position:50% align:center
Hey, look at that.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
The sign says we can pet cats.
That sounds like fun.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
Yeah, elephants are cool,
but cats aren't bad.

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.646 position:50% align:center
You do risk showing your panties
when you bend down to pet them,

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
but they're worth it,
aren't they?

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.691 position:50% align:center
I hate them.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.319 position:50% align:center
Um, you guys,
Kyo didn't pick this.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.695 position:50% align:center
I'm actually the one
who asked him

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.655 position:50% align:center
if we could come to the zoo.

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.449 position:50% align:center
Oh. We're not being serious.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center
Just can't pass up the
opportunity to tease him.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:18.620 position:50% align:center
I'm all about the zoo.

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
It's nice and relaxed. Maybe
we can get ice cream later.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:26.086 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA] Giraffe-less places
are perfectly acceptable, too.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.088 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Aww, cats!

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
Damn, but you're adorable.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
They're all so precious.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:32.258 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Huh?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.259 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kyon.

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.219 position:50% align:center
What?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center
Look at that.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.640 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
A black cat. Of course.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:40.684 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
It's like her familiar.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.018 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hm?

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.986 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU giggles]

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.079 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
That day, I watched silently

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.917 position:50% align:center
as Tohru picked up the beads
of the bracelet I'd ripped off.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.378 position:50% align:center
I don't know why she did that.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.631 position:50% align:center
Maybe picking them up was
her way of protecting me,

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.926 position:50% align:center
both my current
and future selves.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
What I do know, is that
loving someone isn't simple.

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:23.893 position:50% align:center
It means embracing their
yesterdays and tomorrows, too.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:27.063 position:50% align:center
Not just loving the person
they are today.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.692 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Whoa, you serious?

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50% align:center
You really applied to
a college that far away?

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.237 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mh-hm.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.156 position:50% align:center
They've got a
program there I like.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
I'll be living on my own.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.284 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're ready?

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.368 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna come for a visit

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.162 position:50% align:center
only to find your
decaying corpse.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hm?

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.998 position:50% align:center
Doing is the best way to learn.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, does Machi
know about this yet?

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50% align:center
She knows. Don't worry.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] My, my, my.
Welcome to adulthood.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
Is it everything you
hoped for and more?

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] If you say that to Machi,
she will definitely punch you.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:02.140 position:50% align:center
So, what did you decide
about college? Will you go?

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm college bound.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.978 position:50% align:center
I wasn't super into
the idea, honestly,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
but then everyone got
on my case about it,

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
and I figured
"Okay, might as well."

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.026 position:50% align:center
--Y'know what I mean?
--[doorbell rings]

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Oh, good.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
I was starting to worry
you wouldn't come.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
You were on the fence,
weren't you?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50% align:center
"Yes, because I would rather
have you all to myself."

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center
No, jerk! I wanted to avoid
you saying stuff like that.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
Welcome to adulthood.
Is it everything you hoped for?

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.962 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I did warn you.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.049 position:50% align:center
We did some serious walking.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
It was quite enjoyable, though.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I had a great time!

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
If you guys don't mind,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna stop by the
restroom before we leave.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
You okay on your own?

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I'll be right back.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
[KYO sighs]

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Man, I'm beat.
What's her secret?

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
She always dresses like that,

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
but I've never seen her
so much as break a sweat.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.114 position:50% align:center
How is that even possible?

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center
Through sheer force of will.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
I told you no reading
my mind, goth girl!

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
Hm? What's up?

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
You're going to take
her away--away from us.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
Yes. I thought as much.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
I knew this day would come
sooner or later, and here it is.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
...it's selfish.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorr-- It's just
that, I need--

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Tell ya what.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
I'll forgive you as soon as
you start calling me "Mama."

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
So, over my dead body, I guess?

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
Hey, we've had our fun.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50% align:center
Why don't we cut the
poor guy some slack?

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Oh, drat.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
"Drat"? Really?

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Hey, Kyon.

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
We do actually like you,
believe it or not.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
Sure, you're dumb,

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
but you're also a good
guy and hard to hate.

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
Still dumb, though.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
Yep. Totally dumb.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.798 position:50% align:center
[KYO sighs]

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Listen.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
Tohru is our people.
Our friend. Our family.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
So, all joking aside,

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
we're counting on you
to take care of her.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Graduation day
was bright and beautiful.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
Everything we
could've asked for.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
The sun shining.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
The breeze gently
tugging at the clouds.

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
The world seemed almost to
be giving us its blessing

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
as we took the next step,
as we left school,

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:34.709 position:50% align:center
and prepared to leave home.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
All done.

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
I think my room is about
as clean as it can be now.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
It's kinda crazy how
empty it looks in here.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.679 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
There's nothing left
in your room, either.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Well, not like I have
much to leave behind.

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center
Plus, we're staying at
Master's tonight, so...

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
So much has happened,

00:05:57.315 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
but I can't help remembering the
first time I entered this room.

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:05.699 position:50% align:center
Yuki and Shigure were so kind,
but I was still nervous.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50% align:center
I had no idea what to expect.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
And then, you crashed
through the roof!

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
Okay. Not exactly my
finest moment, I guess.

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It was pretty surprising.

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
Then I tripped
and fell into you,

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
and all three of
you transformed,

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
which was even more surprising.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
Surprising and strange,
but... also fun.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
They've all been,
these last years.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.601 position:50% align:center
I've enjoyed the days
I spent with all of you.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
Never perfect,
but always precious.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
Like jewels to treasure.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
It's sad, you know?
Saying goodbye to them.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm sad.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.994 position:50% align:center
And maybe I wouldn't have been

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
if I hadn't loved
it here so much.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
I guess the greater the love,
the lonelier the goodbye.

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:05.133 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
You still don't get it, do you?

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
Here's the deal.
Are you listening?

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
Everyone loves you,
more than you realize.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay, I promise.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
This isn't the last
time you'll see them.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
It's the beginning of
a new banquet. Right?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.947 position:50% align:center
--Uh-huh!
--[stomach growls]

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh my gosh! I'm sorry!

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
I don't know why that happened!

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
'Cause you're hungry?

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
You really get embarrassed
about the weirdest things.

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Oh, hey, this is for you.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
It's the key to my new place.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
You can come and visit anytime.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't want you to
think I'm cheating on you

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.925 position:50% align:center
just because I'm at college.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
What? I wouldn't think that.
Honestly, don't be ridiculous.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
'Kay, I lied!

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
Come on, isn't that better?
Us being honest?

00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:01.606 position:50% align:center
You're the worst.
An absolutely terrible person.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
Um, you're not leaving
right away though, are you?

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
We still have some time?

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah. We do.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
The others leave
tomorrow, though.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Does it make you sad?

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hm?

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
Mh-hm. Yeah, of course.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
It makes me sad, too.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
The idea of you leaving.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
You'll be far away. I won't
get to see you very often.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center
Not like I do now.

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
So... I'll catch up.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
I swear. I'll catch up to you.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
I'll wait.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
[RITSU]
Oh, hey, Kagura-<i>chan</i>.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Hm?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
Did you hear that
Shigure decided

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.620 position:50% align:center
to quit being a novelist?

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
Weird, huh?

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
Really? He's retiring?
I didn't know.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
You should've seen
Mitsuru when she told me.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
She was ecstatic about it.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
[MITSURU] It's over!
The evil one has fallen!

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
[RITSU] That's wonderful!
I'm so happy for you!

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
She's finally free.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
Big change. I wonder if he's
quitting to be with Akito.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
Do you think that they'll
end up getting married?

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50% align:center
[RITSU]
Who knows?

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, will you and
Mitsuru tie the knot soon?

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
Wha--?! No! That's impossible!
I'm nowhere near worthy of her!

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
I mean, maybe someday I'll be
able to propose, but now?

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:33.281 position:50% align:center
No way, not happening!

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
Absolutely zero chance
she'd accept if I did!

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
Ugh, jeez, I was just
asking. Whatever.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:41.289 position:50% align:center
I don't get why everyone's so
lovey-dovey lately, anyway.

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
So, tomorrow. It's the
big sendoff, you know.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
You're coming right?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
Of course I'm coming!
But not for stupid Tohru's sake.

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
I'll be there for
my darling Kyo.

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
They're taking a huge step,

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
and we all hope
they'll be happy.

00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
Try again. Not hope.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
They are going to be
happy. End of story.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
[KISA] With everyone moving out,
Shigure's house will be empty.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
What do you think
will happen to it?

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
Is it going to be torn down?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.495 position:50% align:center
No, not yet. It'll be
left as-is for now.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
It will? Good, I'm glad.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
We can't know for sure,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
but hopefully it won't
be empty for too long.

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Mh-hm.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
Whoa, why are you crying?
What's wrong?

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
It-It's nothing,
really, I'm sorry.

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking,
Tohru leaves tomorrow.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I'll see
her off with a smile.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
She deserves that.

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
No, Kisa.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
Cry all you want tomorrow.
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
Because... you love her.

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.825 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Sensei was laughing.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
Apparently, the doc had told him

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
that someone was bound
to punch him in the face,

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.707 position:50% align:center
but he figures he won
because no one ever did.

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
Of course no one did.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.960 position:50% align:center
Though that's only
because we're all

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
more grown-up than him now.

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.965 position:50% align:center
That's right. Very grown-up.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.300 position:50% align:center
Listen, about Kyo.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
If he wants to leave,
that's fine,

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
but how dare he take Tohru!

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
I bet he just wants
her all to himself.

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center
I want to pinch him so
badly for that! Ugh! Jerk!

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
You could always
pinch him tomorrow.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
I wish. I couldn't do
that in front of Tohru.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
But, you know, thanks to him,
I have another dream.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
Better than pinching.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
One of these days, I'll get
my own fabulous sweetheart,

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:43.870 position:50% align:center
and we'll go visit them,
just to show off.

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
So Tohru has to stay happy, too.

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
If she doesn't,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:55.090 position:50% align:center
if she loses her smile or her
spirit, I'll be disappointed.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.592 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I don't get it.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
How can you act like
nothing's happened?

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
Akito hurt you. Both of you.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
Physically, emotionally, she
left you battered and bruised.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
Tohru, too.

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:13.316 position:50% align:center
She scarred us all.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
And I'll...
I'll never forgive her.

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
I can't!

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
Am I wrong to feel that way?

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
The rest of you are
moving past it, but me?

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:31.376 position:50% align:center
No matter what I do, the mess
in my heart doesn't go away.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
Haru, am I letting you down?

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
Whenever I say this stuff,
I worry you'll hate me.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
You could never let me down.

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:43.388 position:50% align:center
And I'll never hate you.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.851 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
They've been through so much.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
They may be moving on, but
they're still scared and hurt,

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
some of them more than others.

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
Yes. It won't be easy,
but they'll overcome it.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
It's almost here. The big day.

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
It is.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
I'm sad, but not worried.
I think they'll be just fine.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.913 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
I feel the same.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
[KUNIMITSU]
Whoa...

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
Yep, tomorrow. That's right.
I'll send your regards.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
'Course I'm sad.
How could I not be?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
But still... happy, too.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
Excited for them, I guess.

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
Journeys, you know?

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.357 position:50% align:center
Hey, are the trees
blooming there?

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Almost.

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
All right.

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
Sounds like it's almost time
for my own journey, then.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
You better be ready to feed me.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.118 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
<i>Tororo </i>soba?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
[MINE]
Aya! Aya!

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
Think we should
send this one, too?

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
It will look so lovely on Tohru!

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
<i>Tres bien</i>, Mine!
Add anything, everything!

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
It's all fair game for our
marvelous care package.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.510 position:50% align:center
They must be glamorously
attired for their new life.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
And who will see to that
if not the two of us?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
Sir, yes, sir!

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
[AYAME chuckles]

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center
[MINE]
But you know,

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
it's not always easy when
a child leaves the nest.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
There's a certain
loneliness to it.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
Fear of what the
future will bring.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Indeed, there is!

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
Which is why we adults make
obnoxious care packages

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.531 position:50% align:center
stuffed with instant ramen,
socks, maid outfits,

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center
everything they could need.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
We send them on their way
with a box full of love!

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center
So wherever they may go,

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
they will carry that
love with them.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
Naturally, for dear Yuki,
we must craft something

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
even more exquisitely
extravagant

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
to express the depth
of our devotion.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:45.385 position:50% align:center
How about this?
It'll look so lovely on him!

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Okinawa? On summer break?

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
I'm in. Let's do it!
Oh, wait, are you joking?

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
Not even a little bit.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
I've never gone
on a real vacation.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
There's so much I haven't seen.
Even just right here in Japan.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
I figure I'll start
in the south--

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
I love this idea!

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
It's so amazingly,
wonderfully not you!

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
Hatori on a southern
island in short sleeves

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.870 position:50% align:center
and beaches and suntan lotion.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.913 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] I'm glad you're
entertained, Mayu.

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.999 position:50% align:center
I'm sitting here trying to
imagine you in a bathing suit,

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:19.294 position:50% align:center
it's absolutely hilarious! Ha!

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
The idea of me in a bathing suit
is actually much worse.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
Why's that?

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just... um...

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:29.763 position:50% align:center
My figure being what it is...

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
Come on, you know
I've got no boobs.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
I'm like a... a pancake.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.187 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
A tall pancake.

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
So glad we established that.
Can we let it go now?

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
And I know I laughed
before, but you can't!

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
All right then, let's get going.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
We can check some
travel agencies.

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
So you're going to the
send-off tomorrow, right?

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
I hope it's a clear day.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Me, too.

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Okay.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
We've finished all our errands.
Time to go relax now, right?

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Nope, time to work.

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
You're no fun at all.

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.308 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] You're going to
the send-off tomorrow,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
so today we need to get
as much done as we can.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] And you really
aren't going to go?

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not.

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
It's okay. I mean...

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:30.407 position:50% align:center
When I feel like seeing her,
I can always go and visit.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
And I suppose that I'll be
dragged along with you

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
on these visits?

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
Always so selfish.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:54.014 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
How's the packing? Are you done?

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Pretty much.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
There's still food left in the
kitchen. Eat it if you want.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Kyo.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
Miss Honda, I want to
talk to her in private.

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
Is that okay?

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
In there.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hey.

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
Do a good job, stupid Cat.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Mind your own
business, stupid Rat.

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hm?

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
Oh, Yuki. Welcome home.

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Thanks. So tomorrow's the day.

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I won't get to hear you
say "welcome home" anymore then,

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
will I?

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
But... even so, I'm happy.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:12.133 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Happy for you,
and for myself, too.

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:15.303 position:50% align:center
The "me" I've become.

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
Before, I was weak.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
I wanted to connect--
to be needed and loved.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
I yearned for it so badly
and for so long,

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
but I didn't know
how to reach out.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:35.281 position:50% align:center
Then one day, out of nowhere,
you came into my life.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
You appeared and made
it all come true.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:45.291 position:50% align:center
Granted my deepest wish,
asking nothing in return.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
You gave me so much.

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
I'm here now, standing
strong, because of you.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
You helped me grow.
Made me a real person.

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
Accepted my weakness and
turned it into strength.

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
You were there. Always.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:13.111 position:50% align:center
Giving me love and shelter,
like a mother.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I did it.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
I finally managed to
tell you how I feel.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center
Heh. It's kind of
embarrassing, I guess.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
--No--
--[YUKI] Honestly, though,

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I think it's the
same for the others.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
Not just me.

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.172 position:50% align:center
You're someone special.

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:36.343 position:50% align:center
Bright and warm.
Selfless and kind.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
And yeah, things are changing.
Our lives will be different.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
We'll have new adventures
in new places.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
But still, we'll think of you.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
"Is she doing well?"
we'll wonder.

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
"I hope she's not
crying or hurt."

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
"Is she happy today?"

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:05.955 position:50% align:center
"Wherever she is, is there
a smile on her face?"

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
We'll carry you with us,
in our thoughts

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
and our hearts--always.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Everyone loves you,
more than you realize.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Thank you.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we met. So glad.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Knowing you changed my life.

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:41.866 position:50% align:center
So thank you. Thank you.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
Thank you... Tohru.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Thank you.
I'll see you again soon.

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A humming]

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.364 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:24.242 position:50% align:center
Not here.

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
Mama! Mama!

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Uh?

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A]
Where're Tohru and Kyo?

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:33.084 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Hey, now!
Where are your manners?

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
Call them "Grandma"
and "Grandpa."

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A]
Huh?

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.548 position:50% align:center
But Tohru said she doesn't mind.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.550 position:50% align:center
It's not bad manners to
call them by their names

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center
if they're okay with it, right?

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
If you're looking
for Grandma and Grandpa,

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
they went out for a walk.

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:49.684 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A]
Aww! They left me behind again!

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] No interrupting
them, understand?

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:54.022 position:50% align:center
This is their time alone
to be lovey-dovey.

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:58.276 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A] Oh, lucky them.
They're always lovey-dovey!

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Together, hand in hand.

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:10.997 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] Have lots of happy
times. And sad times.

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:14.876 position:50% align:center
And everything in between.

00:22:14.918 --> 00:22:19.005 position:50% align:center
That's how I want
you to grow old.
