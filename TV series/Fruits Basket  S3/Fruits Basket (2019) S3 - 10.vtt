00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.973 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] If only it could
have been possible

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
to go through life
without any missteps.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
If only this world...
could have been a kinder one.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
Without anxiety or fear,
where I didn't hurt anyone,

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
and no one hurt me.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.287 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] If only things
had been different.

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:42.167 position:50% align:center
If I'd taken a better path--
a shorter path--

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
to the kinder world
I've been wishing for.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:52.052 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Without any wrong
turns or regrets.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.438 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Yun-Yun, I heard
Honda's in the hospital.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.355 position:50% align:center
That true?

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.816 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hm? How did you know?

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:32.444 position:50% align:center
Somebody in your class
told me about it.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:36.281 position:50% align:center
Plus, I also heard orange hair
dude's been absent for days.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.408 position:50% align:center
He doin' okay?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.618 position:50% align:center
I don't know. Or care.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.245 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Yun-Yun.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center
So, Kimi's been wondering
forever about that Honda girl.

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
What exactly is she to you?

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.962 position:50% align:center
She's his mom.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.465 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Okay, no one
thinks you're funny.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
Yun-Yun! Kakeru's
saying creepy stuff.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:57.469 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Why's that creepy?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.012 position:50% align:center
She protected Yun-Yun
when he was

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
as weak and defenseless
as a baby deer.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:02.849 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Sometimes I hate you.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
Um, so, like, what's that mean?
Is she his girlfriend?

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] No. It's just like
told you, she's his mom.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.359 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Seriously, that does
not make any sense.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Just drop it!

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.781 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO] President, looks like
you have some visitors.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
I don't understand.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50% align:center
Kyon's not at the
creepy writer's house,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50% align:center
and he hasn't shown his
face around here, either.

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
What is going on with him?

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
Good question,
especially since Tohru

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
refuses to say
anything about him.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
Something happened.
I'd like to know what.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.972 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Tohru gave us
the one-minute summary

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
of how she ended up here.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center
Of what happened between
her and Akito Soma.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I'm not sure how much you know,

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
or what she said
happened to her,

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
but it's my fault.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
I'm the reason she got hurt.

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
You might think that,

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
but Tohru doesn't believe that
her fall was anyone's fault.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
Also, um, I heard
about you and Kureno.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] You should know,
he's here, too. As a patient.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:20.135 position:50% align:center
He's here...
because I stabbed him.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.888 position:50% align:center
I shackled him to me,
trampled his will.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
But even so, he won't blame me.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
And now I...

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
You're a woman, aren't you?

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA] According to Kureno,
there was someone in his life

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
he had to stay with.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
Someone who needed him.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
It was you.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:56.838 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Her existence wasn't
what hurt me, not really.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.469 position:50% align:center
It was both simpler and more
complicated than that.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
It was the realization that
I was the outsider here.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
That in the 26 years
of Kureno's life,

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.688 position:50% align:center
I was nothing but a footnote.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
I'd been polishing a
single day's memories

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
like they were some diamond,

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
and it made me feel
a little pathetic.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.700 position:50% align:center
That's what hurt the most.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] I'm surprised.
I didn't think you'd come.

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI
Why not?

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
[KURENO
'Cause... I don't deserve you.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
You spoke with Akito, right?

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:49.349 position:50% align:center
The truth is, there's one last
thing I need to do for her.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
What?

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
I... I need to leave.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
If I stay, she'll never
forgive herself.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Always, up until the very end.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case,
go wherever you want to.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter to me.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
I'll follow anywhere.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
[KURENO gasps]

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
I mean it. Y'know why?

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
If you don't... that's too bad.
I'm not telling you.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
It's fine. I don't mind.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.107 position:50% align:center
If you need time, I can wait.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
But from now on, I'll be
more than just a footnote.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE sighs]

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
A convenience store breakfast?

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
How low we've sunk.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What else could we do?

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.207 position:50% align:center
We're out of rice, bread,
pretty much everything.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
Having Tohru has spoiled us.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
We're even worse at taking
care of ourselves now

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
than we were before she came.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
Good thing she's being released
today, or we might starve.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
Ooh, what should we ask her
to cook this evening?

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
Nothing because we're
not total jerks.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.639 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
And still no Kyo.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
I wonder where he ran off to.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
Welcome home.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
Um, wait, what?

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
Whoopsie. Did I forget
to lock up after us again?

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Hmm.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
Your forgetfulness made
it an easy conquest.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
It was wide open,
so I slid right in.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
How's Honda? Good?

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They're releasing
her this afternoon.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
Great news. I'm glad.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
Rin was impressively
worried about her.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
"Impressively" how?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] She turned blue,
then kind of gray,

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
then a shade of brown.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.175 position:50% align:center
Five stars.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It's not like she's a movie.

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Also, the size of
her boobs definitely increased.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I can't tell if you're
trying to lighten the mood,

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
brag, or sexually harass me.

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
All three?

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.397 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Of course.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50% align:center
--[thud]
--Huh?

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
What do you suppose
that was? Is Kyo back?

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. Maybe that's
why the door was unlocked.

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
Hey, he never went
to visit her, right?

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I get it.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
I get that he has his own
pain and his own reasons.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
But as far as I'm concerned,

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
they don't matter even the
tiniest little bit right now.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
See ya later, then.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Where were you?

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
Not here. Or at the hospital.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
Miss Honda is being
released today.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
Running away?

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Say what you want.

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
Me being here would hurt her.
I can't protect her.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50% align:center
It's better if she has you.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Oh. So that's how it is.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
My poor house.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
This is what comes of
living with two boys.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50% align:center
Hey, can I order pizza?

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?
You can't protect her from what?

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.644 position:50% align:center
You think you should catch her
before she falls off a cliff?

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
Or swoop in and save her
from getting hit by a car?

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that'd be amazing.
But who the hell are you?

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
Do you think you're some
kind of superhero?

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
No. You're just a stupid Cat.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Shut up!

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
I didn't say that and
it's not what I think.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure, I bet somebody
like you could pull that off.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
But if I could be like you,
I already would be!

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
Don't you understand?!

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
I wanted that.

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
To be you!

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Fine.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
Fight all you want to,
I don't care anymore.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
Can I get some nuggets, too?

00:09:58.056 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
[KYO groaning]

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Go to hell. Go to hell.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
Go to hell! Go to hell!

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
Go to hell!

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
So did I!

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50% align:center
That's what I wanted.
To be like you.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
I admired you so
much. And now...

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:21.788 position:50% align:center
You had to go and say it first!
Easily, like it's nothing!

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
Screw you. Screw you!

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
But...

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.841 position:50% align:center
...you're you. I'm me.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
And we can never
be anything more.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
We can only be ourselves.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:46.021 position:50% align:center
We have to accept ourselves...
and face who we are.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
You did protect her!

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.276 position:50% align:center
You protected her
just fine, dumbass!

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
Maybe it doesn't mean much,
making somebody smile.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
And yeah, maybe it's
not like being a hero

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
with special
supernatural powers,

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
but when you're with her...
Miss Honda looks so happy!

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
Do you seriously think
I could do that?

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
Make her smile just
by being there?

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
Cut the crap!

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center
Open your eyes and realize there
are things only you can do!

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
Don't make her cry!
Get your damn act together!

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Why are you just sitting there?

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
The guy you claim to admire
gave you a pep talk,

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.277 position:50% align:center
get out there and do
something about it.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
Stupid Cat.

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.090 position:50% align:center
That idiot. I hate him.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Things only I can do...

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
Before I see her... there's
another stop I need to make.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Try not to worry.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.779 position:50% align:center
Nobody's going to
hate you, Hiro-<i>chan</i>.

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:22.033 position:50% align:center
They'll understand.
I'm sure of it.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to be the
first one you told

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
about your curse breaking.

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
It means a lot.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Kisa.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:36.673 position:50% align:center
This means I'm not a member
of the zodiac anymore.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
Does that bother you?

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center
Hiro-<i>chan</i>, what about you?

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
Being near me,

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
is it hard since I'm still
possessed and you're not?

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
Does it bother you?

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
What? No, it's-- Uh.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Huh?

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center
That's Kyo.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
I heard he hasn't been home
since everything happened.

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
[MAID A]
Um. Excuse me, sir.

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.835 position:50% align:center
Who said you could
let him in here?!

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
[MAID A]
I'm sorry, but he--

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
Why'd you come?
What do you want?

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
You dare to set foot
in this house

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
without so much as a hint
of guilt on your face!

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
Drinking? Isn't it a bit
early in the day for that?

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
I mean, how can you
work if you're--?

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER]
Shut up! What do you know?

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.356 position:50% align:center
I work plenty. Plenty!

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
It's just that, right now,
I'm taking a vacation

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
because I haven't
been feeling well.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
And whose fault is that?

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
I'm sure according
to you it's mine.

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
You're damn right it is!

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
Like her death.
That was your fault, too.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
Admit you killed her!

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center
You won't get away with this

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
just because you didn't
physically hurt her.

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.251 position:50% align:center
You're guilty...

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I feel sick.

00:13:57.212 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
It's as if all these emotions--
hatred and fear and grief--

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
got tossed into a pot
and boiled into a vile stew.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
Get your act together.

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for you, then--

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Yeah, you're right.
It's my fault.

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:20.360 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER laughs]

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center
He admitted it.
He finally admitted it!

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
I heard it with my own ears.
Hey! You did, too, right?

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER]
Call the main family.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
Tell them to come and
get him immediately!

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
[MAID A]
Um, yes, sir.

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
You'll be locked up
for the rest of your life,

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
and it's nothing short
of what you deserve!

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:41.631 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I refuse.

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
I won't go in there. Not ever.

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
I'll live my life
on the outside.

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
I'll choose.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
That's why I came.
To make that clear to you.

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
There's someone that
I want to be with.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
Someone good.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER] No.
What are you talking about?

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:13.246 position:50% align:center
It's ridiculous.
You're unforgivable.

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows
you're unforgivable.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
Somebody like you living
like a normal person?

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I won't let you!

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
Monster! Filth!

00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
Accept your fate and spend
the rest of your days

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
inside a cage like a beast!

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
Atone for your crime!

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
Do you understand the shame
that I've been forced to suffer?

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center
What a complete and utter
wreck my life has become?

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
It would never have
happened if not for you.

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
If not for her giving
birth to a freak!

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center
[KYO] "You're the one who
bore this disgusting child."

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:51.201 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER]
You're a monster.

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
I'll never forgive you,
dammit! Never!

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
"Get out of my sight."

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
Failures! Do you two enjoy
disgracing me, is that it?

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
I never want to see you
again. Either of you!

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Those words...
you said them before.

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
To Mom.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER] Are you trying
to pin your crime on me?

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
It isn't my fault.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
You drove her to depression.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
You! You're the reason
she died; it wasn't me.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center
It wasn't. It wasn't!

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
It isn't my fault!

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER]
It isn't my fault!

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
You're the monster.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
I didn't ask for a
creature like you!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Were you lonely?

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
Was it hard to bear it all
on your own like that?

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
I was too young to understand
what you must have felt.

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:57.225 position:50% align:center
[KYO] I won't claim I would've
realized as I got older.

00:16:57.267 --> 00:17:00.020 position:50% align:center
Maybe I would have. Maybe not.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
But... I'll never know now.

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
We'll never find out...
because you died.

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:14.367 position:50% align:center
I wanted you to live, so badly.

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
I wish you hadn't died.

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
I wish you hadn't given up
and thrown yourself away.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
While you were alive... Mom.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:31.343 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I won't... throw myself away.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
No.

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
I'll try.

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:41.811 position:50% align:center
While I'm still alive,
I'll try... to really live.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
I won't allow this!

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
Let go--

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
Ah! He'll kill me!

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
Someone. Someone, help!

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
He'll kill me! He'll
kill me! He'll kill me!

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A] Pardon me,
but regarding the Cat,

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
shall I have someone go and
fetch him like his father wants?

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:06.002 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I'll go myself.

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
I have something to tell
his father anyway.

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
Kyo is free.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
And I'm destroying that
cottage. Completely.

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.514 position:50% align:center
You're serious?

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Yes.

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A] And you think
his father will accept it?

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
No. But I've made up my mind.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A]
I envy you young people.

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
You can change your whole
way of life so easily.

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
But I can't. Too many
years have passed.

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
I was born and raised here.

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
I don't know any life
outside of this estate.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:46.918 position:50% align:center
It's too late.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
Maybe you can change in the
blink of an eye, but I can't.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
I spent 40, 50, 60 years
building the life

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
that I have now.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.306 position:50% align:center
I simply can't walk
away from it.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
It's too hard. Too frightening.

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
I'm too old to change.
I-I can't do it.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Then don't.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:17.157 position:50% align:center
Stay exactly where you are.
Do what you want.

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
But I'm going. It's past time.

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:26.124 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
What to do and how to do it.

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
The answers are simple.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
So simple,
but difficult as hell.

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
It was hard for me to get them.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
And that's what makes
them so valuable.

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'll visit again.

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
No. Wait! Get back here!

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
Stop! I won't allow this!

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
I'll never, ever forgive you!

00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] If only it could
have been possible

00:19:56.654 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
to go through life
without any missteps.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
But... it's not.

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:12.087 position:50% align:center
We fail, we stumble, we get
lost, we make mistakes.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
The path is there.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
We just have to keep walking
it one step at a time.

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
On our own two feet,
however much we get hurt,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.059 position:50% align:center
we have to move toward
that something,

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
or that someone,
at our destination.

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hello? Machi, what's wrong?

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Um, nothing. Sorry.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
I know this is out of the blue,
but... could we meet?

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
There's something
I wanna give you.

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Where are you right now?

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:58.258 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] Huh? Uh, one station
away from the school.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Wait there! I'm headed your way!

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
Please. Wait for me.

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
I wanna see you!

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Time to say a prayer...
and start walking.

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
But... after what I said...

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
...will she still accept me?

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:24.826 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
And me--do I still love her?

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.619 position:50% align:center
Really love her?

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
What do I love about her?

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
Why do I love her?

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.548 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.592 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
How much do I...?

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Wait. None of that matters.

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
I love her.

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
I love her.

00:21:54.814 --> 00:22:00.362 position:50% align:center
I just... love her so much.

00:22:00.403 --> 00:22:02.030 position:50% align:center
--[KYO] Toh--
--[TOHRU yelps]

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:04.574 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Uhh...

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
She ran like she was trying
out for the track team.

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:09.329 position:50% align:center
Nothin' to do at this
point but laugh.

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:12.248 position:50% align:center
You can't hear, but I'm
laughing on the inside.

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:17.962 position:50% align:center
No. I'm faster than
you are, dammit!

00:22:18.004 --> 00:22:20.674 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I won't let you go.

00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:24.719 position:50% align:center
It's crazy. It's really crazy...

00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:26.596 position:50% align:center
Jeez!

00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:28.390 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't be
sprinting the second

00:22:28.431 --> 00:22:31.226 position:50% align:center
you get out of the hospital!

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.770 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
...how much I want her.

00:23:58.772 --> 00:24:00.357 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
"Goodbye."
