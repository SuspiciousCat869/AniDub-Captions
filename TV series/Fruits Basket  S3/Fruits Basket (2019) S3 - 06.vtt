00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:16.266 align:middle
[HATSUHARU]
Good for you.

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:19.644 align:middle
You made a true friend--
one who really cares about you.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.022 align:middle
You must be so happy.

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:22.856 align:middle
[ISUZU]
Stop crying!

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:23.898 align:middle
Sorry!

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.233 align:middle
[HATSUHARU]
Definitely happy.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.527 align:middle
I can tell from the
way you're blushing.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.822 align:middle
Well, you seem to be unusually
energetic today, Isuzu.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.073 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Master!

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.409 align:middle
[KAZUMA] I suppose that it
must lift your spirits,

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.036 align:middle
a friend visiting.

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.787 align:middle
Oh. Did you say "a friend"?

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.831 align:middle
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.207 align:middle
They get along so well.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:41.875 align:middle
Yeah.

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:45.211 align:middle
Minus the violence, maybe.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:47.964 align:middle
[YUKI] Will she be staying
here to recuperate, then?

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.132 align:middle
[KAZUMA]
For a while.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:52.469 align:middle
She prefers it to the hospital
or the main estate.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle
[YUKI] She was locked up
by Akito, wasn't she?

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.686 align:middle
Rin doesn't want us to
tell Honda what happened.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.313 align:middle
And the thought of
having anything more

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.691 align:middle
to do with Akito frightens her.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.945 align:middle
Me, too. I want them kept apart.

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:12.238 align:middle
[YUKI]
Okay.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.449 align:middle
Awful. Poor girl.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:18.661 align:middle
Can you tell me, Hatsuharu,
where Isuzu was being held?

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.457 align:middle
[HATSUHARU]
The Cat's room.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.626 align:middle
[KAZUMA]
I see.

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:28.588 align:middle
The same cage that's
meant to hold Kyo soon.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.641 align:middle
[KYO] Don't know for sure,
but I get the feeling Master's

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle
gonna let Isuzu
move in with him.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:06.686 align:middle
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:07.604 align:middle
[gasps]

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:08.938 align:middle
You have nothing to worry about!

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.107 align:middle
You're still number one
in Master's book!

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.525 align:middle
He lives for you, Kyo!

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.779 align:middle
I'm not worried about it at all,
so quit sayin' weird stuff.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.738 align:middle
Plus, to be honest,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.699 align:middle
I think her staying there's
actually a good idea.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.201 align:middle
With someone else
around the place,

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.162 align:middle
he's less likely to get lonely.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.914 align:middle
Miss Honda?

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle
What's up?

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.501 align:middle
[YUKI] The anniversary of
your mom's death is this week.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.169 align:middle
Could I come with you
to the gravesite?

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.004 align:middle
Of course. I would love that!

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.799 align:middle
I'm going on Saturday morning
with Uo-<i>chan </i>and Hana-<i>chan</i>.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle
[KYO]
Sorry. I can't go.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:42.639 align:middle
Oh... 'Kay.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
Well, that was a disaster.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.235 align:middle
Not only did your search for
a way to break the curse fail,

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:57.612 align:middle
you wound up in
trouble, as well.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.116 align:middle
You acted recklessly
and paid the price.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.325 align:middle
I talked to Ren.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.577 align:middle
She said that she would tell
me how it could be done.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:05.495 align:middle
She promised.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:08.164 align:middle
Yeah, about that...
she lied to you.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.544 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
Ren has no idea how to break it.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.921 align:middle
Smart money says
she was using you.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.549 align:middle
Another pawn in her
feud with Akito.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.051 align:middle
And you were desperate
enough to fall for it.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.219 align:middle
You're wrong.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.097 align:middle
I don't blame you for being
less than willing to trust me.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.142 align:middle
But I promise, I know Ren
much better than you do.

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:31.896 align:middle
She and I are close,
you see. Very close.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:37.485 align:middle
Rin, the thing is, the zodiac
curse is going to break.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.071 align:middle
On its own, without help.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.073 align:middle
It will break.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.284 align:middle
No need to work yourself
to death over it.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.411 align:middle
Things are already in motion.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:49.539 align:middle
Those ancient ties
have begun to fray.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.292 align:middle
Eventually, all of
us will be free.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:56.379 align:middle
We are the generation invited
to the final banquet.

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.174 align:middle
What? Don't just make stuff up!

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle
[TOHRU] What do you
mean... "eventually"?

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:08.767 align:middle
How long is that?
When will it finally happen?

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:13.772 align:middle
Years from now? Decades?
That's not good enough.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle
It has to be broken
by next spring, or...

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.986 align:middle
Or Kyo will--!

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:25.617 align:middle
Wait, Shigure. All this time...
did you know it would break?

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:29.329 align:middle
You give me too much credit.
I didn't know for sure.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.707 align:middle
I simply had a feeling that
we might be nearing the end.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.502 align:middle
Apparently, this is the first
time the whole zodiac

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.879 align:middle
has been alive at once.

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.006 align:middle
Such a momentous occurrence.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.717 align:middle
The attendants were
positively thrilled.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.637 align:middle
But I came up with
my own theory.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.056 align:middle
It's all about the
banquet, remember.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:51.768 align:middle
What if everyone's attending
because this is the last one?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.105 align:middle
Would you like further proof?
Take a look at good old Kureno.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle
His curse broke without
him even trying.

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:59.359 align:middle
What? So, you mean he--?

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:02.112 align:middle
[SHIGURE] Shall I spell
it out further for you?

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:06.408 align:middle
Very well. Simply put,
Kureno isn't one of us anymore.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.119 align:middle
And his thinking
aligns with mine.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.414 align:middle
He says he also believes
the end is drawing near.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle
One change follows another,
and before you know it,

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.044 align:middle
it all comes tumbling down.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.339 align:middle
Of course, as things stand,
Kyo will still be locked up.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.298 align:middle
[TOHRU gasps]

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.843 align:middle
Oh, yes, Tohru, we know.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.638 align:middle
Every member of the zodiac knows
just what will happen to him.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.725 align:middle
And in the not-too-distant
future, at that.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:36.438 align:middle
But we won't do or say anything.
He'll get no help from us.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.856 align:middle
Why not?

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:42.819 align:middle
Because... he's serving
his purpose as the Cat.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.237 align:middle
[gasps]

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.365 align:middle
We zodiac members are monsters.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.576 align:middle
So, it's a relief to
know there's someone

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:51.703 align:middle
more monstrous out there.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:57.292 align:middle
"Thank God," we think.
"At least I'm not like him."

00:06:57.334 --> 00:07:00.045 align:middle
The Cat is a gift to the
rest of us, you see--

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:04.049 align:middle
an other creature
for us to exclude.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.842 align:middle
You may not have realized,
but Kyo knows--

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.302 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Shigure!

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.849 align:middle
Mad at me?

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:17.562 align:middle
The Cat's burden will end,
too. Sooner or later.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.607 align:middle
It's not that I believe Kureno's
story without question,

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:23.943 align:middle
but it matches what
my gut tells me.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:27.405 align:middle
However, you said "eventually"
isn't good enough.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.532 align:middle
Are you hoping to save him?

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle
Do-Do you love--?

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.162 align:middle
[ISUZU gasps]

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:40.126 align:middle
[ISUZU]
Kyo? Does she really?

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:46.132 align:middle
[ISUZU] What is it that's
most precious to you?

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.259 align:middle
Tell me.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.637 align:middle
[TOHRU]
That question.

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.099 align:middle
I should've said my mom
without even thinking,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle
but I couldn't.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle
What came to mind instead was...

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.524 align:middle
Why? Why?

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:06.778 align:middle
That day... I made a
promise and I meant it.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.113 align:middle
Tohru, dear.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:11.783 align:middle
You ready to go?
Anything else to pack?

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:15.995 align:middle
[TOHRU] It was like...
I could feel her disappearing.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:20.291 align:middle
She'd been there so recently,
bright and alive.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:24.004 align:middle
Looking at me, smiling
that smile of hers,

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.381 align:middle
warm and comforting.

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle
But that, too, was
starting to fade.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:35.098 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER]
Kyoko, dear, it's time to go.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.728 align:middle
[TOHRU] So I swore to myself,
no matter what happened,

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:42.313 align:middle
no matter how much time passed,

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:46.317 align:middle
I would always put
Mom first in my heart.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:49.029 align:middle
I believed as long
as I did that,

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.199 align:middle
I could keep holding
on to all of it.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:57.704 align:middle
My memories of her...
The promise we made....

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.706 align:middle
"Always together."

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:03.543 align:middle
I had to believe,
because if I didn't,

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.587 align:middle
I knew I would collapse.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:09.049 align:middle
And now... she's going again.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.217 align:middle
Someplace far away.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.011 align:middle
It feels so wrong, but...

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.304 align:middle
[KYO]
Tohru?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.143 align:middle
[gasps] What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:26.149 align:middle
[TOHRU] Because I...
I don't know what to do.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.278 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I'm lost!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.948 align:middle
[KYO] Well, in that case...
just don't do anything.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.116 align:middle
[gasps]

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.785 align:middle
[KYO]
Give yourself time.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:40.622 align:middle
Wait until you have to do
something, then act.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:44.918 align:middle
And, uh, well,
it's okay, you know.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.381 align:middle
You can cry.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.552 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I'm sorry.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.555 align:middle
I'm sorry, I know it's selfish,

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle
but I wanna stay here
just a little longer.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.812 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Because eventually I really will

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.939 align:middle
have to do something.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.066 align:middle
And when that time comes,

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:12.445 align:middle
I think... I know
what I'll let go of.

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:20.286 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER]
Oh, my! I know you.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:23.623 align:middle
You're that boy.
I remember your hair!

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.333 align:middle
[KYO]
You're Tohru's--

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.167 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER]
That's right.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:30.964 align:middle
I'm Kyoko's--I mean,
Tohru's grandfather.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:34.217 align:middle
She's been living at your
place for some time now.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:37.554 align:middle
[KYO] I don't mean to be rude,
but why are you sitting here?

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.972 align:middle
It's quite all right.

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:40.765 align:middle
I was walking along,
and wouldn't you know it,

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:41.975 align:middle
I strained my back again.

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:43.935 align:middle
Huh? Are you okay?

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:48.356 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER] I'll be fine.
I'm just waiting for my ride.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:49.774 align:middle
I suppose you came out here

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.861 align:middle
to pay your respects
to Kyoko, as well.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.904 align:middle
Thank you for that.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:59.367 align:middle
Kyoko--I mean, Tohru is
doing well these days, I hope.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.039 align:middle
Hey, um, do you always
call her "Kyoko"?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.708 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER]
Hm? Yes, I do.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.338 align:middle
You don't think that's
a little messed-up?

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.298 align:middle
Yes, perhaps.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.386 align:middle
But you see, I wanted
to keep her alive.

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:21.097 align:middle
There had to be some way
to tie them together.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle
Some sort of reminder
or proof I could offer

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:27.771 align:middle
that Kyoko really had existed,
even if she was gone now.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.523 align:middle
Without that, I feared
Tohru would break

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:34.194 align:middle
in a way that could
never be mended.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.696 align:middle
I'm curious, young man,

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.865 align:middle
do you have any idea
why my granddaughter

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle
talks the way she does?

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:43.995 align:middle
[KYO]
Uh. No, I don't.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.749 align:middle
She's imitating Katsuya.
Uh, that's her father.

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle
Started doing it when she
was still a little girl.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.673 align:middle
It was after his funeral.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:58.468 align:middle
Some nasty relatives
had said nasty things.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.055 align:middle
"She doesn't look a bit
like Katsuya," they said.

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:04.182 align:middle
"Are we even sure
that she's his?"

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:09.354 align:middle
"Such a child won't be of any
comfort at all. What a pity."

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:11.523 align:middle
Young as she was, maybe
they thought they could say

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:15.568 align:middle
whatever they wanted because
she wouldn't understand.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.365 align:middle
How stupid of them.
Children absolutely understand.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:23.159 align:middle
They know contempt
when they hear it.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.579 align:middle
Playing hide-and-seek, Kagura?

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle
Shh! Sensei, please just
pretend I'm not here.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.377 align:middle
I hope I'm not intruding.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.254 align:middle
[KAZUMA]
Not at all. Come on in.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.673 align:middle
I take it you've dropped
by to see Isuzu?

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:40.343 align:middle
Yes, I was on my way home
from visiting my mom's...

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.846 align:middle
You're welcome to head
on up to her room.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.478 align:middle
Well, what's wrong?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.731 align:middle
Are you avoiding her
because you had a fight?

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.817 align:middle
Not a fight. It's more
complicated than that.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.445 align:middle
I don't think I can see
her after everything.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.031 align:middle
I haven't figured out
how to move on.

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.866 align:middle
I know that'll show on my face.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.702 align:middle
I'll feel like she's the
winner and I'm the loser.

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle
And understanding that about
myself is the worst part of all!

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:09.914 align:middle
Ugh, this is so frustrating!

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.459 align:middle
You're right, that does
sound awfully complicated.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.252 align:middle
[KAGURA] If she'd just get
together with Kyo already,

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle
I could at least be
resigned to it.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle
What do you think?
Does she love Kyo?

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:21.426 align:middle
Yeah, why wouldn't she love him?

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.386 align:middle
That's like the stupidest
question ever!

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:27.182 align:middle
And anyway, I know he's
head over heels for her.

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.475 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:31.811 align:middle
[KAGURA] Sensei? I thought
it would make you happy.

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:34.356 align:middle
I'm just a bit worried,
I suppose.

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle
I hope she loves Kyo
for the right reasons.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:40.362 align:middle
For the person he is.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:43.531 align:middle
And not just out of
compassion or pity.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.826 align:middle
[ISUZU] So, any special
reason you're here?

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.078 align:middle
Well, I felt bad.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.497 align:middle
It was so rude of me to run
away like that last time,

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle
and it's been several days now.

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:55.043 align:middle
You taking off didn't
bother me, but...

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:57.879 align:middle
Why Kyo? Of all people.

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:03.009 align:middle
I mean, he's the Cat.
Do you pity him?

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.552 align:middle
[KAZUMA]
You may not have known this,

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:07.138 align:middle
but the previous Cat
had a companion.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle
The woman in charge
of looking after him.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:14.312 align:middle
She conceived his child.
Stayed with him till his death.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.815 align:middle
One day, someone asked her,

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle
"How could you devote so
many years of your life

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.985 align:middle
to a creature like the Cat?"

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:25.615 align:middle
Poor thing. I couldn't help
but feel sorry for him.

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:28.451 align:middle
[KAZUMA] Perhaps that sentiment
is a laudable one.

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle
And perhaps my
grandfather was happier

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:34.833 align:middle
than he would have been
spending his days alone.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.502 align:middle
But still...

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.295 align:middle
Hm?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.422 align:middle
[TOHRU]
This feeling.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:44.467 align:middle
It's cruel and greedy.
All-consuming.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.678 align:middle
Can it really be pity?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.807 align:middle
It sounds noble, saying I wanna
protect the zodiac members.

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.475 align:middle
Free them from the curse.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:56.146 align:middle
But those are just... excuses!

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.648 align:middle
I'm hiding from
my true feelings.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.736 align:middle
Tricking you, like a coward.

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.571 align:middle
The truth is...

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:08.825 align:middle
[TOHRU] I put Mom first in
my heart before, but now...

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle
What I want is him. I want Kyo.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:15.749 align:middle
I can't let him be
taken from me.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle
Not by the curse, or the
Somas, or anyone else!

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:26.509 align:middle
Because more than anything,
he's what's precious to me!

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:29.387 align:middle
[KAGURA]
Why are you telling her?

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:33.558 align:middle
Idiot! You should
be telling him!

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.478 align:middle
Dear Tohru took their
cruelty to heart.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle
It was like she lost them both.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle
Katsuya was dead, and Kyoko
was withering before her eyes.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:46.488 align:middle
[TOHRU] Daddy went
someplace far away, right?

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:50.408 align:middle
What about Mommy?
Is she going to go there, too?

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.829 align:middle
She seems sick.
And she won't talk to me.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:58.375 align:middle
Maybe it makes her sad that
I don't look like Daddy.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:03.296 align:middle
If I start acting just like him,
will she get better?

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.924 align:middle
Will she stay with me?

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:08.301 align:middle
[GRANDFATHER]
Not long after, there was a time

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:13.473 align:middle
when Kyoko was away from home--
from Tohru--for a long while.

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:16.226 align:middle
It started then.

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.144 align:middle
[KYOKO]
It started then.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:23.441 align:middle
Katsuya... She sounded like him.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:25.068 align:middle
[KYO] She never
finished that sentence,

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle
but I think I finally know
how it would have ended.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.952 align:middle
[KYO] One time, Kyoko had to
stay out all night for work.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.245 align:middle
Tohru was home by herself,

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:40.417 align:middle
so I thought I'd sneak over
and get a look at her.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:44.587 align:middle
The Tohru I saw that night,
sitting all alone,

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:47.215 align:middle
is that who Tohru really is?

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:55.932 align:middle
[KYO] Even now, is she still...
that lonely girl?

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle
[TOHRU yelps]

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:57.726 align:middle
Uh.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.519 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Oh, you startled me.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:01.062 align:middle
I didn't realize you were home!

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle
[KYO]
Yeah.

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.232 align:middle
You came back early too, huh?

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:05.483 align:middle
Yeah, a bit.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.820 align:middle
I mean, I heard that it was
supposed to rain this evening.

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:11.823 align:middle
But I guess there was
nothing to worry about!

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:17.704 align:middle
Hey. I was just wondering,
what did your dad look like?

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.122 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:20.206 align:middle
[KYO]
You don't remember him well,

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.584 align:middle
but do you resemble him?

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.294 align:middle
At all?

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:28.715 align:middle
No. I, um... I don't.

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:31.509 align:middle
Not in-Not in the way I look.

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:34.429 align:middle
Oh, but you know,
there's one thing.

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:37.682 align:middle
People say my way of speaking
is a lot like his.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:44.481 align:middle
Even Mom thought so.
She told me that it was similar.

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:49.652 align:middle
[KYO] Oh, yeah? Well, that
probably made her happy.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.242 align:middle
[TOHRU]
No. That's a lie.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:59.245 align:middle
I'm actually nothing like him.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:03.541 align:middle
I started imitating him so I
wouldn't seem so different.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:09.506 align:middle
[TOHRU]
It's awful, but the truth is...

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:13.968 align:middle
...in my head, I made
my dad the bad guy.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.555 align:middle
He wasn't, of course,
not at all.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.766 align:middle
I remember his kindness,

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:22.352 align:middle
and the presents
he would give me.

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:26.064 align:middle
I really do remember them.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:28.942 align:middle
But... back then...

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:33.655 align:middle
...I thought he might take
Mom away with him.

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:37.325 align:middle
I had to find some way
to make her notice me,

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:40.704 align:middle
so she wouldn't leave
and go to him.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:44.499 align:middle
I wanted to keep her alive.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:47.377 align:middle
I couldn't bear
to be left behind.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.754 align:middle
I'd do anything to feel safe.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:53.883 align:middle
To keep the person I love
from being taken from me.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:55.719 align:middle
So I did it.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.723 align:middle
I pinned the blame on my dad
because it made it easier.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.975 align:middle
That's how selfish I am.

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:06.479 align:middle
I'd break any promise
for my own sake.

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:08.648 align:middle
I'm horrible.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:14.112 align:middle
[KYO]
It was... so foolish.

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:16.823 align:middle
She must've thought
hard about it.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:19.075 align:middle
She didn't want her mom
to go and leave her behind,

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:23.329 align:middle
so she needed to
figure something out.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.083 align:middle
She chased the image of
her father in her memories.

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:32.172 align:middle
[TOHRU] And the answer
she came up with was...

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:35.216 align:middle
[TOHRU]
"W-Welcome home."

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.594 align:middle
"I'm glad you're back."

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.929 align:middle
"Did you enjoy yourself?"

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.723 align:middle
"I'm glad to hear it."

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.225 align:middle
[KYO] It was off the mark
and totally absurd,

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.478 align:middle
but it was what she had.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.396 align:middle
It was so foolish,

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:51.191 align:middle
watching her stubbornly
keep at it.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:58.073 align:middle
[KYO] Watching her do her
best to hide her loneliness...

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle
Seeing her torture
herself like that...

00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:04.704 align:middle
It was so foolish.

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:07.082 align:middle
And it made my heart ache.

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:14.756 align:middle
[KYO] I'm sure that your mom
realized what you were doing.

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:17.926 align:middle
And guessed the reason why.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:21.304 align:middle
But I'm also sure...
that it helped her.

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:24.307 align:middle
That it gave her strength.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:26.851 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I hope that's true.

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:29.896 align:middle
[KYO]
It is. Believe it.

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:33.066 align:middle
[TOHRU] I'm sorry.
I must sound so pathetic.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.901 align:middle
--[TOHRU] I shouldn't say--
--[KYO] It's fine.

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:38.446 align:middle
Say it. Whatever you need.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.659 align:middle
[KYO]
You won't disappoint me.

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:49.666 align:middle
[KAGURA]
I refuse to apologize.

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:52.293 align:middle
Tohru and I communicated
with our fists.

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:54.796 align:middle
You're the only one
who did any hitting.

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.798 align:middle
[KAGURA] Some people can
easily trust others

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.967 align:middle
to do what needs to be done.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:02.387 align:middle
And honestly, I kind
of envy them for that.

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle
But maybe I can do it, too.

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:11.563 align:middle
Because what she was feeling
definitely wasn't pity.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:14.816 align:middle
All right, it's settled!
I'll leave it to her!

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:16.192 align:middle
Give me a break.

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:17.902 align:middle
You're so annoying
when you get like this.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.822 align:middle
Stop complaining and hug me!

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.578 align:middle
[TOHRU]
This is him, my father.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.539 align:middle
[KYO] So, you do
have a photo of him.

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:31.291 align:middle
I kinda figured.

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:38.965 align:middle
[KAGURA] Idiot!
You should be telling him!

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:40.342 align:middle
I--

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:42.344 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:46.222 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:47.599 align:middle
[KYO]
Hm?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.851 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:51.311 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Nothing.

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:04.324 align:middle
[KYO]
I remember.

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:07.077 align:middle
I locked it away, but...

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:09.662 align:middle
I won't forgive you.

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:16.878 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Kyo. Your face.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.756 align:middle
Is something the matter?
What's wrong?

00:22:19.798 --> 00:22:20.507 align:middle
Kyo, please...

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:22.467 align:middle
[KYO]
I remember now.

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:23.593 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Kyo!

00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:26.137 align:middle
[KYOKO]
I won't forgive you.

00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:00.857 align:middle
[AKITO]
"That's right, it's empty."
