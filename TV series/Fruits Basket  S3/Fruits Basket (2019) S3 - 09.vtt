00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.560 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
They both died because of me.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.856 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
If that were true...

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:27.485 position:50% align:center
If I really believed it...
it would be crushing.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
But...

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Too late.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
It's too late.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
Akito. But why?

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
It's over. The end is here.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.544 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'm disappointed in you.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.963 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
But worse in that moment...

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
...were his eyes.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
Half-hidden behind
his coppery hair,

00:00:52.594 --> 00:01:02.562 position:50% align:center
they were screaming so loudly:
"I'm sad. I'm sad. I'm sad."

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
That was the most
crushing thing of all.

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
It made my heart ache.
Even more than thoughts of mom.

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:16.993 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
It's over. So what now?

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:20.789 position:50% align:center
Will you throw me away?
Abandon me?

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.669 position:50% align:center
[AKITO, KYOKO] Will you move
on... and leave me behind?

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:30.799 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I know how it
feels to be left behind.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:06.978 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Shigure!

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:10.607 position:50% align:center
Oh, what's this? I'm not
the only one out and about?

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
Hardly. Listen, have
you seen--? You reek!

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
I had a drink or two.
Date with my author buddies.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You were out
drinking all night?

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
Only until the first
morning train.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
You are technically
our guardian, you know.

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
Try acting like it sometime.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
No, I don't have time
for this creep.

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Harsh.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Did you pass the idiot on
your way? The great big idiot?

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
Idiot? Oh, I see. You mean Kyo.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
No, I didn't.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] He must've gone
the other direction.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.931 position:50% align:center
What's up? Has Kyo been
causing trouble again?

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
I don't know the
details, but yeah.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
That colossal idiot.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
How dare he make her cry!

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.233 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Are you happy?

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
You won, you know.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
You supplanted me,
stole my place.

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
Now I'm the outsider,
the outcast.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.327 position:50% align:center
Because they all like you best.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
Does that feel good?

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] The loneliness
of being abandoned.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
You showed up and
destroyed everything.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
I'm alone. A mistake.
The bad guy.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
Does that feel good? I hate you.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
Finally. I see you.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
You came and wrecked it.
My whole world.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
Yet somehow, you still get
to be the "pure" one.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
You're the dirtiest
one of us all!

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Akito. I finally found you.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
No, don't.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
Stay back! You make me sick!

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I've been so thoughtless.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
How could I have
not realized it?

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.420 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Akito!

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Get back!

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
All this time...

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
...you've been so lonely,
but you couldn't let anyone see.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
From the beginning,

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
ever since she was born,
she was treated as "special."

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
As somebody who's above the
circle instead of part of it.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
But... that's just a different
form of abandonment.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I understand now.

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
Why you talk so much
about eternity

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
and an unchanging future.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
You say those things
because... you're scared.

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
You're terrified of being alone!

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.382 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Shut up!

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
You know nothing! Nothing!

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
You condescending brat.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
I told you, I don't want
your false sympathy!

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
You won't win me over. Never.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.935 position:50% align:center
Never!

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I am dirty. It's true.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
You were right about me, Akito.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:03.530 position:50% align:center
Because, even as I
rejected your eternity,

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
I was wishing for
the same things.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
For forever.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
Unchanging feelings.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
Bonds.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
I was, but...

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Mom, the truth is...

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
...I've fallen in
love with someone.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center
It took me so long to admit it,

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
and now he's saying
he's disappointed in me.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
But I love him.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Even if he doesn't love me back,

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
I've decided not to
stand still anymore.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:51.119 position:50% align:center
It's time. I'm going
on ahead, Mom.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
People can't be bound forever.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.625 position:50% align:center
Neither can their feelings.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
I think, deep down,

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.840 position:50% align:center
you've already realized
that, haven't you?

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
And for all this
time, it's hurt,

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center
knowing that painful truth.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
You've been sad, miserable,
and so very lonely.

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:20.607 position:50% align:center
No!

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
I don't want this!

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna be
abandoned, left behind!

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.656 position:50% align:center
--Why is this happening?
--Akito--

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] No! I'm scared.
I don't want this!

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
I was promised so much more!

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] This world,
where no one needs me,

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
where everyone's a stranger,
I don't want it.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:43.922 position:50% align:center
Not this.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Please, wait!

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
No, I'm done!

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
It's too late. Don't
you understand that?

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.014 position:50% align:center
This world is unrecognizable.

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
There are no promises or bonds,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.063 position:50% align:center
no hope of eternity,
and I'm scared.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
I can't live surrounded
by strangers.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
Alone, without any guarantee
that I'll be loved.

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
The world scares me.

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Well, in that case,
what if you begin again with me?

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:28.216 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Here. Now.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
We met the wrong way.
Let's start over.

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
I'll go first.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50% align:center
Hello. My name is Tohru Honda.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what's your name?

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
Maybe we could be friends.
I'd like that.

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:55.118 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Liar! You don't mean it.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center
The second I cry, you'll
decide you've had enough.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
If I complain, you'll get mad.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
You'll stop liking me and
throw me out of your life.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
There you are.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I finally found you.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Tell me, what's your name?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.627 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Maybe we could be
friends. I'd like that.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Please... don't cry anymore.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
Someone, help!

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
Someone! Anyone! Come quickly!

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
Help!

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Akito, please... don't cry.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50% align:center
It's all right.
Everything's all right.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
The scary times are over.
You made it.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Whoa. I wasn't
expecting to see you here.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.257 position:50% align:center
Please. Help her.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
Hurry. She's hurt.

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
She needs help.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
She fell... from...
from up on the cliff.

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:42.434 position:50% align:center
So far down. So far...

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
What do I do?
She's not moving.

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
She's so... so still.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.651 position:50% align:center
Akito, slowly now.
Calm as you can.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
Who fell? Tell me.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
Toh... Tohru.

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:58.950 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
Okay. Where was she?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
That way. Straight back.

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
Shigure, I'm calling for help.
Meet them when they get here.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
What do we do? She won't move.
Shigure! What do we do?

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
Akito, did you push her?

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No. I didn't.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center
I didn't! Really.
I don't know why.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
The ground... it just
crumbled, out of nowhere.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
But I... I did hurt Kureno.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
I stabbed him.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hatori. It's me.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. What's going on
at the main estate?

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
Akito is actually at my place.

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.805 position:50% align:center
Yes. Here.

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
I heard. How is he?

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
Well, we've got an emergency
on our hands, too.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
No, Akito is fine. It's Tohru.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It seems she
fell off a cliff.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Right.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'll call back
when I know more.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Good news.
He says Kureno will live.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Tohru.

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Don't move her.

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
Her head, she probably
hit it hard.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
Wait. This can't be happening.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
It's wrong. It's... all wrong.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
This isn't what I wanted.

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
You can't go. Stay with me.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
Tohru.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Don't cry.
Please... don't cry anymore.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:57.045 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Wait... who's crying?

00:13:57.087 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
Akito? Kyo?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. I have
to go after Kyo.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
I have to find him.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
And when I do, I'll tell him,
"I love you so much."

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
Every day, I feel
grateful we met.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.070 position:50% align:center
Maybe all it brought you
was frustration and pain,

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
but the time we've had together
has made me so happy.

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:33.540 position:50% align:center
Your awkward kindness.
Your blushes.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
Your smile. Your shy looks.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
They all made me so, so happy.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
And little by little, over time,
they became precious.

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
My treasures.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
I realize now,

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
that day in the rain,
I chased you so desperately

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
because I was already
in love with you.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
And that love made the thought
of losing you unbearable.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:09.284 position:50% align:center
Being near me hurt you.
My feelings hurt you.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
I know that...
but it will be okay.

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
So please, don't cry anymore.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
Everything ends eventually.
Happy times. Fun times.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center
But scary and sad times, too.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
They will pass. Always.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
[TORHU] Even if you can't
believe it right now,

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
please, keep living.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
Don't give up.
I want you to live.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
It's all right if
you make mistakes,

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
or take the long way around.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
But please... please live.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
Whatever happens,
don't stop moving forward.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
Keep walking. One foot
in front of the other.

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
Even if I'm not by your
side... keep walking.

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
Tohru, you're...

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center
I-It's okay... I promise.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
Kyo... It's all going
to be okay now.

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Can you hear me?

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.331 position:50% align:center
Am I reaching you?

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
Please.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Never mind. It's all right.

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:51.344 position:50% align:center
I get it. It's all right.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
No need to talk.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.940 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Let me reach you.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
[YUKI grunts]

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
You look tired.

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything
you've done,

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.871 position:50% align:center
but why don't you
go on home to bed?

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center
Just leave it to us for now.

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.918 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yes, sir. I'll be back tomorrow.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
[GRANDFATHER] All right,
but don't you skip school.

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.882 position:50% align:center
It would only make
her fret, you know.

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
[GRANDFATHER]
Oh, one moment.

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
Where's the other young man
with the orange hair?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
Doesn't he know about this?

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
He's...

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.556 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Visiting?

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
Did you come alone?

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
Are you here for Kureno...
or for Tohru?

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
It was close. I'm glad
they'll be all right.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] From what I hear,
a lot happened after you left.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.249 position:50% align:center
Akito, are you okay?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
They should be blaming me.

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
Getting angry. Complaining.
I don't know, just something.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
Why aren't they?
Are they idiots?

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
If they forgive me
no matter what I do or say,

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
that isn't softhearted--
it's just idiotic.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
They're both idiots. Morons.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Good thing, right?

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
Thanks to those two idiots,

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
you won't be charged
for your crimes.

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center
So, you got lucky.

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center
Idiots do have their
uses, don't they?

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
[AKITO crying]

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Why are you crying?

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] I wondered--if I said,
"No. No, I'm not okay,"

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
what would Kureno do?

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
Come back? Be by my side again?

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I think he would have.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
That's just the kind
of person he is.

00:19:56.613 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Hopelessly soft and kind.

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
Endlessly kind.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:09.042 position:50% align:center
And this whole time,
little by little...

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
...I've been killing him.

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
It hurts... so much.

00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:23.098 position:50% align:center
I'm furious with myself.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] My meaningless apologies
didn't change anything,

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
but he listened
and accepted them.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:41.866 position:50% align:center
So much kindness, and I only
ever repaid it with pain.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] So, from now on,
make sure to treasure them.

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
It's simple.

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
Just because other people
think they're idiots,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
that doesn't mean you have to.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
You can take care of them

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center
and treasure them
for who they are.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
That's all you need to do.

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] This is just like
the idiotic traveler.

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
It's a story. Want to hear?

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
Once you do, you'll definitely
want to go see Tohru.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Wow, so Akito really
did go to the hospital alone.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
I'm shocked.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
And impressed. Maybe the
stabbing spree was cathartic?

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
Her and Honda, something
happened between them.

00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think
that's safe to say.

00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
She sat down.

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:48.892 position:50% align:center
Not far away...
or somewhere above me.

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
She sat next to me. Nearby.

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:55.190 position:50% align:center
She started talking to me.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.944 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
"There you are," she said.

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:05.241 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] Did everything go
according to your plan?

00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
Oh. I guess so.

00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:13.958 position:50% align:center
Although I am feeling a little
remorseful about parts of it.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.043 position:50% align:center
[HATORI
"A little"?

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:18.338 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Come on now, Doc. Baby steps.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.589 position:50% align:center
It may not seem like much,

00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:22.926 position:50% align:center
but that's quite a concession
coming from me.

00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:31.309 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
It's progress, really.

00:23:57.562 --> 00:24:00.607 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
"I just... love her."
