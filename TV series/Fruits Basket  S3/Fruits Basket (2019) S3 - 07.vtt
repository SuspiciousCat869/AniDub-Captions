00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:14.681 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] Even if the world
doesn't need me,

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:19.060 position:50% align:center
I decided to keep living
for someone who does.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
It's enough.

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
Even so, I coulda lost
custody. It was dicey!

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:26.860 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
"Custody"?

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.778 position:50% align:center
And, ya know, things
were still kind of crazy,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.530 position:50% align:center
with the move and everything,

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
but I kept busy and
bounced back pretty well.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
How could I not? I've got
Tohru on my side, after all.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
[KYO grunts]

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
What? It's true.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
She is so darn cute! Cutest in
the world. No, the universe!

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
But Katsuya Honda.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
Hm?

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
You don't wanna go
see him anymore?

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
Still so young.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:56.222 position:50% align:center
I wonder how much time
and effort it'll take

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center
for you kids to
find your answers.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.644 position:50% align:center
Your reasons for living.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:06.524 position:50% align:center
[KYO] When she said that,
it sounded ridiculous.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:10.487 position:50% align:center
I'd always felt I was born
to be an object of contempt.

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:14.074 position:50% align:center
That I continued living
only to hurt other people.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:15.950 position:50% align:center
And wasn't I right?

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.830 position:50% align:center
[KYO] That's why it
happened, isn't it?

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.999 position:50% align:center
That's why my mom died.

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Didn't she wanna
tell me it was my fault?

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:32.300 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
And you, too.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center
Even your fond smile
became hate in the end.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:42.394 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S MOTHER] Now, now,
it's not your fault. Really.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.021 position:50% align:center
I promise you didn't
do anything wrong.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:47.982 position:50% align:center
But, Kyo, you can't go
outside, all right?

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:51.695 position:50% align:center
It's better this way.
There are bad things outside.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:56.700 position:50% align:center
You understand?
Come on inside with Mom.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
We'll stay there forever,
safely inside the house.

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:05.208 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't disobey your
dear mother, would you?

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.169 position:50% align:center
I won't forgive you.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.923 position:50% align:center
Really, Kyo. Don't you
realize Mom knows best?

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.010 position:50% align:center
I'll be inside, waiting for you.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50% align:center
But come soon,

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:20.598 position:50% align:center
or something even more
terrifying will happen.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.808 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU, MOMIJI laughing]

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
And... done. This one's Tohru!

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:37.365 position:50% align:center
Ha! I love it, thank you!

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
But are we sure the different
shapes will grill okay?

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.579 position:50% align:center
Not to worry!
You can leave it to me!

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.790 position:50% align:center
Kyo! The food's almost ready!

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
Kyo? Coming?

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.462 position:50% align:center
Do you think he fell
asleep or something?

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Eh. He'll wander
down eventually.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Both of them
in the same dream.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
Did they know
what I was thinking?

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
Is that why they came?

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:08.688 position:50% align:center
To remind me that I
need to know my place.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
Because I thought,
maybe... just maybe...

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.654 position:50% align:center
...Tohru loved me back.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
Please. Who was I kidding?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] What are you doing
in this part of the estate?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Did you slip away from
your servant again?

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I need to venture out,

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.968 position:50% align:center
find somebody
interesting to talk to.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
Well, you understand.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
I hear you pressed Isuzu
into your service

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
and asked her to fetch
a certain box for you.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
My, my. Word travels fast.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
If <i>you </i>know, I suppose the girl
went and blabbed about our deal.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center
A worthless child, indeed.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] A bit hypocritical,
don't you think?

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
I did tell you, Ren, that
it was our little secret.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Is that
what you said?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.539 position:50% align:center
Because to me, it sounded
like you were suggesting

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
that I go and get it from her.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
Me? I would never.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
[REN] In any case, the
operation failed miserably.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
This would be much easier

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center
if you'd simply get
it for me yourself.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50% align:center
No. That's out of the
question, I'm afraid.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.516 position:50% align:center
It would just feel
blasphemous, somehow.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
[REN]
Yes, it would be.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
Because no one other than me
has the right to touch Akira.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
His flesh, his blood, his soul,

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:03.655 position:50% align:center
anything that is connected
to him in any way...

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
...would be sullied by
someone else's hand.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] I hear another
marriage talk fell apart.

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] The doctor says he's
not long for this world.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
I don't see why they
can't compromise.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] That's exactly why!
There has to be a successor.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
True, no one wants "outsiders"

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
to fall heir to
the Soma fortune.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
[REN]
Akira and I met not by chance,

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
but because we were fated to.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50% align:center
It was destiny.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
You must be lonely. And afraid.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
Nobody wants to
face death alone.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
All these people, and none
of them have noticed.

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:47.157 position:50% align:center
But I see what they don't.
Because I'm different.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:50.744 position:50% align:center
So let me carry it all
for you instead.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
Your sorrow, your fear,
and your pain--every last bit.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
I'll take it all.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A]
No. This cannot be allowed!

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
You're just a lowly servant!

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
But the two of us are in love.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A] Silence!
Get out of here this instant.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
Never set foot on
this estate again!

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Ren saw me.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:14.392 position:50% align:center
She saw my loneliness
when no one else did.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
She saw it,
and she cried for me.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
[REN]
It was bliss.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
We had each other, and we
didn't need anybody else.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
I was the center of his world,
and he was the center of mine.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.495 position:50% align:center
We were happy.
That was enough for me.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:36.623 position:50% align:center
Though... it didn't last.

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.667 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Hey, did you hear?

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.503 position:50% align:center
They said Akito's going
to be raised as a boy.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why, though.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
Apparently, Ren decided
it a while ago.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.135 position:50% align:center
Said a female heir
could cause issues.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
I heard she threw a fit
and refused to have the baby

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50% align:center
if she couldn't
raise it as a boy.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] She's not Akira's
"number one" anymore,

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:00.021 position:50% align:center
and she can't stand it.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
Jealousy. That's what it is.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.903 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why you
won't ever hold Akito.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.531 position:50% align:center
Why should I bother with
shows of affection?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
The brat already gets plenty
from everyone else.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
Akito's a special child
who was born for them to love.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
It's only natural.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Think about it.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
Remember the day we
realized Akito was coming

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
and ran up to Ren?

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center
The look on her face...

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:30.969 position:50% align:center
You could just tell she
was thinking, "Oh, crap."

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Gure. I don't get it.

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
You know Gure. Always
complicating things.

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
Are you saying
Ren's a bad person?

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Heh.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
What I mean is,
she should be pitied.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:47.986 position:50% align:center
Really all of us
should. We Somas.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
You poor, unfortunate thing.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.824 position:50% align:center
[REN]
What about you?

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
Don't you deserve pity?

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
You're at Akito's mercy,

00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
shackled by the curse
and its so-called "bonds."

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
Face it.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
Whatever you think you
might feel for her,

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
it isn't actually love.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:09.883 position:50% align:center
You're just caught up
in a child's fantasy.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
Really, haven't you noticed?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center
That look you have in your eyes.
I've seen it before.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.853 position:50% align:center
You want me now just
as you did back then.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Yes, I've noticed.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
Looking at you, I feel
a rush of affection.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
I find myself wondering if
she would have resembled you

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
had she only been allowed
to live her life as a girl.

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
That's my fantasy.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
You're quite right.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
I did indeed want you
to take that box.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
Your charge just tried
to murder his own mother!

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
And you gave him that silly box!

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
The poor family head
is so innocent

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
he believed in it,
and now look what--

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.293 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A] Of course
he didn't believe in it!

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
You're a fool!

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
I gave it to Akito
for comfort and solace

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
in the wake of his
dear father's death.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
It's merely a charm
or a talisman.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
Anyone would know it was empty!
That's just common sense.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
I told you, Akito shouldn't
be given such things!

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Akito.

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I was torn. About the box.

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
I believed in it,
but I also didn't.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:20.952 position:50% align:center
It was empty,
but I thought, maybe...

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center
...there was an
invisible power inside.

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
Maybe... just maybe...

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
I couldn't get rid of it,

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
but I didn't wanna look
into it again, so I hid it.

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:43.058 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] I clung to it, that
feeble hope... all these years.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
Can you blame me?

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
That was my version
of common sense!

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:50.106 position:50% align:center
Don't you see?
Nobody taught me otherwise.

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:52.067 position:50% align:center
This was the life they gave me.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
Nobody ever offered
me another one!

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
So how do I ask when I
don't know what to ask?

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me that? Can you?

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
You can start now.

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
Begin learning.
Begin understanding.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
Let's do it.
Let's change, Akito.

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
If you stay in this
place much longer,

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
the Soma family and
the bonds will crush you.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
You'll remain empty.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
--So, please--
--[AKITO] Too late.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] It's far too late
for you to say that.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
"Change"? No.
We're past that point.

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you say it
in the beginning?

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you push me away
the second you had a chance to?

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you abandon me?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
I know.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
<i>Now </i>you change your mind?

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
I know.

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] It's too late.
Save your lecture.

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
You didn't help me by staying.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
That "kindness" of yours,

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
leaving me half-saved
and half-rejected...

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
Did you realize that it
was killing me? Did you?

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
We're done.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
You screwed up. Now pay for it!

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
With your life!

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
[gasps, groans]

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.321 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT C]
Kureno!

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
What happened? You're bleeding!

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
Never mind me.

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
Find Akito. Go now. Hurry!

00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
Someone help!

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Pretty words.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
But it's too late.
For both of us.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
Yeah, looks dead, all right.

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
[COWORKER A] Ugh.
I wonder if a cat got to it.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.974 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Maybe flew into
a window or something.

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER A] What's going on?
You two finish cleaning yet?

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
[COWORKER A]
We're working on it.

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:54.397 position:50% align:center
But there's a dead
bird out here!

00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Were you just tired?

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Thank you.

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure!

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:05.992 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'll be back. I'm goin' out.

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:11.831 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kyo!

00:22:11.873 --> 00:22:13.291 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:22:14.918 --> 00:22:17.504 position:50% align:center
Please just wait for a minute?

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:19.881 position:50% align:center
I have something to tell you.

00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:00.815 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
"I'm disappointed in you."
