[TOHRU]
Kyo, wait!

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.598 align:middle
Um...

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:18.560 align:middle
[TOHRU]
It's just...

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:22.647 align:middle
There's something I'd
like to tell you if I can.

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle
--[TOHRU] Kyo, I--
--[KYO] Me first.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.209 align:middle
[KYO]
There's something that I've been

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.962 align:middle
wanting to ask
you for a while now.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.883 align:middle
If I've got the wrong idea,
you can laugh at me.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.428 align:middle
Call me an idiot if you want.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.015 align:middle
Tohru.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.392 align:middle
I need to know.

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:23.727 align:middle
Do you love me?

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:26.396 align:middle
[gasps]

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.064 align:middle
[MOMIJI]
I mean,

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.483 align:middle
you know, right?

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.197 align:middle
[KYO]
Are you stupid?

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.201 align:middle
Shit, I can't believe
my hunch was right.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:44.414 align:middle
Of all people, why me?

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.167 align:middle
[KYO]
Your mom--

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:50.837 align:middle
she was the person you
loved most in the world.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.425 align:middle
What was that? A lie?

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.136 align:middle
Or did it just disappear?

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.765 align:middle
[KYO]
I can't do this.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle
[KYO]
It was foolish.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.937 align:middle
Wishing to stay with her.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.107 align:middle
f I'd known this is
how it would turn out,

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle
I would never
have wished for that.

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.155 align:middle
How'd things get so screwed up?

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.158 align:middle
It's not fair.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.951 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Kyo, wait!

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:25.955 align:middle
[KYO] I don't wanna say it.
I don't want her to know.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.916 align:middle
I don't wanna admit it.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.044 align:middle
But... this just isn't fair.

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.004 align:middle
Please listen to me!
I just want--

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.964 align:middle
[KYO]
You don't know anything!

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.591 align:middle
Not what I did,

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle
or what I failed to do!

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:42.597 align:middle
[KYO] You love me...
and I pity you for it.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.641 align:middle
So much.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.602 align:middle
So ridiculously much.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle
[KYO]
I'm sorry.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle
[KYO]
I'm sorry.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle
[KYO] She could've lived,
but she didn't, 'cause of me.

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:07.914 align:middle
Your mom would've
lived if I'd helped.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:13.753 align:middle
I never told you, but,
your mom... I knew her.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.797 align:middle
And that day...

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.341 align:middle
The day of the accident,

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:23.054 align:middle
I was standing right there
and I recognized her.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:26.725 align:middle
Her hair color. Her face.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.644 align:middle
They were just like
they were when we met.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.229 align:middle
I was a kid.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.441 align:middle
Master had only
just taken me in.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.484 align:middle
Back then I was still
too self-conscious

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.779 align:middle
to go straight home
to the dojo after school,

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.948 align:middle
so I'd just wander around.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.367 align:middle
[KYOKO]
What's your deal, kid?

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.201 align:middle
You're way too young

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:47.454 align:middle
to go around dying your
hair different colors.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.456 align:middle
Wait, hold on, is that natural?

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:51.082 align:middle
Jeez! What's your deal?

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.377 align:middle
Just leave me alone! Ya say
anything else and I'll kill ya!

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.838 align:middle
Oh, wow. You're a total
brat, aren't you?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.173 align:middle
That's so darn cute!

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.426 align:middle
[KYO] Hey! Who do ya think
you're callin' cute? Old hag!

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.345 align:middle
[KYOKO chuckles]
Listen to the mouth on you.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:07.599 align:middle
Insulting a random stranger.
Stinkin' adorable.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.143 align:middle
You're gonna get kidnapped
if you don't stop being so cute.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.604 align:middle
Better go home.
Your mom'll be worried.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:17.192 align:middle
I don't have one,
okay? She died!

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.109 align:middle
And your dad?

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.404 align:middle
I don't need him
either. The jerk!

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:25.617 align:middle
I wish he'd die.
He wants me dead, too!

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle
[KYOKO grunts]

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.663 align:middle
[KYO gasps]

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:34.417 align:middle
[KYOKO]
Wow. Sounds lonely.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.423 align:middle
[KYO grunts]

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.926 align:middle
Hey, weird lady. Your hair real?

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle
Well, weird lady's a bit rude.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:48.932 align:middle
Why don't you call me Kyoko?
The name's Kyoko Honda.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.142 align:middle
[KYO]
What? Her name's like mine.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.269 align:middle
[KYOKO]
So what do they call you?

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.604 align:middle
Not telling.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:55.647 align:middle
[KYOKO]
All right.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle
I guess I'll just have
to call you Squirt, then.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:02.320 align:middle
[KYO] We kept talking.
She told me she worked nearby.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle
[KYOKO]
Come by again sometime, Squirt.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.493 align:middle
[KYO]
We met a bunch after that.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.538 align:middle
Kyoko Honda told me
about lots of stuff.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:15.625 align:middle
About herself,
about Katsuya Honda,

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:19.212 align:middle
and about Tohru.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.632 align:middle
[KYO] I wondered what the
daughter of someone like her

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.926 align:middle
would be like.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.721 align:middle
Today I'm gonna show
you something special.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.265 align:middle
This girl is my treasure.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.017 align:middle
Tohru!

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.728 align:middle
[KYO] I wondered what her
laugh would sound like.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:40.817 align:middle
[KYOKO gasps]
Oh, Squirt.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:43.069 align:middle
Tohru... she must be lost.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.779 align:middle
She hasn't come home.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:48.324 align:middle
I looked for her,
but I can't find her.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.327 align:middle
I can't find her anywhere!

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle
She's gone!

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.208 align:middle
[KYO]
Get it together!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.962 align:middle
Because I'm gonna
find her for you! I swear!

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:05.175 align:middle
You wait at home. I'll help her.
I'll protect her for sure!

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.719 align:middle
And that's a man's promise!

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.598 align:middle
[KYOKO sniffs]

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.351 align:middle
[KYOKO]
A man's promise.

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:16.686 align:middle
[KYO panting]

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.438 align:middle
[KYO]
Why?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle
Why couldn't I keep it?

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:30.867 align:middle
[KYOKO] Squirt!
Thank goodness I found you!

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.119 align:middle
You were still
searching for her, huh?

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:37.832 align:middle
Tohru is safe and sound!
Someone helped her get home.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:41.127 align:middle
I'm sorry.
You looked for so long.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.838 align:middle
That hat...
Where'd it come from?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.007 align:middle
Oh, this thing?

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:48.927 align:middle
Tohru says the kid who
helped her was wearing it.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.178 align:middle
You recognize it?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.137 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.139 align:middle
[KYO]
I did.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.059 align:middle
I'd picked it out for myself.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:08:02.357 align:middle
Master bought it for me, and
it ended up with him instead.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.067 align:middle
[KYO]
Yeah.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle
Yeah, it was mine,
but it's not anymore.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:10.407 align:middle
Not if he's touched it.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.826 align:middle
That guy... He sucks.

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:16.996 align:middle
He has everything.
People who care about him.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:21.334 align:middle
So why does he have to go
and take stuff from me?

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:23.545 align:middle
This boy helped Tohru
come home safe.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.755 align:middle
[KYO]
I don't care! He still sucks!

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.674 align:middle
He's not a good person!

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.801 align:middle
I was gonna do it.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.554 align:middle
Protect her for you.

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:36.725 align:middle
[KYO] What a jerk. He was
already born luckier than me.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:40.687 align:middle
Why can't he at
least let me have this?

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.647 align:middle
[KYOKO] The bad guy--
that's what you wanna see.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.441 align:middle
[KYO gasps]

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle
[KYOKO] 'Cause if he's not
as awful as you think,

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:49.279 align:middle
who do you have left to hate?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.905 align:middle
[KYO gasps]

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.199 align:middle
Are you kidding?!
You're on his side, too?!

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.076 align:middle
You're saying it's all my fault?

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.954 align:middle
No, I'm not.
It's pointless, you know?

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.874 align:middle
Labeling good and
bad. Taking sides.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.543 align:middle
Don't live your life
worrying about that stuff.

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.296 align:middle
You understand me?

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:10.633 align:middle
Really. It would be a waste
of a good, kind boy like you.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:11.968 align:middle
[gasps]

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.764 align:middle
That's just stupid!
And you, you're a traitor!

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:19.392 align:middle
I've had it! I'm done
with you and her, too!

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:23.021 align:middle
[KYOKO] Hey, Squirt!
I'm holding you to it.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.023 align:middle
Your promise.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.191 align:middle
[KYO grunts]

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.985 align:middle
[KYO]
I never went back.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle
I was lonely because
I felt betrayed,

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.783 align:middle
ashamed because I couldn't help,

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:38.411 align:middle
and stung because it felt
like he'd stolen something.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:44.042 align:middle
Basically, I was sulking,
so I avoided seeing her again.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:45.627 align:middle
But then,

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:49.673 align:middle
one day, there she was.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle
I was trying to decide whether
to say something when I saw it:

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:58.515 align:middle
A car... coming toward us,
out of control.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:02.018 align:middle
I thought, "Oh, shit,
I have to help her."

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.938 align:middle
If I grabbed her arm and
pulled her back against me...

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:09.192 align:middle
But then I remembered
I'm not human.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:14.739 align:middle
[KYO] If I caught her
in my arms, I'd transform

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:19.369 align:middle
and people would
find out what I am.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:27.377 align:middle
[KYO]
So instead, I let her die.

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:31.089 align:middle
If I had just pulled her back,

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:34.801 align:middle
then she wouldn't
have gone flying.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:38.054 align:middle
She wouldn't have
felt all that pain.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:41.725 align:middle
I know she'd still be alive.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.893 align:middle
But I didn't.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle
I weighed her
life against mine...

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.192 align:middle
[KYO]
...and I chose me.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:57.198 align:middle
[KYO] I protected my secret
at the cost of someone's life.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:03.455 align:middle
Even though...
I hate myself so much.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:09.252 align:middle
So intensely, so completely.
I wish I'd just go away.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.338 align:middle
Disappear for good.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.799 align:middle
And yet, in the end,
I always protect myself.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:19.637 align:middle
Instead of taking
responsibility, I run away.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:23.266 align:middle
Every damn time.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.477 align:middle
Like now.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.648 align:middle
[KYO] I'm too scared
to even look at your face.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:33.818 align:middle
[KYO] My mom.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.571 align:middle
She was sent flying, too.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:40.367 align:middle
That's how she died.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:44.371 align:middle
Only it wasn't an accident.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:48.833 align:middle
She said she felt guilty
for giving birth to me.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:53.046 align:middle
That she pitied me too
much to be around me.

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.091 align:middle
She was sobbing uncontrollably.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:12:00.428 align:middle
And the next day... she died.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.596 align:middle
[FUNERAL ATTENDEE A] An
accident?

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.140 align:middle
[FUNERAL ATTENDEE B] I thought
there was a suicide note.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.183 align:middle
[FUNERAL ATTENDEE C]
People heard her fighting with

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.644 align:middle
her husband the
night before, too.

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:09.771 align:middle
[KYO'S FATHER]
It's your fault!

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:13.483 align:middle
Kyo, you drove your mom
to do what she did.

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:16.152 align:middle
She's dead because of you!

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.862 align:middle
Just shut up!

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.198 align:middle
No! This isn't my fault!

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.075 align:middle
You don't understand!

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle
No! No! No!

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.455 align:middle
[KYO] Who do you
think you're convincing?

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.166 align:middle
Just admit it.
You know the truth,

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.794 align:middle
and that's why
you've been running.

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:37.465 align:middle
Admit it, fool.

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.593 align:middle
It's my fault.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle
Everything's my fault.

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle
Their lives... I stole them.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.561 align:middle
It's true.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:55.275 align:middle
[KYO]
They both died because of me.

00:12:56.568 --> 00:13:01.281 align:middle
[AKITO panting]

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:04.534 align:middle
[KYO]
Honestly, I almost cried...

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.077 align:middle
...hearing her say that.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.955 align:middle
[KYOKO]
Sounds lonely.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle
[KYO] Because even
if I didn't understand

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:13.543 align:middle
exactly what she meant,

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.254 align:middle
I felt forgiven.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:21.217 align:middle
Forgiven for existing
by a total stranger.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle
[KYO] That probably isn't
what she intended, but still...

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:29.768 align:middle
[KYO]
Today I met someone weird.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.270 align:middle
Huh? Weird?

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.398 align:middle
Oh, um, I mean, not in
a bad way or anything,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.526 align:middle
but different, you know?

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:41.363 align:middle
It's not like we're
friends. We just talked.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:42.822 align:middle
She said to come back sometime.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:43.823 align:middle
[KAZUMA chuckles]

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:47.911 align:middle
Well, in that case,
you'd better go back sometime.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle
[KYO] I thought Master was
the only person in the world

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:53.458 align:middle
who would actually
want me around.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.128 align:middle
My mom was always
consumed by her fear.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.298 align:middle
My dad had nothing
but hatred for me.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.968 align:middle
The Somas looked
at me with contempt.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:09.391 align:middle
I was so used to being rejected,
she was like a ray of light...

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:11.351 align:middle
...of hope.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.313 align:middle
[KYO]
And then there was Tohru.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:17.857 align:middle
I wanted to meet her, too.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:23.405 align:middle
Even so, I only actually
went to see her that one time.

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:28.451 align:middle
I watched her sitting
alone in that room,

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.705 align:middle
and I didn't like how
lonely she looked.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:34.582 align:middle
I wanted both of
them to be happy.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:38.294 align:middle
I wanted their days
to be good ones.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle
I wanted to erase that
loneliness.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:47.137 align:middle
Childish thoughts,
but they got trapped in my mind,

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.723 align:middle
and I found myself thinking,

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:54.602 align:middle
"Are they lonely today?
Are they smiling today?"

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:59.524 align:middle
It was like something
bloomed in my chest

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:02.485 align:middle
and the worry wouldn't go away.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.865 align:middle
[KYO] So that day,
for the first time,

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.784 align:middle
I made the conscious
decision to visit...

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.704 align:middle
...not that it ended well.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle
And when I saw her again,

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:18.376 align:middle
that ending was much worse.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:22.714 align:middle
She said she
wouldn't forgive me.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:26.509 align:middle
She was lying there
in a pool of blood.

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle
She noticed me
standing nearby and said,

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.308 align:middle
"I won't forgive you."

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.895 align:middle
At least that's
what it sounded like.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:41.649 align:middle
And then... I just
stood there, frozen.

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.484 align:middle
[PEDESTRIANS chattering]

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.319 align:middle
[KYO]
My mind went blank.

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.155 align:middle
I couldn't think.
Couldn't understand.

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:48.114 align:middle
Get help! An ambulance! Quickly!

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:52.327 align:middle
[KYO] Then something
snapped... and I ran.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.957 align:middle
[KAZUMA]
Kyo, what happened?

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:06.174 align:middle
[KYO] After that, Master took me
away to live in the mountains.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:10.887 align:middle
[KYO]
I'd fallen into the dark...

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:14.265 align:middle
...and I stayed there, trapped.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:18.144 align:middle
Master tried to
get me to keep living,

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle
but I was so lost.

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:23.692 align:middle
I couldn't forgive
myself for what I'd done.

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:27.946 align:middle
[KYO]
It felt like I deserved to die

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:32.492 align:middle
and the only way to keep
going was to tell myself,

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:35.078 align:middle
"It's not my fault."

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.998 align:middle
Yuki's fault. That's what it is.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.169 align:middle
He's the reason things
turned out like this.

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:46.631 align:middle
That Rat stole all my hope.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:50.635 align:middle
I made it Yuki's fault 'cause...

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle
...it couldn't be mine.

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.181 align:middle
I created a "bad guy" in my mind

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.935 align:middle
and made him take
responsibility for everything.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:03.523 align:middle
It wasn't logical.
It didn't need to be.

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:06.901 align:middle
I just needed him
to be the bad guy.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:10.864 align:middle
As long as I could make
anything inconvenient his fault,

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.117 align:middle
I could pretend to
forget what had happened.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:17.662 align:middle
As long as I could
just keep hating him.

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle
[KYO]
I focused on that--my hate--

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.376 align:middle
and used it to erase my memory

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.212 align:middle
of the day your mom died...

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle
...because of me.

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:31.343 align:middle
[KYO]
I still can't believe

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:34.763 align:middle
I managed to keep it
buried all this time.

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle
[KYO] The other day,
I saw that hat in your room,

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:43.855 align:middle
and it came flooding back.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:47.192 align:middle
The memory I'd
conveniently repressed.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.612 align:middle
The guilt I'd shifted
on to somebody else.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:55.742 align:middle
Figures. My whole life,
saving my own skin's

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:58.828 align:middle
been the one thing
I was ever any good at.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.248 align:middle
Awful, right?

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.959 align:middle
Anyway, when I "got better,"

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:10.173 align:middle
I decided to leave the mountains
and use hatred to keep me alive.

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:14.302 align:middle
Master just gave me a sad smile.

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:17.472 align:middle
My dad had told Akito
I dropped off the map,

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle
so I was summoned to the main
estate when I showed back up.

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.561 align:middle
Akito scolded me.

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:27.315 align:middle
We argued,
and then we made a bet.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.776 align:middle
Before you graduate
from high school,

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.903 align:middle
prove you can defeat Yuki.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:35.156 align:middle
Win, and I'll stop
calling you a monster.

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:38.952 align:middle
I'll even welcome you
as a true zodiac member.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:42.956 align:middle
[KYO] Maybe I was secretly
happy to hear that.

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:47.585 align:middle
Not because I wanted to be
welcomed into the zodiac,

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:50.964 align:middle
but because it fueled my hate.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:55.677 align:middle
So I went straight to find Yuki.

00:18:55.719 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle
Of course, I never imagined
I'd run into you, too.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:06.021 align:middle
Now, Kyo, this young
lady is Tohru Honda.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.814 align:middle
[KYO gasps]

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.607 align:middle
[KYO]
No.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle
What is she doing here?

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:19.868 align:middle
[KYO] Knowing that,
can you forgive me?

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.662 align:middle
The guy who ran away?

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:25.957 align:middle
Who always runs away?

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:28.376 align:middle
Who never said anything?

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:32.505 align:middle
Who pretended he didn't realize?

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:36.217 align:middle
I was so angry and scared.

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:39.471 align:middle
I didn't mean to
get so close to her.

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.892 align:middle
[KYO]
I didn't mean to fall in love...

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:48.563 align:middle
[KYO]
And yet...

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle
[KYO]
How?

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:54.277 align:middle
I can't forgive me.

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:56.363 align:middle
[KYOKO]
I won't forgive you.

00:19:56.404 --> 00:20:00.909 align:middle
Your mom was right to say that.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.747 align:middle
And I don't want you
to forgive me, either.

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:07.665 align:middle
Not now.

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:11.002 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I won't.

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.382 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Is that what you wanna hear?

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:18.343 align:middle
What I have to say?

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:22.389 align:middle
Either I forgive
you or I don't--

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.641 align:middle
is that what it comes down to?

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:29.312 align:middle
Are those choices the
only ones I have left?

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle
I can't believe she'd
really tell you that.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:35.527 align:middle
It doesn't sound
like her... not at all.

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:41.032 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I can't believe it, but...

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:43.868 align:middle
...if you're right,
if you didn't mishear

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:48.164 align:middle
and that's truly what
she said to you, then...

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:49.916 align:middle
Then...

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:51.835 align:middle
I know my choice.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle
The only one I can make
is to go against Mom!

00:20:55.672 --> 00:21:00.844 align:middle
Kyo, please, isn't there any way
I can get you to see the truth?

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.847 align:middle
To accept the fact
that I love you,

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle
and nothing you say
will change that?!

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.852 align:middle
[KYO gasps]

00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:13.273 align:middle
[TOHRU whimpers]

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:22.073 align:middle
[KYO]
I'm... disappointed in you.

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:25.785 align:middle
[KYO]
You won't disappoint me.

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:29.122 align:middle
[gasps] Kyo, wait!

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:31.791 align:middle
Kyo! Come back!

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:34.252 align:middle
Miss Honda.

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:37.213 align:middle
Miss Honda, you should go in.

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:40.133 align:middle
Dry off or you'll
catch cold, okay?

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:42.093 align:middle
I'll be back.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.971 align:middle
That idiot!

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle
[KYO]
Pathetic.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.559 align:middle
I was completely selfish.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:53.605 align:middle
I confessed my own sins,

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:56.608 align:middle
said everything
I wanted to say...

00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:01.613 align:middle
[KYO] ...and trampled
all over your feelings.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.156 align:middle
Then I ran

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:06.076 align:middle
even though I know that
sometimes in this world

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:08.953 align:middle
you don't get the
chance to see someone again,

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:11.039 align:middle
to say you're sorry.

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.124 align:middle
[KYO]
I know that.

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:18.213 align:middle
[KYO] But if I'm just
going to repeat history,

00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:23.635 align:middle
then how's that any different
than knowing nothing at all?

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.774 align:middle
