00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:18.917 align:middle
[TOHRU] "I'll hold another
banquet. And another.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.833 align:middle
I'll hold banquet after banquet.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:26.917 align:middle
An eternal series of gatherings,
forever unchanging.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500 align:middle
I may be lonely now,
but I won't despair.

00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle
Because everyone
is waiting for me

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.083 align:middle
on the other side
of that promise."

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle
[TOHRU] Words spoken in
the long-distant past,

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.417 align:middle
lost in the years that followed.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.667 align:middle
The original memory,
forgotten by everyone.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.125 align:middle
The original promise.

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.125 align:middle
[AKITO]
I'll see you soon.

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:58.583 align:middle
Soon.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:32.125 align:middle
[TOHRU]
You said "girl."

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:34.375 align:middle
You mean Akito is...

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.417 align:middle
...a woman?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle
[gasps]

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:42.125 align:middle
No, that can't be true, can it?

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:43.708 align:middle
[KURENO]
It's true.

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle
I'm sure you've realized that
the Somas have many secrets.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.417 align:middle
That's the biggest of them all.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.625 align:middle
But I don't understand.

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:55.167 align:middle
Akito behaves like a man.
Dresses like one.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.583 align:middle
And the way the others talk,

00:02:57.667 --> 00:03:01.583 align:middle
they don't ever treat
him like... a girl.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:04.708 align:middle
I never even guessed. Not once.

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:07.333 align:middle
It's the way Akito
was brought up.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.542 align:middle
Raised as male from birth.

00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:13.542 align:middle
Someone else chose that for her.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.667 align:middle
Who do you mean?

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.167 align:middle
She almost caught you that
time at the main estate.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle
[gasps]

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.875 align:middle
[gasps]

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.917 align:middle
Hatori! What are
you doing? Get away!

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.083 align:middle
Must I tell you again?
Keep your hands off them.

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:33.792 align:middle
[HATORI]
It's fine. I promise.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:36.458 align:middle
She was just saying hello
to me, nothing more.

00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:38.083 align:middle
[REN]
Exactly.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.042 align:middle
I was simply greeting
dear Hatori, here.

00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:44.125 align:middle
Is that so terribly wrong?

00:03:44.208 --> 00:03:46.167 align:middle
It's never a simple
greeting with you.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.792 align:middle
You're always leering
at the zodiac men.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.167 align:middle
I don't know why you're
here in the first place.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.583 align:middle
Go back to your room
where you belong!

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:57.333 align:middle
[KURENO] She's sequestered.
Rarely leaves her quarters.

00:03:57.417 --> 00:04:02.333 align:middle
A troubled woman,
both mentally and physically.

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:08.167 align:middle
But even so, she continues
to haunt Akito's mind.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle
Ren Soma. Akito's mother.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:16.458 align:middle
[KURENO]
It was her doing.

00:04:16.542 --> 00:04:20.542 align:middle
She's the one who decided to
raise her daughter as male.

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:22.417 align:middle
I don't know much.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle
Neither Akito nor Ren
will speak of it.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle
The only thing I can
say for certain is...

00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:31.292 align:middle
...those two hate each other.

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.167 align:middle
Bitterly.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.792 align:middle
[REN] You really should
watch your mouth

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle
around the zodiac
members, Akito.

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:38.833 align:middle
If you're not careful,

00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:42.625 align:middle
they'll lose all affection
for you, family head.

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:45.917 align:middle
Right, Hatori?
Poor dear. I feel sor--

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.792 align:middle
He doesn't need your
pity--none of them do!

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:51.583 align:middle
We have a bond you
could never understand.

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:55.125 align:middle
We're connected in a world
you could never be a part of.

00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle
Are you still trying to convince
people that nonsense is true?

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:00.875 align:middle
You little fool.

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.583 align:middle
How many times do I have
to explain this to you?

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.375 align:middle
That so-called bond may
make you feel something,

00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:08.708 align:middle
but it is not real love.

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:11.708 align:middle
The "forever unchanging" story
you like to tell yourself

00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:14.083 align:middle
is exactly that: A fantasy.

00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:15.583 align:middle
A delusion.

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.792 align:middle
So of course I pity the ones
who have to put up with it.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:23.333 align:middle
Akito!

00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:25.792 align:middle
[AKITO yells]

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:27.167 align:middle
If that's the case,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.375 align:middle
then maybe you would like
to tell me what is real.

00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:34.042 align:middle
It isn't a parent's love!
We all know that's not perfect.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle
Plenty of people
abandon their children,

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:38.042 align:middle
including members
of the Soma family!

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:41.458 align:middle
Just like you!
Ever think of that?!

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:43.458 align:middle
You can't say what's
real or fake,

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.333 align:middle
what's pretense or worship.

00:05:45.417 --> 00:05:48.542 align:middle
No one can define
those things. No one!

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:51.208 align:middle
The bond that we share
is sacred, you hear me?

00:05:51.292 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle
It's sacred! We will share
an eternity together!

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:57.667 align:middle
[REN]
I'll tell you what's real!

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.958 align:middle
It does exist.
I have it... with Akira.

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:07.542 align:middle
Unlike your zodiac bond,
our bond is real.

00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:10.375 align:middle
I'm going to kill you.
I swear, I'll kill you!

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:12.208 align:middle
[REN]
By all means, go ahead.

00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:15.292 align:middle
Because when I die,
my soul will go to Heaven.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.333 align:middle
Yes! I'll finally be
with Akira again.

00:06:18.417 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle
I don't need you!

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle
[AKIRA]
Akito.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:25.333 align:middle
You're a special child
born to be loved.

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:29.708 align:middle
Everybody was waiting
just for you.

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle
[KURENO]
According to Ren,

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle
the ties that bind Akito
and the zodiac are wrong.

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:38.125 align:middle
She says they're unnatural.
That they're twisted and false.

00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle
And the connection isn't real.

00:06:41.083 --> 00:06:47.708 align:middle
So, she constantly clashes with
Akito, who clings to our bonds.

00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:49.417 align:middle
That day...

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.667 align:middle
The morning after Ren conceived
Akito... I woke up in tears.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle
[KURENO] So did Shigure,
Hatori, and Ayame.

00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:07.333 align:middle
We eldest are the only zodiac
members who know the truth.

00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:10.042 align:middle
That Akito is female.

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:12.042 align:middle
Apparently, Ritsu was
too young to sense

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle
what had happened clearly.

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:18.958 align:middle
But we four all had
the same dream.

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:22.375 align:middle
Akito appeared,
the god we'd not yet met,

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:25.667 align:middle
and gave us a message.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle
"I'll see you soon."

00:07:28.583 --> 00:07:30.708 align:middle
We ran straight to Ren,

00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:34.417 align:middle
who had no idea she was
carrying a child.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.583 align:middle
Tears on our faces,
we just kept saying...

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.708 align:middle
..."We've been waiting for you."

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:43.958 align:middle
It was so strange.

00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:45.417 align:middle
This feeling I didn't recognize

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.792 align:middle
welled up from deep
within my heart,

00:07:48.875 --> 00:07:53.375 align:middle
and I sensed a me that
wasn't me, shouting.

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:57.417 align:middle
It was... the zodiac spirit.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.458 align:middle
Another self. One living
inside me--in my veins.

00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:05.542 align:middle
At the first sign of
a new ego forming,

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:11.167 align:middle
the zodiac blood begins to hound
us, compelling our loyalty.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.792 align:middle
[ISUZU]
They swore a solemn vow.

00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:16.458 align:middle
No matter how many
times they're reborn,

00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:21.292 align:middle
they will return to God's
side and never leave.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:25.292 align:middle
[KURENO] When my curse broke,
I could finally see the truth.

00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:28.667 align:middle
The bond that connected
us wasn't a natural one.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.708 align:middle
It's just like Ren said.

00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:37.667 align:middle
But... at the same time,
I could see something else.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle
A little girl... crying.

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle
[HATORI]
Akito, it's okay.

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:48.458 align:middle
Calm down. It's okay.

00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:51.917 align:middle
This way, ma'am. Let's go.

00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle
[REN]
Really, Akito.

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:58.458 align:middle
Do you think a pathetic crybaby
like you can ever win?

00:08:58.542 --> 00:09:02.042 align:middle
We should leave.
Let's get you back to your room.

00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:09.583 align:middle
[AKITO]
Why? I don't understand.

00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:14.417 align:middle
Why is she always... so mean?

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.417 align:middle
She's cruel! Always.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle
[AKITO]
Hatori! Hatori, give me a hug.

00:09:28.458 --> 00:09:32.458 align:middle
[KURENO] She's still the sobbing
child I can't abandon.

00:09:32.542 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle
Even now.

00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:36.583 align:middle
And I can't see Arisa
while there's another

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:39.125 align:middle
I've sworn to remain beside.

00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:41.958 align:middle
[KURENO]
I'm sorry.

00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:45.875 align:middle
That's a lot.
And difficult to hear.

00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958 align:middle
I guess... I hoped telling you

00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:51.083 align:middle
would help you
understand something.

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:53.833 align:middle
The same Akito who wounds
others so easily

00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:57.167 align:middle
is herself deeply wounded.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.958 align:middle
Maybe now... you see
why I can't leave.

00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:03.458 align:middle
Even if part of me wants to.

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:09.625 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I... I should say something.

00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:13.833 align:middle
I know I should...
find the right words.

00:10:13.917 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle
But I can't. None will come out.

00:10:19.292 --> 00:10:23.625 align:middle
I'm sorry. All I ever do
is hurt other people.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:29.833 align:middle
[KURENO] But even so,
this is the path I chose.

00:10:29.917 --> 00:10:34.458 align:middle
My choice. My will.
No one else's.

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:37.583 align:middle
[KURENO]
I'm sorry.

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:41.250 align:middle
And thank you... for everything.

00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I'm... frozen.

00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:53.208 align:middle
[TOHRU]
It's all... frozen.

00:10:55.167 --> 00:10:59.625 align:middle
[TOHRU]
A chain, a spiral of sorrows.

00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:10.333 align:middle
[TOHRU]
And everything's frozen.

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:14.958 align:middle
[KURENO] I just didn't feel like
working today for some reason.

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle
So I decided to go out
and get some fresh air.

00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle
I'm sorry. But I won't again.

00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:47.958 align:middle
[TOHRU gasps]

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle
Here I am to save the day.
Da-da-da-da.

00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:07.083 align:middle
[YUKI]
Uh. What do you mean?

00:12:07.167 --> 00:12:10.542 align:middle
[HANAJIMA] Just what I said:
Tohru is in my custody.

00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:13.542 align:middle
She'll be mine all night.

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:17.167 align:middle
Um, Hanajima, your phrasing
there is a little sketchy.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.208 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
Is that doubt I hear?

00:12:19.292 --> 00:12:22.167 align:middle
You dare object to my impromptu
Nightgown Festival?

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.208 align:middle
Pretty sure the term you're
looking for is "pajama party."

00:12:25.292 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle
No. I have no objections at all.

00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle
[HANAJIMA] Excellent.
Then I bid you goodnight.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.375 align:middle
Uh.

00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:36.208 align:middle
[YUKI] It's not a problem,
but it is a little strange.

00:12:36.292 --> 00:12:39.208 align:middle
Could something have
happened to Miss Honda?

00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:41.458 align:middle
Who was that you
were just talking to?

00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:43.125 align:middle
It was Hanajima.

00:12:43.208 --> 00:12:46.375 align:middle
Miss Honda is staying the
night over there, apparently.

00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle
Oh.

00:12:48.083 --> 00:12:50.375 align:middle
I guess we'll be doing
takeout for dinner.

00:12:50.458 --> 00:12:51.833 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
My goodness.

00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:54.208 align:middle
Was she really that shocked?

00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:57.542 align:middle
[SHIGURE] If she doesn't
bounce back quickly,

00:12:57.625 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle
Saki might be quite
angry with me.

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:02.208 align:middle
There's a terrifying
thought. Heh.

00:13:02.292 --> 00:13:03.792 align:middle
[YUKI]
Or, hey.

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:06.292 align:middle
Instead of ordering out,
maybe I could try cooking.

00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:07.542 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:09.417 align:middle
Do we have a cookbook
around here somewhere?

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.333 align:middle
No, don't. Please. I'm scared.

00:13:11.417 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle
[YUKI]
It's okay.

00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:14.750 align:middle
I just lacked the proper
motivation before, I think.

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
And the skill!

00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:18.750 align:middle
[HANAJIMA'S MOTHER]
Saki- <i>chan</i> , Saki- <i>chan</i> !

00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle
Do you know if Tohru- <i>chan</i>
has eaten dinner yet?

00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle
I can make something if you
tell me what she likes.

00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:25.208 align:middle
She enjoys shark fin.

00:13:25.292 --> 00:13:28.333 align:middle
You're only saying that because
it's what you want, aren't you?

00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:29.792 align:middle
That's not very nice,
Saki- <i>chan</i> !

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.500 align:middle
Especially since you just ate.

00:13:32.583 --> 00:13:35.625 align:middle
I asked, Mom.
She says no dinner.

00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:37.792 align:middle
But I was thinking,
maybe hot tea?

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:39.625 align:middle
[HANAJIMA'S MOTHER]
Uh! You're absolutely right!

00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:43.208 align:middle
How rude of me! I'll go
brew some right up.

00:13:43.292 --> 00:13:44.792 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
Megumi.

00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle
Go on. You know what to do.

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle
[MEGUMI]
I've got it.

00:13:53.167 --> 00:13:55.833 align:middle
Here we are. I've brought tea.

00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:59.083 align:middle
Oh. Great. Thank you.

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:01.083 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
Be careful, it's hot.

00:14:01.167 --> 00:14:03.583 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Right. Of course.

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:06.375 align:middle
So, um. Hana- <i>chan</i> ?

00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:09.667 align:middle
How did you know I was there?

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.375 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
You were crying.

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:15.542 align:middle
You were crying so loudly,
it drew me like a shout.

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:19.708 align:middle
But in a voice only I can hear.

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:24.208 align:middle
Something truly sad
happened, didn't it?

00:14:24.292 --> 00:14:28.958 align:middle
I, uh... It's just...

00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:35.083 align:middle
Hana- <i>chan</i> , I'm...
I'm so confused.

00:14:38.417 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle
[KURENO] Unlike the others,
mine has broken.

00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:49.667 align:middle
You said "girl."
You mean Akito...

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.667 align:middle
Ren Soma. Akito's mother.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.208 align:middle
I won't see her again.
I'll stay where I belong.

00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I... I was right.

00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:10.458 align:middle
It turns out... Uo- <i>chan</i> 's
Kureno... is Kureno Soma.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.875 align:middle
[TOHRU] I wanted him to
go see her so badly.

00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:22.583 align:middle
I asked him to, but...
he said he can't.

00:15:22.667 --> 00:15:27.708 align:middle
He told me it's because there's
someone he has to stay with.

00:15:27.792 --> 00:15:31.125 align:middle
Someone who needs him.

00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:36.667 align:middle
He's a kind man. A caring man.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.792 align:middle
He isn't doing this
for his own sake.

00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:44.042 align:middle
He's putting someone else's
feelings before his own.

00:15:46.875 --> 00:15:52.208 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I... I couldn't say anything.

00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:56.917 align:middle
So many people have helped
me so many times.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.167 align:middle
But then, when it was my turn,
I couldn't do anything.

00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Why am I so useless?

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.083 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Uo- <i>chan</i> . And Kureno.

00:16:18.167 --> 00:16:19.625 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
Tohru.

00:16:19.708 --> 00:16:23.750 align:middle
Putting other people's feelings
ahead of your own...

00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:26.542 align:middle
...that's something
you do all the time.

00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle
I worry about what doing
that will do to you.

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.917 align:middle
The thing is,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.042 align:middle
if you keep taking on people's
feelings, bearing their burdens,

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:46.583 align:middle
the weight will grow
and grow and grow.

00:16:50.292 --> 00:16:54.958 align:middle
[HANAJIMA] Until one day,
I fear that it will crush you.

00:16:56.625 --> 00:16:58.375 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hey, look at this!

00:16:58.458 --> 00:17:00.792 align:middle
What do you think of
the new scarf I bought?

00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:02.958 align:middle
It even has pom-poms!

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:08.167 align:middle
[HANAJIMA] Buried beneath
other people's pain,

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle
I worry you'd lose
what makes you you,

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:14.833 align:middle
and your smile would disappear.

00:17:16.375 --> 00:17:20.125 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
If it did... If that happened...

00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:25.167 align:middle
[UOTANI] If that happened, it
would be the end of the world.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.083 align:middle
[TOHRU gasps]

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:28.333 align:middle
I invited an additional guest.

00:17:28.417 --> 00:17:29.875 align:middle
Man, I'm beat.

00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.542 align:middle
You told me to hurry, so I ran
all the way here from work.

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:33.792 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
Did you hear us?

00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:35.292 align:middle
[UOTANI]
I heard.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.375 align:middle
Look at you,
crying because of me.

00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:44.875 align:middle
I'm total trash.

00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.333 align:middle
Please don't say that!
You're not trash!

00:17:47.417 --> 00:17:49.708 align:middle
Yeah, all right,
but if I can't say it,

00:17:49.792 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle
you can't say you're useless.

00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:55.542 align:middle
Because I love you, you dummy.

00:17:58.417 --> 00:18:01.542 align:middle
[UOTANI]
You can stop worrying. I'm okay.

00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle
I really am, I mean it.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:09.208 align:middle
I was totally right, though.
Kureno is just like you.

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:11.583 align:middle
You're the same kinda dumb.

00:18:11.667 --> 00:18:17.958 align:middle
I guess that must mean...
I've got a weakness for dummies.

00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:21.792 align:middle
I don't wanna make trouble
for people like the two of you.

00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle
So... that's the end.

00:18:30.417 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle
Yeah, the end.

00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:34.542 align:middle
You got your heart
broken, Arisa?

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:36.042 align:middle
[UOTANI grunts]

00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle
You little brat!

00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:39.958 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
Think before you speak, Megumi.

00:18:40.042 --> 00:18:42.083 align:middle
This is a delicate moment.

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:45.792 align:middle
[MEGUMI] But some things
take time to find.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.833 align:middle
A long time, maybe.

00:18:47.917 --> 00:18:51.375 align:middle
Like a good friend.
Or a person to love.

00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:55.458 align:middle
So it wasn't all for nothing.

00:18:55.542 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle
[UOTANI]
Of course it wasn't!

00:18:57.583 --> 00:19:00.417 align:middle
It never is. That's
my personal creed.

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle
All right.

00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle
Shall we begin setting up for
the evening's festivities?

00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:09.333 align:middle
Can I help, Hana- <i>chan</i> ?

00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:11.292 align:middle
[MEGUMI] I find my heart
beginning to race

00:19:11.375 --> 00:19:13.458 align:middle
as I'm surrounded
by older women.

00:19:13.542 --> 00:19:15.875 align:middle
[UOTANI]
That line again, kid?

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.208 align:middle
[ISUZU gasps]

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle
Hello, Isuzu. You naughty girl.

00:19:32.083 --> 00:19:35.667 align:middle
Skulking around like
a thief in the night.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.917 align:middle
Tell the truth.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.708 align:middle
You've been searching
very hard for something,

00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:41.833 align:middle
haven't you, dear?

00:19:41.917 --> 00:19:44.708 align:middle
I know all about it.

00:19:44.792 --> 00:19:47.875 align:middle
Would you like my help
with your little problem?

00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:54.625 align:middle
[MEGUMI]
They're sound asleep.

00:19:54.708 --> 00:19:56.167 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
Indeed.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle
Things have been rough,

00:19:57.583 --> 00:19:59.875 align:middle
but this gave Arisa a
small measure of closure

00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle
for her feelings, at least.

00:20:02.583 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle
That may be what
she needed most.

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:06.333 align:middle
[MEGUMI]
Is it over, then?

00:20:06.417 --> 00:20:09.125 align:middle
Or could things still work out?

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:12.375 align:middle
I don't know. Perhaps.

00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:15.958 align:middle
But as they say, that's a
story for another time.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.333 align:middle
Romance is pretty tough, huh?

00:20:20.417 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle
Yes, it is.

00:20:23.583 --> 00:20:29.708 align:middle
[TOHRU] The sun goes down,
but it always comes up again.

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:34.875 align:middle
No matter how dark,
no night lasts forever.

00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:40.042 align:middle
So, I'll start again,
one step at a time.

00:20:40.125 --> 00:20:42.917 align:middle
Hi! I'm back from my sleepover!

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.750 align:middle
Shigure?

00:20:44.833 --> 00:20:48.542 align:middle
It's quiet. Wonder
if he's still sleeping.

00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:49.542 align:middle
Well...

00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle
Hold on. A scarf?

00:20:52.583 --> 00:20:55.417 align:middle
Looks like the one I was
wearing yesterday, but...

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.667 align:middle
How? Did I...?

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.083 align:middle
Oh, hey, you're back.
So it is yours, then?

00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:03.625 align:middle
Good thing I made the
call to bring it home.

00:21:03.708 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle
It was just lying all
crumpled in the street.

00:21:07.083 --> 00:21:08.208 align:middle
Uh, I--

00:21:08.292 --> 00:21:10.917 align:middle
I washed it, but not all
the stains came out.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.208 align:middle
If that bugs you,
buy another one.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.333 align:middle
What are you doing?
It isn't dry yet.

00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:21.375 align:middle
Uh. Told ya so.

00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:23.542 align:middle
Thank you so much, Kyo!

00:21:23.625 --> 00:21:26.792 align:middle
I'll be super careful.
I won't drop it again.

00:21:26.875 --> 00:21:29.167 align:middle
Sure. Whatever.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.542 align:middle
You stayed over at
Hanajima's last night?

00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:34.208 align:middle
That's right!
Uo- <i>chan</i> came, too.

00:21:34.292 --> 00:21:36.333 align:middle
We had a Nightgown Festival!

00:21:36.417 --> 00:21:37.708 align:middle
[KYO]
A what now?

00:21:37.792 --> 00:21:40.333 align:middle
We all had such a great time!

00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:44.667 align:middle
Morning. Did you have
fun at the party?

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.792 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Yes, I did, thank you!

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:48.208 align:middle
Tohru, hi!

00:21:48.292 --> 00:21:50.125 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Good morning, Shigure.

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:52.625 align:middle
Please, say you'll never
spend the night away again.

00:21:52.708 --> 00:21:56.667 align:middle
Yuki cooked and it reminded me
just how much I appreciate you.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle
It was so weird, I don't
even know if it was bad.

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:00.875 align:middle
Actually, I take that back.

00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:02.958 align:middle
It was terrible. I almost died.

00:22:03.042 --> 00:22:06.083 align:middle
[YUKI] Maybe motivation
wasn't the problem.

00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:09.583 align:middle
[TOHRU] Little by little,
One step at a time...

00:22:09.667 --> 00:22:11.917 align:middle
...I'll figure it all out.

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Uo- <i>chan</i> ! Hana- <i>chan</i> !

00:22:15.833 --> 00:22:16.833 align:middle
Hey, what's up?

00:22:16.917 --> 00:22:20.167 align:middle
Walk with us, won't you?

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.667 align:middle
[TOHRU]
The truths Kureno told me,

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.292 align:middle
and the mysteries that remain.

00:23:57.167 --> 00:23:59.667 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
"That's an unwavering truth."
