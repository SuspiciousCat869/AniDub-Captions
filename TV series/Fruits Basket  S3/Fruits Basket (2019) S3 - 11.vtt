I mean, I know, but still... Hm?

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.642 position:50% align:center
Tohru, we're taking you home.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
That's sweet of you.
Thanks a lot.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:31.990 position:50% align:center

--[KYO] Toh--
--[TOHRU yelps]

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:41.958 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] My feet,
they just started running,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
taking me away from Kyo.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.
This isn't right.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
It's not what I planned.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:53.011 position:50% align:center
When I saw him again,
what I meant to do...

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
...was smile.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
Tohru... please wait.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.147 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I had a plan.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.777 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER A]
He got dumped, huh?

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:09.611 position:50% align:center
[DAUGHTER A]
He got dumped.

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
[CAT A meows]

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.113 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.783 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna lie, that hurt.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.083 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I messed up.
I handled that all wrong.

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:28.171 position:50% align:center
I'd decided...
that since it was over,

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:31.466 position:50% align:center
since there was nothing
else I could do,

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:37.764 position:50% align:center
nothing else left to say...
no place for me...

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.432 position:50% align:center
...then at least...

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.726 position:50% align:center
If there's anything else
you think you might need,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.061 position:50% align:center
just say the word.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.356 position:50% align:center
Thank you. I should
be all right for now.

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:47.440 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You're okay?

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:52.028 position:50% align:center
Of course I am.
Fit as a fiddle. Heh.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.281 position:50% align:center
Listen, about Kyo...

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.076 position:50% align:center
He just--

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.289 position:50% align:center
Ah! Sorry, ignore me!

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.457 position:50% align:center
Your injury!

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.752 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] So, how are things
going back at home?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.714 position:50% align:center
I bet the laundry has
really piled up, huh?

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:11.923 position:50% align:center
And the dust, too.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.385 position:50% align:center
Oh! And what about the grocery
shopping? Toilet paper...

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:18.221 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
There's this pain in my chest.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:21.016 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'm disappointed in you.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:24.269 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It hurts. So much.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50% align:center
Just hearing his name
is a knife to the heart.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I can't go on like this.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:39.659 position:50% align:center
I need to move forward.
Find some way to get past it.

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:44.247 position:50% align:center
If I don't,
it will hurt everyone.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
Even Kyo.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.962 position:50% align:center
I can't do that. I can't.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:56.718 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Smile. Smile.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.928 position:50% align:center
Smile!

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.807 position:50% align:center
I decided I'd smile
the next time I saw him.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
I even practiced,
smiling over and over again.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
But it was no use.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:17.906 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I told myself it was
okay, and that wasn't a lie.

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
Surely I would be fine,
even without him by my side.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
I would smile and accept that
this is the way things are.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
If I could just do that,
it would be all right.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
But I wanna be with him.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
I want it so badly.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:46.685 position:50% align:center
It hurts. So much.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Wait. Stay back. Please.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
Just for a bit.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] It's no use.
I can't control them.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Please. One second.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Stop it. Stop it.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50% align:center
Stop crying!

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.828 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I don't wanna upset him.

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
I don't want him to hate me.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
I don't want him to be...

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
...even more disappointed in me.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
Hey. I was completely
selfish, wasn't I?

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
I just confessed
all my own sins,

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center
said everything I wanted to say,

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
and trampled all
over your feelings.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
Then I ran, even though I know
that sometimes in this world,

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
you don't get the chance
to see someone again.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
To say you're sorry.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.453 position:50% align:center
I know that.

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
But... if I'm just going
to repeat history, well, then,

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
how's that any different
than knowing nothing at all?

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
--Kyo.
--[KYO] I'm sorry,

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
for making you cry.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.970 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I hurt you so much.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
This is the last time.
I'm fine with that.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
I don't need another after this,

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
but will you please
give me one last chance?

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
What I want is to be with you.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
If I'm going to keep living,
I wanna do it with you.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
You and nobody else.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
Because... I love you.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
So... um...

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
Does that mean...
I'll stay by your side?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
That we'll... be together?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
You're saying I can be with you,

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
stay close to you
and hold your hand?

00:05:56.773 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
You know, you already are.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Even if it's been said dozens,

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
hundreds, thousands of times...

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
Even if the words are
a worn-out clichÃ©...

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
...they're still true.

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
This really is... like a dream.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kyo.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:35.020 position:50% align:center
You may not remember,
but that was our second kiss.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
Huh?! It was? But when...?

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Yeah. Guess I
shouldn't be surprised.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to
remember it on your own.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
If you don't,
then it won't count.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.283 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Okay.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:56.166 position:50% align:center
You think I could... hold you?

00:06:56.207 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
I know as soon as I do,
I'll transform.

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
And sometimes... it'll be hard.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
Being with me will mean
you'll have to deal

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
with this weird body of mine.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Kyo. Haven't you
figured it out yet?

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Because I love you
no matter what.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
I love you. I swear.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:26.404 position:50% align:center
And that love...
it's invincible.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU giggles]

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
Oh. Huh.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
Well, then, maybe
I'm invincible, too.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
I mean, there's nothing
to be afraid of now.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
Not if you're with me.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.527 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Goodbye.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I was jealous.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:20.458 position:50% align:center
That was it. I resented you.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
Compared to me,
you're so pure and pretty.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] The thing is,
though, I'm really not.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
Please, don't use
words like that

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.975 position:50% align:center
to separate people
into categories.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
To keep everyone
at arm's length.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:44.524 position:50% align:center
You think we're so different
because I'm pure and pretty,

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
but the truth is... so are you.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
When you cried out, confessing
your loneliness and fear,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
you were beautifully,
heartbreakingly pure.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
I'm someone who's trying to
destroy the world you know,

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
the future you
always believed in.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
And it doesn't matter whether
it's wrong or right.

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
The reasons behind it
don't change the fact

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:17.932 position:50% align:center
that I'm hurting you,
or lessen the pain.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:23.188 position:50% align:center
But after all this, if you think
you could still bring yourself

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
to be friends with me,
then I'd like that.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Maybe... we could be friends.

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
I'd like that.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I'll say this much...

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.086 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
...you're persistent.

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
There will be time later, right?

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
For new meetings...
and new beginnings.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Once upon a time,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
a certain person lived
high atop a mountain.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
They had been alone for
many, many long years.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
Though isolated at its summit,
they knew that many people

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
lived at the foot
of the mountain.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
And yet, they still
remained alone.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
They were separate, other.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
They knew their incomparable
power, immeasurable life,

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
and boundless memory
made them different

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.176 position:50% align:center
from the people below.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
In truth, they were
afraid of people.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
Afraid of being judged,
of being hurt.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
And they were afraid
of themselves

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
for having such great power,
and yet being so different.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:58.867 position:50% align:center
Then one day, a Cat paid
a visit to the mountain.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] They were bewildered
by the appearance

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
of this unexpected caller,

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
but the Cat bowed
its head respectfully,

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
and said, "I have been
observing you for some time.

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
You are a deeply
mysterious personage.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:19.763 position:50% align:center
I cannot help but
feel drawn to you.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
I am a mere stray cat,

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
but I pray you will allow
me to stay by your side.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
Please, O God."

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50% align:center
The Cat was faithful
to its words

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
and never left the person's
side, not even for a moment.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
This made God very happy.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
and from the Cat's companionship
was born an idea, a possibility.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
"Perhaps," God thought.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
"Those who are
also unlike humans

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
would be willing
to be my friends.

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
If they understand how I feel.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
perhaps we could enjoy
a banquet together."

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
And so, God wrote many,
many invitations,

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50% align:center
and sent them out
into the world.

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:21.908 position:50% align:center
In time, 12 creatures arrived,
come to the mountain to see God.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
Thus, it began.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
God and the 13 animals
held banquet after banquet,

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
gathering whenever
the moon shone.

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
They sang. They danced.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
And God learned what it
was to laugh aloud.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
The moon silently watched
over these banquets,

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center
shared by those who are
different from others.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
But then one night,
the Cat collapsed.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Its natural
lifespan was running out.

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50% align:center
There was nothing to be done.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
The animals began to cry.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
And they realized,
it wasn't just the Cat.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
Eventually, they would all die.
The banquets would end.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] No matter how
joyous they'd been,

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
no matter how precious,
they would end.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
But then, God chanted
the words of a spell,

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
and traced a circle
around a sakÃ© cup's rim.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center
Bringing the liquid to
the dying Cat's mouth,

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
God fed it a sip from the cup.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
Then turning to
the others, said,

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
"Here and now, I make the
bonds between us eternal.

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:44.199 position:50% align:center
Even after we die,
we shall remain connected--

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
tied to one another.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
No matter how many times
we die and are reborn,

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
our banquets will continue,
just like this.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
We shall be eternal
and unchanging.

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
Friends forever,
as we were meant to be."

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
God's guests all nodded firmly,

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
and the Rat sipped
from the oath cup.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
The Ox followed,

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
and then the Tiger, the Rabbit,
and the rest in order,

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
sealing their vow.

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
But as the final animal,
the Boar, finished drinking,

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:30.245 position:50% align:center
the Cat began to weep feebly.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
"God, O God, why did you make
me drink from that cup?

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
I neither need,
nor want eternity."

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Those softly spoken
words echoed loudly.

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:53.476 position:50% align:center
To God and the other animals,
they were a rejection.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
Saddened by the Cat's
pronouncement,

00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
they rebuked and admonished
their fellow guest.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:04.821 position:50% align:center
Still, the Cat continued,

00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
"God, O God, things must end.
We are mortal.

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
Let us accept these truths,

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
scary and lonely
though they are.

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
I count it a blessing to have
been with you for even a moment.

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:31.139 position:50% align:center
If we do meet again in the
cycle of death and rebirth,

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:34.726 position:50% align:center
I hope it is not
only by moonlight.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
I would like to know what
your smile looks like

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
illuminated by the sun.

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
I would like to be there when
you smile not only among us,

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
but among humans, too."

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.871 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
With a final flick of its tail,

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
the Cat fell down and died.

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
There it lay,
disregarded by the others,

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:07.050 position:50% align:center
who were preoccupied by
the perceived betrayal.

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Some time later,
the other animals began to die,

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.558 position:50% align:center
one by one.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
Eventually,
the Dragon's time came.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
With its passing,
God was alone once more.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
And then, at long last,
God's death came as well.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] But, strengthened
by their promise,

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
and knowing this end would
lead to a new beginning,

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.293 position:50% align:center
God was unafraid.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
"I'll hold another
banquet. And another.

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
I'll hold banquet after banquet,

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
an eternal series of gatherings,
forever unchanging.

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
I may be lonely now,
but I won't despair.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:01.312 position:50% align:center
Because everyone
is waiting for me

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
on the other side
of that promise."

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:07.944 position:50% align:center
Words spoken in the
long-distant past,

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
lost in the years that followed.

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
The original memory,
forgotten by everyone.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:19.622 position:50% align:center
The original promise.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I can let go now, right, Father?

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] It's okay to stop being
special, to stop being a god,

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
and just be me, isn't it?

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
To start a life
that's truly my own.

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
I... I'm...

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
I'm hurt. I'm scared.

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
I don't know who'll
love me now, but...

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
...goodbye.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Mine.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
Mine!

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
Here, Boss. You need somethin'?

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:12.467 position:50% align:center
If you're thirsty,
I can bring more tea.

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:15.303 position:50% align:center
It'll be a while till
lunch is ready, though.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
What is it, Boss?

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] Mine... I was
born to be with you.

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:29.109 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
To love you.

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
At last I can say it.

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
[MINE crying]

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Goodbye, everyone.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
[RITSU'S MOTHER gasps]

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? Ritsu,
are you all right? Are you hurt?

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] It's hard and
lonely... saying goodbye.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] They say that after
"goodbye" comes "hello,"

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
and that all new beginnings
come from endings.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
ClichÃ©s can wait.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
It's painful, isn't it?

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
Lonelier than you would think.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] I don't wanna
hear them right now.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
Cry with me, please.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
There's nothing we can do.

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
It's over. So please,
just cry with me.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Sob with me. Scream with me.

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:47.812 position:50% align:center
Feel with me.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:54.569 position:50% align:center
We lost what we had, and we're
left with no guarantees.

00:19:54.611 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
Cry with me, for the terror
of living in this new world.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Huh. So this
is what it feels like.

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] As we cling
to hope for tomorrow,

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:19.803 position:50% align:center
please, do this much:
Cry, and cry, and cry.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
Like we did when we were
first born into the world.

00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Goodbye.

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
Goodbye. Goodbye.

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
[GOD]
Goodbye.

00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:24.052 position:50% align:center
[GOD] When did that
promise become a curse?

00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:29.140 position:50% align:center
When did our fellowship
become a burden?

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:33.311 position:50% align:center
The days we spent together
were happy ones.

00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:37.565 position:50% align:center
We didn't want them to end.

00:22:37.607 --> 00:22:42.195 position:50% align:center
In the beginning, there
was love and comradery,

00:22:42.237 --> 00:22:44.948 position:50% align:center
but time marched on.

00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:48.493 position:50% align:center
People changed.

00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:52.664 position:50% align:center
And happiness turned to sorrow.

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:58.044 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:22:58.086 --> 00:23:02.966 position:50% align:center
Still... even after
the promise wore thin,

00:23:03.008 --> 00:23:09.014 position:50% align:center
broke down and lost its shape,
you all carried it with you.

00:23:11.016 --> 00:23:15.979 position:50% align:center
[GOD] So, what I want to
say more than anything...

00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:20.817 position:50% align:center
[GOD]
...is thank you.

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:23.361 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:27.574 position:50% align:center
Words spoken in the
long-distant past.

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:32.954 position:50% align:center
The original memory,
forgotten by everyone.

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:45.633 position:50% align:center
[GOD]
It would be many long years

00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:51.306 position:50% align:center
before the Cat's plea,
fervent and honest,

00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:53.683 position:50% align:center
was finally heard.

00:23:58.021 --> 00:24:00.106 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
"You fought well."
