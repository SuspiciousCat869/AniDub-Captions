00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.514 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Here we are.

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.933 position:50% align:center
I'll leave water for you.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.310 position:50% align:center
Kureno.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
Tell me, do you
know what this is?

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.358 position:50% align:center
No.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
That's right. You wouldn't.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
What is it? What's inside?

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Father.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.373 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Yes, absolutely!

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.667 position:50% align:center
My husband and I are thrilled
to have a baby girl.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
So is Hiro, of course.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
Hinata is doted on constantly.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
Should I be letting
you get back to her?

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Oh, no, it's fine.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
Hiro's got things well in hand.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
He's taken to being
a big brother so naturally.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.975 position:50% align:center
She'll grow up wanting
to be just like him!

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.854 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
So... any word on when Isuzu

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.898 position:50% align:center
will be released
from the hospital?

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
[KISA'S MOTHER]
None.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.319 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Seems like an
especially long stay this time.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
I was hoping to
introduce her to Hinata.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:16.034 position:50% align:center
But apparently, she didn't even
get to go to her graduation.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
[KISA'S MOTHER]
Really? That's troubling.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Haru!

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.958 position:50% align:center
Rin, she's back in the hospital?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.672 position:50% align:center
Which one? How is she?
I'd like to know.

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:29.756 position:50% align:center
Why now?

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:33.301 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I only just found out
from Miss Honda. She's worried.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.553 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Worried? About Rin?

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:39.015 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, they've gotten
pretty close lately.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:43.228 position:50% align:center
Rin, you made
yourself a friend.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.356 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Anyway, like I was saying,

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.525 position:50% align:center
Miss Honda's very concerned.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:51.403 position:50% align:center
Like she has a bad
feeling about it.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
I see.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.572 position:50% align:center
Afraid I can't help you, though.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.242 position:50% align:center
Wait, so you don't know, either?

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.243 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Hmm...

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:02.247 position:50% align:center
Far as I can tell, seems
nobody knows any details.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.581 position:50% align:center
And the plot thickens.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:07.919 position:50% align:center
Hey, this isn't some
mystery novel. Uh.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
Haru... are you okay?

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.299 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I'm okay.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.679 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Eh. Yeah.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.724 position:50% align:center
I guess normally I'd
be in panic mode.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:24.060 position:50% align:center
Maybe there's something
wrong with me.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.813 position:50% align:center
Maybe something's
always been wrong.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:27.939 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Haru.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.191 position:50% align:center
If I learn anything,
I'll tell you.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
When you see Honda,
thank her for me.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:37.949 position:50% align:center
And if it all goes bad,
be there for her.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.621 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Huh? Hiro-<i>chan</i>!

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
Huh? Kisa? You've
been home already?

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:47.625 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Yep!

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.587 position:50% align:center
Got changed and now I'm
on my way to your house.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:52.505 position:50% align:center
What about you, though?

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.466 position:50% align:center
You're still in your
uniform and everything.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I stopped by Kagura's
place on the way home.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
You know, to see
if Rin was back yet.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
And... I'm guessing she's not?

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:07.312 position:50% align:center
Mhm. They haven't seen
or heard from her.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.356 position:50% align:center
So, you're coming
to visit Hinata?

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Mh-hm.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.567 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
She's too young to experience

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
all the same emotions we do.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
But I hope she'll
start smiling soon.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
And by then, you'll be
an even better big brother

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
that you already are.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
We'll see.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
But... yeah. I wanna be.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.086 position:50% align:center
When I look at my sister,

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
I realize what a
self-absorbed idiot I am.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
I mean, here's this tiny person

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
who doesn't even know
good from bad yet.

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50% align:center
She just is the way she is.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
And then there's me. Insecure.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
Wrapped up in my
vanity and fear.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
I'm so small and stupid.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:57.445 position:50% align:center
I wanna be stronger.
Someone who can protect her.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking about
that a lot lately.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
So... Well, it's not
the only reason why,

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:08.456 position:50% align:center
but there's something
I wanted to tell you.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
Kisa, I'm so sorry--

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
Oh. Whoops.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.089 position:50% align:center
Ugh, seriously?

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
If you're going to loom
over people like that,

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
at least be a little more
aware of your surroundings.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.178 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
Something's changed.
You got taller.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
Hands off.

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Be careful on your walk.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
You be careful!

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
And if you're looking
for Rin, she's not back.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Maybe that's
none of my business.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
What you said, a while ago,

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:43.575 position:50% align:center
about Rin...
and how she was sad...

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
...did she seem hurt?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
What? Like, after the play?

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
Look, that stuff I told you,
it was wrong, okay?

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
I was only projecting
my own guilt.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
But, um, I do know that
she was suffering.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
Haru, Akito pushed Rin
off the second-floor balcony.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.018 position:50% align:center
Those injuries, they weren't
the result of some accident.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
Akito found out that you
were together, and then...

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.402 position:50% align:center
What are you doing out here?

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT B gasps]

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
Oh, Kureno. I should
ask you the same.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
This place is off-limits.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
Exactly, so... why would you
be delivering a tray of food?

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
This cottage, it's for the
Cat, and the Cat alone.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
No one else can go inside,
and normally no one wants to.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
So who's in there now?

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
Please. Don't ask. I can't.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
You'll get in trouble? With who?

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
I can't say!

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
You don't understand.
My father, he's indebted to...

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
If I do something wrong...

00:05:56.981 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
If... If I fall out
of favor, then...

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Akito.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
When Akito...

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
Kisa.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Huh?

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
When Akito hit you... and you
wound up in the hospital...

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
...that was my fault.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] It's true. And I've
always wanted to apologize.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.843 position:50% align:center
To you, too, Haru.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
Both Akito and Rin
said to keep quiet.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
If you're mad,
I understand, but...

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:35.687 position:50% align:center
You should know.
Rin's trying to break the curse!

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
She's doing everything she can.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
Everything to free you from
Akito--and from herself.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
That's why... she left you.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
Give me the key.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
You can say I overpowered you.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
It's not right.
You know it isn't.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT B]
Sh-She... She hasn't eaten.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
She hasn't had anything
for days now,

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
and at this rate,
she's going to die.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
Please save her.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
You need to tell her
she can stop now.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
At this rate, she's going
to lose everything.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
She'll just suffer
alone forever!

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Haru...?

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
[KISA crying]

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
[KISA] Hiro-<i>chan</i>,
all along, you've felt guilty

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:39.209 position:50% align:center
because I got hurt?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
Even when I was smiling...

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
...and having a good time...
inside, you were hurting.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.227 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
how selfish I am.

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
I never noticed
something was wrong!

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:03.692 position:50% align:center
Wait, why are you
apologizing to me?

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
That's not right!
I'm the one who...

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Huh?

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
It was my fault.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
You can stop now.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
It's okay. Really.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
[KISA] Hey, Hiro-<i>chan</i>,
Isuzu's been gone a long time.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
Where do you think she is?

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I don't know, but...

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] ...I hope she comes
back in one piece.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
What's this about?

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
Uh! Hatsuharu, stop!

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
You have no right.
Even if you are a zodiac member.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50% align:center
Shut up, hag.
Get the hell outta here.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
Uh! How dare you
order me ar--

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.407 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
It's fine.

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
Clearly Hatsuharu here
has something important

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
he'd like to discuss with me.

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.455 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
Now, what did you need?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
I wanna know why you pushed her.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
Why did you push Rin?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
What are you talking about?

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
I pushed her? Really?

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
That's news to me.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
Where did you hear
that, I wonder?

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
An oracle.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
Heh. You say such
ridiculous things. Ha!

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center
What a simple boy you are.

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.941 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Stop laughing.

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
Tell me why you did it.
Were you trying to kill her?

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Hmm.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.659 position:50% align:center
So you believe in oracles,

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
but you don't believe
in me, your god.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
I'm curious, why
would you get so angry

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.543 position:50% align:center
about whatever
happened to Isuzu?

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
You always have been
awfully nice to the girl.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
Is it out of pity? Compassion?

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
Or some other reason?

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
Because I love her!

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.390 position:50% align:center
But you've known that
for a long time now,

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
so obviously you're just
trying to piss me off!

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
Tell me, where's Rin?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
Nobody else seems to know,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
but I'd bet anything
that you do.

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
What a worthless conversation.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
Where did you get
an idea like that?

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
With Rin, you've always
been so cold. So harsh.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
It's not just her, either.
You treat all girls that way.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
All the cruel things
you do, the insults,

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
is that how God's supposed
to be? Is it?!

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
You knew how I felt, and yet you
still came storming in here,

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
declaring your love for her.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.310 position:50% align:center
You knew I hated Isuzu.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
You knew, and you
said it anyway.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Where is she?

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
Where is Rin right now?

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
I don't know, so stop asking.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
Where the hell did you put her?!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
I said I don't
know where she is!

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
Why is it I'm always--?

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
Isuzu's at the hospital.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
With Hatori. He drove her.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
She wasn't fully conscious,
but please, don't worry.

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:11.296 position:50% align:center
I'm told her life
is not in danger.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
Akito, you mustn't
do these things.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
No matter who you are
or how you feel,

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
there are some things that
just shouldn't be done.

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
So... where was she?

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.231 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
The Cat's place.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.735 position:50% align:center
She was locked away in
the room meant for the Cat.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Kureno, why would
you betray me like this?

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
No, Akito, listen...

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
You're cruel!

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
Enough of your bullshit!

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
You lie and lie and lie,
and he's the one who's cruel?

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50% align:center
Were you trying
to kill her again?

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
So what if I was?

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
It's your fault for choosing
that girl over your god.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
You might as well have
dug her grave yourself.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
No, stop!

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Rin.

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
Hey, what happened?

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
Were you having
another nightmare?

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Yeah, but I'll be okay now.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
You're here,
so it'll all be okay.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.861 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
That's right.

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
And I knew... all along.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
I knew that our love might
be digging Rin's grave.

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
That she would be the target
for Akito's wrath, not me.

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
Deep down, I realized...

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
But I wanted her.
Wanted to make her mine.

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
The simple truth is, even more
than I wanted to protect her,

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
I wanted to keep her to myself.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] You're here,
so it'll all be okay.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:53.064 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
It's not okay. None of it.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
I'm no different than the adults
who always put themselves first.

00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
Me being with her
didn't make it okay.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
If Rin got hurt because of me,

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
because of what I
pretended not to know,

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:10.832 position:50% align:center
then it doesn't matter how
much I thought I loved her.

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
Because that love...
is worthless.

--[HATSUHARU] Don't talk.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:28.558 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
No. Hatsuharu.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.019 position:50% align:center
Wait. Don't go.

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
Don't go, Hatsuharu!

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
Hatsuharu?

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Hatsuharu. Hatsuharu!

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
You should go,
and don't come back.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:48.703 position:50% align:center
Go to Isuzu. She needs you.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
When we found her
in that room...

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
...the first word she
said was your name.

Why?

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
Why does everyone betray me?

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
They don't want to betray you,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center

You, too!

Why would you do such a thing?

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:07.282 position:50% align:center
Carrying her off without
permission like that?

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
Surely you realized your actions

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
would constitute a
betrayal of Akito.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
So what, then?

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
You're saying that I should've
just left her there?

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
If that's what Akito wishes,
then yes, you should have.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
You--

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:50.760 position:50% align:center
If you grant my wish,
then I will grant yours.

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:53.304 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you what
you need to know.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
Simply fetch something for me.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
Something that should
rightfully be mine.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
You'll find it in Akito's room.

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
I can't get anywhere near there,
but perhaps you could.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
If you're careful.

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
Akito would be too insecure to
keep it very far from reach.

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
It'll be hidden by nothing
more complicated than a door.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
This thing you want...
what is it?

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
[REN]
A precious treasure.

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Just give her this,

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
and I'll learn what
I need to know.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
Haru, I can finally
set him free.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Oh... right.

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
I get it now.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] Akito reminds me
of Mama when Mama got mad.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I don't want to see your face,

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
or any other part
of you ever again.

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
So I'll give you a choice:

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
You stay in exile,
or Hatsuharu loses his sight.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
Want to test me,
see if I'm bluffing?

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
No. You don't need to do that.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
I'll stay here.
I'll stay until I die.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
Haru, I'm sorry.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
I was close. I almost
learned the secret.

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
But I'm no good. Just worthless.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.038 position:50% align:center
I can't do a single thing right.

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:49.421 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] It's no wonder
they didn't want me.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
Oh, my. So that's what
happened to Isuzu.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
How unfortunate.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
Although I suppose
it does explain

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
why there hasn't been any sign
of my wish being granted.

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A]
But, ma'am,

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:03.518 position:50% align:center
what you told her about
breaking the zodiac curse,

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.937 position:50% align:center
do you really know of
a way it can be done?

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
[REN laughs]

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
How on earth would I know
something like that?

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.111 position:50% align:center
Thought as much.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
[REN]
I've always disliked that girl.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:19.159 position:50% align:center
Viscerally.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
That said, I did hope
she would prove to be

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center
at least marginally useful.

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:28.043 position:50% align:center
But what worth could
a worthless child have?

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I'm still here after all.

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
Was I dreaming that whole time?

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
I just wish my last dream
could be of Haru.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
Of being held by him, comforted
by his warmth and kindness.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
Can I have that much,
if I'm dying?

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru?

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
It's Haru. I got my wish.

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
I'm dreaming of him!

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry... I couldn't do it.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
I tried, but I failed.

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:16.466 position:50% align:center
I couldn't find the key
to your freedom.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
To your happiness.

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
So it's over?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
Your journey is over,
right, Rin?

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Uh-huh.

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
Then... welcome home.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
If your journey is over,

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
I need you to come back
home to me, or else...

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
...I'll be lonely, okay?

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru is kind.

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
All right. I guess I had
better come home, then.

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:59.426 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] If I can go home to
Haru, then I'm glad, truly.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
This is...

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
...the best dream.

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
It's not a dream.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:11.021 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
I've been looking for you.

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
Everyone's worried.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you
made it this far

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
in the condition you're in.

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop. Please, I can walk.

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm still a dumb kid.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
I thought I was worthless

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
for not seeing how much
pain you were in,

00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:31.332 position:50% align:center
and maybe that was true, but...

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU gasps]

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:36.671 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] ...I've grown
up a little since then.

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:41.760 position:50% align:center
Enough that I can carry you
when you need me to, at least.

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
I'm not giving up on you, Rin.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
So, walk on your
own when you can.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
And when you can't,
let me carry you.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.483 position:50% align:center
I like carrying you.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.777 position:50% align:center
You're not a burden.

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:03.281 position:50% align:center
You never have been. I promise.

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:08.161 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
The end... of a long journey.

00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:15.335 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Um... Haru?

00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:16.878 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yeah.

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:19.881 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru.

00:22:19.923 --> 00:22:21.466 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yeah.

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:24.719 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I'm home.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.396 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Welcome home.

00:23:57.187 --> 00:24:00.774 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
"I mean... you know, right?"
