[MINE]
Hey, Boss?

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.849 position:50% align:center
Boss!

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.642 position:50% align:center
Oh, there you are.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.436 position:50% align:center
So, what do you want for dinn--?

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:21.354 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Mine, a question.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.484 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
If I remain cursed forever...

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
...will you leave me and
seek happiness elsewhere?

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
[MINE] I'm the one who decides
what makes me happy, you know.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.957 position:50% align:center
Your Mine isn't going anywhere.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
She's absolutely crazy about you
and wants to stay here forever.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.757 position:50% align:center
Do you object?

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
What's that?

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
You've been looking
at it a while.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50% align:center
Oh, I was just thinking
it might be nice

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center
to take a trip somewhere.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.396 position:50% align:center
Taking a trip, huh?
That sounds nice.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.273 position:50% align:center
Um, what about you?

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
Is there anywhere
you'd like to visit?

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.782 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
No.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] I finished tallying
everything, President.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.329 position:50% align:center
President?

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Thank you. That was fast.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:25.377 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
I, um... did my best.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.380 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Machi.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:36.554 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
There's... something I've--

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:39.641 position:50% align:center
Hey, you guys,
anyone seen Kimi's brush?

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.267 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
You probably left it at home.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:42.018 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.729 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't leave the house
without something so important.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.148 position:50% align:center
Well, have you seen it, Machi?

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.484 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
No. I haven't.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.861 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Yun-Yun, what about you?

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.196 position:50% align:center
Me, either.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.114 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Just give up...

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:57.325 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Somehow, I have to tell her.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:02.747 position:50% align:center
She needs, deserves to know...
that I'm not a normal human.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I'm curious.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
What exactly are you
hoping to accomplish

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.638 position:50% align:center
by holing up in your
room like this?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
If you just stay in
there long enough,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
the world will shape
itself to your will?

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
Is that what you think?

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
Are you letting him leave?

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I don't care anymore.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
That cold-blooded bastard--
I'm done with him.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
If he won't be kind
to me when I'm miserable,

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
when I'm really suffering,
then... forget about him.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
If that's what you believe,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
you'll be sorely disappointed.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
Time marches on. So do people.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.141 position:50% align:center
You'll be left behind.

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
Whoa. No way?

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
I'm totally serious!

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
Hey! Who's that guy? Is he new?

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE C] Come on,
you know him. The Soma kid!

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
[GARDEN STUDENT C]
What? Really?

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
Alone? Wanna walk home together?

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
Yes! I'd love to.
Thanks, Momiji.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, he grew up!
I mean, like, all the way up.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
I know, it's crazy!

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
[GARDEN STUDENT C]
He was obsessed

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
with ice cream and candy.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.585 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE C] Ran around
like a hyper little kid

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
with that bunny backpack of his.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
He's practically a man now!

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
Oh, idea! Let's get
ice cream on the way!

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Or not...

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Hmm...

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
Everyone still looks super
shocked whenever they see me.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
You grew so fast,

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
and you're even more handsome
than you were before!

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
What? Me? I'm handsome?

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
Very! Just like a prince!

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
Good to know. Huh.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I'm glad
that I got taller.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong,
being little was fun.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
There were things I could do
and stuff I could get away with

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
that I couldn't have otherwise.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center
But I want people to
see... that I'm a man.

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, it's Yuki and Haru!

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys! Over here.
Wait up. We'll walk with you!

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.230 position:50% align:center
Look at that. S'crazy, right?

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
If you didn't know any better,

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:59.901 position:50% align:center
you'd think those two were
a couple of lovebirds.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
Oh, Hatsuharu!

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
I heard the good news.
About Isuzu, I mean.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.409 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah, that's right.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
I told Miss Honda
about the hospital.

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
That you found out the address.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yeah. Sure did. Thanks.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
We're heading home.
Thought we'd stop for ice cream.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
Hey, I know! Let's buy a bunch
and eat it at Shii-<i>chan</i>'s.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50% align:center
You in?

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
Heh. That sounds perfect!

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
We'll get lots of flavors.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
And maybe an ice
cream cake, too!

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, we couldn't. Could we?

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing she's
never had one.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.106 position:50% align:center
And she's worried something
so fancy sounding

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
must be super expensive.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Uh. Uh...

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Uh...

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
Hi!

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.158 position:50% align:center
It's, uh, nice to, um...

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
Watch it. I don't like when
people intimidate Kisa.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
I didn't do anything!

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
Wait. Where'd you come from?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
The bathroom, jerk.

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Well, anyone who came
home to her just sitting there

00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
would wonder what was up!

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
--Oh. I, uh--
--[HIRO] That's the issue here?

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
She's younger than you,
so be nice. Uh.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
Ha. Whatever. When's the
female resident coming home?

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
Oh, and now you're
going to act like

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
you're letting me
win or something?

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
Okay, uh. It's, um, nice to--

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
You know, assuming
we're that rude

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
actually makes you
the rude o-- Ugh.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
Shigure was just on his way
out when we got here.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
Going to the estate, he said.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Your attitude's pissing me
off more than the insults would.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:31.493 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Um! Excuse me, but--

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
It's... nice to see you!

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah. You, too.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
Well, she'll probably
be home soon.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:45.465 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
I did it!

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
I really talked to him!

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
Heh. Good job.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.387 position:50% align:center
He's nice.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
Maybe he doesn't always
like to show it, but still,

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
I should have known.

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center
He's so kind to
Tohru, after all.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.857 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Another round today?

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
Don't you ever get tired
of taunting Akito?

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
You're always so
judgmental, Doc.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50% align:center
Showing up out of
nowhere to yell at me.

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
I live here, you know.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.953 position:50% align:center
And take this seriously.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center
She seems to withdraw
further into herself

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
every time you visit.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:21.501 position:50% align:center
Really, you don't say!
Oh, no! That's terrible!

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] Knowing I'm
the same age he is

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
makes me truly sad sometimes.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
Stop it. You're too old
to be playing the brat.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
Try being honest about
your feelings for once.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
The longer you do this,
the more stubborn she'll get.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:39.686 position:50% align:center
Ah. You realize that's more
or less what I'm going for.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
I assure you,
I'm perfectly aware.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
And it's absurd.

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
This endless battle of wills

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
against someone
younger than you.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
The way you act, it sometimes
seems like you truly hate her.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
Even to me.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
Maybe just try to show
a little kindness.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
You say that, but from me,

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
"kindness" is nothing more

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
than a hastily manufactured
afterthought.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.715 position:50% align:center
Your version's the real deal

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
to which mine can't
hope to compare.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
I should probably find that sad.
For some reason, I never have.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
It's strange, you know.

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
I mean, the way my heart
seems to function.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
I never did crave
my parents' love.

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
And being possessed,
which bothers you all so much,

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
has never been more
than a minor hindrance

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
as far as I'm concerned.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
If this is what you call
being "twisted"...

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
...then I suppose
that's what I am.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
And the fact is,
I can't even find that sad.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
Maybe that makes me very alone.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
What does a person like
me need? Was it wrong?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
Should I have dreamed
about somebody else instead?

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the point is,
I'm not a nice guy,

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
so why should I bother
pretending to be one, right?

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] You're not even
going to try, are you?

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Don't you understand?

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
A generous kindness like yours,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
or a detached kindness
like Kureno's.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
Even assuming Akito wants
either of those from me,

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
it's not going to happen.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
Because if one thing's certain,

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
it's that I'm not looking
to become her father.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Well, I wonder what
we should do for dinner.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
We've got quite a crowd.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
Let's have a barbecue!
Who's with me?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
You know, the two of you
really should've called first.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
Just showing up like
that's impolite.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
I do feel a little bad about
not giving them any warning.

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
But still, if the
person who's forced

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
to make dinner for us
is fine with it,

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
how big of a deal can it be?

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Um, Miss Honda?

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50% align:center
Oh, I got distracted! Sorry!

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
No, it's fine.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
I want to have a barbecue!

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
I seriously doubt
that this house

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
has the necessary
equipment for one.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.578 position:50% align:center
We don't need any
special equipment.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
We really do, though.

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Barbecuing's simple.

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50% align:center
All it takes is a fire to grill
the meat over, right?

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yeah. This oughta do it.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.590 position:50% align:center
[YUKI, HIRO]
What are you planning?

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
A well-grilled steak.

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
It's what's for dinner.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
Morons. At this rate,
we'll starve.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
I vote... curry.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, is Kyo not home yet?

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
We saw him a little earlier,

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:26.186 position:50% align:center
but maybe he went
up to his room?

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
No problem. I'll go get him!

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hm?

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on?
You're eating here, too?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
It's okay. We went with curry.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
Right, whatever that means.

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
You sure got tall.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
<i>Ja</i>, I know!

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
If this keeps up,
I'll be taller than you.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.412 position:50% align:center
And probably better
looking, too!

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
Then maybe, if I'm lucky...

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
...when I propose to her,
Tohru will actually say "yes."

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Kyo, you get it, right?

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
If you give up, then something
like that might really happen.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center
You'd lose her.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
So you have to hang in there.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
I will, too.

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
No more thinking,
"There's no point,"

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
and shrugging off my dreams.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
It would sting, wouldn't it?

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
If some other guy
took Tohru from you?

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center
Well, good talk.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
Now we'd better see if they
need help with the curry!

00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
Come on. Let's go!

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.251 position:50% align:center
I guess stranger
things have happened,

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
but to come home to a
soup kitchen in my yard

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50% align:center
is a rather odd experience.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.340 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
We made curry for dinner!

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
What thoughtful children you
all are. Papa is so proud!

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh, Yuki, what's his deal?

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's an idiot.
Just ignore him.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.226 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Shigure, if you
haven't eaten already,

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
you're welcome to have some.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
Our dear Tohru.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
How are you? Working hard?

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yes. I try to.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
All those years ago...

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
Maybe it actually should've
been you I dreamed of.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:07.245 position:50% align:center
Yes, maybe that's the answer.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
What somebody like me really
needs is somebody like you.

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
The author thinks,
contemplating his own backstory.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
Just thinking... about what-ifs.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
And I'd love some curry.
Though not too much, please.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right. Sure!

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
Hey, Tohru! It's time
for the ice cream!

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Coming!

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.774 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] People change,
and their feelings with them.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
Time marches on.

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I want you to come soon,

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:45.116 position:50% align:center
or you might miss it altogether.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
[AKIRA]
Listen closely now.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.205 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time,

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.916 position:50% align:center
God made an invitation
to the animals.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
God said, "I'm having
a banquet tomorrow

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
and all of you are
invited to attend it."

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
Do you know who God
in this story was?

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.510 position:50% align:center
You, Akito.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
A special child.
The chosen child.

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
One who was born to be loved.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
Your future holds no loneliness
or fear, only bonds.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
Bonds that will last
forever--unchanging.

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50% align:center
You have been promised eternity.
No one will ever leave you.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Hatsuharu.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
Don't go, Hatsuharu!

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
Hatsuharu?

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.746 position:50% align:center
Hatsuharu!

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Momiji.

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Oh.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] I didn't think
it would come so suddenly.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
The end.

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Momiji.

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
Momiji.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
Don't go. Please stay.

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
Don't leave. Stay with me!

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
What was that?

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
All those feelings...
inside me, but not of me.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
Watching from some corner
of my heart, like guards.

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
I don't see it.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
What has kept me bound to
this person for so long?

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] So small...
and weak... and pitiful.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Momiji.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
That look! Stop it! I can't...

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:44.069 position:50% align:center
Your eyes. Don't
look at me like that.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.236 position:50% align:center
Don't.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] I think you should
go back to your room.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
Really, you don't look well.

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
And in case you're worried,
I won't tell anyone about this.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.376 position:50% align:center
Go home.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.378 position:50% align:center
For now.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
I need time. I'm confused, too.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.510 position:50% align:center
We can talk more
about this tomorrow.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:16.267 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yuki.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
Hey. Seen Momiji?

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Uh, no, I haven't.
Why, wasn't he in class?

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
He was, but he showed
up pretty late.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.654 position:50% align:center
Did something happen to him?

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
Don't think so.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:35.203 position:50% align:center
But it's like... he's off.

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
He seems the same as always,
but something's... different.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
Hey, you guys!

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hello.

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Honda, have you seen Momiji?

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:52.887 position:50% align:center
I haven't, not today.
Why, is something the matter?

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but what could it be?

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.310 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! What happened?
What's wrong with poor Momiji?

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
Haru.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.940 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It's all right. Really.

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:06.568 position:50% align:center
He was just thinking out loud.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
'Kay, if you say so.

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
Kyo!

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
[KYO] What're you all
standing around here for?

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Kyo, have you seen Momiji?

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Why, somethin' up with him?

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:20.415 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
No, nothing.

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
Huh? Then why ask?

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hm?

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
Momiji? Jeez, you're up
here of all places?

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
Tohru and the others
are looking for you. Uh.

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
What?

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Oh. Uh, nothing.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center
You just seem a
little... different.

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:56.034 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's because
my curse broke.

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:01.373 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] Just kidding.
I had you for a second.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
What? Why would you say that?

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] It's not like
it matters, though.

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
Tohru would rather your
curse break than mine.

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
That would make her so happy.

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
I mean... you know, right?

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
This time, at least,
I'm the one who's stung.

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Shut up.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna know anything
about that, all right?

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:34.989 position:50% align:center
It's too much.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] I'm sorry for sending
you away like that last night.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:44.582 position:50% align:center
I spent the whole day trying
to figure out what happened.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
Why is my curse gone?

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.879 position:50% align:center
Why did mine break
when no one else's did?

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
And in the end, I didn't come
up with any good answers.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
But I do know this:

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
Akito, I can't do it.

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
I can't spend the rest
of my life by your side.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
It's my choice,

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
'cause there's nothing
binding me to you now.

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
[AKITO growls]

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
How dare you.

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
You're a monster!
A filthy traitor!

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
An ungrateful idiot!

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:22.412 position:50% align:center
If you leave here, leave me,
you've got no place to go!

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
Think Mommy and Daddy
will welcome you back?

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:27.459 position:50% align:center
Because they won't. No one will!

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
You'll never be
happy again! Ever!

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
It hurts.

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
The truth is...
I've never been so free,

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
but I've never been
so lonely, either.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
The curse may be gone,

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't mean
I'll get the girl I want.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
And the bonds that connected me

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
to everyone unconditionally...
have disappeared.

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:53.109 position:50% align:center
It's too late.

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
Everything is broken now...
and there's no going back.

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Good morning.

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI'S MOTHER]
Hm?

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
Oh, Momiji, is that you?

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
Good morning. Is this
your usual school route?

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.672 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] Nah, I thought
I would change things up

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
and try out a different one.

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI'S MOTHER]
Oh, I see.

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
My goodness I can't believe
how tall you've gotten.

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
I hardly recognized you.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] Has your daughter
grown a lot lately, too?

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI'S MOTHER] No, she's
definitely still a little girl.

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
We're going on a
trip this summer

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
and she can't contain herself.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
She's already so excited!

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI'S MOTHER]
What about you?

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
Any plans for summer?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
Will your family
take a trip, too?

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] Far away.
To a place without me.

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
Where they can be happy.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
But...

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
No. Don't tell me I
can't find happiness

00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
because of the things I've lost.

00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
You're not the one who
gets to decide that. I am!

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
It could still be out
there somewhere.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
Sure, I'm scared and lonely now,

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
but my happiness might
be just down the road,

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
waiting for me to catch up.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Yeah. There'll be a trip.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Someday.

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:26.536 position:50% align:center
With the family that I
can make for myself now.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
I'll find my future in this
ever-changing world.

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
It's time. My path
is my own to choose.

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:38.214 position:50% align:center
And I'm ready to take
the first step.

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
And you? How long will
you remain hiding?

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:49.267 position:50% align:center
You tell me that
if I leave here,

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.936 position:50% align:center
I'll have no home or happiness,

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center
but I think that's just an echo
of your own deepest fears.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.902 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Shut up.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:02.864 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna hear it. Just go.

00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:12.165 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Okay.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway, I should be going.

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:18.963 position:50% align:center
All right.
See ya later! <i>Tschuss</i>.

00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:23.593 position:50% align:center
Take care of yourself.

00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:32.185 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
I will!

00:23:57.354 --> 00:24:00.357 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
"It was so foolish."
