[YUKI]
Where are you right now?

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.765 position:50% align:center
Wait there!
I'm headed your way!

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:19.811 position:50% align:center
Please. Wait for me.
I wanna see you!

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I was so happy,
it was almost embarrassing.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
I was thrilled that
out of everyone,

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center
the person you were
looking for was me.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
I still am.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
We can't take it for granted

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
that there will ever be someone

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
who cares enough
to search for us.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
[MACHI gasps]

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It's not a given.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
It's a blessing.
Almost a miracle.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center
You called. I'm so glad.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry it was so sudden.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
Like I said, there's something
I wanted to give you.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:02.812 position:50% align:center
Of course. What is it?

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.939 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Um, this.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.693 position:50% align:center
It's a "get well" present
for Honda-<i>senpai</i>.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.822 position:50% align:center
Coming from me,
it might be odd,

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:16.242 position:50% align:center
so, um, will you please
pass it along?

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center
It's just some stuff
for the bath.

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
That's sweet. I'd be happy to.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.126 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Honestly, it's, um,

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:30.423 position:50% align:center
my way of saying thank you
for everything she's done.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:33.718 position:50% align:center
President, just knowing
that someone like you

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.264 position:50% align:center
exists in the world
makes me happy.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
So I want to show
how grateful I am

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:45.563 position:50% align:center
that Honda-<i>senpai </i>was
there to protect you.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:49.109 position:50% align:center
Because, if you were weak once,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.654 position:50% align:center
I think that made you
who you are now.

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:55.448 position:50% align:center
I think that's why
you noticed me.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
Why you spoke to me and
reached out your hand.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.331 position:50% align:center
Why you were able to
find the good in me.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.167 position:50% align:center
You saw me when I
couldn't even see myself,

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
and that made me so happy.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.174 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] There's somebody
waiting out there

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:17.512 position:50% align:center
who'll see this side of you
and know how special it is.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.556 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
There you are. Finally.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.900 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Thank you... for finding me.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hold on. What is this?

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
Such a strange feeling.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
President?

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
Is there something
on your mind?

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
Machi.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
Um, I couldn't find
the right time,

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
but I've been wanting
to tell you--

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
[GOD]
You're the last one.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
Just you now.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.906 position:50% align:center
[GOD] You kept the
promise... for so long.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:48.413 position:50% align:center
[GOD] It's time to go now,
but thank you.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
The original memory,
forgotten by everyone.

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.466 position:50% align:center
The original promise.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50% align:center
[GOD]
Goodbye.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
President?

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
Please, tell me what's wrong.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I-- I'm sorry
for crying like this.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
It's just... I said
goodbye to someone

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
I've been with my whole life.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
We were always together.

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
A constant presence that caused
so much pain and heartache.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
But parting hurts, too.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
It's selfish, isn't it?
To cry now.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
The person you said goodbye to,
will you see them again?

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
No. Never.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
But in exchange,
I have... my freedom.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:56.898 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Sorry. I know
I'm not making sense.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.406 position:50% align:center
When I said I wanted
to tell you something,

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
this wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
But for right now,
it'll be enough.

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Well, um...

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
Actually, there was
something I wanted

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
to talk to you about,
too, if that's okay.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yes?

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
Do you think I could call you...
by your first name?

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
Of course. I'd like that.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
Yu... ki.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
[MACHI gasps]

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.197 position:50% align:center
Once more.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
Yu... Yuki.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
As often as you'd like.

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
He always seemed fine alone.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Content with his own company.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
I found it irritating somehow.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Shigure, do you love me?

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.826 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Yuki, have you seen Shigure?

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.995 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Huh? Isn't he here?

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
He hasn't been home all day.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
Honestly, the adults seem
more freaked out than we are.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center
[RITSU] You're right!
I'm sorry, so sorry!

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
I'm a pathetic
excuse for an adult!

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.174 position:50% align:center
You think maybe
you're overreacting?

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
I apologize! Stupid me...

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.513 position:50% align:center
Well, we're all here,
just like we were told to be.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.683 position:50% align:center
Akito must already know
what happened, right?

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Yeah.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
I suspect the atmosphere
is going to become

00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:01.231 position:50% align:center
very tense in a moment.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
Yo.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
Yo...

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
...isn't good enough!

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
Jeez, what is up with you?

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] I mean it,
you're ridiculous and awful!

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
I'm even more heartbroken
than ever now!

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Shameful. You cheater.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Uh, what the--?

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
Cheater.

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
Cheater!

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Did you two plan that?

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
We'll be okay.

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
Things don't seem to have gotten
tense among us, at least.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
I was worried, you know?

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:37.475 position:50% align:center
That we'd all feel
awkward or shy,

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
but it's like it always
has been, right?

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
Of course it is.
I'll love you forever.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Careful, Haru. Rin's watching.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.236 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
As am I, Yuki, my dear brother.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
I shall watch over you
my whole life long.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
Worry not! We shall never
be awkward with each other.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
Which brings to mind
an old proverb.

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
"There's no need
to fear red lights

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
so long as we all
cross together!"

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
[RITSU]
Aya, you're amazing.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
That is not an old proverb.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.130 position:50% align:center
What's up? Akito's
not even here yet?

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
Says the man who's late himself!

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
Now, then, where have you
been wandering, Kyonkichi?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Uh, well, I've hardly ever
been inside the main estate, so.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I see.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
Its combined size and
opulence must be novel

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
for riffraff such as yourself,
so explore away.

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
I give you my blessing to
traverse its halls without fear.

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:25.732 position:50% align:center
[AYAME laughs]

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
Everyone, may I have
your attention?

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
Akito is ready to see you now.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
[RITSU gasps]

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Hatori, where is Shigure?

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
[HATORI gasps]

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:03.144 position:50% align:center
Akito, can it be? Have you
adopted my dressing habits?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
No, I haven't. This is...

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
A present.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
[AKITO gasps]

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.117 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Consider it a parting gift.

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.159 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.161 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I hate you!

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
I hate you so much!

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.625 position:50% align:center
I knew all along
that it would be you.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
That you would be the
quickest to abandon me!

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
Fine then! Go on! Leave!

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
Just calm down.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
Who said that I was
going to abandon you?

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But you
brought that gift.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
You're finally saying
goodbye to the you

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
your father always
wanted you to be,

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
and becoming a new Akito, right?

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.943 position:50% align:center
That's what the gift
is for. That parting.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:54.154 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
Though I suppose it's also a
welcome gift for the new you.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
I look forward to seeing
how you live a life

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
you've chosen for yourself.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
This is a symbol of change.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:14.007 position:50% align:center
Just as you've been able to
return to who you truly are,

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
at last, I've returned to
my true self, as well.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
You're free, all of you.

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
I should've said
this sooner, but I'm...

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I've caused such suffering.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
...sor--

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
So much to apologize for.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I'm curious
how you'll atone

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.995 position:50% align:center
for everything you've done.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
Shut up. I mean it,
that's enough.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
Did you know, out of everyone,
it was you who scared me most?

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
Because I felt like you were
the furthest away from me,

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
the hardest for me to pin down.

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
The one who never feared me.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
You pushed me away
more than anyone.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
Bond or no bond,
I couldn't tie you to me.

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I have to act
like everything's okay.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, I fear
I might explode.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
Whenever I think I have you,
you flit away from me

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:25.370 position:50% align:center
and into somebody else's
sympathetic arms.

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
Such a traitor.

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] Wait. That's not fair!
You did the same thing!

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I'm selfish and childish,

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
so I don't want to be hurt,

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:37.882 position:50% align:center
and I'm not interested
in losing out.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
Once I have you within my grasp,

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
I have no intention
of letting you go,

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
or letting anyone
else touch you.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
[AKITO gasps]

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yes, that's right.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
If you're going to reject me,
then do it now.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.523 position:50% align:center
See, thanks to you,

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
I've learned how to make a
concession every now and again,

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
so I'm giving you the
chance to run away.

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
However, if you think
it through and decide

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
to come to me once more...

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
...know what to expect.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Selfish. Cruel.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.714 position:50% align:center
He acts like he's blameless.

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
Like none of the
fault lies with him.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
He really is a child,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
laying claim whenever
it suits him to,

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
then feigning indifference.

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
It's irritating.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
And it makes me want
to make him look at me.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
I want to permeate his body,

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:43.031 position:50% align:center
get into his cells, into his
bones, invade and infuse them.

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
Saturate his entire
being with my own.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50% align:center
Fill every corner
of him with my scent,

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
till he can't even breathe.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
This feeling. This desire.

00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center
Is it the woman I've always
been finally reaching out?

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] They were surprised
and conflicted.

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.349 position:50% align:center
How could they not be?

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
I tried to apologize,
but I couldn't.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
Any words I said would
have been hollow,

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:20.527 position:50% align:center
like I was asking for
absolution without atonement.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
I've decided I'm going
to continue living here.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
I think that there are still
things I need to do.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
I have to stay. After all,
I'm the family head.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
So, then, you're telling me

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
that's the kind of
life I'm in for?

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Are you angry?

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
A little.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
After all, I've been
waiting a long, long time

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.561 position:50% align:center
for you to come back to me.

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
You're late, you know.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
And beautiful.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
That suits you.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.326 position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I love you. Forever.

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
As long as you want me to.

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
[KYO] So I've decided
that when I graduate,

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
I wanna leave here.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:27.927 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
Um, not like that.

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm not trying
to run away or anything.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.854 position:50% align:center
It's just, I've been avoiding
people my entire life

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
and disengaging from the world.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
I sorta got a free pass to do
that, given how things were.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center
But it's different now.

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
I'm a normal human being,
and I can live a normal life.

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
I can be part of
this world with you.

00:15:56.623 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
That makes me so happy.
And I don't wanna hold back.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:03.963 position:50% align:center
However hard it is,
I want to fight.

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
To test myself in another place.

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
And, um, I'm hoping you'll come.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] So, when you leave here,
do you know where you'll go?

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
[KYO] To a dojo run by
someone Master knows.

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
It's a long way from here.

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
[KYO] It makes sense
because I can train and work

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
at the same time.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
Then someday, when I take
over Master's dojo,

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
I'll have outside experience.

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I'll be able to
use what I learn there.

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
All of it. The good
and the bad, both.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
[KYO] I know it must
sound young and naive.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
It would mean taking you away
from people who love you.

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
But, well, I wanna find
out who the real "me" is.

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yes.

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
I want you to find
the real Kyo, too.

00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:17.495 position:50% align:center
I can see it.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
The look on Master's face
when you told him.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
He was happy, wasn't he?

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
Hearing you plan and
talk about the future.

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
Finally seeing you
determined to live.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
He was happy, and I am, too.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
So, yes. When you leave
here, Kyo, I'll come.

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Huh? Huh?!

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
You will? Are you sure?

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
It's really far away. It'll be
hard to see your friends.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
And, um, we might not
have a lot of money.

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
You do know you're the one

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
who asked me to
come with you, right?

00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Yeah, and that's what I want,

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.374 position:50% align:center
but it's fine if you
need time to think,

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
or if you decide not to go.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
Kyo, I'm easygoing,

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
but I stand my ground when
something's important to me.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
I'm actually quite stubborn.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, yeah.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
I guess I've noticed
that a time or two.

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Okay, good.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you know I can
make up my own mind.

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
Because there's another thing
I've made up my mind about.

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
You're wrong about Mom
holding a grudge against you.

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:29.651 position:50% align:center
Even if it's true,
and she really did say

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
she'd never forgive you,

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
she didn't say it out
of anger or hatred.

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
I know it. Absolutely.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
That's me... standing my ground.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
I am going with you.

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
Yes, leaving everyone
here will make me sad.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.883 position:50% align:center
It will be hard.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
But, Kyo, if I were
apart from you,

00:18:57.429 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
that would be much harder.

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
I belong with you, by your side.

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna be separated.
And I don't wanna wait.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.236 position:50% align:center
Please take me with you.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
[KYO] She's coming.
You good with that?

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'm keeping it, my promise.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
I know I'm really late, but...
I'll protect her my whole life.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
That work?

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.402 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
No.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
No. What do I do?

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
I can't hear anything
or feel any pain.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:05.038 position:50% align:center
Why? No, this can't
be happening.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
But it is. I'm sorry... Tohru.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
I think... I'm gonna die.

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
What do I do? Please. I don't--

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
I don't want this.
I don't wanna die!

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
Tohru.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
Leaving her alone is
the worst kind of unfair.

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
If I'm gone, she'll have no one.
What will happen to her?

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
She's young.
Barely even a high schooler.

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
She's just a kid.
Still... Still so...

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
Katsuya, I get it now.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
Leaving is as bad
as... being left.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
They both hurt, don't they?

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
Sorry. I'm sorry, Tohru.

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center
Did I love you enough?

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
Sweetheart, believe me,

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.482 position:50% align:center
I wanted to love you
so much more.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:23.033 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] Someone....
Someone... protect her!

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
Please, someone...

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:31.332 position:50% align:center
Please... protect her.

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
My treasure. Protect her.

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
Someone. Some... one...

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
Please!

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
It's okay if you forget me,

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:51.353 position:50% align:center
but if you see her again,
please remember.

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:58.360 position:50% align:center
The next time she gets lost,
you go out there and find her.

00:21:58.401 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
You need to keep our
old promise, or...

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:08.661 position:50% align:center
...I won't forgive you, ever.

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:18.338 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] Please,
I'm begging you, please...

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.007 position:50% align:center
...do what I can't.

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:23.927 position:50% align:center
Protect my baby girl.

00:22:29.641 --> 00:22:33.353 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] Sorry, honey.
I guess this is goodbye.

00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:37.774 position:50% align:center
I have to go, but I pray
that you'll be happy.

00:22:37.816 --> 00:22:43.780 position:50% align:center
I pray that your years will be
full of people who love you.

00:22:43.822 --> 00:22:47.784 position:50% align:center
Live the kind of life you
can be proud of in the end,

00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:52.789 position:50% align:center
even if you make mistakes
or take the long way around.

00:22:52.831 --> 00:22:57.585 position:50% align:center
Live so that...
when it's your time to go,

00:22:57.627 --> 00:23:03.091 position:50% align:center
people will say,
"You fought well."

00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:06.970 position:50% align:center
Have lots of happy
times, and sad times,

00:23:07.012 --> 00:23:09.264 position:50% align:center
and everything in between.

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:14.185 position:50% align:center
That's how I want
you to grow old.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.888 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:23:53.975 --> 00:23:55.977 position:50% align:center
[KATSUYA]
You fought well.

00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:00.690 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
"See you again soon."
