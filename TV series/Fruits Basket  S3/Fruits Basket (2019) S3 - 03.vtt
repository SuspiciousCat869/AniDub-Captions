[PRESIDENT A]
That concludes...

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:14.264 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
This isn't fair.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
It's almost spring...
and it's snowing.

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna
watch it pile up.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] Smoothing the rough
edges of the world.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:31.948 position:50% align:center
Making everything look clean,
undisturbed... and perfect.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.660 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
I hate it.

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.087 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO sigh]

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.048 position:50% align:center
It's almost here,
huh? Graduation.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.550 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.177 position:50% align:center
Why so sad?
You're not graduating.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.263 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Ugh. This is so annoying!

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.597 position:50% align:center
Well, someone's late!

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.976 position:50% align:center
Be nice. I just had to
reject another senior.

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:25.228 position:50% align:center
Ugh. I mean, confessing
your love to someone

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50% align:center
you know you have
no chance with?

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.356 position:50% align:center
That's just plain selfish.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.275 position:50% align:center
Sure, they get
closure and stuff,

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center
but what about how
it affects me?

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.404 position:50% align:center
I bet you've had to
deal with it a lot

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:37.615 position:50% align:center
in the past few days,
too, Yun-Yun.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:41.161 position:50% align:center
All I can do is say
no and hurt them.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO] What, are we supposed
to pity you for hurting people?

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
Your guilt seems
well-deserved to me.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:49.753 position:50% align:center
Wow, someone's bitter.

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:52.297 position:50% align:center
Is Shortstack wishin' that
he was as popular as Yuki?

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.215 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Enough with the nickname!

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.384 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm short, shorter
than my sister, in fact,

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
but last time I checked,
that wasn't against the law,

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.221 position:50% align:center
so maybe back off for a second?

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.474 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Um, I didn't say anything.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
Or are you implying that height
is what makes a man attractive?

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
No, that's not it at all.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
Really! It's not height,
or looks, either!

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:15.987 position:50% align:center
What makes a guy attractive
is... how much he's worth.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh...

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
True story.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50% align:center
Yeah?!

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
Well, excuse me for being a
normal guy with normal parents.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
We can't all be rich
like the Somas.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hey, for what it's worth,

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.375 position:50% align:center
that's Soma money,
not mine personally.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I see!

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:32.587 position:50% align:center
You're in love.
Admit it, you so are!

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
But the person you've
got your eye on

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
has a hopeless crush on Yun-Yun,
so you're super jealous!

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Yeah, that reminds me.

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
Didn't you say that Yun-Yun
was your rival once?

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I remember that.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:48.228 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Well? Kimi's right, isn't she?

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Out with it, already!

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Enough of this!

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.732 position:50% align:center
Where's Kuragi?
She should be here!

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Uh-huh.
That sounded like a "yes."

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] If you're waiting
for Kuragi, it'll be a while.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
She's gotta clean up the
box of chalk she spilled.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
When is she gonna stop pulling
these little stunts of hers?

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.244 position:50% align:center
They're getting real old.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
What's this? You think you
can barge in uninvited?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
Are you two in the
same class as Machi?

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
Yes! We are!

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
Want to know what
she did this time?

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
Knocked over a whole brand-new
box of chalk for no reason!

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
That girl is like
seriously terrifying.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
For real.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center
I heard she got kicked
out of her house

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
because she tried to kill
her own little brother.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Uh! Are you sure?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
This is the first time
Kimi's hearing about it.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] That's the rumor
going around lately, anyway.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] Rumor or not,
I think it's true.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.817 position:50% align:center
It can't possibly be.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
You may not have faith
in Machi, but Kimi does!

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Yeah. I've got zero
faith in that statement.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
Oh, Kuragi.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
Machi.

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
She ran.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
You see? That means
it must be true.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Oh, Machi. No, how could you?

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.049 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, what happened
to having faith?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
I think where Kimi's concerned,
faith is a fickle thing.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER]
I don't want to hear it!

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center
You've been jealous of him
from the day he was born.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S FATHER] I've worried
that might be the case

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
for a while.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:14.939 position:50% align:center
I don't think you should
live here anymore.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
It'll be better
for you this way.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
Yes. This is for your sake.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER] You'll feel
more comfortable on your own.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
So, about this rumor.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
I hate to say it,

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
but it's actually pretty
close to the truth.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
Machi has a little brother.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.627 position:50% align:center
I mean, he's my
half-brother, too.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
And he's young.
Way younger than us.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:42.050 position:50% align:center
Machi and I were both
deemed unsuitable,

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
so they decided to name him
the heir of the family.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
And I guess that decision
didn't sit too well with her.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
She got jealous and
tried to kill him.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
They couldn't have her
around after that,

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
so they set her up
with her own place.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't know. That sounds
pretty hard to believe.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
Fair point.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
That's what I heard
from the parentals,

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.822 position:50% align:center
so who knows how warped it is?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
We could always go ask Machi.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:06.866 position:50% align:center
[YUKI gasps]

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
Go and see her.
Find out the truth.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
What? No! We can't
do that. She lives alone.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
Come on, you'll be fine.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
Nothin' about her place
is remotely sexy.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Why is it always
about that with you?

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.548 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, you know,

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
I remember this one winter
when it snowed like crazy.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
Please stop. This conversation
is giving me whiplash.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
Sorry, man, it just
now came to me.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
So there was a buncha snow

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
and the whole family was
together for some reason.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
They were all being lame,
so I snuck out for a while.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Turns out Machi
had the same idea.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center
I watched her for a little bit.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
She was walking around,
leaving footprints in the snow.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
She was super intent on it.
Just round and round.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
Dead silent.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
What could that have
been about, you think?

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

Come right in, Yun-Yun!
Don't be shy!

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hey, would you let me go?

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
Sure enough, it's as
messy as always.

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
Go away!

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.982 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, this brings
back memories.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
What's...?

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center
This is my fault?

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.871 position:50% align:center
Got anything more interesting?

Try not to be a perv, Yun-Yun!

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center
No problem. I'm not you.

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
So, what?

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.968 position:50% align:center
You came here to
play housekeeper?

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
No.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
But, um, glass on the
floor is dangerous,

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.849 position:50% align:center
and I wouldn't want
you to get hurt.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.353 position:50% align:center
Maybe... you wanted to
ask me about the things

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
those girls said
before, is that it?

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Think what you want.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center
Believe them, or not.
I don't care.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
My parents didn't
believe me. No one did.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
I'm done trying
to convince people.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.419 position:50% align:center

[YUKI]
A pristine snowfall.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
A neat and tidy room.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
Anything that seems
perfect bothers you.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
Yes. It... scares me.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
You have to be perfect.
Do you understand me?

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
Your personality,
your grades. Everything!

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you will never
beat that woman's son.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
My whole life, I was so nervous.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] The tiniest misstep
and she'd be furious.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
Like I was walking a tightrope
that grew thinner every day.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Perfection is terrifying.
Suffocating.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
I can't stand it.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
I tried, though.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
I did my best to be what
they wanted me to be.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
But...

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
But now, there's my
little brother, so I--

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER]
It's wonderful.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.368 position:50% align:center
We finally got the boy
we were hoping for!

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
This will be so much
better for everyone.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50% align:center
I mean, there's Machi,
but she's just so... plain.

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
Really, it's like the girl
has no personality at all.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
She's so boring.

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
I guess good grades
aren't everything, are they?

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
What?

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
Why would you say
something like that?

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
You think I'm boring?

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
I did everything you
told me to, though.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
I worked hard to be
perfect, like you said.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
So it's my fault you
turned out this way?

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
You're laying your
failures at my feet?

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
Well, fine. I suppose I do
share some of the blame.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
I did raise you. Clearly,
I went wrong somewhere.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] No. That's not
what I needed you to say.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:35.844 position:50% align:center
I did everything I could,
and this is what you tell me?

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
I'm something that went wrong.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:43.476 position:50% align:center
If I'm a mistake,
what do I do now?

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Where... do I go from here?

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You've worked hard, right?

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
You have. I can tell you have.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
You worked hard to become
the person you are, and...

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
...I'm glad.

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.379 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You did well.

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Somebody thinks... I did well.

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
I never imagined
I would hear that.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center
Not once.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
My whole life,
I've been a screw-up.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
A mistake. Something
that went wrong.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
But... he thinks I did well.

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:44.412 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
It was cold.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
And I was worried
about my brother.

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
I just... didn't want him
to get sick, you know?

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
So I went to cover
him with a blanket.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER]
What are you doing?

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
I wasn't trying to hurt him.

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
But they...

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
I don't want to hear it!

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
I've worried this
might be the case.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] I couldn't get
them to understand.

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:17.612 position:50% align:center
I tried, but they'd already
made up their minds.

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
I just wanted...
to keep him warm.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.878 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Hey, if this
snow keeps piling up...

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] ...we'll make
footprints in it. Together.

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
Promise.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
Sorry! My stupid phone!

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
Shoulda put it on silent.

to kiss, weren't you?

Shut up, you idiot!

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center

Okay, it's on vibrate now!

The snow didn't stick, though.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
It melted overnight.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
And by morning, it was gone.

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Any other opinions?

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
Well, sounds like
we've got that settled...

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:18.798 position:50% align:center
Got you something.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
Here. It's a brand-new box.

everything goes smoothly.

Next up, regarding club
activities for spring break,

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
there's been a slight change.

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
The hard end time
was originally 6 PM...

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
It's gone now, but I wonder...

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
...will he remember
what he said?

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
Will he make footprints with me?

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
I hope it snows soon.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe, but for
the first time in my life,

00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
I'm wishing for snow.

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
Okay. Here! Uh, Kyo?

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
Um. Right. Thank you.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.816 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] It's pretty crazy
to think that we've only got

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
one year left as high
schoolers, isn't it?

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
The passage of time
is a curious thing.

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
We could use some
help over here!

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Tough.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't even have any
flowers if it wasn't for us.

those girls to run off with 'em!

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah, thanks.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center
You jerk.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
Kyon. Tohru almost got hurt.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
That's not something
we can forgive.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.723 position:50% align:center
[KYO] You were the
ones who started it!

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:53.184 position:50% align:center
Well, just checking in.
I should get going now.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
Right. I guess you need to
get back to student council.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
No. I'm meeting up with
someone, actually.

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Once I graduate,

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
there will be no place for me
at this school anymore.

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
The familiar hallways,
the lockers, the classrooms.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
They'll belong to other people.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:21.129 position:50% align:center
That's what graduation means.

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
Moving on. Saying goodbye.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
But...

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.722 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Sorry. Hope you
weren't waiting long.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, it's fine!
I'm just happy that you came.

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
So I'll get right to it, then.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:40.273 position:50% align:center
Or... that's what
I intended to do,

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
but suddenly, my mind seems to
have gone completely blank.

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
Sorry. How silly of me.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.368 position:50% align:center
Right. Here goes.

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
I wanted to say I'm glad
I met you. Really glad.

00:15:56.289 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
I was lucky, coming to a high
school as special as this one.

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
Every day was a new adventure,
like a never-ending festival.

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:11.721 position:50% align:center
I laughed. I cried. Caused
more than a little trouble.

00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
And at the center of
it all, there was you.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
I loved you.

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
I loved you, Yuki.

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:26.945 position:50% align:center
So, I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
...I want the best for you.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
I hope that, whatever comes,
whatever the future holds,

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
you'll find happiness, too.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
And if you've already found it,
if you're already happy,

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
then I hope there's even greater
happiness in store for you.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
I've had my own
taste of happiness.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
The years I spent here, that
was a gift. A precious gift.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
One you gave me.

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but this
is the only way

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
I can think of to pay you back.

Please... let him understand.

00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
I'm not doing this to get
anything from him.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
I don't expect him to
return my feelings.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]I just want him
to know that I was happy.

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
I had so much fun here, and I'm
truly glad to have met him.

I think that's more
than I deserve, but...

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center

right there, Yuki!

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
Surprisingly, I find I'm feeling
quite good at the moment.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
I'd hate for you to ruin it
with an ill-timed apology.

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
You don't want me
to cry, do you?

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
Besides, don't discount karma.

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
These things might be
fairer than we think.

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
For all we know,
somebody may have been

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
pining desperately for
me all along, as well.

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.769 position:50% align:center
Like former president Takei?

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
No. Absolutely not!

Honestly, Yuki, you're so...

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:35.490 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO crying]

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center

So, sad to be leaving?

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Oh, goodness, you caught me.
How embarrassing.

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
I wanted to take one last
little look at the classroom.

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center
But I'm done now.

Well, I just...

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
I-I always... thought... Um...

So, I hope whatever the future
holds for you after graduation,

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
you'll be happy, and...

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
...you'll keep smiling.

Sakuragi, you, too.

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll be happy.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
And thank you.

Goodbye.

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Nice to meet you.

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
Hiro, your name means
"a light on the path,"

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
so I named her Hinata,
for "sunshine."

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
Cute, right?

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
Hinata, this is
your big brother!

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
He's going to be starting
middle school so.

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
Well, come on.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center
Don't you want to hug her?
Don't be shy now.

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:26.453 position:50% align:center
No, that's a terrible idea!
Mom, Hinata's a girl. I can't.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, it's fine.

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:31.332 position:50% align:center
Mama's here. I can
hug you both easily.

[KAGURA]
So it turns out,

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
Isuzu graduated while she
was still in the hospital.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Good for her.

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
And you were kind enough
to go pick up her diploma.

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
You're such a
sweetheart, Kagura.

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.725 position:50% align:center
Compliments are
meaningless from you.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:50.226 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:52.020 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Hey.

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
Is that really where
she is, the hospital?

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:58.443 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's what I'm told.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:01.488 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Okay, but nobody seems to know

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:04.032 position:50% align:center
which one she was admitted to.

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:05.033 position:50% align:center
And her phone--

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:06.117 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Now, Kagura,

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:08.161 position:50% align:center
have you asked your
mother's advice on this?

00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:10.955 position:50% align:center
I bet she told you not to snoop.

00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:12.916 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm snooping.

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:15.502 position:50% align:center
This time it's just...

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:20.632 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling that she
might not be coming back.

00:22:20.674 --> 00:22:24.010 position:50% align:center
And... I'm worried.

00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:00.398 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
"I'm home."
