[AKITO]
Shigure, do you love me?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.375 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
What?

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:21.167 align:middle
Have you been walking around the
compound asking everyone that?

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.000 align:middle
I'm the one asking
the questions, here.

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:26.542 align:middle
So? Do you?

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.167 align:middle
I care about you more
than anyone else.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle
I always will.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:46.417 align:middle
That's an unwavering truth.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
Yes, Akito. I love you.

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:32.458 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
Ooh!

00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:35.375 align:middle
Nice. Making paper
flowers, I see.

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:38.083 align:middle
That sure brings me back.
Are they for school?

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:41.500 align:middle
That's right! I'm making them
for the graduation ceremony.

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle
Our class is in charge of
the flower decorations.

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:47.917 align:middle
Wow, it's graduation
season already?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.542 align:middle
And that means the three of
you will be seniors soon.

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.958 align:middle
Time sure flies, doesn't it?

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.542 align:middle
Say, would you mind terribly
if I opened one up?

00:02:56.625 --> 00:03:00.625 align:middle
Oh. No. Go ahead.
It's fine. Please.

00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:03.583 align:middle
[KURENO] We eldest are
the only zodiac members

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle
who know the truth.

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:10.625 align:middle
Um... I wanted to ask.

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
Yes?

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:14.542 align:middle
It's-It's about A--

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:20.125 align:middle
Um.

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:21.875 align:middle
Oh, dear! Are you thirsty?

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.917 align:middle
I'll just go into the kitchen
and make some tea.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.417 align:middle
I can't blame her.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.542 align:middle
It is a difficult
topic to ask about.

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:36.333 align:middle
[TOHRU]
It's too hard to ask about!

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:41.792 align:middle
[TOHRU]
And I don't know if I should.

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:46.708 align:middle
I don't want to interrogate him,
or pry into his personal life.

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:51.333 align:middle
Besides, when I think about
the things Kureno told me,

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle
it feels... like I'm
looking into a dark well,

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:58.958 align:middle
with no bottom in sight.

00:03:59.042 --> 00:04:00.417 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle
[MOMIJI] My class is doing
paper flowers, too!

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:09.875 align:middle
You know what that makes
us, right? Twinsies!

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.875 align:middle
Um, right! Twinsies!

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.833 align:middle
I'm having so much fun getting
things ready for the ceremony,

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle
but I bet all the seniors
feel a bit sad

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle
since they have to graduate.

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:19.625 align:middle
Oh, I'm sure they're--

00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:23.042 align:middle
You don't know my sorrow!
Goodbye, Yuki!

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle
Repeat the year.

00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:25.417 align:middle
I can't do that!

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle
And what is it with you,
appearing out of nowhere

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.125 align:middle
just to be snarky to people?

00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:30.917 align:middle
Oh, I thought about doing that.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.375 align:middle
Repeating a grade
to stay longer.

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle
Because of Momo.

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:37.667 align:middle
Papa said that she wants
to come to this school.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle
Of course, that had
him panicking.

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle
Silly. She's a lot
younger than me.

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle
I'll be long gone by
the time she's here.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle
[HATSUHARU]
Momiji.

00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle
[MOMIJI]
Hm? What's up?

00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:52.208 align:middle
[TOHRU] I don't think I
can tell Momiji, either.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:56.333 align:middle
Not even about
Uo- <i>chan</i> and Kureno.

00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:58.667 align:middle
I'm sorry.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.042 align:middle
I don't know what
I can talk about,

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:03.875 align:middle
or how much I can
risk revealing.

00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.333 align:middle
What would people think if
they knew the things I do?

00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:12.875 align:middle
How would those secrets
make them feel?

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:25.458 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:26.792 align:middle
Halt, thieves, get back here!

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:28.542 align:middle
We need those!

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:30.083 align:middle
How sneaky,

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:33.083 align:middle
waiting until most of the class
had already left to strike.

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:35.667 align:middle
Um, I'm sorry, but what
just happened here?

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle
They stole some flowers.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:40.125 align:middle
It seems they targeted the
ones Yuki made specifically.

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:42.958 align:middle
Uh! Why would they do
like that, though?

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.042 align:middle
Well, you see...

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle
[UOTANI, HANAJIMA]
He's their prince.

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:49.292 align:middle
They're ours! We did it.
We got them, ladies!

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:51.667 align:middle
We overcame all the
obstacles in our path

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.292 align:middle
and claimed this treasure!

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle
Yes, a brilliant plan!

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:59.292 align:middle
And with these disguises,
they had no idea who we were!

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:00.708 align:middle
Maybe it would help if you went

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:02.875 align:middle
and gave them a
talking-to, Hanajima.

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.917 align:middle
Why bother? There's
no benefit in it for me.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.542 align:middle
Dumb fangirls. They
took a lot of 'em.

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.917 align:middle
Guess we'll need more.
You'd better get folding, Kyon.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.583 align:middle
Huh? Wait. Why're you
draggin' me into this?

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle
They stole that jerk's
flowers, not mine.

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:20.042 align:middle
Yeah, but he already left
for student council stuff.

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:21.625 align:middle
[KYO]
Well, I don't care.

00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:25.625 align:middle
I finally got my share of the
stupid things done just now...

00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:26.625 align:middle
They're all gone!

00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:27.875 align:middle
That's not my problem.

00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.917 align:middle
What the hell?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.708 align:middle
Where'd they go?

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:32.292 align:middle
[STUDENT K laughs]

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle
[STUDENT K]
I did it.

00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:36.542 align:middle
Whoever gets Kyo's
flowers gets his love!

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle
[ADMIRER A]
You think so?

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:39.333 align:middle
[ADMIRER C]
She just made that up.

00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:42.208 align:middle
[ADMIRER B] Hey, if it's true,
that means he'll love all of us.

00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:43.625 align:middle
Whoever did it...

00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:46.792 align:middle
...I won't actually kill them,
but they can go to hell!

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.417 align:middle
His own unique brand of mercy.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle
Oh, is that what that was?

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:53.083 align:middle
Well, either way, it looks like
you'll have to start over.

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:54.542 align:middle
[KYO]
You're kidding me!

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:56.958 align:middle
Really, though, what're we
gonna do about the prince's?

00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:00.125 align:middle
It doesn't seem fair to call him
back here to make more of them.

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:01.625 align:middle
[CLASSMATE D]
Yeah, you're right.

00:07:01.708 --> 00:07:04.292 align:middle
It's not like it was Yuki's
fault that they got stolen.

00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle
[YUSUKE]
Wait, does that mean

00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:08.583 align:middle
<i>we</i> have to make
the replacements?

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:11.875 align:middle
Like hell! We're not gonna let
'em get away with this crap!

00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle
We'll track them down
and take those flowers!

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle
--[YUSUKE, HIROSHI] Heck, yeah!
--Yeah!

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:15.792 align:middle
Wait!

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:17.208 align:middle
I don't know, you guys,

00:07:17.292 --> 00:07:18.958 align:middle
wouldn't making them ourselves
be a simpler solution?

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:19.958 align:middle
[UOTANI]
We want the thieves

00:07:20.042 --> 00:07:21.542 align:middle
to be brought to
justice, don't we?

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:24.042 align:middle
[KYO] More like you wanna get
outta doing the work yourself.

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:26.542 align:middle
[UOTANI]
Let's go! You, too, Hanajima!

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:29.125 align:middle
I suppose, if you
require firepower.

00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:29.917 align:middle
Wha--?!

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.708 align:middle
You hold the fort, Tohru!

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:38.708 align:middle
You don't have to do anything.
Just wait till they get back.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:39.917 align:middle
Up a little, maybe?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.958 align:middle
A bit, yeah.

00:07:41.042 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle
[YUKI]
Can I help out with anything?

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:44.458 align:middle
Oh! Hi, Soma- <i>senpai</i> !

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:45.792 align:middle
No, it's fine, really!

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle
I mean, thank you for
the offer, but we're good.

00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle
[FRESHMAN A] We couldn't
possibly ask the president

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle
to help us!

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:52.917 align:middle
Help with this?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle
Thank you, but we couldn't
ask you to do that, Yuki.

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle
We've got it. Thanks, though.

00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:59.583 align:middle
That's right. We know you must
be busy with other stuff, Soma.

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle
[GIRLS screaming]

00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:02.958 align:middle
[GIRL A] He's so handsome,
I can't take it!

00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:06.292 align:middle
[YUKI]
I could help.

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:09.292 align:middle
They don't need to be
so polite about it.

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:13.583 align:middle
[STUDENTS laughing, chattering]

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:17.292 align:middle
[YUKI]
Looks like fun.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.542 align:middle
[hurried footsteps]

00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:32.958 align:middle
Machi?

00:08:33.042 --> 00:08:34.417 align:middle
You startled me.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.083 align:middle
What's wrong?
You're really out of breath.

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:38.417 align:middle
It's your fault.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.667 align:middle
What?

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.125 align:middle
[MACHI] You were roaming
around strange patterns.

00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle
I couldn't predict your route
and kept losing you.

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:48.333 align:middle
Oh, I didn't realize that
you were looking for me.

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:51.333 align:middle
I'm sorry. Did you need
me for something?

00:08:51.417 --> 00:08:52.458 align:middle
No, it's nothing.

00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:54.583 align:middle
Uh, I'm confused.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:57.833 align:middle
So you ran all over looking
for me for no reason?

00:08:57.917 --> 00:08:59.583 align:middle
[MACHI]
Fine. I did want something.

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:00.958 align:middle
Okay.

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:03.667 align:middle
I... saw you before.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:09.083 align:middle
And, I don't know, I figured...
I would find you and say hello.

00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:10.292 align:middle
But...

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:11.917 align:middle
...you kept going.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.458 align:middle
Wandering nonsensically
from one place to the next.

00:09:14.542 --> 00:09:16.458 align:middle
It's called
"patrolling," actually.

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:19.333 align:middle
Anyway! I got stubborn,
that's all.

00:09:19.417 --> 00:09:20.958 align:middle
'Cause you were hard to catch.

00:09:21.042 --> 00:09:22.875 align:middle
[YUKI]
Okay.

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.708 align:middle
[YUKI]
It didn't have to be now.

00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:27.917 align:middle
She would've seen
me again later.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.708 align:middle
But she chased after me...
just to say hello.

00:09:32.792 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle
She sought me out. Just me.

00:09:41.625 --> 00:09:42.792 align:middle
[gasps]

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle
[YUKI]
Thank you.

00:09:46.833 --> 00:09:50.583 align:middle
What the heck? Pretty sure
I didn't deserve that.

00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:51.542 align:middle
And what's this?

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:52.375 align:middle
A flower.

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.792 align:middle
[YUKI]
Oh. No way. Really?

00:09:54.875 --> 00:09:57.208 align:middle
It's even worse than
the ones I made.

00:09:57.292 --> 00:09:59.208 align:middle
[MACHI]
Whatever!

00:09:59.292 --> 00:10:01.292 align:middle
[KYO]
Jeez, they're taking forever.

00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:04.667 align:middle
[TOHRU] Do you think maybe
their investigation hit a snag?

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.375 align:middle
Nah, I'm betting they
got distracted

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:08.125 align:middle
by something more fun.

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:10.083 align:middle
People like them just do
whatever sounds best

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:11.458 align:middle
at the moment.

00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:13.792 align:middle
Oh. I don't know.

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle
[KURENO] Unlike the others,
my curse... has broken.

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:25.458 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hey, Kyo.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.833 align:middle
[KYO]
Hm?

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:30.958 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Well, I was wondering.

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:33.958 align:middle
What would you think
if there was somebody

00:10:34.042 --> 00:10:37.125 align:middle
in the zodiac who was different?

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:40.375 align:middle
Whose curse had... broken?

00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:46.042 align:middle
Broken? What do you
mean? I have no idea.

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle
Anyway, I don't like "what ifs"
about that kinda stuff.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.458 align:middle
[KYO]
Hey, what's wrong?

00:10:57.542 --> 00:10:58.833 align:middle
Why do you look
all depressed now?

00:10:58.917 --> 00:11:02.292 align:middle
Wow. That was so thoughtless
of me. I'm really sorry.

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:04.792 align:middle
[KYO]
No, wait, don't apologize.

00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:06.917 align:middle
I'm not mad or
anything, I swear!

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle
[TOHRU]
What now? What should I do?

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:13.667 align:middle
I don't want to upset him.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.958 align:middle
But if I look up,
I'm afraid I'll cry.

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:24.042 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:42.833 align:middle
We apprehended the thieves!

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:44.708 align:middle
It was exhausting.

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
Shall we go home, Tohru?

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.583 align:middle
Yes, but what did you do
when you finally caught them?

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:52.083 align:middle
[HIROSHI] Well, they probably
deserved worse than they got.

00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:53.375 align:middle
[UOTANI]
We were merciful--

00:11:53.458 --> 00:11:55.333 align:middle
just ordered them to make
replacement flowers.

00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle
[VICE PRESIDENT A] They're lucky
we didn't confiscate

00:11:56.833 --> 00:11:57.833 align:middle
what they took.

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.125 align:middle
[HANAJIMA]
Our punishment was humane.

00:12:02.792 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
How are you feeling today?

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle
I took the liberty of
bringing you a present.

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:11.458 align:middle
I thought you might never have
seen one of these before.

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:19.083 align:middle
[AKITO]
Hey. Do remember that day?

00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:23.833 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
Which one?

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:32.875 align:middle
[gasps] Isuzu!

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.917 align:middle
Uh. "Isuzu"?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle
What, is something up with Rin?

00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle
Oh, no, it's nothing!

00:12:38.083 --> 00:12:40.125 align:middle
My mind was wandering
and I just blurted that out.

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:41.625 align:middle
Forget I said anything!

00:12:41.708 --> 00:12:44.167 align:middle
Sure. If you say so.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.875 align:middle
[TOHRU]
What's wrong with me?

00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.792 align:middle
I can't believe I'm only
thinking about Isuzu now.

00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:54.792 align:middle
She's like me. Desperate for
a way to break the curse.

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:57.667 align:middle
Another person to
hide things from.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.875 align:middle
Or should I tell her?

00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle
Come to think of it,

00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:05.958 align:middle
I don't think I've seen
her since... New Year's.

00:13:06.042 --> 00:13:08.542 align:middle
Shigure says he's
gonna be out late.

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:09.875 align:middle
[YUKI]
Oh, really?

00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.417 align:middle
He's having dinner
with his editor.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.125 align:middle
I wouldn't think it
would take that long.

00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.958 align:middle
Gives him more time
to torture her, I guess.

00:13:16.042 --> 00:13:18.750 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I think... I'll go see her.

00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:21.167 align:middle
It feels like the
right thing to do.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.958 align:middle
You have to come
and rescue me!

00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle
Please, I'm begging
you. I need help.

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:28.792 align:middle
I've done my best, but I'm
at the end of my rope here.

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:30.042 align:middle
I won't make it
through the night

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.958 align:middle
without incurring
permanent emotional

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:33.625 align:middle
and psychological damage.

00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:34.958 align:middle
[COLLEAGUE A]
Mitchan, get it together.

00:13:35.042 --> 00:13:38.083 align:middle
Try to act like a professional.
You're his editor!

00:13:38.167 --> 00:13:40.167 align:middle
Poor thing. She seems so upset.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.333 align:middle
Do you think we should
go tell the manager?

00:13:42.417 --> 00:13:45.917 align:middle
Let's wait, give her some
space. It sounds personal.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.292 align:middle
Not anymore!

00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:49.208 align:middle
Don't you know the devil
pretends to be a castaway

00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:50.542 align:middle
before boarding the ship?

00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:52.042 align:middle
[COLLEAGUE A]
Wait, what?

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:54.792 align:middle
Never mind. Business is
business. No running away.

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:56.625 align:middle
[MITSURU groans]

00:13:56.708 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle
I'm starting to think
I should just quit. Uh?

00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:01.833 align:middle
Got to go. My
companion's here.

00:14:01.917 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle
Don't leave yet, Shigure.
At least greet Akito first.

00:14:05.333 --> 00:14:08.042 align:middle
Oh, no, thank you. That would
take far too much time.

00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:08.667 align:middle
Shall we?

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.458 align:middle
[MITSURU grunts]

00:14:11.542 --> 00:14:13.292 align:middle
[MITSURU]
Um, if you know those people,

00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:16.292 align:middle
shouldn't we have invited them
to come for a drink with us?

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:17.958 align:middle
Absolutely not.

00:14:18.042 --> 00:14:20.375 align:middle
Why on earth would I want
to drink with my parents?

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:23.875 align:middle
Are you kidding me?! Those two
back there are your parents?!

00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.292 align:middle
'Fraid so. Even I have a set.

00:14:26.375 --> 00:14:27.875 align:middle
Wait!

00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.458 align:middle
One sec, I need to go back there
and get a closer look at them!

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:31.125 align:middle
You'll be wasting your time.

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:33.958 align:middle
They won't have anything
to do with an outsider.

00:14:34.042 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle
As it happens, there's
a dinner here tonight--

00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:39.333 align:middle
an exclusive gathering
for the main family.

00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:41.458 align:middle
You picked the worst
restaurant, Mitchan.

00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle
"The main family"?

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:47.667 align:middle
Oh, wow. Guess you Somas
are real elites, huh?

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle
Indeed, we are.

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:53.333 align:middle
There's quite an immense gap in
status between you and Ritchan.

00:14:53.417 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle
Oh, and look, the honored
family head arrives.

00:14:57.333 --> 00:14:58.625 align:middle
[MITSURU]
Hm?

00:14:58.708 --> 00:15:00.917 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
Pale as a ghost, am I right?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.875 align:middle
[MITSURU]
Mm-hmm.

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.542 align:middle
Uh. I mean, no! I was
thinking he looks so young!

00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Over 20 now, I believe.

00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:11.375 align:middle
Uh! Are you kidding?!

00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:13.917 align:middle
Since when are people
over 20 considered old?!

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle
The Soma family head is
a beautiful young man!

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle
Uhh... although, I guess
he might not appreciate

00:15:19.833 --> 00:15:21.458 align:middle
being called "beautiful."

00:15:21.542 --> 00:15:23.167 align:middle
Well, no sense standing around.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.333 align:middle
Let's go get that drink.
I'm parched.

00:15:25.417 --> 00:15:27.833 align:middle
[MITSURU]
Huh? Okay, fine.

00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:30.167 align:middle
[SHIGURE'S MOM] I did tell him
to pay his respects.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.208 align:middle
Shall I fetch him back?

00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:39.292 align:middle
No need. Come, Kureno.

00:15:40.417 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle
[SHIGURE] Leaving may have been
better for everyone involved,

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:45.042 align:middle
including Akito.

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:49.375 align:middle
And you know, it's not too late.

00:15:49.458 --> 00:15:53.125 align:middle
[KURENO]
You... don't seem too surprised.

00:15:53.208 --> 00:15:57.875 align:middle
Did you already know...
that I was free from the curse?

00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.542 align:middle
[SHIGURE] Ahh, I would
sound so very prescient

00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:05.458 align:middle
if I could say yes, but I'm
afraid it was just a hunch.

00:16:05.542 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle
Though I must admit, I feel a
bit better now that I do know.

00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:16.083 align:middle
That explains why she wants
to keep you so close.

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle
She can't have other
people finding out,

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:21.542 align:middle
so she clutches to
you desperately.

00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:23.542 align:middle
[KURENO]
Listen, Shigure,

00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:27.083 align:middle
I believe I know how
you feel about her.

00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:29.333 align:middle
I realize you that
probably hate me, but--

00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:31.500 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
You've got that right.

00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:36.042 align:middle
I hate you. I truly, truly do.

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:39.583 align:middle
You really ought to thank me
for putting it so bluntly.

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:40.833 align:middle
It'll make it that
much easier for you

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.917 align:middle
to play the poor,
pitiful martyr.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.542 align:middle
Your favorite role.

00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:47.042 align:middle
[KURENO]
Please.

00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:51.667 align:middle
Hate me, that's fine, but don't
abandon her. All right?

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.875 align:middle
There's no need for
you to be so cold.

00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:58.667 align:middle
Like you said, she doesn't
cling to me out of love.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.042 align:middle
There's one person
she's always wanted,

00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:04.792 align:middle
and I think we both
know it isn't me.

00:17:06.917 --> 00:17:08.208 align:middle
[SERVANT A]
Welcome home.

00:17:08.292 --> 00:17:09.917 align:middle
[SERVANT B]
Welcome home.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.083 align:middle
I hope the dinner went well.

00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:13.875 align:middle
A moment please?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.458 align:middle
[AKITO]
Stay here. Let nobody in.

00:17:18.542 --> 00:17:20.042 align:middle
[HEAD SERVANT A]
Of course.

00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:35.125 align:middle
Did you have a good night?

00:17:35.208 --> 00:17:38.375 align:middle
Nothing better than
a fancy Soma soireé.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.208 align:middle
[SHIGURE] I have to say,
in that outfit,

00:17:42.292 --> 00:17:45.625 align:middle
you look even more
masculine than usual.

00:17:45.708 --> 00:17:48.333 align:middle
Wanna tell me what
you're doing here?

00:17:48.417 --> 00:17:51.792 align:middle
I came to apologize for not
greeting you at the restaurant.

00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:56.167 align:middle
[AKITO] That woman
with you, who was she?

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.583 align:middle
Just somebody I know from work.

00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle
Slept with her yet?

00:18:01.083 --> 00:18:02.083 align:middle
Uh.

00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle
[SHIGURE chuckles]

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:04.917 align:middle
I would never.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.125 align:middle
Really? That surprises me.

00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle
And here I thought you slept
with every woman you knew.

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:13.333 align:middle
Oh, come now, Akito.
You're being absurd.

00:18:13.417 --> 00:18:16.833 align:middle
[AKITO]
Well, you did sleep with <i>her</i> .

00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:19.708 align:middle
[SHIGURE] Sorry, which
"her" would that be?

00:18:19.792 --> 00:18:21.958 align:middle
Ren, who else?

00:18:22.042 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle
How dare you.

00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:26.417 align:middle
How dare you sleep with her!

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.875 align:middle
That was a long time ago.

00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:32.417 align:middle
And if you'll recall,
you already punished me for it.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.667 align:middle
You told me to leave, remember?

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.083 align:middle
You know that's the only
reason I live in that house

00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:38.083 align:middle
instead of here.

00:18:38.167 --> 00:18:39.333 align:middle
Yeah, is it?

00:18:39.417 --> 00:18:40.875 align:middle
Funny how you waltzed
right out of here

00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.208 align:middle
without even putting
up a fight, then.

00:18:43.292 --> 00:18:45.667 align:middle
You wanted to go
from the beginning!

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.708 align:middle
You wanted to get
away from here.

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:52.042 align:middle
From me!

00:18:52.125 --> 00:18:55.458 align:middle
Admit it. That's why
you slept with her.

00:18:55.542 --> 00:18:58.167 align:middle
It is, right, Shigure?

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:03.667 align:middle
You like her more.
You want her more!

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.542 align:middle
I care about you...
more than anyone else.

00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:08.458 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:08.542 --> 00:19:12.292 align:middle
That's an unwavering
truth. Even now.

00:19:14.042 --> 00:19:17.333 align:middle
I thought that you'd forgotten.

00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:20.083 align:middle
I never said
anything of the sort.

00:19:20.167 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle
Is that why you've
been so irritable?

00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:24.708 align:middle
A test?

00:19:24.792 --> 00:19:27.833 align:middle
Is that what this is, some kind
of warped test of yours?

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.875 align:middle
No, Akito, I'm not testing you.

00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.833 align:middle
Don't you understand?

00:19:32.917 --> 00:19:35.542 align:middle
Haven't you figured out
why I slept with Ren?

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:37.708 align:middle
I did it because you
slept with Kureno.

00:19:37.792 --> 00:19:41.333 align:middle
[gasps] Because of me?

00:19:41.417 --> 00:19:44.583 align:middle
What the hell are you saying?
That it's my fault?

00:19:44.667 --> 00:19:48.833 align:middle
I did nothing wrong!
You can't blame me for this!

00:19:48.917 --> 00:19:51.917 align:middle
[SHIGURE] Now, Kureno,
don't get me wrong.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.792 align:middle
I love Akito.

00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:57.792 align:middle
I always have. I always will.

00:19:57.875 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle
In fact, I love her so much...

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:05.667 align:middle
...that sometimes I want
to spoil her rotten.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.167 align:middle
I'm not just anyone,
I'm special!

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.042 align:middle
You're all mine. I can
do what I want with you.

00:20:11.125 --> 00:20:15.042 align:middle
Whatever I want! It's my right!

00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:18.833 align:middle
[SHIGURE] And sometimes,
I want to crush her to a pulp.

00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:22.417 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
If you don't get it,

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.083 align:middle
there's no point
discussing this further.

00:20:26.167 --> 00:20:29.667 align:middle
We're merely repeating the
same argument we always have.

00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:34.417 align:middle
Your mood is only getting worse
the longer we talk about it.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle
I should just go.

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:51.625 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
You deny your femininity,

00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:57.375 align:middle
and yet you're always ready to
use it as a weapon against me.

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:02.958 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
Don't you know? It's here.

00:21:03.042 --> 00:21:07.167 align:middle
Eternity. It's right here.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle
I'm always thinking about you.

00:21:11.583 --> 00:21:14.500 align:middle
Before you came,
something was missing.

00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:19.625 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
I'm here forever.

00:21:19.708 --> 00:21:22.125 align:middle
You just haven't realized it.

00:21:24.292 --> 00:21:29.917 align:middle
[SHIGURE] I was waiting that
day... and I never stopped.

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:36.917 align:middle
[STUDENT C] Isuzu Soma?
Yeah, she's in our class.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.125 align:middle
[STUDENT D]
Well, technically she is,

00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:39.917 align:middle
but she's on one of
her absent kicks again.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:43.958 align:middle
I forget, did she wind up
back in the hospital?

00:21:44.042 --> 00:21:45.958 align:middle
[STUDENT D] She's out,
but still recuperating.

00:21:46.042 --> 00:21:48.833 align:middle
Oh, that's right! In some
far-away place or whatever.

00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:51.417 align:middle
[STUDENT D] Heh. I swear,
your mind is like a sieve.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.667 align:middle
[TOHRU] Oh, I see.
Thank you for telling me.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.667 align:middle
[STUDENT C]
Sure.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.667 align:middle
What do you think
the chances are

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.333 align:middle
that Soma will graduate on time?

00:21:59.417 --> 00:22:00.458 align:middle
[STUDENT D]
You know her family'll just

00:22:00.542 --> 00:22:02.333 align:middle
pay off the school.

00:22:02.417 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle
Wonder who that girl is.
A friend of Soma's, maybe?

00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:07.417 align:middle
[STUDENT C] Since when
does Soma have friends?

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.417 align:middle
[STUDENT D]
Ha! You're so mean!

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.458 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
I've been here. Waiting.

00:22:17.083 --> 00:22:19.125 align:middle
[SHIGURE]
All this time.

00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:25.167 align:middle
[SHIGURE] I've been right
here waiting for you.

00:23:57.542 --> 00:23:59.917 align:middle
[MACHI]
"I hope it snows soon."
