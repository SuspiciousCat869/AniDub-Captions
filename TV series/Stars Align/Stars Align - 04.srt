1
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,348
Now you're gonna tell us
to change up all the pairs?

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,267
Yeah, what makes you
think that's your call?

3
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,187
These are the ones
I came up with. Look.

4
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,396
Sure.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,899
[gasps]

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:24,816
[SHINGO]
What is it?

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,026
[TSUBASA]
What does it say?

8
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,945
[TAIYO]
Hey, I wanna see.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:28,987
[RINTARO]
Captain?

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,489
[NAO]
I totally know how he picked.

11
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,574
[ITSUKI]
You're totally full of it, Nao.

12
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,451
You're joking, right?

13
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,870
These pairs are
completely awful.

14
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,748
I couldn't do worse
than this if I tried.

15
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,551
I'm seriously playing
in the back?

16
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,510
Hey, new guy!

17
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,639
Maybe you didn't notice,
but I always play up front!

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,600
And I've literally never
played a game in the front.

19
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,728
A 15 point? Are you
sure about this?

20
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,105
[MAKI] Mm‐hm. It's the fastest
way we can get through

21
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,649
the roster, isn't it?

22
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,859
That's true enough.

23
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,237
They're jumping straight in.
Is this a good idea?

24
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,490
Well, Katsuragi seems
confident, right?

25
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,992
[KANAKO]
He does, but I'm not sure why.

26
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,662
I'm sick of your crap.

27
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,122
Get ready, 'cause I'm
goin' for headshots!

28
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,666
Big talk, but let's
see if you can

29
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,959
keep a rally going.

30
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,294
Play ball!

31
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,716
[groans] It all feels off!

32
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,226
Hey! Don't just hit it
straight to him like that!

33
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,395
It's not like I was trying
to give up a point.

34
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,563
I've never played back before!

35
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,487
So I guess I should
be hugging the net.

36
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,488
Huh?

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,616
Pay attention! Your left
side was wide open!

38
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,617
Don't give me that!

39
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,369
[SHINGO] And you could
actually aim next time!

40
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,663
Do you really think
that pair's gonna work?

41
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,873
Yeah.

42
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,750
[MAKI grunts]

43
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,796
Stop hitting it to the
same place, dammit!

44
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:33,964
‐‐[SHINGO] Crap!
‐‐[TSUBASA] They keep getting

45
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,799
those because you keep
handing them shots.

46
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,926
Shut up! I know that!

47
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,728
Oh, you little punk!

48
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,442
[TSUBASA]
Dammit!

49
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,735
That only happened
'cause you didn't

50
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,319
get back to the net fast enough.

51
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,988
Do you think I don't know?

52
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,491
Man, playing front's
a huge pain in the ass.

53
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,617
[SHINGO grunts]

54
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,037
[TSUBASA]
Hey, Toma, come at me!

55
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,539
Hit it over here!

56
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,959
[SHINGO]
Tsubasa, right side!

57
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,420
I have eyes, you know!

58
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,589
Looks like you're
having fun in the front.

59
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,090
You smug jerk.

60
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,260
[gasps]

61
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,553
Dirty little...!

62
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,726
Tsubasa!

63
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,895
Yeah, I know, I've got it!

64
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,022
[TOMA gasps]

65
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,649
They got a point.

66
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,777
That volley was pretty good.

67
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,323
Thanks for setting it
up, man. Keep it up!

68
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,355
What are they setting up?

69
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,648
Get to the baseline, quick!

70
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,107
Oh, crap.

71
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,694
We're getting played!

72
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,612
Yeah!

73
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,155
Hell yeah!

74
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,702
Huh. Total fluke, but
it looked pretty cool.

75
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,954
I don't think it was.

76
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,164
Watch. See?

77
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,249
Shingo!

78
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,167
Oh, no, you don't!

79
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,298
[TSUBASA]
Now I've got you!

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,300
Ah!

81
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,720
Game and set. 15‐10.

82
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,849
Takenouchi and Soga
are the winners.

83
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,434
Crazy. You play pretty
good in the back.

84
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,855
Hey, thanks. You were
killin' it up there.

85
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,481
Did we mess something up?

86
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,985
I don't think so.
We just got outplayed.

87
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,653
For real?

88
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,363
It's all because
of their mindsets.

89
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,574
They each think about
their own game.

90
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,158
They're kinda
self‐centered as players,

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,494
but that means they stay
out of each other's way.

92
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,663
If they can grasp that and
learn each other's styles,

93
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,541
they'll end up being way better
than they've been until now.

94
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,792
Though they might
have to give and take

95
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:19,838
a little more than
with their old partners.

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,964
That makes sense.

97
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,173
Those two work well as a pair

98
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,383
because they
complement each other

99
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,968
and amplify both
of their strengths.

100
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,595
Yeah, basically.

101
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,015
From here, they can
only get better.

102
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,600
[MAKI]
Anyways, you'd better get ready,

103
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,977
'cause we still have two
more matches left to play.

104
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,770
You were holding back.

105
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,658
Nice return, Itsuki!

106
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,037
Uh. Honestly, I even
surprised myself with that.

107
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,330
1‐0.

108
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,921
They scored again.

109
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,505
Who would have thought
Itsuki'd be this good

110
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,632
at playing the front?

111
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,258
Yeah, he's super
focused and he's good

112
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,843
at making decisions quickly.

113
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,470
And Rinta's a more
cautious player,

114
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,847
so he's suited to
playing the baseline.

115
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,515
He's getting around
the court way better

116
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,101
than when he plays
up front with you.

117
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,354
Those two make a...

118
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,898
Yeah, they're a
well‐balanced pair.

119
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,524
Sure, I guess.

120
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,739

That's how you want it?

are gonna take this one.

that get past me.

pretty lost.

get it together bro!

make him freeze up.

something I wanna try.

What the crap?

up way at the back?

Hey, I get it now.

152
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,711
It works 'cuz Nao
has good control.

153
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,130
And since he's not up by
the net, he has time to aim.

154
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,173
Crap!

155
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,805
They scored.

Right!

[TOMA panting]

160
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,525
[TOMA] Nao and Taiyo have
similar personalities,

161
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,360
so they're able to
read each other easily.

322
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,600
See ya' later, Mister Sakurai.

323
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,351
Uh, later.

324
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,403
[SAKURA] The equation is
X plus two Y equals two.

325
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,906
If we set X to zero,
we can find where the graph

326
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,532
will cross the Y axis.

327
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,660
Do the same with Y to find
where it crosses the X axis.

328
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,787
If we connect those points,
and extend the line

329
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,999
past them, we end up with
a graph that looks like this.

330
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,417
So if we have a value for X,

331
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,252
we can plug it into
the formula and get‐‐

Long time no see, man.

mean, "what do I want?"

336

Fine, you caught me.

No, I'm not calling to
ask you for money. Yeah.

[TOMA] I didn't expect to see
you at practice, Mister Sakurai.

00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:16,744
Something wrong?

No. But I do have an
announcement for you.

But why Misaki Academy?

Misaki? Are they,
like, a big deal?

354
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,932
They're just one of the
best teams in the country.

355
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,267
Championship level.

356
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,685
Forget winning,
we can't even put up

a fight against those guys.

00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,604
They'll stomp us.

Don't be like that.

360
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,443
Boys your age should
act like grasshoppers.

Y'know, jump around!

You callin' us bugs?

Uh, that's not what I meant.

364
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,492
[MAKI] But he's right.
This is a great opportunity.

[GROUP gasps]

You said they're
championship level,

367
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,162
and we're getting
a chance to play

368
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,790
a practice match
with them. Right?

369
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,501
Yeah, that's true. Good point.

370
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,877
[MAKI]
They're strong opponents.

371
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,338
And they're probably gonna
kick our butts pretty bad.

372
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,882
But you're not the
same team you were.

373
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,385
We're not the same? Really?

374
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,636
Yeah, Really.

375
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,221
Let's see how much
we've changed

376
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,558
and find out how much
potential we have.

377
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,851
Potential, huh?

378
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,394
This is an awesome chance.

379
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,147
It's way better than we ever
could have hoped for, guys.

380
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,982
We'll be able to learn
our true strength,

381
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,235
and we can also find out where
our real weaknesses are.

382
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,612
You can think of it
as a practice run

[SAKURA] That's what boys
are like at this age.

Grasshoppers.

[KADOWAKI] Honestly, I never
expected you to call me

about a practice match.

401
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,195
It caught me off guard.

402
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,780
That's fair.

403
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,239
I figured I should
at least act like

404
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,450
a real club advisor sometimes.

405

That's good to hear.

406
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,704
Especially since... Y'know.

407
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,457
Yeah, right? Five years ago.

408
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,875
Things were different.

409
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,294
Clubs are supposed to be
for the kids to enjoy.

410
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,588
Not treated like some
life‐or‐death deal.

411
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,756
It's not good to push them

412
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,384
into a "winning is
everything" mentality.

413
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,678
But these boys are
pushing themselves.

414
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,388
They have a goal that
they want to achieve,

415
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,682
and they're giving it
everything they've got.

416
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,017
If I told them not to worry
so much about winning,

417
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,811
it would just come off
as a cheap excuse

418
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,979
from an underachieving grown‐up.

419
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,274
That's all. Make sense?

420
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,403
We're not gonna go easy on them.

421
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,987
Practice match or not.

422
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,783
Of course. That's fine.
In fact it's what I want.

00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,244
Come at us with
everything you've got.

424

Careful what you wish for.

425
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,455
I don't think your
kids have ever played

426
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,958
with anybody on our level.

427
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,626
They're sensitive at that age.

428
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,962
Push 'em too far, and
you'll break their spirits.

429
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,798
Think so? I'd say when
it comes to spirit,

430
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,300
I've got nothing to worry
about with these guys.

431
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,095
They're tough,
like grasshoppers.

take care of around here.

So, there's more
up there, right?

461

No. We don't have anything else.

Man, if that doesn't take
me back. How does it go?

470
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,699
Friendship, effort,
I think there was one more.

471
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,618
And I wanted to believe.

472
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,622
All that bullshit they
talk about in school.

473

All the dumb stories
they tell you as a kid

474
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,084
before they throw you out
into the real world.

475

But you. You know
they're all lies.

Because you're my son, Maki.

runs through our veins.

478
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,014
The same filthy blood.

479
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,682
No. You can't!

480
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:57,269
So people like us don't
get to be happy, get it?

481
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,396
We're garbage in
a garbage world!

482
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,731
Please, no!

483
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,405
[KENJI]
Have something by tomorrow.

484
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,991
I'm not leaving here
emptyhanded again.
