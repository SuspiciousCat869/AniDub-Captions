00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,931
[AN]
You're home!

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,265
Hey. Sure am!

3
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,225
[AN giggles]

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,644
Wha‐‐ Whoa, take it easy!

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,395
[AN'S MOM]
You two stop that.

6
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,814
Hands off. Your clothes
are still dirty.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,484
Yeah, okay. Hey, An.

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,903
We can play after
I've had a bath.

9
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,448
Do it as fast as you can!

[NAO'S MOM]
Other hand.

[gasps]

12
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,630
[NAO'S MOM] Where are you
going in the morning?

13
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,423
[NAO]
To the library to study.

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,926
I'm not playing that
game with you anymore.

15
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,678
I told you to quit the club,

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,722
so why are you still
going to practice?

17
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,723
I'm not.

18
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,100
I know you're lying.

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,269
It's true. I did quit.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,812
I'm telling you this
for your own good,

21
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,482
so you need to listen.
I'm worried about you, Nao.

22
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,151
You shouldn't be hanging
around boys like them.

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,778
[NAO]
Mom.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,324
Why can't you just do as I say?

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,451
[NAO'S MOM]
Fine.

26
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,246
I'll take this up with
your club advisor myself.

27
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,831
That'll solve the problem.

28
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,457
Maybe after that,
you'll finally stop

29
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,334
disobeying your mother.

30
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,935
What? You want to
watch Shingo's game?

31
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,688
[AN] Mm‐hm! Tomorrow's Sunday
so I wanna go to Shingo's

32
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,357
school with him and watch
him play in his match!

33
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,608
[AN'S MOM]
But don't you wanna go shopping

34
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,734
with me tomorrow?

35
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,152
We can go to a movie afterwards!

36
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,321
[AN] No! I wanna go
to school with Shingo

37
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,322
and watch him play!

38
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,740
Well, you can't.

39
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,034
An. Do you want to go that bad?

40
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,870
Yeah. I really wanna
watch Shingo's match!

41
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,541
Shingo. Can you look after
her if she comes along?

42
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,626
Of course I can.

43
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,088
Plus I'll have the whole club
there to help me out.

44
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,298
[AN'S DAD]
That should be fine, right, Mom?

45
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,217
I think they can handle this.

46
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,762
An. You be a good girl and
listen to your big brother.

47
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,765
‐‐Yay!
‐‐[AN'S MOM] Honey, please!

48
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,183
[AN'S MOM]
Honestly.

49
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,352
[giggles]

50
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,150
[AYA] They've got you going
to practice on Sundays, too?

51
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,151
You're working hard!

52
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,028
You, too, going in on
the weekend. Good for us.

53
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,073
[AYA] Well, a weekend off
would be nice for a change.

54
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,159
[sighs] What would
really be great

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,244
would be a better‐paying job.

56
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,663
[MAKI] I think everybody dreams
of a better paying job.

57
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,291
[AYA] We all need dreams
to help keep us going.

58
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,377
Yeah, I guess so.

59
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,630
[AYA] Maki. How is
soft tennis? Still fun?

60
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,717
[MAKI]
Mm... Mm‐hm!

61
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,677
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

62
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,054
Great. Glad to hear it.

63
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,269
[YUTA] Aw, hi there!
Are you Shingo's sister?

64
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,104
Hey! An's here!

65
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,106
Hi, Taiyo! Doin' good?

66
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,983
Hey. Nice to see you again, An!

67
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,110
Long time no see,
An. 'Member me?

68
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,362
Vice‐president!

69
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,740
Wow, she's so smart!
I think she's got you beat.

70
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,992
Maybe. Already knows katakana.

71
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,495
Now, An, be a good girl, okay?

72
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,372
You're partners with my brother!

73
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,832
Yeah, I sure am!

74
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,666
[TAIYO]
Hey, An.

75
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,876
You wanna come help me
sweep off the tennis courts?

76
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,963
[AN]
Yeah! That sounds fun!

77
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,091
Thanks for helping us out.
And good luck with the match.

78
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,300
Same to you.

79
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,135
The girls have all been
looking forward to today,

80
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,721
so I'm hoping they'll have
some fun with it this time.

81
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,061
[SAKURA]
Okay, Namie.

82
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,813
They left the nurse's
office open for us,

83
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,190
so if anyone gets hurt,
go straight there.

84
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,942
Make sure everybody
stays hydrated.

85
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,027
It's pretty hot out here today.

86
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,488
[NAMIE] Yes, ma'am.
I'll let everyone know.

87
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,199
We're going in the same order
we talked about, right?

88
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,910
Hirahashi and Nagae.
Tawaramoto and Ichikawa.

89
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,705
Then Kuroda and Kawanishi.
And we're up last.

90
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,914
Sounds good.

91
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,333
Everyone's so excited
about this practice match.

92
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,961
[KEI] It felt like a real chore
the last time we did one,

93
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,796
but now they're all fired up.

94
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,799
'Cause the boys have
been practicing so hard.

[BOTH giggle]

96
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,639
Look here. We hold the
racket like this. See?

97
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,351
[AN]
Mm‐hm! That's easy.

98
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,020
[yelping]

99
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,146
Help, Shingo!

100
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,440
Got it. Watch this.

101
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,819
You're so cool!

102
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,322
You look at Shingo
like he's a superhero.

103
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,282
That's 'cause my big
brother is the strongest

104
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,325
in the whole world!

105

[GROUP laughs]

106
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,246
Hello, looks like we've got
a tiny little cheerleader today!

107
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,206
You all need to be
extra careful.

108
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,001
Keep an eye on her and make sure
she doesn't get hurt, okay?

109
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,586
We've got it, Tacky.

110
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,046
Everyone's taking
turns watching her;

111
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,631
nothing will happen.

112
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,389
Maki. About today's match.

113
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,432
Yeah?

114
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:25,028
Is it okay if I go explore?
"Oh, yeah, sure!"

115
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,420
[KEI] Are you okay
with five‐set matches?

116
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,922
Yeah, that'll be perfect.

117
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,591
These bags are heavy.
Why do I have to take two?

118
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,802
[KANAKO] Well, you are the
strongest in the whole world.

119
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,261
[SHINGO laughs]

120
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,682
Hey. Where did An go?

121
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,643
She needed to use the bathroom,
so I told her where it was.

122
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,436
‐‐I guess she's not back yet.
‐‐[SHINGO] Huh?

123
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,607
Wait. You let her wander off?
Why would you do that?

124
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,359
I can't go with her
into the girls' room.

125
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,194
Are you an idiot?

126
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,375
This is bad.

127
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,795
[KANAKO]
Rintaro!

128
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,673
[panting]

129
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,134
We have to go find An!

130
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,343
Huh?

131
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,012
[TAIYO]
An?

132
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,182
Hey, An, where did you go?

133
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,477
An. Come on out now!

134
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,104
[TSUBASA]
Where is she?

135
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,897
I'm worried 'cause
she's so little.

136
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,733
I hope she didn't
get herself stuck.

137
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,109
I don't think that she would.

138
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,610
She's smart.

139
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,036
[KANAKO]
We're safe. The door is locked.

140
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,078
That's good.

141
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,539
At least we know she's
not on the roof.

142
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,226
Hey, An?

143
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,146
You have club
activities on a Sunday?

144
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,277
If she's lost...

145
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,742
They'll cancel our match.

146
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,621
You need to stop wasting
your time on soft tennis, Nao.

147
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,540
It's because An is here.

148
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,005
[NAO]
Because of her.

149
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,265
[YUTA]
We couldn't find her there.

150
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,517
[SHINGO]
For real?

151
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,351
[KANAKO]
Yeah.

152
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,393
[SHINGO]
Then we've got nothing.

153
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,687
[TSUBASA]
Dammit, where'd she go?

154
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,606
And you?

155
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:07,440
No luck.

156
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,818
Really? How hard
were you looking?

157
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,361
You think I'm lying?

158
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,321
It's your fault this is
happening in the first place!

159
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,573
[TAIYO] Wait, I'm not trying
to accuse you of anything!

Please give the guys
a little more time.

It won't be much longer!

176

[TAIYO] Nao. You need
to tell me the truth.

177
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,128
[NAO]
I am telling the truth.

178
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,255
I looked around for An
and I couldn't find her.

Seriously, I don't
know where she is.

Where did you look?

[NAO]
Yeah. She wasn't there.

189
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,322
[MAKI] I went to the
nurse's office, too.

190
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,949
But I couldn't check it
because the door was locked.

This is on all of us

[SOFT TENNIS CLUB]
We're sorry!

Uh. This is kind of awkward.

[NAO] This isn't right.
I shouldn't be part of this.

It wasn't supposed
to be this way.

[BOTH]
Yeah!

227
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,236
[KANAKO]
I don't understand why Tsukinose

228
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,489
would lie like that.

229
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,823
[MAKI]
I think that, in his head,

230
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,742
he might have been
telling us the truth.

231
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,035
[KANAKO]
What do you mean?

232
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,745
If Nao thought that
he would be better off

233
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,288
if the lie was true,
he could have

234
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,706
made himself think that it was.

235
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:34,957
[KANAKO] What would have
happened if we didn't

236
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,793
end up finding An when we did?

237
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,796
I'm sure that they would have
canceled the practice match.

238
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,506
I don't know if that's
what Nao was trying

239
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,258
to do from the start,
or if he just committed

240
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,302
to the lie because the guilt
of admitting the truth

241
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,804
would have been
too much for him.

242
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,472
Most people don't like to lie.

243
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,017
It makes them feel ashamed
and disgusted with themselves.

244
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,229
But if they can fool themselves
into believing their own lies,

245
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,522
they can get rid
of those feelings

246
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,232
without having
to face the truth.

247
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,608
At least for a while.

248
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,568
Sure, but in the end,
is it really worth

249
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,278
having to keep all that up?

250
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,573
He should know it'll
end up worse for him.

251
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,828
[YUTA] Some people lie about
random stuff for no reason.

252
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,747
Maybe because of emotional
stress or trauma.

253
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,500
[TOMA] Nao deals with plenty
of that thanks to his mom.

254
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,460
Anyone who knows him
could tell you.

255
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,963
So you think it's Nao's mom
who's causing him stress?

256
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,215
It's normal for parents
to worry about their kids

257
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,217
and get involved in
their lives, but...

258
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,344
The way she does it is too much.

259
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,679
She rejects everything about him

260
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,098
that doesn't line up
with what she wants.

261
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,224
[KANAKO]
Being that overbearing

262
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,352
is a kind of child
abuse all by itself.

263
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,271
[MAKI] But parents who act
like that tell themselves

264
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,274
that they're looking out for
their children's interests.

265
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,859
They don't even understand
what they're really

266
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,902
doing to their kids.

267
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,156
Do you think Nao's dad ever
says anything about it?

268
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,076
There's no way he's thinking
that much about his family.

269
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,749
[TOMA] We had an awesome
practice today, though.

270
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,585
[YUTA] Yeah, it was cool
of the girls to let us play

tough, but now we know

273
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,881
where we need to improve.

274
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,883

that much fun for you?

can you even feel the hits?

Yeah, way more than in a sport
you play with your feet.

00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,967
Don't run off alone like that.
Can you say you're sorry?

317
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,468
Sorry, Shingo.

318
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,679
Okay. And if you wanna
go exploring again

319
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,598
you'll ask first. Promise?

320
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,308
[AN]
Promise!

321
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,740
[AN giggling]

322
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,451
[AN'S MOM]
Stop squirming.

323
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,078
It's hard to clean your ears
when you're moving around.

324
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,958
[AN]
I can't help it! It tickles!

325
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,422
[SHINGO] I'm gonna go take
some practice swings.

326
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,965
The tournament is soon, right?

327
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,091
Keep it up, son.

328
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,426
[SHINGO]
Got it.

329
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,552
Keep it up!

330
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,678
[SHINGO]
Right.

331
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,563
Tsubasa? Come back!

332
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,358
[TSUBASA groans]

333
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,655
Hey, what happened? You're hurt!

334
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,448
[TSUBASA]
It's not a big deal.

335
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,991
Lemme see it.

336
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,082
[SHINGO] That looks bad.
What happened to you?

337
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,293
I just fell down like
half a flight of stairs.

338
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,003
C'mon, I've got you.

339
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,425
[SHINGO]
I'll be right back!

340
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,636
Dad! It's Tsubasa, he's hurt!

341
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,304
We need to get him
to the hospital!

342
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,056
You mean Soga?

343
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,989
[DOCTOR 9A] Minor ulnar
fracture. See it there?

344
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,118
So it's broken? How long
will it take to heal?

345
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,704
[DOCTOR 9A] I'd say probably
about two months.

346
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,748
It looks like all your weight
must have come down on it wrong.

347
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,375
You say you fell
down the stairs?

348
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,337
Uh, yeah, that's right.
I lost my footing.

349
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,755
Is that the truth?

350
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,383
Sure there wasn't
anybody else involved?

351
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,100
No, just me. I do stupid
things sometimes.

352
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,685
Huh?

353
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,729
[SHINGO] Doctor? Is this
going to keep him

354
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,230
from playing tennis?

355
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,149
[DOCTOR 9A]
Are you right‐handed?

356
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,150
Yes.

357
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,860
Then I'm afraid so.

358
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,237
You're not gonna be able to hold
a racket until it's healed.

359
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,115
[gasps] Two months...

360
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,954
[TSUBASA]
Shingo. I'm sorry.

361
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,383
[AN'S DAD]
Well, An's asleep.

362
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,385
[AN'S MOM] That's one good
part of him being out.

363
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,679
The house is quieter
and so is she.

364
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,972
[AN'S DAD]
I suppose.

365
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,307
That child looks so
much like his mother.

366
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,601
Has the exact same eyes.

367
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,228
I guess.

368
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,813
I can see it more every day.

369
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,565
Boys are like that.

370
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,024
[AN'S DAD]
Ya think?

371
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,568
People have always
told me that his aunt

372
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,528
looks like me, though.

373
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,365
[AN'S DAD sighs]

374
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,285
Where did he run off to?

375
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,495
He and Soga went
to the park to talk.

376
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,831
Why the park, at this hour?

377
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,001
[AN'S DAD]
They needed privacy.

378
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,090
[TSUBASA]
I think my dad hates me.

379
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,303
I'm not good enough,

380
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,056
and I can't keep up
with my older brothers.

381
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,683
[SHINGO]
That's tough competition.

382
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,269
They're both crazy good
at soccer, right?

383
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,646
Why didn't you go that route?

384
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,232
[TSUBASA] I never had
much talent for soccer.

385
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,651
I tried my best back
in elementary school.

386
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:23,611
Yeah, I was there.

387
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,613
We played on the
same team back then.

388
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:29,033
Dude. You were great!

389
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,826
I was nothing special.

390
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:34,997
There was no way I could
play on my brothers' level.

391
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,583
So I gave up on it,
and I don't think Dad

392
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,086
ever forgave me for that.
He thinks I'm a coward.

393
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,214
Unmanly. Totally useless.

394
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,800
[SHINGO] Did your dad used
to be a soccer player?

395
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,093
Yeah, he was.

396
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,180
He still brags about
it all the time.

397
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,807
But why does that mean
I have to do it, too?

398
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,435
I don't need to be
like my brothers.

399
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:00,397
I'm my own person! And today...

400
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,816
When I fell down
the stairs, he...

401
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,486
...just stood there
staring at me!

402
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,491
[TSUBASA]
Dammit! He did this!

403
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,539
[TSUBASA]
I wanna play in our tournament!
