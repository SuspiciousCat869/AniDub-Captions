[MISAKI CROWD] Go, go, Misaki!
Fight, fight, Misaki!

Go, go, Misaki!

00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:20,979
Holy crap.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,023
What the hell are they
doing, yelling like that?

6
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,776
They have over 60 members
on the Misaki boys team,

7
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,613
so a lot of times, their first
years act as a cheer squad.

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,240
Wow. That's creepy.

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,407
Hey, Mitsue.

10
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,493
You might try keeping those
kinds of thoughts to yourself.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,745
Mind your own business.

12
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,330
Just like we talked about.

13
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,916
Nao and Taiyo. You two
will be playing first.

14
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,626
I'm still nervous.

15
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,336
What if they're so far
beyond our level

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,004
that we can't even
put up a fight?

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,049
Yeah, it would seriously
suck if they shut us out.

18
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,051
If you think like that,
you might psych yourselves

19
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,178
into losing a match
you could win.

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,805
You really think they can win?

21
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,932
Yuta's been scouting their
team for the past week,

22
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,893
and he gathered a lot
of good info we can use.

23
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,354
Manager. What can you
tell Nao and Taiyo

24
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,815
about the guys they're playing?

25
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,025
I don't know how helpful
it'll really be.

26
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,443
Have a little confidence.

27
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,196
Let's see. You're going
to have Kazumi Miwa

28
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,156
setting up in the back,
and Ayumu Ooi

29
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,741
will be playing forward.

30
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,244
Miwa has a really
strong opening serve.

31
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,038
His shots are fast, and he
has great placement, too.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,833
Getting shots past Ooi
won't be easy either.

33
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,669
These two are a classic example
of a front‐back pair.

34
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,338
So their basic strategy
will be what you'd expect.

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,882
Watch for Miwa to try
and set the pace.

36
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,593
[MAKI]
Thanks a lot, Yuta.

37
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,428
I think the way to win
is for both of you

38
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,805
to focus on making Miwa
chase after your returns.

39
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,766
I don't think I can keep up
with somebody on his level.

40
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,518
Yeah, true. You probably can't.

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,770
You didn't need to say it
like that, Katsuragi.

42
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,730
But you don't have to.

43
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,564
[TAIYO, NAO gasp]

44
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,233
[MAKI] Between the two of you,
he'll have plenty to deal with.

45
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,736
So just play the way you play.

46
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,989
Yeah, that strategy they
used before could work.

47
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,948
Why not?

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,076
These two can win this
match. Right, guys?

pre‐match ritual of theirs?

66
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,412
Apparently.

67
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:46,708
A war dance, but for
grasshoppers. I guess.

Ugh. Neck's so damn stiff.

And since they're
playing a five‐game set,

00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,198
Yeah. You have to
win the majority

163
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,450
of the games in the set,
so in a three‐game match,

164
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,576
you need to win two.

165
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,538
Seems like a complicated
way to score things.

166
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,873
That's just the way they
do it in soft tennis.

167
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,295
They'll be playing
harder after this.

168
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,297
They know we're for real.

169
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,592
[KAZUMI]
My bad.

170
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,803
Don't worry about it.
Let's reset.

171
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,971
[KAZUMI]
Yeah.

172
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,848
We know that we're the
better players here.

173
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,143
[KAZUMI] For sure. Time to
treat this like a real game.

174
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,395
Right. Let's do it.

175
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,066
Pull it together.

176
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,987

[sighs]

178
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,873
Huh?

179
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,252
[MISAKI OFFICIAL 6A]
Out!

180
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,754
What was that?

181
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,840
It's a slice.
He's adding sidespin.

182
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,633
You could've done that earlier.

183
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,302
1‐0!

184
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,182
Ah!

185
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,269
He started going in
with slice serves

186
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,937
right out of the gate.

187
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,482
He can consistently
pull those off?

188
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,858
[MISAKI OFFICIAL 6A]
2‐0!

Again?

190
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,493
[NAO] Will this next
one be a slice, too?

191
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,786
[AYUMU grunts]

192
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,413
Did they catch up?

193
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,706
Yeah, it's even now.

194
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,125
The game score is now one‐all.

They're totally
controlling the pace now.

199
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,146
In the end, they're still
a championship team.

[MISAKI OFFICIAL 6A]
Game and set!

201
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,653
Miwa and Ooi from
Misaki win the match

202
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,030
with a score of
three games to one.

203
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,034
Sorry. We gave it all we had.

204
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,369
They're on another level.

205
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,329
Nah, you guys did great.

206
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,665
Taking that first game
really threw them off guard.

207
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,292
Yeah. And the two
back formation works.

208
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,753
It'll be awesome with some
more practice. One thing‐‐

209
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,213
We've got some work to do

210
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,756
on our conditioning,
too, don't we?

211
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,967
True. We're gonna need
to run more often.

212
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,344
[RINTARO] Either way,
that was amazing, guys!

213
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,555
You were keeping up with
them for the first half!

214
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,681
[TAIYO, NAO giggle]

215
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,433
What do they look so
happy for? They lost.

216
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,518
But it was worth it.

217
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,936
Even if they didn't
win the game,

218
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,729
it taught them a lot,
and that's what matters

219
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,981
in a practice match.

220
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,066
A loss is still a loss.

221
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,903
[YUTA]
The tall one plays back.

222
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,073
His name's Yanagishita.
He's a true power hitter.

223
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,409
His serve is even
faster than Miwa's.

224
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,703
Ikeda has a great serve,
too, and he's an expert

225
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,664
at positioning himself to
set up Yanagishita's shots.

226
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,750
Between the two of them,
I can't see any weaknesses.

227
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,378
[RINTARO] In other words, these
guys are gonna be really good.

228
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,297
[MISAKI OFFICIAL 6B]
Serving side: Misaki Academy,

229

Yanagishita and Ikeda.

230
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,427
On the receiving side:
Shijo Minami, Futsu and Ameno.

231
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,054
This is a five‐game
match. Play ball!

We can bring it back now that
we have a chance to serve.

236
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,918
Plus we've got a better idea

237
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,878
of what kind of speed
they're working with.

238
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,921
That's true.

239
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,924
And I think Takada's
serves were way scarier.

[ITSUKI]
Yeah, they're no big deal.

the scoop on these guys?
