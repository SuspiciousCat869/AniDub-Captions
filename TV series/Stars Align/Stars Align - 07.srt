[MAKI]
With these guys,

29
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,009
Oji is gonna try to control
every play they make.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,218
He doesn't think of Sunaga

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,763
as an equal on the court.
He's just an accessory.

32
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,141
Which means Oji doesn't
really have a teammate.

33
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,767
Just spare parts.

34
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,853
Sunaga barely gets a
chance to act because

35
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,814
Oji's strategy doesn't allow
him to make decisions.

36
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,649
Maybe. But the stronger player

37
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,693
should take the lead,
right? It makes sense.

38
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,821
Right, and that is what
Oji should be doing.

39
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,407
But instead, he's controlling.
It's different.

40
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,784
And since they're not
really playing as partners,

41
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,703
they lose their
strength as a pair.

42
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,121
I think I get it.

43
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,831
[MAKI] These guys' biggest
weakness as a pair

44
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,626
is that they're not one.
And we can use that.

45
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,044
Here's the plan.

46
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,503
Aim the ball directly
between them

47
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,465
anytime you see an opening.
I know it'll work.

48
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,134
We can win if we throw
Oji off his rhythm.

"final time," huh?

Huh? Right. Each pair has
won two games out of five,

so the match will go to whoever
can take this next one.

scoring system used
just for the final game.

they play to seven.

00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,596
Help me out.

167
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,976
Uh. Yeah. Sure thing.
Let's do this.

168
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,561
Deuce. Play ball!

169
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,942
This is their third
time at advantage.

170
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,527
But our guys are still
hanging in there.

171
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,945
It'll be okay!

172
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,364
They caught on and
started working as a team.

173
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,991
I was hoping that
we could finish this

174
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,826
before they figured it out.

175
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,997
[gasps]

176
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,334
Shit!

177
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,169
Nice volley!

178
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,462
Yeah, we're back to deuce!

179
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,588
[MISAKI OFFICIAL 6D]
Change sides!

180
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,883
So. When exactly is this whole
deuce thing gonna end?

181
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,760
There has to be a
two‐point difference,

182
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,220
so someone needs to win
consecutive points.

183
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,473
But then what happens
if they just keep

184
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,641
trading points back
and forth like this?

185
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,143
They stay at deuce forever?

186
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,270
Technically, that's
what the rules say.

187
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,397
Are these guys ever
gonna get to go home?

188
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,943
Still deuce. Play ball!

189
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,821
I'm ending this
right now. Let's go!

190
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,500
[gasps]

191
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,251
Jeez. You mean he
can still pull off

192
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,461
a serve like that?

193
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,837
Even after running
around the court

194
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,464
like a madman the whole set!

195
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,216
This guy's got our number.

196
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,593
He's got better technique
and he has more stamina.

197
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,262
Yeah. Arashi's a real athlete.

198
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,975
I forgot all about the basics.

199
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,519
Did he make me do that?

200
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,479
[MISAKI OFFICIAL 6D]
Advantage in!

201
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,772
Can I end it?

202
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,690
Is he going left or right?

203
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,800
Oh, crap!

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,765
[yells]

00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,605
I've got this, okay!

206
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,150
Uh! Yeah. Understood!

00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,569

No way!

210
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,312
Guys, that was the match.

[ALL cheer]

212
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,982
Ugh. Dammit, that was close!

213
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,442
Shit, why couldn't
you have stayed

214
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,277
on their side, you stupid ball?

215
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,237
The skill gap was too wide.

216
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,326
Doesn't seem that way
to me. Look at them.

217
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,038
This sucks so bad!
After all that.

218
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,748
It ends like this?!

219
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,333
Those two put up
a real fight against

220
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,585
one of the best pairs
in the country!

221
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,669
Yeah, you're right.

222
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,589
Toma and Maki are amazing!

223
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,216
We couldn't make it happen.

224
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,593
No, but it was awesome.

225
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,427
We lost, though.

226
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,971
Well, yeah, but it
was an amazing game.

227
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,181
I had fun!

[KANAKO]
Mm...

231
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,360
What's the matter, Mitsue?

232
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,238
I came to watch these
guys get dunked on.

233
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,156
My day is ruined.

234
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,120
[TSUBASA]
Stop holdin' out on us, Maki!

235
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,081
We need more ideas for training!

236
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,457
[RINTARO]
Before we do any more teamplay

237
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,126
or technique stuff, I think we
all need to work on cardio.

238
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,294
[TAIYO]
Yeah, I agree.

239
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,213
Should help us move
around the court better.

240
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,756
[NAO] It'll be easier
to win if we're able

241
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,716
to outlast our opponents.

242
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,717
That's true.

243
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,386
Wanna take some extra
time on our run?

244
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,220
Sounds good.

245
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,389
Yo, Tsubasa, rack time!

246
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,935
Yeah! Ooh, it hurts so good!

Hey, Itsuki.

Yo.

00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,544

awesome new trick

I see.

258
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,141
That's another thing we're
gonna have to work on.

259
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,726
[TSUBASA]
So we purposely leave one side

260
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,936
open to bait the opponent
into aiming there?

261
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,439
[SHINGO] We have to be fast to
make it work, so let's sprint!

262
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,815
[TSUBASA] But we also need
to have the endurance

263
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,233
to keep playing after.

264
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,986
Right. These are good
things to keep in mind.

265
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,988
Let's put our heads together
and make a schedule.

266

[TOMA] Good idea.
What do you think, Maki?

267

the schedule right and all.

I don't know.

271
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,462
I'm not sure if pushing
ourselves into more

272
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,173
and more practice is the
right approach to take.

273
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,924
You're saying practicing
isn't the best way

274
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,884
for us to get better?

275
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,886
[TAKAYUKI]
You guys are looking lively!

276
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,929
So is this a strategy meeting?

277
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,432
It's really good to see
you all working so hard.

But don't overdo it, okay?

279
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,728
[TSUBASA] Get real, Tacky!
We can't slow down now.

280
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,730
We still suck real bad
and we're not gonna get

281
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,648
any better unless
we keep practicing!

282
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,900
Right, and we don't
have much time

283
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,151
before the summer tournament!

284
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,112
Hey. Why don't you set us up
another practice match?

285
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,864
Yeah, I think that's
a great idea!

286
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,950
Could you? That'd be awesome!

287
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,410
I'm glad you're excited;

it's great to see
all this enthusiasm.

00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,498
Which is why you're getting
us another practice match!

290
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,833
Thing is, that positive
attitude won't be enough

291
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,710
to keep up this pace
all the way to summer.

292
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,588
Be careful, or you're
gonna run out of gas.

Shut up, no we won't!

You will.

295
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,301
I'm your club advisor,
so I'm advising you, okay?

296
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,221
If there's one thing I can
offer, it's life experience.

297
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,515
Well, what should we
be doing instead then?

298
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,350
Get away from
school for a while.

299
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,060
Go someplace you can relax.

Tacky was the outdoorsy type?

Yeah, I'm kinda shocked.

You're kidding, right?

I borrowed all this
stuff from Ms. Murou.

Ah. I wouldn't have
figured that either.

314
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,765
So anyway, whatcha got
in the cooler there?

Oh, just this here.

Whoa, that's a lot
of meat. Oh, man!

Dang, Tacky, you are
not messin' around!

There's game meat, too.

320
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,401
I talked with a friend
of mine and had him send me

some venison and
wild boar to cook.

00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,911
They're already
setting up the grill.

325
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,497
[KANAKO]
You're late!

326
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,749
[YUTA]
Mitsue?

327
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,418
Morning!

328
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,752
[KANAKO]
Hmph.

329
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,423
Wonder why Mitsue
decided to come.

330
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,342
Doesn't matter. Right, Yuta?

331
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,847
[MAKI]
We brought some pre‐cut veggies.

332
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:13,764
[SHINGO]
Cool.

333
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,558
[MAKI]
Yuta lent me a hand with those.

334
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,186
[ITSUKI] You're like a pro
on that grill, Makimaki.

335
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,272
[SHINGO]
Look at that!

336
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,774
It's no big trick, I've just
had a lot of practice.

337
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,401
Time to start the <i>yakisoba</i>.

338
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,527
Bring the noodles please.

339
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,904
Got it!

340
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,406
[TOMA]
I brought the water.

341
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,616
[MAKI]
Pour it in the pot to boil.

342
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,284
[TOMA]
Uh, sure thing.

343
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,954
[ARASHI]
All right, Kamuy. Keep it up!

344
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:39,916
Wait!

345
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,919
Ow.

346
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,258
Hey, I know them!
What's going on?

347
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,303
Man, I love meat!

348
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,305
Do you have any idea what
you're eating right now?

349
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,806
I know it's meat!

350
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,766
[ITSUKI]
Looks great.

351
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,309
[TAIYO]
Everything tastes amazing.

352
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,728
Eat up. We've got tons
of food here, guys.

353
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,606
Oh, man! Who knew
deer was this good?

354
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,651
But I think I might like
the boar even better!

355
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,195
Which makes sense
since it's pork.

356
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,448
Wow, Mitsue. You
sure can eat a lot.

357
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,908
Yeah, what about it?

358
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,245
It's nothing, just...
when I see you at lunch.

359
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,790
You never look like
you enjoy eating.

360
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,125
So what? That's my
business, not yours.

361
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,753
She can't help it.
This food is way too good.

362
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,589
I'm pretty sure all girls
actually eat like crazy.

363
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,508
Like Namie has five meals a day.

364
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,094
I've got two big sisters
and they both eat a ton.

365
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,471
Yeah, so it's normal. Eat up.

366
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:39,725
Ugh. Gee, thanks. This
isn't awkward or anything.

367
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,768
[KAMUY barks]

368
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,936
Huh?

369
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,650
Yo. Thought I'd come
crash your party.

370
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,901
How's it goin', Arashi?

371
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,278
Taking the dog for a walk?

372
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,530
That's right, this
guy's name is Kamuy.

373
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,532
What a good boy!

374
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,449
Can I?

375
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,284
Sure.

376
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,578
Ready? Now catch!

377
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,290
Thanks for sharing.
You thank him, too, boy.

378
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,000
[barks]

379
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,168
He's as smart as
he is handsome.

380
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,170
[ARASHI]
Obviously, he takes after me.

381
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,047
Hold on. What's the deal?

382
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,049
Is that the angry kid
from the other day?

383
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,676
Why'd he have to show up?

384
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,428
Trying to pick a
fight or something?

385
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,722
Pretty ballsy to come
here alone, if that's it.

386
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,141
Nobody's looking
for a fight, guys!

387
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,517
So, Maki.

388
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,103
From what I hear, you're
still new to soft tennis.

389
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:24,979
That's right.

390
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,732
It's been, I think
about a month now?

391
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,609
That's it? A month?

392
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,569
Yep. That's it.

393
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,987
Now I'm mad.

394
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,239
Coach put me up against
a total newbie.

395
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,700
But it was still a pretty
good match, wasn't it?

396
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,994
Yeah, one of the best
I've had in a while.

397
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:40,995
No kidding.

398
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,581
Hey, thanks. Have some barbecue.

399
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,082
We really don't mind sharing,

400
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,377
as long as you don't mind
helpin' us make more.

401
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,046
[ARASHI, SHINGO laughing]

402
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,714
[SHINGO]
Those serves were sick though!

403
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,466
How did you get so good at that?

404
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,843
[ARASHI]
That was 100 percent raw talent.

405
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,677
[SHINGO]
Don't lie.

406
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,096
I bet you do like
1,000 practice swings.

407
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,806
No way. Twice that at least.

408
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,308
[BOTH laugh]

409
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,851
What's up with these two?

410
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,479
They synced up quick because
they each have half a brain.

411
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,482
Whoa. Hey, Maki.
What is this stuff?

412
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,108
It looks like <i>yakisoba</i>.

413
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,236
Yeah. They're Okinawan
fried noodles.

414
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,156
Okinawan fried noodles?
Never had 'em.

415
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,120
Oh, man. This stuff's awesome!

416
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:28,334
That's good! Okinawan
fried noodles are the best!

417
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,710
There's more!

418
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,881
So, uh. That was
for everybody?

419
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,509
[ARASHI] Sorry. I can't
help myself, guys!

420
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,012
You know?

421
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,181
Is it all gone?

422
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,809
Sure is. But we can make more.

423
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,982
[ARASHI] Whoa, Maki!
You're a beast on that grill!

424
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,192
I'm just cooking lunch, man,

425
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,736
it's really not a big
deal. There we go.

426
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,279
[ARASHI]
That's so cool!

427
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,864
For real, you make
our housekeeper

428
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,075
and our nutritionist
look like amateurs!

429
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,452
Back up. "Housekeeper?"
"Nutritionist?"

430
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,578
That is what he said.

431
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,622
The Prince of Soft Tennis
here must be loaded.

432
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,083
I mean, even his dog
looks expensive.

433
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,337
Aw! Hi there!

taken a liking to you, too!

[ARASHI]
Sure, that's fine.

438
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,180
As long as Kamuy's okay with it.

439
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,932
[TSUBASA]
Dogs are the best.

[KANAKO] Ugh. Have you dorks
never seen a dog before?

441
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,146
You okay?

442
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,230
Yeah, why?

443
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:34,859
Sorry. I was wondering why
you're eating by yourself.

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,027
Oh. It's fine.

Is there something wrong?

No, I'm good. It's just that...

447

I have a hard time
being around people

Mm... Uh.

00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,041

I feel like I'll just mess it up

00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,503
if I try to take part.
I can't see how I fit in.

[gasps]

I wanted to ask, Maki.

455
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,516
How did you get your
reflexes so sharp?

456
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,226
What sports did you play before?

457
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,936
We asked him the same
thing when he joined

458
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,147
and he told us he'd never
played a sport in his life.

459
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,816
I guess... Yeah,
that's probably it.

460
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,526
All those chocolate‐
covered critters.

461
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,987
Huh? What chocolate‐
covered critters?

462
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:20,821

Oh, gross!

465
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,867
[MAKI] Our crappy old
apartment was swarming

466
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,661
with the things. Mom
offered me ten yen apiece

467
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,581
for each one I could catch,
so I got really good at it.

468
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,374
And I think it ended up
training my reflexes

469
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,001
and dynamic vision.

470
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,252
Roach training?

00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,253
No thanks.

472
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,172
I tried a few things
and found the best way

473
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,840
to catch them was
with chopsticks.

00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,105
like we did before, guys!

482
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,940
Yeah, good idea!

483
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,691
Man, thinking about
it gets me pumped!

484
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,109
Right, let's do it!

485
00:21:59,151 --> 00:21:59,944
I'm in!

486
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,904
Kinda weird to do
in public, but...

487
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,072
Meh, screw it.

488
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,699
Yeah! I don't know what
we're doin', but I'm in!

489
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,576
You kind of don't go
to our school, dude.

490
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,412
Yeah, so what?
Don't sweat the details!

491
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,039
Hey! Captain!

492
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,291
Yeah. Sorry!

493
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,418
Here we go, guys!

494
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,586
[SOFT TENNIS CLUB, ARASHI]
Yeah!

495
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,298
We're gonna win the whole
summer tournament, right? Fight!

496
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,218
[SOFT TENNIS CLUB, ARASHI]
Whoa! Fight!

497
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,430
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

498
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,434
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

499
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,853
Go! Go! Go!

500
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,771
Whoa!

501
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,524
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

502
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,475
[HEAD OF YEAR] Sir, how exactly
should we handle this?

503
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,602
[PRINCIPAL] This was about
the Soft Tennis Club?

504
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,978
The boys, you said.

505
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,438
[HEAD OF YEAR] It would seem
they're using outdated,

506
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,773
dangerous training methods.

507
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,025
[PRINCIPAL] And that was a
complaint from a parent, yes?

508
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,443
[HEAD OF YEAR]
Yes, sir.

509
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,195
Apparently, the club
members were forced

510
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,073
to participate in a
Sunday practice yesterday.

511
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,535
[PRINCIPAL grumbles]
This is troublesome.

512
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,995
[HEAD OF YEAR sighs]
