1
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,851
[knocking]

2
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,187
You had club activities
on a Sunday?

3
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,772
What was that all about?

4
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,982
I already explained
it yesterday.

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,526
The team went to a barbeque.

6
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,777
I don't believe that.

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,072
A club full of irresponsible
boys having a random barbecue?

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,657
Something just isn't adding up.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,617
I wouldn't say that
they're irresponsible.

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,702
[NAO'S MOM] Regardless, those
boys on the Soft Tennis Club

11
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,287
are a bad influence on you.

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,790
And besides, you're not
even old enough to drink,

13
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,376
so what fun is
a barbecue to you?

14
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,210
In any case,

15
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,170
you should be spending
more time on your studies,

16
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,714
or else you won't pass those
high school entrance exams.

17
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,258
It's only my second
year, you know.

18
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,968
So, there's one year left!

19
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,886
And all that soft tennis
is wasting the time

20
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:53,971
you have remaining.

21
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,305
You need to quit
before it's too la‐‐

22
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,349
I'm not going to quit!

23
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:00,852
[NAO'S MOM]
Not sure if you forgot,

24
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,105
but I watched one of
your practice matches.

25
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,023
Your advisor even
thought it was a joke.

26
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,358
All of those
"teammates" of yours

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,194
never stood a chance
and lost every game.

28
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,947
And you couldn't hold your
own out on the court either.

29
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,908
I've never been
so embarrassed before.

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,452
Yeah, but now
things are different.

31
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,663
[NAO'S MOM]
How exactly? Are you winning?

32
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,915
Is that why you're
slacking off at some party?

33
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:22,791
[NAO]
Well, I‐‐

34
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,626
[NAO'S MOM]
Just do as you're told!

35
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,920
I'm only telling you these
things for your own good!

36
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,632
It's my responsibility
as your mother!

37
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,136
But did I ask for that?
No, I didn't.

38
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,323
[TAKAYUKI] Tsukinose's parents
actually said that?

39
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,991
Mr. Sakurai.

40
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,869
Claims like these can
often be hard to disprove.

41
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,413
It's important that
you understand

42
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,081
this type of situation.

43
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,041
So, unless we do
something promptly,

44
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,002
the state of things could
escalate and get out of hand.

45
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,839
I assume you want to
discipline the club then.

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,549
[PRINCIPAL] I do believe
that's our best option

47
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,176
at the moment, but...

48
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,930
Maybe it is the best option
for the school and the parents.

49
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:47,144
But then... What about the kids?
What's best for them?

50
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,106
Huh? Seriously? An entire week?

51
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,775
For real? How come? Why now?

52
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,694
Well, I can think of one reason.

53
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,070
Was it that old hag?

54
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,864
She strikes again.

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,365
Who do they mean?

56
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,950
It was Nao's mom.

57
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,578
She complains to the school
for just about everything.

58
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:09,458
You could say that she's
a bit "overprotective."

59
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,959
That's gotta be pretty rough.

60
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,377
Hey, Nao. Are you okay?

61
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,504
[TAKAYUKI] But there's
good news to go with this.

62
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,215
Yup. The bracket
for the summer team

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,009
tournament was just decided.

64
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,469
I received the
diagram in the mail

65
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,803
first thing this morning.

66
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:22,804
Did you really?

67
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,222
Hurry up and show it to us!

68
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,724
What the hell's wrong with you?

69
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,267
Start with that news first!

70
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,518
Well, who do we got?
Spit it out!

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,895
Yeah, sure. Give me a sec‐‐

72
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,062
[SHINGO]
Mine now! 'Kay!

73
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,189
Lemme take a look at this thing!

74
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,356
[TAIYO]
Finally! The team tournament!

75
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,274
[ITSUKI]
Who's up first?

76
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,444
It's Hatanooka middle school!

77
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,406
[YUTA] This Joy guy is
a big hit on social media.

78
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,240
It's nuts.

79
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,409
[KANAKO]
Yeah, I guess so. Joy Kusakabe.

80
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,911
He's only half Japanese.

81
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,204
[TOMA]
Just look at him.

82
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,206
[MAKI] He's only in
his second year and‐‐

83
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,874
Wait, he's that tall already?

84
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,876
A matchup like this should
be against the rules.

85
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,461
He's on a whole other level.

86
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,631
It's hard to believe that
he's a second year like us.

87
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,633
We don't know much
about Hatanooka.

88
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,343
What do you think we should do?

89
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,261
You wanna gather
data, don't you?

90
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,472
We have to take a week off
from practice anyway.

91
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,849
Let's try to make use of
that time and form a plan!

92
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,019
A winning strategy!

93
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,896
Hey, you guys?

94
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,482
I might have an idea
that could help you out.

95
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,990
[IZUMI]
Something for Yu to wear.

96
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,534
This one might be
pretty cute on him.

97
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,868
What do you think, Izumi?

98
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,995
Yeah! I think that
would be pretty good.

99
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,497
We can try this one, too!

100
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,498
[YUTA]
Please, um...

101
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,707
[IZUMI, HIKARI]
Hm?

102
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,251
Keep this a secret from Mom.

103
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,503
Sure, No problem.

104
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,130
This'll be our little
secret, promise.

105
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,425
[NAO'S MOM] Aren't you glad
that club is on a break?

106
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,136
Now you have all the
study time you need.

107
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,597
I'll make sure you
take advantage of it.

108
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,392
I know! We can try to get
you into cram school.

109
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,143
I think that would be helpful.

110
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,563
I have a pamphlet for one.

111
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:59,317
Really? Yeah, sure. That's good.

112
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,902
Think so? Perfect.

113
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,738
Because I already signed
you up for a trial session.

114
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,241
[NAO]
Cool. When?

115
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,742
How's tomorrow?

116
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,453
I can fill out the admission
forms right away.

117
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,164
I'm so glad to see that
you're motivated, Nao.

118
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,459
Uh‐huh.

119
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,964
[RINTARO]
Wait, scouting?

120
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,842
[TAIYO] Yup. At Hatanooka.
But in the past,

121
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,760
outsiders that snooped
at their tennis courts

122
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,762
got reported to the police
if they got caught!

123
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,015
Didn't they make it impossible
to see their players

124
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,766
on the courts by
putting up a new fence

125
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,768
and a buncha shrubbery
in the way?

126
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,813
The shrubs are to keep
perverts out. I'd bet money.

127
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,024
But still. That
doesn't stop them.

128
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,400
There are always a lot of girls

129
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,193
trying to get a glimpse
of that Joy guy.

130
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,696
Those types of fangirls
are the absolute worst.

131
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,948
Stalking his every move
and squealing like harpies.

132
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,742
It's so gross.

133
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,952
Well. Teachers did
try to stop them.

134
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,787
But, they've sorta
given up on it.

135
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,457
They figured that it wasn't
a threat to their security.

136
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,584
It's only a few excited girls.

137
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,920
[TSUBASA] So a group of boys
like us would stand out.

138
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,046
Forget standing out!

139
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,964
They would totally
report us to the police!

140
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,925
Wouldn't it be better to
just be straightforward

141
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,009
with them and say
that we're there

142
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,719
to watch some of the matches?

143
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,137
[RINTARO]
Well, yeah.

144
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,431
But, they'll probably know
we're their opponents,

145
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,017
and it's gonna be pretty obvious
that we're scouting them.

146
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,810
So that wouldn't work.

147
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,103
Yeah, good point.

148
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,147
We really only
have one advantage.

149
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,025
None of the other schools know
anything about what we can do.

150
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,194
Which means, if we wanna
keep the advantage,

151
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,696
we can't reveal ourselves
and risk them scouting us back.

152
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,906
[SHINGO]
Well, if that's the case,

153
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,116
let's just lie about
what school we're from.

154
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,117
No way.

155
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,495
'Kay, "no way" it is.

156
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,122
It'll be fine as long
as we don't get caught.

157
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,542
Hang on. I know.
We can just have her go!

158
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,923
Huh? What? Are you crazy?
Yeah, hard pass.

159
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,841
I think we'd probably
get more info

160
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,760
if a club member went to watch.

161
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,261
We're trying to analyze them.

162
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,930
Learn their plays and practices.

163
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:56,935
Ya See? I can't do
any of that kinda stuff.

164
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,355
[YUTA] Why don't we disguise
ourselves as girls and go?

165
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,606
As girls?

166
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,649
'Cause...

167
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,026
...there's gonna be lots of
girls watching Joy anyway;

168
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,361
we can blend right in with them.

169
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,405
Huh? You're serious about this?

170
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,448
I never considered it,
but it could work.

171
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,409
Well? Why's everyone so quiet?

172
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,243
Any takers?

173
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,161
Wait! Where are you
gonna get clothes?

174
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,329
And what about your hair?

175
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,539
I have two older sisters,

176
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,916
and we can borrow outfits
and wigs from them.

177
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,584
I can film the match,
and someone should

178
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,752
come with me as backup.

179
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,754
You've thought this through.

180
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,965
Well, it works for me!

181
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,385
But who else here could
pull it off with you?

182
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,562
Yeah? What?

183
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,695
[zipping]

184
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,406
Wow. You know how
to use this makeup?

185
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,908
Yeah, my older sisters
taught me how to do it.

186
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,452
[MAKI]
That makes sense.

187
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,707
Don't you think this
is kinda weird?

188
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,167
Not really.

189
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,544
[YUTA]
Oh? That's how you truly feel?

190
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,463
Well, I get how other
people might think

191
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,339
it's weird, but it
doesn't bother me.

192
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,050
No one should have to fit
into a mold that's not

193
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,801
made for them, so they
should do what they want

194
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:15,513
to find out who they are.
That make sense?

195
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,683
[YUTA] It does.
To be completely honest,

196
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,811
I'm not really
sure about myself.

197
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,106
There's actually this
friend of my mom's.

198
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,983
Legally, he's
registered as female,

199
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,069
but everything else
about him is male.

200
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,237
Really? How so?

201
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,699
It's referred to
as "FTM," right?

202
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,576
How did you know?

203
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:40,330
He told me all about it.
A while back.

204
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,623
He and my mom have been friends

205
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,625
since they were
in college together.

206
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,126
And ever since I
was a little kid,

207
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,878
he's been there for me.

208
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,672
Even helped me study.
I really love him.

209
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,133
Always have.

210
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,344
My mom was busy with
work all the time.

211
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,263
So he stepped in when
she couldn't care for me.

212
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,933
And without hesitation.

213
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,436
I always considered him
a part of my family.

214
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,438
That sounds nice.

215
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,399
[MAKI] When he was young,
things didn't really feel right.

216
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,193
He knew pretty early on.

217
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,278
And he told me that while
he was in middle school,

218
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,073
it was painful to wear
the girl's uniform.

219
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,368
But he realized no one
else felt the same way.

220
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,328
He was afraid to talk
to his parents about it,

221
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,705
thinking he was betraying
them or something.

222
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,542
He also didn't want to
disappoint or upset them.

223
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,961
He kept all these
feelings inside.

224
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,798
It was pretty agonizing.

225
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,383
He told me he didn't
feel comfortable

226
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,218
in his own skin, and felt alone.

227
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,303
He was terrified of the
future, until one day,

228
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,389
he got tired of being scared.

229
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,932
After graduating and moving out,

230
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,101
he started living
his life as a man.

231
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,813
When he did, that unease
he felt went away.

232
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,148
And that helped.

233
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,109
It made the pain in his
heart a lot more bearable.

234
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,819
Things were better for him.

235
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,697
And the aching got weaker.

236
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,323
That's good for him.

237
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,326
Honestly, I can't fully relate
to that type of situation,

238
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,329
but I do understand
what it's like to wonder

239
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,956
about the meaning
of life and my place

240
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,749
in the world we live in.

241
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,211
Who I am and what could be
the purpose of my existence.

242
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,796
There's a lot to think about.

243
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:18,219
[YUTA gasps] Yeah, I get it.
I sorta feel the same way.

244
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:22,640
If I had to say...
I think I'm non‐binary.

245
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,436
Though, it doesn't feel right
to have to be categorized.

246
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,604
But still...

247
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,522
People always want
some sort of label,

248
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,274
one way or another.

249
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,568
How do I find out what I want?

250
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,570
Or learn about who I really am

251
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,114
and who I wanna become one day?

252
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,033
A lot of people wonder that.

253
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,743
I feel that way, too.

254
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,827
Can't help but think
that I'm pretty

255
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,246
out of place in life sometimes.

256
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,998
"Out of place"?

257
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,708
It's like when you feel
something is wrong,

258
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,585
but you don't know
exactly what it is.

259
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,212
Not knowing how to
justify that feeling

260
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,796
tends to make it worse.

261
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,091
I'm positive that he
must've felt that way.

262
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,302
Is it really that important
that you label yourself

263
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:03,139
a man or a woman?
Does it matter?

264
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,351
Why do people worry about
that in the first place?

265
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,479
I mean, yeah, there are
people who care about it.

266
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,272
But the only person who
can truly understand

267
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,025
what you feel is you.

268
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,902
Sure, others can try
their best to empathize,

269
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,196
but everyone is unique.

270
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,657
I don't pretend like I
know someone else's pain.

271
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,283
But I think it's good
to have some perspective

272
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,910
and be considerate.

273
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,163
Would you be okay with telling
me that person's name?

274
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,667
It's Shou. That's what
I've always called him.

275
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,794
But he used to go
by the name "Shouko."

276
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,004
I suppose a name like that
can confuse some people

277
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,049
when they look at him, so he
goes by "Shou" for short.

278
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,385
If you ask me, I think that
he's a lot more comfortable

279
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,137
with that just being his name.

280
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,057
Uh‐huh. I feel like
I understand that.

281
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,101
Both of my older sisters
shorten my name down

282
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,144
and just refer to me as "Yu."

283
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,771
And I really like that name.

284
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,564
It suits me perfectly.

285
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,233
[MAKI]
Well. Okay.

286
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,569
Then that's what I'll call
you from now on, Yu.

287
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,406
Sure. Thank you, Maki.

288
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,865
[MAKI chuckles]

289
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,911
[YUTA]
All done.

290
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,706
‐‐[TOMA gasps]
‐‐Oh, wow. That's amazing!

291
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,333
I mean. That's so awesome!

292
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,964
Did you end up bringing
a video camera with you?

293
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,966
Yeah, I borrowed
it from my dad.

294
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,093
You don't think we'll
get found out, do you?

295
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,804
Umm. I guess we'll see.

296
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,806
I have no idea what
to expect here.

297
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,182
[MAKI]
I thought the exact same thing.

298
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,517
[gasps]

299
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,810
[BOTH]
Whoa!

300
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,395
Wow!

301
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,313
[SHINGO]
Oh, dang!

302
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,189
[TAIYO]
No way!

303
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,941
Way to go. You pulled it off!

304
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,110
Sure did! Great work!

305
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,987
[SHINGO] Even when
standing next to Mitsue,

306
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,071
they blend right in.

307
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,073
Would you like to share
your thoughts, Shinjo?

308
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,451
Yeah. I think
we'll be just fine.

309
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,536
‐‐Oh... Ouch!
‐‐[KANAKO] No!

310
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,330
All right, let's go!

311
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,626
Huh? Hey it's Toma. Hi, guys.

312
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,379
‐‐Oh?
‐‐[TOMA] Huh, Takuto?

313
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,797
What're you doing here?

314
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,425
I'm on my way to a
basketball match, that's all!

315
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,427
But forget about me!
Who are those two?

316
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,596
They're just a couple
friends of mine.

317
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,222
You don't know them,
so who cares?

318
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,932
Don't you have a basketball
game to get to?

319
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,059
Better hurry!

320
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,686
[TAKUTO] Aw, come on, how'd
you meet those two cuties?

321
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,896
Just introduce me, wouldja?

322
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,105
[TOMA]
Uh, yeah, no!

323
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,940
They're people we
randomly ran into!

324
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,067
Forget about it!

325
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,777
Relax! I don't get
what the big deal is!

326
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,611
Listen!

327
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,280
Go to your match and lose
it already, would ya?

328
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,783
Dude! What are you
freaking out about?

329
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,703
That was pretty harsh, man.

330
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,373
[GROUPIE 8A]
Hey, Joy!

331
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,041
[GROUPIE 8B]
He's the coolest

332
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,334
[GROUPIE 8A]
Smile!

333
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,211
[GROUPIE 8C]
Look at him go!

334
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,547
[GROUPIE 8A]
Give us a smile!

335
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,509
[GROUPIE 8A] Did you see that?
He actually did it!

336
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,343
He looked at me!

337
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,011
Move it, coming through,
outta the way,

338
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,304
we're watching!

339
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,973
You didn't reserve this spot,
so I can watch wherever I want.

340
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,101
Where'd you come from?
I've never seen you.

341
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,602
‐‐I wouldn't worry about it.
‐‐[GROUPIE 8B] Watch it!

342
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,396
What's her problem?

343
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,775
All right, we can see
him clearly from here.

344
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,193
Yeah, the shot's perfect.

345
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,612
[GROUPIE 8B] You can't just show
up and boss us around like that!

346
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,155
Ah, shut it, you cow.

347
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,490
Huh?

348
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,243
[YUTA]
Joy really is amazing.

349
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,662
Seeing him up close
like this confirms it.

350
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,497
[MAKI]
Yeah.

351
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,873
[JOY]
There!

352
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,959
[MAKI]
I see how it is.

353
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,378
[TSUBASA] Mitsue's
arguing with some girls.

354
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,964
[TAIYO] She's the perfect
distraction at a time like this.

355
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,466
She sure knows how to be
a tricky one, doesn't she?

356
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,094
[NAO] Yeah, people barely
even noticed Maki and Yuta,

357
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,471
so they're able to
scout Joy no problem!

358
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,597
It's still risky.

359
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,266
But Mitsue's putting
herself on the line

360
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,685
to give those two exactly
the kind of cover they need.

361
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,686
Man, she's good.

362
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,397
I'm pretty sure we're older
than you three, am I right?

363
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,857
And why does that
matter, huh?

364
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,234
Brats like you should
respect their elders!

365
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,111
I don't have to respect
a hag like you.

366
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,737
‐‐You little!
‐‐[MAKI] That's enough.

367
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,697
Let's go.

368
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,865
[KANAKO]
Okay.

369
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,117
Later! He's all
yours now, grandma!

370
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,285
Don't you dare come back!

371
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,119
Yeah! Leave!

372
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,955
Or else we'll report you!

373
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,957
Nice work. How'd it go?

374
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,586
Good. And it was all
thanks to Mitsue.

375
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,837
[MAKI]
That looks bad.

376
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,590
[SHINGO] They stomped all
over you. Those jerks.

377
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,092
I can't believe that would
go that far three‐on‐one.

378
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:08,926
You okay?

379
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,053
Let's clean your shoes.
It'll just take a second.

380
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,098
It's fine. I don't care.

381
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,143
[MAKI]
You did all of that for us,

382
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,061
even though you
were outnumbered.

383
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,648
It must've been scary,
but it's okay now.

384
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,484
You can relax.

385
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,281
Yeah, whatever.

386
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,495
[YUTA] Y'know. I'm still
not sure what I want.

387
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,746
[MAKI]
What do you mean?

388
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,414
To tell you the truth,
I don't think

389
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,625
I've settled on becoming
a girl just yet.

390
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,751
Today was like going out

391
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,794
and walking around
in a girls' school.

392
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,214
And I'm not sure it was for me.

393
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,256
And yet...

394
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,884
I don't really know if I can
keep going on as a boy.

395
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,471
I can't say for sure
if I have it in me.

396
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,265
It's totally fine if
you're unsure right now.

397
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,100
[YUTA] But they say
the normal thing to do

398
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,977
is to make up your
mind and pick one.

399
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,521
Even if that's true,

400
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,565
you don't have to force
yourself to make a decision.

401
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,277
If we live life at our own
pace, there's always time.

402
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,904
Well, when you
put it that way...

403
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,906
You might be right.

404
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,414
[RINTARO] Unbelievable. He's
a total elite. It's insane.

405
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,791
We'll never be
able to beat him,

406
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,459
no matter what we do.

407
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,254
[ITSUKI] But a team tournament
takes a total of three teams.

408
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,880
Even if we lose a match to Joy,

409
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,465
it's fine if we win
our other ones.

410
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,592
Yeah, I know that, but still...

411
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,635
[NAO]
Then forget Joy!

412
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,345
Let's focus on the other pairs!

413
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,973
You'll lose all three matches
with that kinda mentality.

414
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:37,890
[TAIYO gasps]

415
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,725
That was harsh, don't you think?

416
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,561
[KANAKO] I'm not trying
to be mean about it.

417
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,979
I'm just saying
that's not the right

418
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,188
attitude you should have.

419
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,856
Yeah, good point.

420
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,442
We'll never win if we're
bein' all negative.

421
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,862
We'll have to focus our
efforts on getting better.

422
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,657
We're allowed to resume practice
starting this Saturday.

423
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,200
Let's do a challenge match.

424
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,077
What's a challenge match?

425
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,370
[TAKAYUKI]
Hey, Ms. Murou?

426
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,580
Sounds great, right?

427
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,373
The Soft Tennis Club boys
versus the girls

428
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,792
in a challenge match?
What do ya say?

429
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,252
Will you? Please?

430
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,130
You wanna have a practice
match against us?

431
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:14,468
I dunno. Didn't we just have one
at the beginning of May?

432
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,262
[TAKAYUKI]
We did, but that was, uh...

433
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,598
Awful, if I had
to put it gently.

434
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,807
[TAKAYUKI]
I definitely think this time

435
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,976
it's gonna be different.
Those boys have really turned

436
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,519
themselves around, I swear!

437
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,687
But what about you?

438
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,105
Have you "turned
yourself around"

439
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,315
like those boys have?

440
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,816
Yes?

441
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,402
Another challenge match, huh?

442
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,156
Why not? The boys' club's
been working hard lately.

443
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,951
[ITSUKI] C'mon, I'm
begging you, sis! Please!

444
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,995
You wanna play us, again?

445
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,165
I mean, I personally don't have
anything against the idea.

446
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:44,999
That's great!

447
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,251
Could you ask that
Black Butterfly‐‐ Oh.

448
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,211
I mean Captain Takada about it?

449
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,839
I don't mind passing
the message along to her,

450
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,883
but I can't make promises.

451
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,218
The tournament is
coming up soon, so...

452
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,804
Sounds like Namie's
got it tough, too.

453
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,233
[knocking]

454
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,486
Yeah! Come in!

455
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,993
Hello. Aren't you, uh...?

456
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,537
It's Mitsue.
Do you have a minute?

457
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,164
There's something
I wanna ask you.

458
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,625
[TAKAYUKI]
Yes, of course. What's up?

459
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,715
[KANAKO] Don't you think
it's kinda cluttered in here?

460
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,050
Maybe.

461
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,968
Uh...

462
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,811
Could you please look
at some of my drawings?

463
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,270
[gasps]

464
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:59,532
[TAKAYUKI]
Mm... Mm. Whoa.

465
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,789
[TAKAYUKI] Are you studying
art from somewhere?

466
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:10,501
[KANAKO] No. My family doesn't
have that kind of money.

467
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,211
My mom keeps telling
me that it's stupid

468
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,796
to draw this kinda stuff.

469
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,674
And that all this manga
is a waste of time.

470
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,426
She keeps saying
that drawing pictures

471
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,928
isn't something
respectable people do.

472
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,638
I'm not surprised
she thinks that way.

473
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,349
Studying is typically more
useful for normal people.

474
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,976
What is "normal" anyway?

475
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,688
And what makes
something "respectable"?

476
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,816
So many things in the world
don't fall under "normal."

477
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,861
And that makes for a lot
that isn't respectable.

478
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,159
[KANAKO]
But all I wanna do is make art.

479
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,244
Is something as
simple as drawing

480
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,664
really that ridiculous
of a passion to have?

481
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,750
Is it just because I'm stupid?

482
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,419
Is that the reason
I like to draw?

483
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,756
But the more I do it,
the more I want to improve.

484
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,924
One day, I wanna
have the ability

485
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,762
to bring the images
I see in my head to life.

486
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,596
So, please!

487
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,348
I wanna learn more and
get better at drawing!

488
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,146
All those boys...

489
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,982
Even though soft tennis
is totally useless to them,

490
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:19,320
they still push themselves
so hard for it.

491
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,614
At first I just thought
they were dumb.

492
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,825
But then... I realized
that I like to draw,

493
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:28,370
so I must be dumb, too.

494
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,955
Does that make it
okay for me to push

495
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,666
for what I want and
have dreams of my own?

496
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,673
[sighs]

497
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,927
[MAKI] Huh? Kanako!
Didn't come by today?

498
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,517
[KANAKO] Even I'm not
that bored all the time.

499
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,146
[MAKI]
Are ya hungry right now?

500
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,607
Huh? Why do you ask?

501
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,984
I can tell you're suffering.

502
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,238
You're being really stupid.

503
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,116
Maki is pretty amazing.

504
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,368
What do you mean?

505
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,371
He's got a great sense
for things. Like that.

506
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,041
[MAKI] When you're feeling down,
it helps to eat a buncha food.

507
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,585
Nah, I'll get fat.

508
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,003
Yeah, you're right.

509
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,674
I guess that's just
how he is. Maybe.

510
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,436
[YUTA]
Hey, guys! We got it!

511
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,814
We got the practice match!

512
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,566
We'll be playing
against the girls!

513
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,692
Awesome!

514
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,860
Yeah, that's great!

515
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,319
It's challenge match time!

516
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,279
All right!

517
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,363
Yeah!

518
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,614
For real?

519
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,116
[ITSUKI]
And it's all thanks to you, sis.

520
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,075
Fight on!

521
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:48,909
Fight on!

522
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:49,952
Fight on!

523
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,412
[SOFT TENNIS CLUB]
Yeah!

524
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,756
[knocking]

525
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:49,011
Hey, sis? Hello?

526
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,221
[YUTA'S MOM]
What are you doing? Well, Yuta?

527
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,016
I, um...

528
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,603
[gasps] Please tell
me this is a joke.

529
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,189
Uh‐‐ Wait, Mom, this isn't...

530
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,399
You know you're a boy, right?

531
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,360
I already have two daughters.

532
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,195
You're my son. So I can't...

533
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,821
Just hear me out,
Mom. I think I'm‐‐

534
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,032
[YUTA'S MOM]
You are a boy, and that's it.

535
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,284
I did all I could to
give you a normal life.

536
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,120
I didn't raise you
to be like this!
