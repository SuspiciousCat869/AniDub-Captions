Yeah, nobody's blaming you,

one of our tournament pairs.

Yeah, that's
a pretty big setback.

That's true.

The whole reason
we've gotten so much better

00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,504
is because of our partners.

This isn't the time

Why don't you take that
and pick up a new racket?

better if you had newer stuff.

You're not wrong
about that, but in this case,

it's better for me to have
the equipment I'm used to.

Their names are Riku and Sora.

161
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,696
And they were
the top‐ranking pair

162
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,282
at last year's national
championship.

163
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,618
Jeez, it's like they're
two of the same guy.

164
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,619
Arashi.

165
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,037
You know the national champions?

166
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,246
Yeah, 'cause I'm awesome.

167
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,248
Did you forget about that?

168
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,210
Oh well, in any case.

169
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,253
Those two are total beasts.

170
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,260
[RYOMA] I'm looking
forward to your match.

171
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,428
This will be your
first time playing

172
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,097
with Maki for real, right?

173
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,640
That's right. What about it?

174
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,642
Y'know. A while back,
he called and asked me

175
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,727
to show him how
to slice his serves.

176
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,188
I gave him some lessons.

177
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,231
He's good.

178
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,109
He's got a natural feel for
the game and he learns fast.

179
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,527
You two could do pretty well.

180
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,904
That's good to hear.

181
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,240
Do you have anything to
talk about besides him?

182
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,869
Anyway. I'll be at your match.

183
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,204
Have fun with it, bro.

184
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,675
[MAKI]
What d'ya think?

185
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,468
Decent serve, right?

186
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,804
You kidding? That curve is nuts!

187
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,055
Awesome!

188
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,223
[chuckles]

189
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,564
[knocking]

190
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,898
Yes?

191
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,986
Oh, hey. What's up?

192
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,822
[RINTARO'S MOM] Honey, we have
something important to tell you.

193
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,993
Okay. Is it something serious?

194
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,917
Rintaro.

195
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,462
We recently received a message
about your birth mother.

196
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,507
The agency informed
us that your mom

197
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,342
got in touch with them hoping
that she would be able

198
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,386
to set up a meeting with you.

199
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,888
My mother?

200
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,605
[TOMA'S MOM] You're not done?
How am I supposed to clean?

201
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,776
You know why
this happens, right?

202
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,403
Because you eat out
before you come home,

203
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,822
and by dinnertime,
you never have an appetite.

204
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,657
Only 'cause
the food here's lousy.

205
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,743
[gasps]
What did you just say?

206
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,744
You know,

207
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,287
that's the reason why Dad
doesn't eat here either.

208
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,789
He can speak for himself!

209
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,166
What gives you the right
to treat me like this?!

210
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,085
Who do you think
you're talking to?!

211
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,252
I'm talking to you!

212
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,546
My mother!
Who else would it be?!

213
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,346
You know I never wanted
to be your mother, don't you?

214
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,515
[TOMA gasps]

215
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,559
If only Ryoma had
minded his own business.

216
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,769
[TOMA gasps]

217
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,544
Well, screw them.

218
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,843
[TOMA]
C'mon, guys! Like you mean it!

219
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,553
[RINTARO gasps]
Yeah!

220
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,637
[TAIYO]
Right!

221
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,268
Uh‐oh.

222
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,894
Ah.

223
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,437
[MAKI]
Is that the president?

224
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,565
[SHINGO]
Kasuga?

225
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,191
[TSUBASA]
Kinuyo's here!

226
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,114
Good to see you giving it
your all, Toma Shinjo.

227
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,449
[TOMA] You came all the way
out to the tennis courts?

228
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,618
It's part of my duty
to observe our school clubs

229
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,787
and ensure that they're
producing results.

230
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,830
[SHINGO]
Aw, crap.

231
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,040
It looks like our captain
may be a marked man.

232
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,250
Don't say that!

233
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,003
I've heard rumors that your club
turned over a new leaf.

234
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,046
You're finally making
a real effort.

235
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,048
We don't want to get disbanded.

236
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,049
And you won't be,

237
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,469
as long as you can win a single
match at the summer tournament.

238
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,055
That hardly seems like
a high bar to clear, right?

239
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,724
It's disappointing to think
that it's still giving

240
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,642
your club so much trouble.

241
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,228
What exactly have you
been doing until now?

242
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,314
Apart from wasting club funding.

243
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,234
Ah. But perhaps I'm being cruel.

244
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,319
Do you think?

245
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,237
You have nothing
to apologize for.

246
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,364
We're only in this situation
because we haven't taken

247
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,950
the club seriously until now.

248
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,244
We all know that. It's on us.

249
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,208
Thank you for giving us
a chance to do better.

250
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,627
It's been fun.

251
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,628
And please...

252
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,004
...cheer us on.

253
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,965
[KINUYO giggles]

254
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,469
[TAIYO grunts] Kinuyo's smile
always feels like a threat.

255
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,012
I don't think it is.

How does the bracket look?

258
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,436
[ITSUKI]
Really, really bad.

Come on, why?

261
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,148
[TSUBASA]
Screwed right out of the gate.

262
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,399
[SHINGO]
I know, man.

263
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,902
[YUTA] You guys, don't talk
like we've already lost!

Seriously. Have we been cursed?

[TOMA]
Pardon me.

270

[AYA] Aww, why did I
fall back to sleep?

271
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,141
Looks like Maki
already took off.

272
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,114
[KANAKO] Let me through
please! 'Scuse me!

273
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,451
[TAKAYUKI] Looks
like Futsu and Ameno

274
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,122
are gonna be playing first.
You're on court three.

275
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,082
[RINTARO] No worries,
Mr. Sakurai. We've got this.

276
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,959
[ITSUKI] Yeah, no point in
freaking out about it now.

277
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,002
Barely made it!

278
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,420
[RINTARO]
Perfect timing, Kanako.

279

[ARASHI] Hey, the Shijo Minami
scrub squad's here!

Are the nerves
getting to you yet?

Hey, what are you doing here?

282
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,345
You know. Watching
you guys get spanked.

283
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,847
[SHINGO grunts]
Good answer...

284
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,349
Hold on. Are you sure
you have time for that?

285
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,434
Aren't you playing?

286
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,352
In the first round
of the prelims?

287
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:35,523
Obviously not, I'm seeded.
Sure is boring having to wait.

288
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,733
[TSUBASA]
Pfft. Smug little jerk.

289
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,901
Right, that kid was
super good, wasn't he?

290
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,029
Even though he seems
like a total goofball?

[TAIYO'S DAD]
Ah. We found him, Mama!

292
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,742
Hi, Taiyo! We came
to cheer you on!

293
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,743
Who's that?

294
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,161
They're Taiyo's parents.

295
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,621
Yeah, they show up
anytime he has a match.

296
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,665
It all makes sense now.

297
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,209
You guys... You didn't
need to come to this one!

298
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,253
But I couldn't just sit at
home and worry all day!

Take it easy.

300

We wouldn't want you
to get yourself hurt

301
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,342

I'm sure you're nervous
about the match.

But even if you don't win today,

305
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,307
you need to remember that
it's not your fault, okay?

306
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,310
That's right, it takes
two to play soft tennis.

307
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,854
Nothing you can do if you have
to pick up your partner's slack.

308

is dragging you down‐‐

Of course, sweetie.

You're exactly right,
Taiyo, and it makes me

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,908
That running strategy
they came up with is working!

477
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,159
Yeah, not bad.

478
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,038
[TOMA] But can they keep
doing it for a whole set?

479
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,539
Which one was
playing front again?

480
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,167
I honestly have no idea anymore.

481
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,253
[TAIYO]
Keep moving. Keep moving!

482
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,839
[NAO]
Run. Don't stop!

483
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,966
I'm impressed that they
can keep running so long.

484
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,176
It looks like all
the running they do

485
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,428
during practice
is paying off now.

486
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,971
Those two made it work.

487
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,313
Almost there!

488
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,481
You can do it, guys!

489
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,107
We're at the final game.

490
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,235
It's turned into
an endurance match.

491
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,028
The game score is two all.

492
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,279
Final game!

493
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,076
We've gotten
this far with this strategy.

494
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,747
[OFFICIAL 10B]
Fault!

495
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,040
That's okay!

496
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,378
[OFFICIAL 10B]
Double fault!

497
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,587
Come on, we're so close!

498
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,713
Don't give up!

499
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,549
[RINTARO]
Keep it up, you're still in it!

500
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,008
You're almost there!

501
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,267
They're done. Out of gas.

502
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,040
[OFFICIAL 10B] The match goes to
Sasaki and Kawakami from Misaki,

503
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,625
with a game score
of three to two.

504
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,503
[CROWD cheering]

505
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,005
You guys really get around.

506
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,464
It was hard to keep up.

507
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,802
Look at our Taiyo!

508
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,554
He did so good!

509
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,555
Great work!

510
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,015
[SHINGO]
I'm proud of you!

511
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,391
You were awesome out there!

512
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,561
You took Misaki to
a final game. Good job!

513
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,858
[TSUBASA] Now go get changed,
'cause you're soaked...

514
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,818
I knew it would
come to this in the end.

515
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,905
[MAKI]
We're up next. You ready to go?

516
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,074
It's down to us.
We have to win this.

517
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,743
Yep. Seems that way.

Ootomo and Kusakabe
from Hatanooka Middle.

520
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:03,317
versus Shinjo and Katsuragi
from Shijo Minami Middle.

521
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,819
Good luck.

522
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,657
You, too.

523
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,910
[MAKI] Now that I'm standing
face to face with him,

524
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,912
this guy is huge!
