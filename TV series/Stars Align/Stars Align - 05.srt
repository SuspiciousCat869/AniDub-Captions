Are they coming or what?

There was something
they needed to talk about.

00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,403
[KANAKO]
Interesting.

24

What really happened
to your racket?

'Cause I know you
didn't break it.

There's no way you're that dumb.

Tell me the truth.

28
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,851
It was my dad who broke it.

00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,186
How did that happen?

30
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,605
I thought you said your
parents were divorced.

[MAKI]
Mm‐hm.

32
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,441
They split up when I was eight.

33
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,652
It should have ended there.

34
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,490
Thing is, the sack of trash
wouldn't let it go.

35
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,743
He still shows up.

36
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,955
He comes by to shake
us down for money.

37
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,458
He's after cash?
Does he not have a job?

38
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,795
Maybe not. I'm not gonna ask.

39
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,135
He only comes when
Mom isn't around.

40
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,680
He knows I'll be the only
one in the apartment.

41
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,432
How come?

42
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,184
Because I'm still scared of him
from when I was little.

43
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,186
What did he do?

44
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,777
[MAKI]
I don't remember everything

45
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,988
'cause I was so
young at the time.

46
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,787
[MAKI]
It seems like he was pretty much

47
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,123
always at home with me.

48
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,333
And Mom would be
the one out working.

[cries]

50
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,803
Maybe he was frustrated
about having to care for me,

51
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,974
but whatever was eating him,
he took it out on me.

52
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,644
You do remember it.

53
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,607
A lot of it. Enough
that when I see him,

54
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,193
the fear hits me
and I just shut down.

55
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,195
I should be stronger.

56
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,113
That's not on you.

57
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,244
I guess terrorizing me
is fun for him somehow.

58
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,331
He took the racket and smashed
it right in front of me.

59
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,501
All I could do was watch.

60
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,294
He said he'd be back today

61
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,923
and that he wouldn't be
leaving without it again.

62
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,799
Money?

63
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,883
[MAKI]
Mm‐hm.

64
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,259
Mom knows he comes by.

65
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,470
And she knows exactly
what he's after.

66
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,517
So she... plays along.

67
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:14,147
She sets some aside for him
and leaves it on the desk.

68
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,649
When she sees that it's gone,

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,777
she fills up another envelope
and puts that one out.

70
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,529
So when I'm the only one home,

71
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,738
I try to find someplace

72
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,324
where I can hide
the money from him.

73
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:28,245
But he... he always
manages to find it.

74
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,877
I don't know what I should do.

75
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,380
If I tell Mom about it,

76
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,216
she's going to try to give
him money we don't have.

77
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,395
You should try this one out.
It's the latest model.

78
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,691
For real?

79
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,443
Of course for real. I think
you're gonna like it.

way better than me.

Wow, Toma. Thanks.

you're always so on
top of everything.

having you around, Asuka.

means a lot. Here.

been hearing about the boys

the whole team

in the past few weeks.

But I gotta say, I still
don't think this club

Maki is my doubles partner
and he's important to me,

You have no right
to speak to him.

Huh. You look like
you're smart enough

to understand this,
so pay attention.

147
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,671
His mother and I are divorced,

148
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,091
but according to the law,
I'm still his father.

149
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,051
And as a parent,
the law can't prevent me

150
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,761
from seeing my child.

151
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,931
If I wanna find him,
all I have to do is ask.

152
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,725
It's my right as his dad.

153
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,852
That's the bond he and I share.

Right, Maki?

00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,564
I'm telling you to
stay away from him!

156
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,108
And what do you think I've done

157
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,151
that makes it okay
for you to stand between

00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,368
I swear... I'll kill you!

161
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,079
Wow. That sounded
like you meant it.

162
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,914
I would get away with it, too.

163
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,293
They always go easy on minors.
Right? You rotten sack of trash.

164
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,880
I'd be doing the world
a favor by killing you!

165
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:39,848
[laughs]

166
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,059
[KENJI]
You're dumber than you look.

167
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,144
Okay.

168
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,021
If you're gonna
try to kill me...

169
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,773
[gasps]

170
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,317
...I'll have to be ready
to kill you first.

171
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,322
Touch him and you
are dead. Hear me?

172
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,616
You keep your damn
hands offa' him!

173
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,245
What happened?

174
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,206
My sweet little boy
has turned out so violent.

175
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,001
You with the glasses,
what was your name again?

176
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,752
Shinjo.

177
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,462
[KENJI]
That's your family name, kid.

178
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,882
I asked you for your name.

179
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,716
Toma!

180
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,718
That's a nice name.

181
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,261
What a wonderful
couple of people

182
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,306
your parents must be
to give it to you.

183
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,766
I'll remember you, Toma.

184
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,188
Until next time, Maki.

185
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,159
Thank you so much, Toma.

186
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,620
You and me are a team, right?

187
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,581
Of course I wanna
help my partner.

188
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,082
That's how it works.

189
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,962
[MAKI]
Thank you so much.

190
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,715
[MAKI whimpers]

191
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,218
[MAKI]
I'm really glad you're here.

192
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,649
[HARUHI] How have things
been going for you

193
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,192
at school, Kinuyo?

194
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,444
[KINUYO]
They've gone splendidly.

195
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,406
[HARUHI chuckles]
I suppose that is to be expected

196
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,200
from the school
that Ryouka chose.

197
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,868
And I've no doubt
that that environment

198
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,372
has many interesting new
experiences to offer you.

199
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,839
I'll be off, then.
See you tomorrow, dear.

200
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,258
Goodbye.

201
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,519
So, Ruriha, have you been
having fun at school?

202
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,396
[KINUYO] When my
grandmother isn't around,

203
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,023
Mom calls me by
the name "Ruriha."

204
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,279
[KINUYO] "Kinuyo" is
a name my grandmother

205
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,489
chose for me
without her approval,

206
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,492
and to this day, Mom
still refuses to use it.

207
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,578
Yes. It's been quite an
enlightening experience.

208
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,497
I've learned a great deal there.

209
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,581
That's good.

210
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,792
Your father's company
employs many of the people

211
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,294
in this town, and
it's vital for you

212
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,004
to understand the way they live.

213
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,548
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

214
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,216
[KINUYO] The truth is
that I'd had my heart set

215
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,843
on enrolling at the
affiliate school

216
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,970
of a certain women's college.

217
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,096
But my mother insisted that

218
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,057
I ought to attend
Shijo Minami instead.

219
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,018
Naturally, this led
to a terrible argument

220
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,894
between her and my grandmother.

221
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,604
The best thing is for
her to go to school here!

222
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,107
You're throwing away her future
out of vulgar sentimentality!

223
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,942
What would an out‐of‐touch
old bag like you

224
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:38,860
know about her future?

225
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,445
I know it will be
wasted if I let her

226
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,821
follow the path you're
setting her on!

227
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:47,452
[BOTH yelling, grunting]

228
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,959
[RYOUKA, HARUHI
distant shouting]

229
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,627
[KINUYO] But neither
of them ever calls me

230
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,006
by my real name. Kaori.

231
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,426
So cute.

232
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,857
‐‐[STUDENT 5BB] Good morning.
‐‐[STUDENT 5B] 'Sup!

233
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,192
[STUDENT 5C]
You don't have to tackle me.

234
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,026
[STUDENT 5CC]
You look fine.

235
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,444
[STUDENT 5BB]
Are you sure?

236
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,488
[KANAKO] Hey, why did you
take off early yesterday?

237
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,490
[MAKI]
So I could go stargazing.

238
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,241
You went stargazing in the rain?

239
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,119
Wait. It rained last night?

240
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,292
[YUTA]
Shinjo. Good morning.

241
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,835
[TOMA]
Morning, Yuta.

242
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,837
How'd yesterday's
English homework go?

243
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,381
Are you done?

244
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,465
[YUTA]
I got through it.

245
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,217
Did something happen
with Shinjo?

246
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,593
Just a fistfight.

247
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,136
You're a liar.

248
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,972
[SAKURA] So we can substitute
Y for three X minus one

249
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,599
in our first equation like this,

250
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,935
which will allow us to
solve for the value of X.

251
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,563
Don't forget to use parentheses
when you write that in.

252
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,273
Let's see here.

253
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,652
Ah, Rintaro Futsu.

254
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,654
Would you like
to come solve this?

255
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,072
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,805
Why can't you let me make
an example of you, just once?

257
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:31,973
[TOMA]
Since we're short on time,

258
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,350
I wanna pick up
the pace in practice.

259
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,436
I agree. Here. I came up with‐‐

260
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,396
[TOMA] Here's a schedule
Maki put together.

261
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,814
‐‐Check it out.
‐‐[RINTARO] Huh?

262
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,109
It looks really well done.
I think we should try it.

263
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,696
What's wrong?

264
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,699
I feel like I'm useless to you.

265
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,575
How so?

266
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,161
I'm the vice president
of the Soft Tennis Club

267
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,412
in name only.

268
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,997
What are you talking about?

269
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,291
Where's this coming from?

270
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,709
It's worse lately.

271
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,212
I can't deny what's happened
since Katsuragi came along.

272
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,630
The reason we weren't
getting better

273
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,258
is because I wasn't doing
anything to help the team.

274
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,054
I only wish I would have
recognized that sooner.

275
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,348
I'm done being VP.

276
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,725
Rintaro.

277
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,563
I feel like I'm useless
at anything I try to do.

278
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,232
And even after everything
my parents have done for me,

279
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,067
I know that I'm
still failing them.

280
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,111
You're not making
any sense right now.

281
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,237
I've known you and your family

282
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,114
since we were in
elementary school.

283
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,449
They adore you.

284
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,242
Your parents gush about
everything you do!

285
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,369
You don't understand, Shinjo!

286
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,330
My mom and dad couldn't
have given birth

287
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,457
to a failure like me.

288
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,168
I'm not the son
that they deserve.

289
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,086
I'm nothing but
a burden to them.

290
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,756
Wait. What are you saying?

291
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,430
[RINTARO] The parents you
know aren't my real parents.

292
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,225
They took me in right
after I was born.

293
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,060
I'm adopted.

294
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,229
What?

295
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,606
[RINTARO]
My biological mother was young,

296
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,691
and she wasn't married.

297
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,277
She knew that she
couldn't raise a child,

298
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,405
so she put me up with
an adoption agency instead.

299
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,410
That was where
Mom and Dad found me.

300
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,790
They were willing to take in
a stray dog. And they...

301
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,876
They were kind enough to love me
just like I was their own child.

302
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,003
They were the best family
I could ask for.

303
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,921
And so I...

304
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,339
I never even thought
that I might be

305
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,425
anything other than
their real son.

306
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,011
But when I was in fifth grade,
they sat me down.

307
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,766
The law said they had to tell
me the truth about my birth.

308
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,268
When I saw them
crying like that,

309
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,186
it suddenly made me
realize something.

310
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,606
That I came into
the world unwanted.

311
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,109
Nobody ever meant
for me to be born.

312
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,445
I was an accident. That's why...

313
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,114
Why I've always
tried to push myself

314
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,659
as hard as I could,
but I'm still a failure.

315
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,077
That's bullshit!

316
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,704
Huh?

317
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,582
Who says that you're a burden?
Or that you're a failure?

318
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,417
Your parents love you
more than anything.

319
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,460
So much that it
makes me jealous.

320
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,254
To them, you are their son!

321
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,715
And I don't know how you
can't understand that.

322
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,341
Who cares who gave birth to you?

323
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,218
They're your parents!

324
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,597
Sorry.

325
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,558
Don't tell Maki.
Do you understand me?

326
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,561
I think he'd lose it.

327
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,021
[MAKI]
Hey, Rintaro!

328
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,939
I'd been wondering
where you had gone.

329
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,358
Wanna hit the courts so you can
get some practice with Itsuki?

330
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,027
Uh.

331
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,281
[RINTARO]
Okay, I'll see you guys there.

332
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,620
Did something happen?

333
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,496
Uh, no, not really.

334
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,416
Huh. All right then,
let's get goin'.

335
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,002
We need to work on
our team play, too.

336
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,212
I had a really good idea to try.

337
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,474
So something did happen.

338
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,558
Yeah?

339
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,102
I'll tell you about
it later, 'kay?

340
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,979
That's cool.

341
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,397
Anyway, I was thinking
I should try

342
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,108
going underhand for
my second serve.

343
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,736
Yeah. It's best if you don't.

344
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,112
[MAKI]
Huh? Why not?

345
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,615
'Cause it looks super dumb.

346
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:21,786
You didn't hesitate
to say that at all.

347
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,163
[TOMA laughs]

348
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,041
[MAKI] Yeah. It's best if
you don't laugh like that.

349
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,467
[TOMA grunts]

350
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,718
[grunts]

351
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,769
It looks like Futsu's going
for it extra hard today.

352
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,145
Oh, really.

353
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,064
With you here, I don't
even have to watch.

354
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,774
Well I know you
only pay attention

355
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,567
when Katsuragi is playing.

356
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,652
You're right, I do.

357
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,320
'Cause I wanna see him
with a mouthful of dirt

358
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,489
and his stupid face
covered in tears.

359
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,991
Fall over, fall over, fall over!

360
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,159
[yelps]

361
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,327
Got 'im!

362
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,039
[TAKAYUKI] Remember that
your practice match

363
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,582
with Misaki Academy tomorrow

364
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,043
will be at their tennis
courts, okay, guys?

365
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,837
So don't come here, go there.

366
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,130
We'll meet up at Misaki Station

367
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,424
and walk the rest of
the way together, got it?

368
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,675
‐‐So make sure‐‐ugh.
‐‐[TOMA] Listen up, everyone.

369
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,594
Tomorrow's the day we
see our hard work pay off.

370
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,805
This is it! We can do it, guys!

371
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,724
[ALL]
Yeah!

372
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,768
Hey, Mitsue, you going?

373
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,688
I already watch these goofballs
practice after school like,

374
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,648
all the time, so why
would I wanna come out

375
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,151
and do it on a Sunday, too?

376
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,570
Yeah, fair enough. That's cool.

377
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,823
Honestly. I do have a life
of my own, you know.

378
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,161
[TAKAYUKI] Okay, final head
count. Is everybody here?

379
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,537
[RINTARO]
Yeah, that's everyone!

380
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,707
Great, it's time we
headed that way, then.

381
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,292
Hey, Shinjo!

382
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,710
You're going the wrong way.

383
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,254
Misaki Academy is over here.

384
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,756
Somebody's nervous.

385
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,174
Shut up.

386
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,185
[YUTA]
You came after all!

387
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,353
[KANAKO]
Yeah, what if I did?

388
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,813
[MAKI]
Where are the tennis courts?

389
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,774
They're a bit further
down this way.

390
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,193
The courts are separated
from the rest of the campus.

391
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,112
Dang, championship
teams are a lot.

392
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,118
[YUTA] Wow, these courts
are really nice.

393
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,120
[SHINGO] Jeez, how many
guys do they have?

394
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,955
[TSUBASA] Enough to need
four whole courts.

395
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,166
[ITSUKI] I hear they get
tons of money from alumni.

396
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,585
[TAIYO] They're definitely
getting money from somewhere.

397
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,504
[NAO]
This place is unreal. Holy crap.

398
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,799
[TAKAYUKI] Guys, guys. Don't
let all of this intimidate you.

399
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,759
Calm down and breathe‐‐

400
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,219
Okay. Listen up!

401
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,137
This is the match
that decides it all!

402
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,597
It's do or die time!

403
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,142
So let's take it to these guys
with everything we have!

404
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,396
Damn, dude.

405
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,524
He must be freaking
out on the inside.

406
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,359
You caught that, too, huh?

407
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,182
Hi, Mister Kadowaki.

408
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,100
Thanks for doing this.

409
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,310
And thank you.

410
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,979
It's always a pleasure,
Mister Sakurai.

411
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,939
I heard that they only
sent their second years

412
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:19,857
out to play us today.

413
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,817
So we're not gonna be up against
their third‐year regulars?

414
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,444
What do these guys take us for?

415
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,613
[ITSUKI] I mean we're all
second years, too, right?

416
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,239
[TAIYO] Even if they're
all second years,

417
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,491
some of these guys have
to be regulars for sure.

418
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,993
[NAO] And they're on
a championship team.

419
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,786
[ARASHI]
Everyone, step aside!

420
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,597
You all look like
a bunch of scrubs.

421
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,599
[ALL]
Huh?

422
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,184
That sucks, 'cause I get nothin'

423
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,394
out of taking matches
off of crappy players.

424
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,397
It's a waste of my time.
That's what I think.

425
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,316
But Coach Kado says
we have to do this,

426
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,901
so that means I'm doin' it.

427
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,237
At least make it fun, okay?
Put up a fight for me.

428
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,406
[growls]

429
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,867
And if you can't manage
that on the court,

430
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,578
you'll be doin' it
on your way out.

431
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,080
With your fists.
