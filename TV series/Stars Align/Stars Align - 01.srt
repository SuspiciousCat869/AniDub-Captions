1
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,483
[AYA] I bet there won't be
any chocolate‐covered critters

2
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,692
in a place like this.

3
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,070
[MAKI] That's one chore
I won't have to worry about.

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,739
I'm fine with that.

5
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,033
Look, we even have an elevator.

6
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,538
We're on the eighth floor
this time, right?

7
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,623
This move is gonna
take us a while.

8
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,791
I'll just take the stairs.

9
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,667
[AYA]
Hang on, Maki!

10
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,961
You'll work yourself to
death climbing all those.

11
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,964
I'll be fine, Mom.
It's nothing new.

12
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,215
Maki!

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,469
That kid of yours
moves pretty quick.

14
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,806
We didn't have an elevator
before, so he's used to it.

15
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,694
[GROUP] Let's go, Shijo!
Fight, fight, Shijo!

16
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,862
Let's go, Shijo! Fight, fight!

17
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,746
Well, what do we have here?

18
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,123
The two soft tennis
teams are having

19
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,166
a pretty one‐sided
practice match.

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,877
Really? It's the boys
versus the girls?

21
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,296
Are they seriously
trying to play against

22
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,755
the national champions?

23
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,882
Those boys are
gonna get destroyed!

24
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,009
For real!

25
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,136
[BOTH laugh]

26
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,179
Yeah, go ahead and laugh.

27
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,681
But, it's kind of sad.

28
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,183
'Cause, they really
are getting destroyed.

[grunts]

32
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,194
I mean, at least they're all
doing their best, yeah?

33
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,530
Ah!

34
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,787
Huh?

35
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,999
[laughs] Wow, you
scored on me good!

36
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,376
Come on!

00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,629
He really is doing
his best, I swear!

38
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,339
He's just nervous!

39
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,967
[ITSUKI]
And... There!

40
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,470
[ITSUKI]
Aw, well, dang it.

41
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,305
That shot went by way too fast.

42
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,223
There's no way either
of us could've gotten it.

43
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,225
That deserves a
round of applause.

44
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,519
Yeah, you're right. Nice.

45
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,356
[TAKAYUKI] Wait! They're not
trying to be mean! Honest!

46
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,900
Yeah! They're not trying
to do much of anything!

47
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,401
[TSUBASA]
Whoa!

48
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,451
[giggles] Look at
that! It got stuck!

49
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,079
They're so pathetic. This
hardly counts as practice.

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,830
Yeah, that's a fair point.

51
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,582
At least your girls
can take it easy.

52
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,626
[GROUP] Let's go, Takada!
Fight, fight, Takada!

Fight, fight, Takada!

[grunts]

55
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,012
I got it!

56
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,055
Ah!

57
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,945
Thanks for the match.

58
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,405
I learned a lot
from playing you.

59
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,572
Glad to hear it.

60
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,157
Work on your first
serve's placement,

61
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,784
and you won't be
half bad, Shinjo.

62
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,160
Right. Thanks for the tip.

63
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,662
Speaking of.

64
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,289
Are you okay with me speeding
up my second serve a bit?

65
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,541
Yeah, sure.

66
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,251
As long as it doesn't
affect your accuracy,

67
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,460
it's fine by me.

68
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,545
[TENNIS STUDENT 1B]
Way to go, Kei!

69
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,131
[TENNIS STUDENT 1C]
Good game out there, you two!

70
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,674
Why are we wasting
our practice time

71
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,134
playing against the boys' team?

72
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,760
We're doing them a favor.

73
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,220
And they should be
grateful that we even

74
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,014
agreed to these matches
in the first place.

75
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,600
[GROUP]
But they're not.

76
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,893
[TENNIS STUDENT 1F]
What's wrong with them?

77
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,020
[TENNIS STUDENT 1G] They don't
even care that they lost!

78
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,863
Hey, Captain. Uh. Good effort!

79
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,990
Yeah right. I sucked.

80
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,700
Here I thought
Toma'd get a game

81
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,201
off the Black Butterfly.

82
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,121
I guess he's just as bad
as the rest of us.

83
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,373
[TSUBASA] Hey, Itsuki, The
White Butterfly's your sister,

84
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,251
isn't she? So, tell her to
go easy on us or something.

85
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,920
Do you honestly think she
would even listen to me?

86
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,964
That's fair. I guess not.

87
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,258
Must be nice having an
older sister who's smart,

88
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,720
pretty, and athletic.
I'm kinda jealous of you.

89
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,305
You cannot be serious.

90
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,600
Wha...? Uh. No. Of course not.

91
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,687
Good to know. Because if
you were, you'd be dead.

92
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,230
[RINTARO]
Okay, Itsuki, that's enough!

93
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,732
Don't wanna bring down
the team morale!

94
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,485
Well, it's not like
we're ever gonna win.

95
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,611
So, who cares?

96
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,653
Even if that's true,

97
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,614
you don't have to be
so harsh about it.

98
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,032
But it is true.

99
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,033
We're never gonna be good,

100
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,410
so it doesn't matter
how hard we try.

101
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,083
But y'know, I heard that
Ms. Muroi practically begged

102
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,085
Mr. Sakurai to have
a practice game.

103
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,129
She thought that we would
be a nice change of pace.

104
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,672
[SHINGO]
Wait. Are you for real?

105
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,717
Shingo. Nao is just
making stuff up again.

106
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,803
Aw. That sucks.

107
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:07,349
[TAKUTO] I'm sick of this.
I'm tired of losing!

108
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,850
Uh‐‐ Takuto?

109
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,769
This is a club
for losers anyway!

110
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,354
Don't you get it?

111
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,188
[gasps]

112
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,023
How could anyone get
popular when they're stuck

113
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,025
in a stupid Soft
Tennis Club like this?

114
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,820
Nanase's never gonna
like me if I'm some loser!

115
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,238
Hang on a sec.

116
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,910
[TOMA]
You mean <i>that</i> Nanase?

117
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,161
Never gonna happen.

118
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,330
I'm gonna start doing
things that are cool!

119
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,165
Like, playing normal tennis!

120
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,000
Then I'm gonna become
popular and stuff!

121
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,043
You'll see!

122
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,837
I don't think that's
how it works, man.

123
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,171
[TAKUTO]
You can't stop me!

124
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,798
I'm quitting this club
and I'm gonna be cool

125
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,508
and popular starting now‐‐!

126
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,804
[TAKUTO yells]

127
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,639
You do that.

128
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,894
All club activities
at this school

129
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,896
operate with the funds
provided directly

130
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,565
by the administration.

131
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,608
As you might expect,
the amount of support

132
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,820
that each club gets,
is something we take seriously.

133
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,114
Naturally, there is a
slight variance in how much

134
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,657
is provided to
each of the clubs.

135
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,868
The total number of students
enlisted is a factor,

136
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,286
for example.

137
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,163
The problem is, this equal
distribution of funds

138
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,041
naively assumes that all
clubs have the same value.

139
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,127
It fails to consider
the amount of effort

140
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,170
and passion invested in them.

141
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,466
So, as your current
student council president.

142
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,135
I want to change all of that.

143
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,262
I'd like to implement
a system that compensates

144
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,347
each club according to
their level of commitment

145
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,850
and quality of results.
That will be truly fair.

146
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,685
I believe hard work
and enthusiasm

147
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,896
will always produce
great results.

148
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,772
In that same vein,
those results deserve

149
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,983
a proportional reward.

150
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,193
Unfortunately, there
are some clubs which

151
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,446
produce no results and
needlessly drain funds

152
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,114
that are better used elsewhere.

153
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,283
These sorts of clubs
are worse than useless.

154
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,452
They are essentially stealing
resources from others

155
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,745
who deserve it more.

156
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,706
So, why should these clubs
continue to exist at all?

157
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,458
[TSUBASA]
Who does she think she is? What?

158
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,252
So we have to win in order
to be considered a real club?

159
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,046
But they won't go
through with it, right?

160
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,756
I thought these clubs
were supposed to be about

161
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,549
students enjoying themselves.

162
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,676
It's already starting
to happen, man.

163
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,386
Just take a look at the
clubs that were good enough

164
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,596
to go to nationals.

165
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,182
They've all got their
funds secured already.

166
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,767
Then what about us?

167
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,437
What's goin' to happen
to the Soft Tennis Club?

168
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,690
Unless we win a match
in the summer tournament,

169
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,317
it's over.

170
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,820
Student Council Pres
sure is heartless.

171
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,365
She knows that we're not
good enough to win anything.

172
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,992
It's been four years of
nothing but losses, hasn't it?

173
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,410
Guess we're done for.

174
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,870
[RINTARO]
Don't be like that, guys!

175
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,081
[ITSUKI] So, what are we
all gonna do next semester?

176
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,166
Well, I suppose my mom
did always want me

177
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,543
to learn how to play an
instrument of some kind.

178
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,712
Is it too late to
join a music club?

179
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,631
We're really disbanding?

180
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,258
But think about the members
that came before us.

181
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,885
You know that it's
their fault, too.

182
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,971
They didn't really
do us any favors.

183
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,764
We shouldn't feel
too bad about it.

184
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,976
Yeah, good point. No
third years stuck around.

185
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,686
And we also weren't able
to get any first years

186
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,312
to join us this year either.

187
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,106
It's just us second years now,

188
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,691
at the very end.

189
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,192
That's too bad.

190
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,861
I gotta figure out what I'm
gonna do with my old racket.

191
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,197
Well, I could always
give it to my sister.

192
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,199
Not sure she'd have
use for it though.

I, um. Well, no.

215
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,978
I just got a bit startled
when you ran past me, so.

216
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,480
I'll be more careful next time.

217
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,607
Uh, aren't you the guy
who came by to meet

Oh, yeah, you live downstairs.

I'm Kanako Mitsue from unit 701.

Right, that's what
it was. Mornin'.

You're Maki Katsuragi?
Did I get that right?

00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,331
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

224
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,917
[KANAKO] Wait. Why didn't
you take the elevator?

225
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,213
It's just kind of a hassle.

226
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,840
Yeah? And how is
running up and down

Who's the new kid?

his uniform is from.

Ugh. Man, I really hate math.

It's from Ryoma.

An Astronomical Almanac!

An Astronomical what now?

244
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,558
It's basically a bunch of data
on the stars and planets.

Check it out.

This is nothing but numbers.

So he's an old friend of yours?

[TOMA] Yesterday,
the student council decided

249
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,787
to apportion club
activity funds based on

250
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,458
achievements by majority vote.
This is effective immediately

So what?

00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,003
That means the boys'
Soft Tennis Club

253

is gonna get shut down.

254

[YUTA] That explains why Shinjo
was in such a bad mood.

255
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,220
Next, we have a new
transfer student.

256

If you notice him struggling
with any of the coursework,

257
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,682
please don't hesitate
to help him out.

258

Don't worry about me!
I'll be just fine on my own.

think the boys are gonna do?

I saw some of them trying

to recruit new members today.

00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,239
Yeah?

263
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,824
I heard they wanna find
athletic people to join.

264
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,951
That way, they might
have a chance

Well, they're not gonna get any

Dammit. Is there nobody left?

If we don't win at least

Hey. Shinjo sounded pretty
desperate back there.

Yeah, I guess. I'm not
interested, though.

not really the reason

318
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,208
why I want him to join.

319
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,418
If we don't win a single match

320
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,170
at the summer tournament,
we're disbanded.

321
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,256
That so?

322
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,550
You're okay with that?

323
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,176
But aren't you an alumnus?

324
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,095
When you played for the
club, our school's team

325
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,097
made it all the way
to the nationals.

326
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,849
And you want me to
say that I don't want

327
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,559
the club to die?

328
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,771
It's your time.

329
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,899
And it's up to your generation
to do what you think is best.

330
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,528
An alumni like me shouldn't
have any say in the matter.

331
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,738
[TOMA] Because you think
I'm gonna fail?

332
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,657
No matter how hard I try?

333
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,908
That's not...

334
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,453
[TOMA]
Whatever.

335
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,745
Wait.

336
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,081
[door slams]

337
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,834
[TOMA]
I'm heading out.

338
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,463
[TOMA'S MOM] Ryoma, would
you like some breakfast?

339
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,797
Nah, it's okay.

340
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,216
I'm good with just my usual
morning coffee right now.

341
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,718
Well then, do you
know what you'd like

342
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,470
to eat for dinner tonight?

343
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,221
I'm actually meeting up
with a friend later,

344
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,974
so I won't be home
for dinner. Sorry.

345
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,100
Right.

346
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,019
And your father is out
on a business trip,

347
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,398
so he's gone, too.
It's just me and that boy.

348
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,358
Y'know, Mom. Toma isn't‐‐

349
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,068
But he isn't anything
like you, Ryoma!

350
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,820
He's different!

351
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,323
Don't say that.

352
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:35,536
I can't help it. Whenever
I'm around him... I just...

353
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,249
[schoolbell ringing]

354
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,834
Dang it, I'm totally
gonna miss the event

355
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,253
if I don't get this
picture uploaded soon!

356
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,973
[MAKI]
The moon and Venus.

357
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,689
That's a good shot.

358
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,705
This again? Gimme a break.

359
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,882
Comin' through.

360
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,134
Guess I'm going this way.

361
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,928
Hey, can you not take a hint?

362
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,430
I'm still waiting for you to
join the Soft Tennis Club.

363
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,307
Like I told you yesterday,

364
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,809
I don't have any
interest in joining

365
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,310
your little sports thing.

366
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,853
I know about your mom.

367
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,564
She works full‐time right?

368
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,235
[YUTA] Katsuragi's father
isn't in the picture anymore.

369
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,154
His parents got a divorce
and his mom took custody.

370
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,448
It happened when he
was just a little kid,

371
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,367
and it's been the two of
them living on their own

372
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,368
ever since then.

373
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,869
I already knew that.

374
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,413
And I remember that
his last name

375
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,373
actually used to be "Kyobate."

376
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,542
Okay. Well, did you know
that he takes care

377
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,002
of all the house
chores by himself?

378
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,587
Wait. All of them?

379
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,090
Yeah. The cooking,
laundry, and cleaning.

380
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,842
He does it all on his own.

381
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,811
[YUTA] Since his mom
is too busy working,

382
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,023
he's the only one around
who can run the errands.

383
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,150
So what?

384
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,693
If you need any help,

385
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,528
I can give you a
hand after practice.

386
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,488
Mind your own business.

387
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,743
The place his mom works at
is a small construction firm.

388
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,912
I assume she works
as an architect there.

389
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,582
And that particular company
isn't a very big one.

390
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,001
So it's possible that he doesn't
have the financial support,

391
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,920
which would prevent him from
joining a club like yours.

392
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:52,840
Let go.

393
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,343
Don't worry about your
tennis equipment or uniform.

394
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,470
I'll take care of it for you.

395
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,766
You won't have to spend
any of your own money.

396
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,645
I said the money isn't
going to be a problem!

397
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,189
Wow. So, you can solve
all of your problems

398
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,941
by throwing some money
around. Must be nice.

399
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,490
[TOMA] My brother used
to be in the club, y'know!

400
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,700
That's right, I remember.

401
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,875
[MAKI] He had that racket back
when he was in middle school.

402
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,252
He was in the Soft Tennis
Club. That explains it.

403
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,339
Y'know, Ryoma approved
of you joining the club,

404
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,383
and even thought you'd do well.

405
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,345
In that case...

406
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,139
Uh?

407
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,267
I'll join the club.
But only if you pay me.

408
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,268
Uh‐‐

409
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,520
Aw, what's the matter?

410
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,938
I'm not made of free time.

411
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,066
But paid time is something
that I can get behind.

412
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,194
I'll charge you
for manual labor.

413
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,364
Unlike you, money is
actually a problem for me.

414
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,533
So I don't join clubs
just for fun.

415
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,785
But this might be
too much for you.

416
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,666
I figured.

417
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,918
So. I guess we're done here.

418
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,838
Ten thousand yen a month!

419
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,423
That makes 30K in total.

420
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,259
Sound good? And if we
win at the tournament,

421
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,180
I'll throw in a bonus!
Making it 40K overall!

422
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,306
Huh?

423
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,060
If that's not enough, I can
pay you even more! Okay?

424
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,687
Uh‐‐

425
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,189
You are good with that. Right?

426
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,568
Ah, that's great! Let's shake
on it so it's official!

427
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,819
Welcome to the club!

428
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,237
Huh?

429
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,239
After school tomorrow,
come to the locker room

430
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,741
that's by the tennis courts!

431
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,784
I'll have a uniform
and racket for you.

432
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,411
We'll start right away!

433
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,455
We'll begin with the basics
and then we can move on to‐‐

434
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,165
Hang on. Slow down.

435
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,332
Oh, yeah!

436
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,256
First things first. Take this.

437
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,594
It's a solid racket that's
great for beginners.

438
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,721
I'm sure you can handle it.

439
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,891
You'll be playin' like
a pro in no time! Here!

440
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,059
Hey, uh. I dunno if I can‐‐

'Kay! See ya!

[MAKI]
Uh. The heck was that?

443
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,525
I didn't actually
agree to anything yet.

444
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,833
The Soft Tennis Club.

445

446
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,032
Coming!

450
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:32,226
Hey, what's up?
Long time no see.

451
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,939
How you holdin' up?

452
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,858
It's been what? Two months?

453
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,320
So this is your
new place, huh?

454
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,239
Damn. It's small.

455
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,200
And as usual, there isn't much.

456
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,870
Please. Get out of here.

457
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,206
What did you just say
to me, you little brat?

458
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,458
You can't talk to
your dad like that.

459
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,465
Show some respect.

460
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,926
Get up. Gimme the usual.

461
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:11,223
I came by for a withdrawal.
Now, where is it?

462
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,267
[MAKI]
We don't have any money.

463
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,518
[MAKI gasps]

[MAKI groans]

465
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,396
Sure you don't.

466
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,481
There's gotta be some
emergency savings hidden

467
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,817
in one of the obvious
spots around here.

468
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,236
But your mother wouldn't
hide things from me.

469
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,405
That means you did.

470
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,366
You must think you're so clever.

471
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,044
[KENJI]
Hm...

472
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,968
All right. I'll be
borrowing this.

473
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,429
Tell your mom I said hello.
