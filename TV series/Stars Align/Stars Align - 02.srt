but nobody really uses it,
so we kind of moved in.

It works for us 'cause it's
right next to the tennis courts.

team have like five? No fair.

319
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,821
Sure, but that's
because the girls' team

320
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,031
is actually good.

321
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:11,077
[RINTARO] Okay. Let's head
to the practice grounds.

322
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,578
Why don't we use the courts?

323
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,747
'Cause the boys' team only
gets to use the courts

324
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,083
on Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays.

325
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,419
The girls take priority
the rest of the time.

326
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,547
Their team goes to nationals,
like, every year, after all.

327
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,133
Winning teams get
preferential treatment.

328
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,676
It's how the world works, right?

329
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,554
So why doesn't the boys'
team just get good?

330
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,514
Gosh, why didn't
we think of that?

331
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,348
We had a deal.

332
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,182
[SHINGO]
Deal?

333
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,768
Enough talking, guys. Let's go.

334
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,109
[TRACK STUDENT 2AA]
I kinda feel like hurdles today.

335
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,278
Why are you trying
to wreck my legs?

336
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,826
[MAKI] Huh? That's weird.
It's all squishy.

337
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,037
[TAIYO] Yeah. It's a lot softer
than a regular tennis ball.

338
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,582
So it doesn't hurt as
much if it hits you?

339
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,084
Well, it won't do any
permanent damage,

340
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,211
but a really hard hit
can leave a welt.

341
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,338
One time, Tsubasa
landed a big smash

342
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,382
right here on the
inside of my thigh.

343
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,927
and that lump took three
whole days to go away.

344
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,347
[MAKI] And why do all these
balls to look so grimy?

345
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,224
Don't the girls get nice ones?

346
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,560
Yeah, they do. These
ones are actually

347
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,270
the hand‐me‐downs
from the girls.

348
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,271
Huh.

349
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,148
It would be nice to
get to use a fresh one

350
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,775
out of the package with that
white powder coat still on it.

351
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,903
Don't fantasize. It's just sad.

352
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,405
[TOMA]
Maki, let me see your grip.

353
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,656
Okay, here.

354
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,534
Now watch. Here's how
you should do it.

355
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,163
Look at my hand.
Set it like this.

356
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,415
Keep your index
finger right here,

357
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,043
and slide the others
down into a tight grip.

358
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,794
We call this a Western Grip.

359
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,339
Turn it like this and
it's an Eastern Grip.

360
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,049
And holding it in between,

361
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,551
like this, is a
Semi‐Eastern Grip.

362
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,221
Western Grip is standard
in soft tennis.

363
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,347
I see.

364
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,640
You try it.

365
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,520
'Kay. How's this?

366
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,940
Watch where you're swinging.

367
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:04,774
Uh, my bad.

368
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,900
Be careful.

369
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,318
Check your surroundings
before you start

370
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,486
practicing your swing.

371
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,779
You don't wanna hit anybody.

372
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,864
Right. Got it.

373
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,783
[TOMA] And you don't just
wave it around like that.

374
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,576
Wait, like what?

375
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,578
Watch me. Look at my posture.

376
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,955
Right, I'm watching.

377
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,999
Like this. Here's the soft
tennis resting stance.

378
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,668
Keep your knees slightly bent.

379
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,545
Put your weight on the
balls of your feet.

380
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,921
Why's that?

381
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,965
Humans can't react quickly
with their knees locked

382
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,466
and their heels on the ground,

383
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,260
it takes too long to get moving.

384
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,886
You never know which
part of the court

385
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,681
the ball's gonna go to,
but you still have to be able

386
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,933
to make it there. Make sense?

387
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:42,061
Yeah, it does make sense.
I'd kinda forgotten.

388
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,524
[TOMA] Now you're going
to plant your left foot

389
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,150
forward for the backswing.

390
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,152
Then twist your whole body.

391
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,531
Don't just use your arms;
turn your hips into the swing.

392
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,450
Open the face of the racket
to hit the ball dead on.

393
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,202
Make sure to get a clean hit.

394
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,662
And as the ball makes contact,

395
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,081
follow through with the
motion, whip your wrist,

396
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,458
and let the racket keep going
over your left shoulder

397
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,837
just like this, and step
through with the right foot.

398
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,006
I think I get it.

399
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,886
Like that?

400
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,388
Good job. Nice form.

401
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,307
That was a forehand stroke.

402
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,391
'Kay, got it.

403
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,101
Now, let's see you hit a ball.

00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,895

a racket before.

00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,004

There's no way.

Ah‐‐

My bad.

416
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,858
It's a good start though.
Now time for the backhand.

417
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,693
You'll use this to hit a ball
that's coming at you

418
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:13,986
from your left side.

419
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,029
Why's that?

420
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,656
Couldn't I just
change my position

421
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,991
so that I can get to
it with my right hand?

422
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,451
He's got a point.

423
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,827
Yeah, but it's slow.

424
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,496
You'd be making
yourself move farther,

425
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,539
and you'll never
hit any fast balls.

[BOTH gasp]

427
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,044
Plant your right foot
in front of you.

428
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,171
Your backswing should
look like this.

429
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,839
Then turn your wrist this way.

430
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,925
Now you give it a shot.

431
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,884
Like this?

432
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,136
And then when you see
the ball is approaching,

433
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,056
swing so that it lands flush
on the racket's face.

434
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:46,644
Hit the ball dead on,
just like with the forehand.

435
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,938
You mean like this.

436
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,815
Don't forget to follow through.

437
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,651
