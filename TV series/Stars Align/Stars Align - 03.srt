1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,056
[MAKI]
I'm fine from here.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,350
[TOMA] I don't mind
carrying it up for you.

3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,893
This is part of
the deal we made.

4
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,854
Well, if you insist. Thanks.

5
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:21,813
What about you guys?

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,648
Uh...

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,525
[pans scraping]

8
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,572
Do you need help?

9
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,699
[MAKI]
Nah, you'd be in the way.

10
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,452
[MAKI]
They had meat on sale today,

11
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,121
so there's plenty
if you want some.

12
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,457
This food... looks great.

13
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,333
It is.

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,919
There's no way anyone's
eating this well at my place.

15
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:44,962
Jealous.

16
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,296
Thanks, Maki.

17
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,844
That's good!

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,304
Sorry if I was cranky‐‐

19
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,348
I wanted to be eating
and not cooking.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,724
[TOMA] If you would
let me do the shopping‐‐

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,186
No, it's fine.
Hey, neighbor girl.

22
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,813
Why are you still here?

23
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,275
I live one floor
down. Who cares?

24
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,109
So good.

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,319
Uh. Hey, Toma.

26
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,321
Why is there one
player up by the net

27
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,322
and one at the back?

28
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,740
[TOMA]
Strategy.

29
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,285
[TOMA] Since there are
two players on a team,

30
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,744
it makes sense for
each one to cover

31
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,080
a different part of the court.

32
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,916
That's the nice thing
about playing as a pair.

33
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,210
But why split the court
into front and back?

34
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,087
One player reads the
game from the baseline

35
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,339
and calls the shots,
and the other looks

36
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,549
for openings to strike.

37
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,842
I get it.

38
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,094
The player combination
must be important.

39
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,388
C'mon. It's just a
system made for people

40
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,265
who aren't good enough
to cut it alone.

41
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,058
That's kinda mean.

42
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,980
I'm back, Maki.
I got off work early!

43
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:50,444
Huh. Hey, honey,
did you bring guests?

44
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,030
[MAKI]
Hi, Mom. I made us dinner.

45
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,531
There's plenty for everyone.

46
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,533
Oh, gosh, it looks so good!

47
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,244
Hi, everyone. I'm Maki's mother.

48
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,414
I'm Toma Shinjo.

49
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,916
Yuta Asuka. Nice to meet you.

50
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,002
Hi, ma'am. I stayed for dinner.

51
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,795
And Kanako's here, too!

52
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,297
Thank you so much
for getting along

53
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,299
with my son, everybody.

54
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,260
They're not my babysitters.

55
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,428
[AYA]
That's neat.

56
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,055
So you and Toma were
in the same class

57
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,140
until your first year
of elementary school?

58
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,392
I went to a different
school than you guys.

59
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,311
Me, too.

60
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,688
Thanks for having us.
We should get going.

61
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,191
Okay. Stay safe heading home.

62
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,818
And you can come back anytime.

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,861
Yes, ma'am.

64
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,498
[TOMA] The games in soft tennis
are played to four points,

65
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,249
then there are multiple
games in a set.

66
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,501
Three, five, seven.

67
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,795
It's always an odd
number, so no ties.

68
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,839
And the matches we play
are usually a single set.

69
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,883
If it's a three‐game
set, the team

70
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,844
has to take two games,
and then they win the match.

71
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,807
Meaning, you can lose one
game and still win overall.

72
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,016
[SHINGO]
Let's go, Taiyo!

73
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,601
Ow, ow, ow! Cut it out,
Shingo, that hurts!

74
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,977
[TSUBASA]
You're like children.

75
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,978
[SHINGO]
Stretch!

76
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,979
[TSUBASA]
Watch your feet!

77
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,481
It's too cramped in
here for that crap!

78
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,110
Hold up. Is Ameno
not here today?

79
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,654
He is. But he'll
be joining us later.

80
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,156
Uh. Is he busy?

81
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,741
Yeah, kinda.

82
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,542
A practice match? All of us?

83
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,710
Maki needs to learn the rules

84
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,586
and pick up the
basics in a hurry.

85
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,130
A match is the fastest way.

86
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,423
Yeah, I get that.

87
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,801
But still, isn't it a little
soon to have him playing games?

88
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,929
[YUTA] I think Katsuragi
will do all right.

89
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,974
He seems like a
fast learner. Look.

90
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,437
You play the net, and
I'll play the baseline.

91
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,479
Sure, sounds good.

92
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,939
But before we do anything,

93
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,984
you need to get that
shirt tucked in.

94
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:54,818
Why?

95
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,487
Because this is a sport
and there are rules.

96
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,905
[MAKI]
Hm.

97
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,032
He's gonna play a match?

98
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,869
[KANAKO sighs]

99
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,078
[RINTARO]
Serving first:

100
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,414
Toma Shinjo and Maki Katsuragi.

101
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,375
Returning: Taiyo Ishigami
and Shingo Takenouchi.

102
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,544
[SHINGO] Return the first
serve to his feet, okay?

103
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,879
[TAIYO]
Seriously?

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,338
[SHINGO] Yeah, give it
straight back to him

105
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,716
with all you've got!

106
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,594
It's a three‐game
match! Play ball!

107
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:24,973
[TOMA grunts]

108
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,769
[TAIYO]
Right in front of Katsuragi.

109
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,854
[gasps] Huh?

110
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,192

Whoa.

114
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,781
Nice, volley.

115
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,657
Volley? Is that
what that's called?

116
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,409
It is. Keep it up.

117
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,452
Now that's sad.

118
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,788
They gave up an easy
point to a first‐timer.

119
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,624
Good start, you two.
Playin' real smart.

120
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,460
If that's how it is...!

What?

00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,180
You moron.

125
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,099
[MAKI]
Hey.

126
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,977
I get to serve next, right?

127
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,395
Yeah, that's right.

128
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,735
[MAKI] So I'm supposed to start
off with a hard serve, huh?

129
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,539
[gasps]

130
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,542
No way.

131
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,003
[sighs] That felt good.

132
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,338
Nice serve.

133
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,674

00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,972
Be careful on the next one.

137
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,684
Got it. Let's see. Like that?

138
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,437
[SHINGO]
Take this!

That's game!

00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,992
Taiyo. You shoulda had that!

144
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,909
Yeah, my bad.

145
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,746
Shingo. How could he get to it?

146
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,164
Change sides!

147
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,917
This is his first time? Really?

148
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,712
He's got sharp eyes.
That's all it is.

149
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,963
Good job.

150
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,428
2‐0!

151
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,013
If they keep screwing
up like that,

152
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,348
it's gonna start
going to his head.

153
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,642
And it's worse with
a guy like him.

154
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,270
[TAIYO yelps]

155
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,608
Game and set! That's 2‐0.

156
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,486
Shinjo and Katsuragi
win the match!

157
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,487
Nice one!

158
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:48,158
Hold on. It's over?
Did he just win?

159
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,994
[MAKI]
Was that a good start?

160
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,413
[TOMA] Yeah. Try to get
up to the net faster

161
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,373
in the next game, okay?

162
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,876
Sure. I'll focus on that.

[grunts] What?

164
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,714
That was pathetic.

Shut up!

[TAIYO]
Shingo, stop it!

167
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,884
[SHINGO]
Huh?

168
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,094
No fighting, guys,
we're still at school!

169
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,554
Idiot.

170
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,557
We hit everything
straight at him.

171
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,142
Isn't that a little bit much?

172
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,354
It's smart to play your
opponent's weaknesses.

173
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,072
[TSUBASA]
Do it. Rush the net.

Friggin' pest!

182
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,730
Nice volley.

183
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,987
Yeah!

184
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,571
That's another point.

185
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,996
[TAIYO]
Um. Game, set and match.

186
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,914
With a score of
two games to none,

187
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,874
Shinjo and Katsuragi
are the winners.

188

[panting]

189
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,714
Katsuragi's really
something else.

190
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,842
He won twice?

191
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,720
I feel like my brain
is breaking here.

192
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,931
Someone needs to knock
this guy down a peg.

[yelps]

194

That's rough.
Itsuki's playing mean.

195
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,366
Uh.

196
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,994
Don't be scared.
It's a soft ball, relax!

197
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,912
It's not gonna kill you!

Let's see.

201
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,844
Katsuragi!

202
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,181
[SHINGO] Stay back!
They're still playing.

203
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,891
Ow.

204
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,519
[ITSUKI]
Welcome to the club!

205
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,314
That's gonna swell up
real nice, newbie.

206
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,775
It's turning into
a dodgeball game.

207
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,318
Looks like they're hazing him.

208
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,819
So. How do I deal with this?

209
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,613
The problem is that
you're not committing

210
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,781
to your movements.

211
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,700
When they do that,
fall back to the baseline.

212
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,826
Understood.

213
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,704
You can change your positioning
once the ball is in play.

214
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,332
So you need to be ready
to make adjustments.

215
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,918
That's a lot to think about.

216
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,377
0‐2!

217
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,430
What is this?

218
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,224
He's not gonna stop moving.

219
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,477
C'mon, take it!

220
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,647
Just hold still!

221
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,650
For real?

222
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:11,903
Good shot.

223
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,404
Heh, thanks.

224
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,909
Eww. My hand's getting wrecked.

225
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,160
What's the deal with him?

226
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,788
He keeps getting better and
better as the match goes on.

227
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,040
Don't praise the enemy, Nao.

228
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,250
What do you mean "enemy"?

229
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,876
Huh?

230
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,170
We're all in the
same club, aren't we?

231
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,644
[RINTARO]
Game and set!

232
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,646
Match goes to
Shinjo and Katsuragi.

233
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,565
Score, two games to zero.

234
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,651
He swept them. I just
can't believe it.

235
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,278
This can't be right.

236
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,612
How is he that good?

237
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,322
Man. You're amazing.

238
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,408
We might have a chance now!

239
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,538
You guys are pathetic.

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,665
What have you been
doing this whole time?

gonna pull this crap‐‐

[ALL gasp]

00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:20,388
Maki's completely right.
How are you this bad?

He took straight sets off
you on his first day!

246
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,561
Is being losers fun to you?

247
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,771
Or are you all too
stupid to get better?

248
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,064
That's not fair.

249
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,901
Everybody really is doing
the best they can.

250
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,277
Then their best is garbage

251
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,362
and they're going to be
garbage at everything.

252
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,364
You might as well
lie down and die!

254

Screw this. Bye, you
guys. I'm done here.

That was too much.

a bad temper. Scary.

00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,355
You're home early. No club?

00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,357
I took off for the day.

261
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,400
Did everyone else
on the team go home

262
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,152
or just you?

263
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:22,617
What is the matter with you?
Are you ever going to try?

264
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,788
I am trying. So hard.

265
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,751
[RINTARO] This is
basically what we've got.

266
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,379
Notes on everyone's
personalities and playstyles.

Don't worry. I'll
make a clean copy.

268
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,801
[MAKI]
Thanks, Yuta. Hey, VP?

269
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,303
No need for the title.
Rintaro's fine.

270
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,846
Okay, Rintaro.

271
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,307
Who decided how you guys
should be paired up?

272
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,851
We each picked our own partners.

273
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,606
Mister Sakurai signed
off on it, too.

274
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,483
Doubles partners are
supposed to complement

275
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,860
each other's playstyles, right?

276
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,863
These are leaders and lackeys.

277
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,407
That's a little harsh.

278

But it's true, isn't it?

279
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,327
Do you really think so?

280
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,162
Okay.

I dunno either.

We both ditched.

I think I'm finally done.

287
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,105
Club's a waste of time.

288
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,483
I'm the captain and I can't
do anything for them.

They suck because I do.

Stop saying you suck,
Toma. You don't.

291

That's not what Mom says.
She thinks I'm useless.

Enough of that.

You're fine.

Sometimes parents
and their children

aren't going to get along.

I know how tense things can
be between you and Mom.

00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,056
I just saw him.

328
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,391
He was back in the locker room

329
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,351
getting changed
into his uniform.

330
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,312
Yeah, I don't think anybody's
gonna buy that one, Nao.

331
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,355
Give it up.

332
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,024
[NAKAO] Oh, hey! It's the
worst club in the school.

333
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,151
How sad.

334
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,111
You mean the tennis team
that sucks too much

335
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,029
to play on the tennis courts?

336
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,157
Could there be anything
lamer than that?

337
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,992
How 'bout hanging
around after class,

338
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,410
starting crap for no reason?

339
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,828
Wait, Ameno?

340
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,038
You're actually in
this trash club?

341
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,832
I am. Now get lost.

342
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,417
It's not his fault.

343
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,128
His sister on the girls' team
got all the good genes.

344
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,088
Oh, yeah, she's paired
with that third year

345
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,423
with the dark tan.

346
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,592
And the whole school knows
she's better than you.

347
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,426
What's that like?

348
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:12,138
[ITSUKI sighs]

349
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,599
Keep talking. Let's
see what happens.

350
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,934
If only Mom and Dad
had kept it together.

351
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,728
Maybe things wouldn't
be like this.

352
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,521
Dang, that's rough!

353
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,149
Their place is a total dump
now that Mommy's gone.

354
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,152
Really. When have you
been to my house, huh?

355
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,696
I haven't, but I'm
looking directly at you.

356
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,781
And it's pretty easy to see it.

357
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,329
[inaudible]

358
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,290
[ALL gasp]

359
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,584
[yelps]

360
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,468
Are you kidding me?

361
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,012
Crap. Taiyo, come help!

362
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,472
Y‐Yeah!

363
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,348
[TSUBASA]
His head's sliced open.

364
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,142
Here. Take this and keep
the pressure on it.

365
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,352
[NAKAO]
It hurts!

366
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,187
Get him to the nurse's office.

367
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,522
[TSUBASA]
Yeah. Shingo?

368
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,648
[SHINGO]
Stand up, you're okay.

369
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,400
[RINTARO]
Itsuki. Hey, you all right?

370
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,527
Oh, yeah. Great.

371
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,362
You can't let guys
like that get to you.

372
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,197
Ya gotta learn to ignore them.

373
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,533
[MAKI]
It's not that easy.

374
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,910
I was getting pissed off, too.

375
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,286
You were watching all that?

376
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,372
My family's the same way.

377
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,916
It's only me and my mom
at our place now.

378
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,547
But still, don't hit
people with your racket.

379
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,590
Those things aren't cheap.

380
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,967
Huh?

381
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,056
No fighting at school.
You know that.

382
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,849
And if you do fight,
don't use a weapon.

383
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,228
I know you don't wanna
seriously injure someone.

384
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,104
Right?

385
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,690
Luckily, the wound wasn't
as bad as it may have looked,

386
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,650
but a big gash on the
head like that bleeds

387
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,278
way more than you would expect.

388
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,238
He had to be scared.

389
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,282
The fight was my fault.

390
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,033
This is all my doing.

391
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,328
Mostly. Of course you are
the one who swung first.

392
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,871
But it was just
as much his fault

393
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,166
for trying to use your family
situation to make fun of you.

394
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,585
Mister Sakurai!

395
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,669
[TAKAYUKI]
He was wrong for that.

396
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,046
A lot of bullies fail to
understand how much pain

397
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,757
their words can cause people.

398
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,010
Now. Want some candy?

399
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,387
The reason Itsuki doesn't
wanna change clothes

400
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,557
with the rest of us...
is 'cause you're here.

401
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,810
But i‐it's got nothing
to do with you personally.

402
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,854
I'm pretty sure he just
doesn't want you to see

403
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,481
the burn scars he has
all over his back.

404
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,150
I had no idea.

405
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,611
Yeah, and they're
pretty gnarly, too.

406
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,405
But barely anybody in the
school knows about 'em.

407
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,033
It's pretty much
only us in the club.

408
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,201
And now you, too, I guess.

409
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,204
[MAKI]
Really?

410
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,707
[TSUBASA] It happened when
he was only about a year old.

411
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:45,875
At home with his mom.

412
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,880
[ITSUKI crying]

413
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,080
They found her sitting
there in a daze.

414
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,416
And Itsuki was lying next
to her in his crib, screaming.

415
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,960
The neighbors came after
they heard him crying.

416
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,671
They got him to the hospital.

417
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,798
Yeah. But he didn't
get there fast enough

418
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,425
for them to stop the
scars from forming.

419
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,594
It's not that he's
embarrassed by them.

420
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,514
He's not really trying
to hide them from anybody.

421
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,101
But he still doesn't like
explaining where they came from.

422
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,061
Make sense?

423
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:52,024
Telling someone that his mom
poured boiling water on him.

424
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,859
That has to be tough.

425
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,867
[ITSUKI] Sorry for making
you deal with this.

426
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,037
If I'm being honest,
it felt good to watch.

427
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,498
That guy kinda had it coming.

428
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,999
That's pretty dark for you.

429
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,543
I'm no angel.

430
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,758

Hi, Namie!

00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,973
Bye, Namie!

00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,350
[NAMIE]
Oh, hey. See ya later!

436
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,646
What's up?
Talked to Mr. Sakurai.

437
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:31,897
Yeah?

438
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,649
Don't hit people with rackets.

439
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,401
My bad.

440
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,903
Just headbutt him or
something next time, okay?

441
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,613
Sure, got it.

00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,915
Yeah.

444
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,587
[ITSUKI]
It's your turn to make dinner.

445
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,421
[NAMIE]
What do you want?

446
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,506
I can go by the grocery store.

447
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,091
[ITSUKI]
Fried chicken.

448
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,344
[NAMIE] Again? What do you
wanna have with it?

449
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,221
[ITSUKI]
More fried chicken.

[RYOMA]
Hey, Toma.

452
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,315
What is it?

453
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,443
Maki really wants
to talk to you.

454
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,320
Here, take my phone.

455
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,994
Hey, Maki.

456
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,872
[MAKI] If the Boys' Soft Tennis
Club ends up disbanding,

457
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,123
I don't get paid, right?

458
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,208
[gasps]

459
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,753
[MAKI] That's not
acceptable. You got it?

460
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,254
So I don't wanna
hear anything else

461
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,006
about you quitting.

462
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,552
[MAKI] You're not allowed,
okay? I forbid it.

463
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,848
Don't even think about it.
Not for a second.

464
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,518
I refuse to hear it.
You understand?

465
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,102
You don't get to give up!

466
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,562
[gasps]

467
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,443
[MAKI]
You and me and the rest of them.

468
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,947
We're better together.
So we're staying together.

469
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:15,042
Yeah, I get it. I'll
see you all tomorrow.

470
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,629
[MAKI]
Good. We'll be waiting. Later.

471
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,976
[TOMA]
Sorry, everyone.

472
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,686
I skipped the last three days,

473
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,313
but I'm back now and
I want to practice.

474
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,066
I'm sorry for everything
I said before.

475
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,194
I hope you can forgive me.

476
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,238
Yeah, we can. I guess.

477
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,447
Dude, shut up.

478
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,700
You've skipped practice
how many times, now?

479
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,701
Have I?

480
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,327
You even forgot skipping.

481
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,622
Oh, yeah? Stretch!

482
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,584
[ITSUKI]
Shingo! No fighting at school.

483
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,419
[SHINGO]
Yeah, look who's talking!

484
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,670
I know.

485
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,922
Wait, that was it?
No clapback?

486
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,300
It's a good thing he
doesn't have his racket.

487
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,175
Why's that?

488
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,803
Don't worry about it;
we'll catch you up later.

489
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,139
[Hey, guys, I've
got some big news.

490
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,442
I figured out why
you all suck so bad!

491
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,318
What?

492
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,611
‐‐[TSUBASA] Katsuragi!
‐‐[RINTARO] What do you mean?

493
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,112
‐‐[TAIYO] Stop saying that!
‐‐[NAO] So tell us.

494
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,448
All of you picked
the wrong partners.

495
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,743
We need to form some new pairs,
and I mean everyone.

496
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,372
New pairs?
