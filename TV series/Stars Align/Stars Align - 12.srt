in the end, it was fun!

325
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,410
[TOMA'S MOM] As long as you
tried your best, Toma.

326
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,828
Thanks, Mom.

327
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,538
You know, from now on, can we‐‐

328
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,082
[TOMA'S MOM]
I've been trying my best, too.

329
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,460
Huh?

330
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,837
[TOMA'S MOM]
I can finally be honest

331
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,880
with what I think
and how I feel.

332
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,757
I don't have to hold it in.

333
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,344
I don't have to suffer anymore.

334
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,930
What?

335
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,348
[TOMA'S MOM]
I'm getting a divorce.

336

[TOMA gasps]

337
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,102
[TOMA'S MOM]
From now on,

338
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,855
you'll be living
with your father.

339
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,650
And I'm going to live together
with Ryoma somewhere else.

340
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,652
But why though?

341
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,406
[TOMA'S MOM laughs]
It's because I hate you.

342
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,992
It's such a relief
to finally say it.

343
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:47,580
I can stop suffering now
that you're out of my life.

344
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,999
Goodbye, Toma.

345
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,513
Toma!

346
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,223
Hey.

347
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,083
Hey, I'm home!

[MAKI]
These are... Are you here, Shou?

349
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,799
At today's match I...

[MAKI]
What the...? That's not good.

352
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,810
[MAKI]
Shou?

353
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,980
Maki.

354
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,237
Hey, where's my mom?

355
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,030
[sighs]

356
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,586
[EMPLOYEE 12A]
Welcome. That'll be 300 yen.

00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,745
This can't keep happening.

361
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,962
As long as he's still alive...

362
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,810
...we're trapped.
And we'll never be free.

363
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,567
I'm ending this right now.
