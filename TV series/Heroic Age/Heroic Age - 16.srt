Perhaps the Golden Tribe

to share our power
with the Iron Tribe.

165

Golden Tribe knew of our fate

as a hindrance.

There is but one fate left
for him if he fails to return.

193
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:49,869
Why in their infinite wisdom
would the Golden Tribe

194
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:54,790
decree a Labor that Mehitak
could never hope to fulfill?

195
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,377
‐ The Golden Tribe decreed
only the number of our Labors.

It was left up to use

in regard to the Nodos.

198

So much of what they intended
remains shrouded in mystery

199

But do not think
the battle is over.

207
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:31,911
Our enemies must know
beyond a shadow of a doubt

208

that we will never again
submit to the yoke

We must retaliate swiftly

Meleagros will continue to act

230
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,129
the council
wanted to avoid a scandal

as much as we wanted
to be rid of the princes.

323
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:54,817
I come from the planet Pore.

324
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:57,945
‐ I am Princess Dhianeila
of the Yunos royal family,

325
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,947
the rulers of the Altria system.

326
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:02,533
On behalf of the crew
and all of humankind,

327
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,786
it is my humble honor to welcome
you on board the "Argonaut."

328
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:09,540
‐ Does this mean I have to enter
into a contract with you now?

329
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,083
‐ Not with us,

330
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,168
but it would help
our efforts immensely

331
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:15,170
if you could provide details
about the contract

332
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,798
you're currently in.

333
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:18,841
‐ [chuckles]

334
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,553
‐ As long as I obey
the Silver Tribe,

335
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:24,888
the planet Pore
will be prosperous.

336
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,265
I am to do their bidding

337
00:18:26,265 --> 00:18:28,976
until my powers as Nodos
are exhausted.

338
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:31,311
Also, it is my duty to help

339
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,647
when the Silver Tribe's
Nodos is in peril.

340
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,274
That's my contract.

341
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:37,484
‐ The Silver Tribe's Nodos?

342
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,112
Is this being bound
to the Silver Tribe

343
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:42,364
by a contract
similar to your own?

344
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:43,907
‐ Yes, she is.

345
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:47,202
But Yuty's contract includes
eight Labors.

346
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:50,497
As for the others,
Karkinos has four.

347
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,166
Lecty has five.

348
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,667
In the battle against Age,

349
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,837
Artemia and I exhausted
our power.

350
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,338
Such is your strength.

351
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,548
‐ Huh.

352
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:01,508
‐ This means that my obligations

353
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,344
to the Silver Tribe
have come to an end.

354
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,347
‐ And what is to become
of your own tribe?

355
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,852
‐ If Yuty learns
of my presence here,

356
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,563
then it is very likely
my home planet of Pore

357
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:17,524
will be destroyed.

358
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:21,153
‐ They are willing to destroy
an entire world, your home,

359
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:23,530
over the disobedience
of one subject?

360
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,865
‐ Yes.

361
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:27,201
The same threat binds
Karkinos and Lecty.

362
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:29,953
Yuty would slaughter our tribes
without a thought.

363
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:32,623
She's even stronger than Age.

364
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:34,708

365

come to harm, Mehitak,

00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:39,296
I promise you.
‐ What?

367
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,924
‐ The "Argonaut" is currently
en route to planet Tauron,

368
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:44,551
birthplace of our mortal enemy,
the Bronze Tribe.

369
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,929
Your people have
already colonized a planet

370
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,097
in the same system.

371
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:49,223
Is that correct?

372
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:52,184
‐ You do wish me to fight
for you.

373
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:53,894
‐ I do not.

374
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,562
I ask only one thing,

375
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,815
that you do not use
your powers as a Nodos

376
00:19:57,815 --> 00:19:59,191
while you are with us.

377
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,443
In return, we will deliver you
to your tribe

378
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:04,446
and offer them our protection.

379
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:05,906
‐ You would do that?

380
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,241
‐ Of course we would.

381
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:09,743
This war should only be
between the Silver Tribe

382
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:10,911
and ourselves.

383

385

I urge you to take refuge
with your people

386
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,709
until this ends.

387
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,962
