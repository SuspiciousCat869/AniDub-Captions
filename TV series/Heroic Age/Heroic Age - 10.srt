for the Yunos family to sit on
the Humanity Alliance Council.

Now it's about bragging rights

193

But surely, Age,
they meant that you would be

194
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:13,356
the one to lead us, not I.

195

You're not telling.

PHAETO O: The fifth is now

with the Iron Tribe.

200
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:32,708
This will inspire other tribes
to resist us.

201
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,502
ROM ROR: Allowing the dissenters
to live

202
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:37,129
will profoundly weaken
our authority.

203

PHAETO O: What do you recommend?

204
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:40,633
ROM ROR: We continue to pursue
the fifth.

205
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:43,135
He and the Iron Tribe
will be made an example of

of the other Nodos.

Confer with Prome.

00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,157
She is there for that purpose.

215
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,870
‐ For all intents and purposes,

216
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,664
the Yunos family owns the Nodos,

217
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:15,042
which makes the family's head‐‐
me‐‐his master.

218

But the sad reality is that
I can't even persuade the beast

‐ Well then, you should stop
using Dhianeila as a go‐between.

221

You can't expect him to follow
your orders with her around.

00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,558
‐ Frankly, our sister scares me.

223
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:32,560
She can read one's thoughts
as easily

224

her clairvoyance for power.

Not compared
to your achievements.

You are the force behind
the most powerful fleet

Unit Calydonian.

If I am to rule the Iron Tribe,

the Nodos must be under
my control.

did you, General?

242
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,645

to get your opinion

243
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,772
on how best to handle
the Nodos situation.

244
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,440
‐ Handle him?

245
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,941
‐ We've been trying
to figure out

246
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,485
how to organize
the Alliance fleet.

247
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:24,737
It seems the motion made
by His Majesty yesterday

is virtually guaranteed to pass.

249

But according to the reports
we received from you,

250
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:30,618
the Nodos doesn't appear
to operate particularly well

251
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:31,952
as a part of a group.

252

that he doesn't cooperate, sir.

254
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,999
It's just that,
left to his own devices,

255
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,585
Age's instincts for battle
far outshine

256
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:41,962
all our best military minds
combined.

257
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,799

he'd be able to function as well

258
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,468
on any ship in the fleet?

259
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:50,137
I think we all agree
that the council's deliberation

260
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,597
are formality at this point.

261
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:53,516
In my opinion,
it's only a matter of time

262
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:55,643
before we initiate
our counteroffensive strike

against the Silver Tribe.
