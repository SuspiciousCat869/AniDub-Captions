the Silver Tribe will acquire
that power, Your Grace.

167
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:17,007
PROME: One: only those who obey
the Silver Tribe in all things

168
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,593
shall be allowed to prosper.

169
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,387

stewardship of the universe.

Nodos faces grave danger,

the exact nature of your Labors,

a Labor decreed within it,

which declares that
you shall sacrifice your life,

200
