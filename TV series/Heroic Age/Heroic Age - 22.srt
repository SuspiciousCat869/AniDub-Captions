161

get some rest first?

There isn't any time.

I must find the path
to Planet Elysium soon.

I don't have a choice.

166
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:16,548
This could well be
our only chance to end this war,

167
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,842
to make the Silver Tribe
our allies.

168
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:23,221
MOBEEDO: Eventually,
the princess will begin

169
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:25,015
to lead us
towards the home planet

170
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:30,729
of the Golden Tribe,
a place called Elysium.

171
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:32,439
I have no way of knowing
how long

172
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:36,067
this journey's going to take,
but I hope we make it back.

I hate to leave you
with this

174
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,446
on top of reorganizing
the fleet,

175
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:40,947

her entire conversation

00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:48,872
with the Silver Tribe, right?

180
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:50,415
‐ Yes, of course, master.

181
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:52,793
‐ I want you to transmit it
to the fleet,

182
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,002
then send it to Nilval

183

I just recorded.

184

‐ Understood, sir.

185
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,633
‐ Elysium.

186
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:03,512
An ancient planet that has
lost its Starway.

187
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:04,721
Could it really hold

188
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:08,016
the lost power
of the Golden Tribe?

189
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:11,102
Please show us the way,
Princess.

00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:15,106

at the end of this journey.

LECTY:
They're searching for Elysium?

192
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:20,362
Does that mean their
conversation was a success?

193
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:21,947
I don't understand it.

194
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:24,616
Is the Iron Tribe
actually going to try and find

195
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:26,952
the Planet of the Dawn?

196
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:31,122
Prome O, you've always believed
there was a possibility,

197
00:12:31,122 --> 00:12:34,209
and now it may become reality.

198
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:39,005
I should have faith in you,
yet I can't help by question.

199
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:42,801
How can we ever hope
to put an end to this war?
