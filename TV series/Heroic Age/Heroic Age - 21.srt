significance?

161
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,165
PROME O: The notion of clinging
to a single planet

162
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:47,251
is an antiquated one.

163
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,837
You often see that kind of
behavior in a tribe

164
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:53,006
that is unable to come to a
universe on their own.

165
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:56,468
You are the only tribe that has
maintained their historic core

166
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,429
after entering the universe.

167
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,181
That is, you and the Golden
Tribe.

168
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:03,851
‐ Us and the Golden Tribe?

169
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:06,770
MOBEEDO: Prome O is in contact
with the Iron Tribe.

170
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,857
MAN: This indicates a
possibility of some sort.

171
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:12,651
His situation is worth
reviewing.

172
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,032
‐ Prome O is making a mistake.

173
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,492
The presence of the Iron Tribe

174
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:22,619
disturbs the order
of the universe.

175
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:25,414
WOMAN: And yet she has come
without a weapon.

176
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:28,375
MAN: We will allow this
conversation to continue.

177
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,795
PHAETHO O: But the Iron Tribe
must be destroyed.

178
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:33,380
‐ Phaetho O.

179
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,966
PHAETHO O: Prome O is sitting
this very moment with the one

180
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,051
who rules the fifth Nodos.

181
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,428
She has put us in danger.

182
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:41,805
If Prome O refuses to get rid of
that woman,

183
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:43,766
I will do so myself.

184
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:47,853
MAN: Your emotions seem to have
taken over, Phaetho O.

‐ Listen to me.

186
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:51,473
If we don't destroy the Iron
Tribe, we risk everything.

187
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:05,579
MAN: The enemy line is falling
apart.

188
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,706
MAN: What's going on out there?

189
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:09,917
‐ We've found our path to
survival.

190
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:12,503
Search for holes in their
defense and head that direction.

191
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:14,588
We'll charge the enemy line.

192
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:19,635
Please guide us through this,
princess.

193
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:23,931
MAN: It seems the vast majority
agrees with Prome.

194
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:25,766
PROME O: Well, isn't it
interesting

195
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:27,601
that we have that in common.

196
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,937
DHIANEILA: Our tribes are the
only ones who've received

197
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:31,814
Nodos from the Golden Tribe.

198
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:35,234
‐ And it is my firm belief the
intentions of the Golden Tribe

199
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:36,777
are hidden in that action.

200
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:38,946
‐ But what do you think it
means?

201
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:41,073
PROME O: The labors of the Nodos
seem to have

202
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:43,075
major inconsistencies.

203
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:47,079
However, it's impossible that
the Golden Tribe made a mistake.

204
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,747
It must be our present condition

205
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:50,457
that causes these
contradictions.

206
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:52,626
We can eradicate them by
attempting

207
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,378
to understand one another.

208
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:57,339
Then the lost powers of the
Golden Tribe shall be bestowed

209
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:58,924
upon both our peoples.

210
00:11:58,924 --> 00:12:00,467
‐ I can't believe it.

211
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,512
I never thought I'd hear those
words coming from them.

212
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:05,848
‐ She never ceases to amaze me.

213
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:09,852
Dhianeila is the best diplomat
any of us could ever hope for.

214
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:12,980
‐ We have come here in search of
peace as well, Prome.

215
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,816
We want reconciliation, not to
take anything away

216
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,401
from your people.

217
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:20,821
‐ There are a few among us who
feel hatred towards your tribe.

218
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:23,115
My people are currently in a
heated debate

219
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:25,534
concerning my decision to speak
with you.

220
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:27,619
DHIANEILA: Yes, I can feel it.

221
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:30,330
And I feel the wonderful
spiritual balance

222
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,748
maintained among all of you.

223
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:34,543
PROME O: That power has allowed
my kind to expand

224
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:35,919
throughout the universe.

225
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,380
But it's frightening to be alone
in space.

226
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,341
So we've evolved to endure that
loneliness.

227
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,302
Now we can share our thoughts
and emotions

228
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,304
despite the distance between us.

229
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,139
However, even when sharing
thoughts,

230
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,850
we tend to avoid emotions which
should not be ignored.

231
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,435
DHIANEILA: Like what?

232
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,896
PROME O: The sense of loss we
felt when the Golden Tribe

233
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:57,733
vanished, the anxiety caused by
a sense of duty

234
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,067
to take over their guidance

235
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,778
and maintain order in the
universe.

236
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:04,698
It was those primitive emotions
which led us to believe

237
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:07,868
that we needed to destroy the
Iron Tribe.

238
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:10,162
‐ But why?
Why us, Prome?

239
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:13,040
PROME O: Because when the Golden
Tribe abandoned us,

240
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,877
they chose to share their power
with your tribe.

241
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:18,670
DHIANEILA: The Nodos.

242
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,797
PROME O: To our kind,
who have learned from

243
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:23,550
and aspire to be like the Golden
Tribe,

244
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,761
it felt like a betrayal,

245
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:28,764
although it was more than just
these simple emotions

246
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:31,975
that led us to believe we must
destroy your tribe.

247
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:34,728
It is also because you're a
destructive race of beings

248
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:38,106
willing to destroy your own
stars if need be.

249
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:45,113
‐ Well, unlike you, we moved
from our home

250
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:46,740
only a short time ago.

251
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,909
We are still a young tribe who
have yet to learn

252
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,702
how to live in the universe.

253
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:53,914
Understand our race can be
taught right from wrong,

254
00:13:53,914 --> 00:13:55,415
but you must give us some time.

255
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:57,084
What would the Golden Tribe have
wanted,

256
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:59,920
an entire race to be destroyed
due to their immaturity?

257
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,547
‐ Of course there are those
among our tribe

258
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:05,133
who share that thought and would
rather not cause

259
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,593
needless destruction.

260
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:09,096
Both your tribe and mine should
learn from the lessons

261

of the Golden Tribe and try to
find peace.

That is a lesson we must learn

destruction.

It's almost like I can hear the

PROME O: I have always wondered.

Every tribe in existence must

are you not afraid

322

DHIANEILA: Before they vanished,
the Golden Tribe told my people

323
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:21,223
to go forth, and by leaving the
Starway,

the ultimate objective

332

endless battle.

the best way to keep life

335
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,546
DHIANEILA: If through their
divination they ever felt

336
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,508
our actions would bring ruin to
the universe,
