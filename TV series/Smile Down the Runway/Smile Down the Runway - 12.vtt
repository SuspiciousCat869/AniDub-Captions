[MAI] When I participated
in the Geika Festival,

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:35.160 position:50% align:center
back when I was a
student starting out,

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:38.580 position:50% align:center
I had 52 inquiries from buyers.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
That record has
stood without once

for the past 40 years.

Is that where we're
going with this?

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
So if you can break that record,
do whatever you want.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:37.282 position:50% align:center
Hey. Is it me or are
those clothes weird?

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.451 position:50% align:center
How are you supposed
to put that stuff on?

but clothes like these

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.851 position:50% align:center
do pop up in some
international shows.

Oh, well. I guess
I don't really get it.

Yeah, weird.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
It could be because
Toh Ayano's up next, though.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center

That can't be right!

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, but don't be nervous,

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
it's just a

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center

least half of the people

are most likely buyers.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, I got
kinda distracted.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
I meant to ask if you would be

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
interested in selling me
a few of your designs?

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
What? Sell, me?

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Your show definitely
caught my attention.

We can just settle
the details another day.

You wouldn't happen to have
a card on you, would you?

Uh, no, sorry, I don't!

always have one ready!

these things will happen.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
All right then.

Just don't forget
to reach out, okay?

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.480 position:50% align:center
Wait, should I...?

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
Is this real?

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center

Can you please not
yank on my hair?

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
It hurts when you do that!

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
Then get down here and
look at me eye to eye!

You listen to me!

until I'm finished!

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center

Oh, hi! Thank you so much

It means the world to me!

And you're even wearing
the suit that I made.

There's nothing
for us to say yet.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.381 position:50% align:center
We'll talk after the results.

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:04.724 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey, high-school guy!

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:06.726 position:50% align:center
Oh, Mr. Ryunosuke.

[RYUNOSUKE]
Wow, somebody's acting emo.

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
Am I? But I'm in
a pretty good mood.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
Just nerves.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.318 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. So, did you
screw up your show?

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:16.861 position:50% align:center
No, I didn't!

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
I think it went well. But
everyone else's were fantastic.

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
You've got it bad. I thought you
were creepy back in the prelims,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
when you kept gushing over
me and Kaoru's entries.

Oohing and ahhing like a fanboy.

What?

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
But now you're trying
to play it cool

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
because you want to win
this thing so badly.

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
You're going to be a
total mess when you lose!

[RYUNOSUKE] So, what're
your plans after graduation?

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
I don't know your
financial situation,

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
but I'm sure you'd be able
to get a scholarship, easy.

Hi, Miss Kizaki.

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
Hey, what'd you
think of my designs?

Oh! Well, I, um--

I think they were
really wonderful.

Okay.

Well, then? Did you
get at least 53 cards?

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Don't know.

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
I haven't counted yet.
Would you like the honor?

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.198 position:50% align:center
It's so silly, you know.
Limiting yourself like this.

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
You should learn
to live more freely.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center

Uh? Shoot, what's going on?
Is this mic working all right?

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's time to
announce the rankings!

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
Thanks to everyone involved

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
from the instructors
to the participants.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.975 position:50% align:center
This year's Geika Festival
was an overwhelming success!

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
After we announce first place,

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
those designers who
have ranked in the top ten

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.189 position:50% align:center
will be called up to the runway.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
Eleventh and below
will stay here.

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
Those who are called,

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
please proceed to
the stage with your model.

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
You'll receive your
critique and a trophy.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
I think it's important to
take this moment to say this:

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
Our ranking does not reflect
the quality of the clothes.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
But since this is a contest,

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
we chose to judge them
based on originality,

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
construction, and last
but not least, presentation.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
Also, keep in mind that
this is only an evaluation

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
from the artistic perspective

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
we've personally
been cultivating.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.848 position:50% align:center
So there is some subjectivity.

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:53.143 position:50% align:center
In no way should it be taken as
a rejection of your favorites!

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
Everyone is entitled
to love the pieces

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
they enjoyed during the show--

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
the ones that they felt
were most fashionable.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
So, without any
further ado, let's begin!

the first-place winner?

Yeah, I mean,
it was good, but...

with your choice of theme.

well-suited for the festival

called should go on stage.

Eleventh is Tsumura. Got it?

Yes, I did.

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO] The construction
was very precise and neat.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.517 position:50% align:center
And as far as the
world-themed designs and ideas,

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
they were all really incredible.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
But... the work was solely
drawn from the countries,

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
lacking creativity
and uniqueness.

Now, practical clothes.

On those, your designs
were too much like

the clothes we all
wear every day.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
One of the primary
duties of designers is

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
to inspire new fashion.

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center

on that from here on out.

to come out to the stage.

were really that bad?

That can't be why.

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
Miss Fujito,
can you hear me now?

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI grunts]

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Who are you, lady?

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
Hey. Be polite!

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
I'd very much like
to speak with you.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center
Is that...?

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
Yes, this is Mr. Toh's
lovely eleventh outfit.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
And it's the one that stumped
all of us patternmakers.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
[KANAMI] I'm going to
change into this, so look away.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
What?! Yeah, sure.

00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
[KANAMI]
Okay. You can turn around now.

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
It's not my size
so it's a little off.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
The sleeves...

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
They don't puff up
the way they should.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
[KANAMI]
I knew it.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.059 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
Would you mind if
I took a quick look?

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
Here's the problem. The shoulder
dart doesn't seem quite right.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
If you made it ten millimeters,
no, five millimeters wider.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
[KANAMI]
If you were on our team,

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
Mr. Toh would've
achieved his vision!

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
Nobody else was able to keep up
with Mr. Toh's high standards.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
He had to fix
every outfit himself.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
Except this... because he ended
up running out of time.

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
Mr. Toh's goal was to receive
53 inquiries from the buyers.

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
But he only got 52.

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
If only this had been finished!

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
But, no. And so he withdrew!

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
I wish that you had been
on board as a patternmaker!

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:10.812 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] Hmm... Everyone
besides Miss Sara voted for Toh.

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
And the only participants who
received inquiries

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
from buyers today were Toh
and Ikuto, and no one else.

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:25.952 position:50% align:center
That's fashion.

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad we
allowed non-students.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] Toh has worked
alone for a very long time.

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.339 position:50% align:center
I think he finally
found a friend.

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:40.717 position:50% align:center
And I feel fairly certain
Ikuto will be smart

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
and follow his lead.

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
[MAI] Just because
you didn't surpass me,

00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:56.316 position:50% align:center
that doesn't mean
it's the end for you.

00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:57.776 position:50% align:center
What are you going to do now?

00:21:57.859 --> 00:21:59.569 position:50% align:center
Well, it seems obvious
that I'll be working

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.988 position:50% align:center
for you at least
a little while longer.

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:05.408 position:50% align:center
[MAI] As long as you're an
asset, you're more than welcome.

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:07.619 position:50% align:center
But... your show today--

00:22:07.702 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
you're still
imitating my designs.

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:11.581 position:50% align:center
I couldn't see any growth.

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:12.457 position:50% align:center
So, why don't you--

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.334 position:50% align:center
I'm not starting my own brand.

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:15.543 position:50% align:center
What?

00:22:15.627 --> 00:22:19.464 position:50% align:center
If I leave, I won't be
able to respect myself.

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:22.050 position:50% align:center
I never break my promises.

00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:25.136 position:50% align:center
Guess I'm a bit of
a narcissist like that.

00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:33.812 position:50% align:center
Ah. I'm gonna cry.

00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:36.648 position:50% align:center
"Go and win, first-born son!"

00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:39.025 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no pressure at all.

00:22:39.109 --> 00:22:42.862 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO sighs]
Enough complaining.

00:22:42.946 --> 00:22:45.657 position:50% align:center
I can't even keep focused.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.869 position:50% align:center
I didn't get any closer to
my dream with this festival.

00:22:49.953 --> 00:22:51.705 position:50% align:center
What am I gonna do now?

00:22:51.788 --> 00:22:52.914 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:02.257 position:50% align:center

Oh, Ikuto!

[IKUTO gasps]

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.470 position:50% align:center
Good, I'm glad I found you.

00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:10.765 position:50% align:center
Here, I wanted to give
this to you. [chuckles]

00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:14.060 position:50% align:center
It's Geika's student
application form.

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:15.895 position:50% align:center
You know, you
can enroll at Geika

00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:17.480 position:50% align:center
and still work as an intern.

00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:19.232 position:50% align:center
An intern, huh?

00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:22.235 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] Yes, so you'd be able
to work while going to school.

00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:24.320 position:50% align:center
Now listen. You're so young.

00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:27.490 position:50% align:center
You're only a 17.
There's room to grow!

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:31.119 position:50% align:center
You faced older college students
today and fared very well.

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:34.039 position:50% align:center
Your achievement will
benefit you, no matter what.

00:23:34.122 --> 00:23:37.500 position:50% align:center
You're only going
to keep improving.

00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to make
it clear that Geika

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:43.715 position:50% align:center
would welcome a student
like you any time you're ready!

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:45.508 position:50% align:center
Thank you so very much.

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.594 position:50% align:center
I'll see you later, Ikuto.

00:23:58.021 --> 00:24:00.065 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Congratulations.

00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:02.150 position:50% align:center
No, not you, too.

00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:03.943 position:50% align:center
Just show me your pain!

00:24:04.027 --> 00:24:05.487 position:50% align:center
What? My pain?

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.490 position:50% align:center
I finally won something fair and
square and came out on top,

00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:11.534 position:50% align:center
but no one's giving me a chance
to gloat about my victory!

00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:14.204 position:50% align:center
Kokoro keeps on
crying over there.

00:24:14.287 --> 00:24:16.956 position:50% align:center
And Igarashi just
left without a word!

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.626 position:50% align:center
So, Ikuto, I wanna
hear how bitter you are!

00:24:19.709 --> 00:24:20.794 position:50% align:center
But I'm not.

00:24:20.877 --> 00:24:23.463 position:50% align:center
I said congratulations
'cause I meant it.

00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:26.007 position:50% align:center
You're for real? You're not
like bitter in the least?

00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:27.467 position:50% align:center
No, seriously not.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.052 position:50% align:center
It's all great.

00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:31.680 position:50% align:center
Cool! Well, just wait until you
hear what happened to me, then!

00:24:31.763 --> 00:24:33.014 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Huh?

00:24:33.098 --> 00:24:35.183 position:50% align:center
I'm signing an
exclusive contract.

00:24:35.266 --> 00:24:37.268 position:50% align:center
Get this.

00:24:37.352 --> 00:24:39.437 position:50% align:center

towards girls with
a more mature style...

00:24:44.234 --> 00:24:48.613 position:50% align:center
...with you as the
face... exclusively.

00:24:48.697 --> 00:24:50.782 position:50% align:center
Nuts, right?

00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:52.659 position:50% align:center
Now I'm bitter.

00:24:53.743 --> 00:24:55.286 position:50% align:center
Incredibly bitter!

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.871 position:50% align:center
You'd better be!

00:24:56.955 --> 00:25:00.583 position:50% align:center
Because I won't lie, it's really
satisfying beating you, Ikuto!

00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:02.002 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Thing is, though...

00:25:02.085 --> 00:25:04.295 position:50% align:center
...this was my first time.

00:25:04.379 --> 00:25:06.673 position:50% align:center
And now that I know
what this feels like,

00:25:06.756 --> 00:25:09.634 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'll lose again.

00:25:10.719 --> 00:25:12.345 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Mm...

00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:19.310 position:50% align:center
Not to be a jerk,

00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:22.188 position:50% align:center
but you'd better hurry
and catch up with me.

00:25:22.272 --> 00:25:23.606 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Yeah, I know.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.360 position:50% align:center
Otherwise I'll go to Paris
Fashion Week without you.

00:25:27.444 --> 00:25:28.903 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:39.456 position:50% align:center

00:25:47.922 --> 00:25:50.300 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I don't want to be left behind.

00:25:52.719 --> 00:25:56.514 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] I can still
take on new challenges.

00:25:56.598 --> 00:25:59.100 position:50% align:center
I'm Chiyuki Fujito.

00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:05.023 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I have news.

00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:06.983 position:50% align:center
I'll be closing up
shop for a while.

00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:09.694 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
What? Why would you do that?

00:26:09.778 --> 00:26:11.029 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
The truth is,

00:26:11.112 --> 00:26:13.823 position:50% align:center
Aphro I Dite invited me
on board as a designer.

00:26:13.907 --> 00:26:15.742 position:50% align:center
Wait, Aphro I Dite?

00:26:15.825 --> 00:26:18.078 position:50% align:center
That's Toh's
grandmother's brand!

00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:21.122 position:50% align:center
If I produce results with
Japan's premier fashion line,

00:26:21.206 --> 00:26:23.291 position:50% align:center
it'll exponentially
increase my worth.

00:26:23.375 --> 00:26:26.294 position:50% align:center
So I can eventually
get to Paris Fashion Week.

00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:30.465 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
What are your plans?

00:26:35.053 --> 00:26:37.097 position:50% align:center

I want to move forward.

00:26:38.348 --> 00:26:40.475 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Yes? What is it?

00:26:40.558 --> 00:26:44.562 position:50% align:center
Will you take me, too?
To work at Aphro I Dite?

00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:52.654 position:50% align:center
So we meet again.

Yes! I can't wait
to get started!
