Mom.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.114 position:50% align:center
Please don't go. You can't.

[IKUTO gasps]

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.160 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.246 position:50% align:center
Everything'll be fine.

[HONOKA]
Where were you?!

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
What took you so long, huh?!

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:12.340 position:50% align:center
This is a nightmare.
I found this note on her bed.

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50% align:center
I was alone and
so scared. [crying]

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.472 position:50% align:center
What the heck was
I supposed to do?!

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:23.393 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA sobbing]

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.645 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Honoka.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.523 position:50% align:center
I think she was
trying to protect us.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:32.277 position:50% align:center
So she didn't let on
to how bad it was.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
This can't be happening!

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:35.989 position:50% align:center
How could she do that to us?!

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:41.077 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA sobbing]

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.499 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
You okay?

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.709 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Yeah.

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Have you
talked to Ichika and Aoi?

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Not yet.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
Maybe you could
tell Aoi secretly.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.510 position:50% align:center
Let's keep it
from Ichika for now.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.099 position:50% align:center
Y'know, they're both
probably worried sick.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.351 position:50% align:center
You wanna head home?

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center
Let them know that
we're all right?

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Yeah. Okay.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] She's been really
sick this whole time.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
Mama, what are you doing?

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
I'm using your old
clothes to make a skirt.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.170 position:50% align:center
Honoka's getting bigger,
so she needs something new.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
I wanna do that, too!

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
Not yet. Needles are
pretty dangerous.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I mean, she was always
in and out of the hospital.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
What a good boy!

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
I think you're already
better than I ever was!

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.769 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
I love it! Honoka won't
even bother with me!

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Why didn't I ever question it

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.568 position:50% align:center
when she said she was okay?

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.238 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:05.704 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
Don't worry. Mommy's with you.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center
Mommy's right here...
for all of you.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasping]

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO] I've always tried my
best not to dwell on the past.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
However, I couldn't seem
to stay out of the hospital.

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
I really thought it
would only be once.

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
But then, I kept relapsing.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50% align:center
I admit, I've finally
started losing hope.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.861 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid the savings your
father left for you are gone.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
Because of this mess,
I ended up using it all up.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
But you know what?

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.702 position:50% align:center
Nothing's going to stop me
from keeping positive.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
I may not be feeling
the luckiest right now,

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
but Honoka got into
her dream school.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
Aoi has her volleyball.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
Ichika loves pre-school.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
That's all pretty amazing.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center
But let me tell you, Ikuto.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
I can't even think about
what life would've been like

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.640 position:50% align:center
if you hadn't been
there for all of us.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Mom.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
I, um...

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
I want to be a fashion
designer more than anything.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.608 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO gasps]

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
I know that. Of course I do.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
Ikuto,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
thank you for everything
you've gone through for us.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
The thought of you having to

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
face any more hardship...

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
I'm trying hard
to keep my head up,

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.799 position:50% align:center
but that thought just kills me.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
I have every
intention of recovering.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.054 position:50% align:center
But... just in case,

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
I want you to know that if
anything were to happen to me,

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
there will be some
money coming to you.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center
Use half of that money
for yourself, Ikuto.

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
Okay? That's what I want.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
Why, though?

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
Why do you think you'll
disappear like this?

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:18.336 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO sobbing]

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center
Kinda weird. Total
radio silence from Ikuto.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Guess he must be busy.

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I better get to work, too.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
The operation was successful,

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
and her post-op
progress is good.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.489 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
That said,

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
your mother is going to be
very susceptible to a relapse

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.119 position:50% align:center
if she pushes herself too hard.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A] We advised her to
have the operation much earlier.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
However, she refused.

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
I don't know why,
but for some reason,

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
she was adamant about
waiting another two months.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
So when's that Geika
Festival happening?

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
It'll be in two months!

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
How exciting.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center
So it was me.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Well, her condition's
still delicate.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.690 position:50% align:center
You'll need to be
careful around her.

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
All right.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
If her recovery
continues on course,

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:28.782 position:50% align:center
then I'd guess she'll
be released in a month.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
Thank you for all your help.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
Um, we've been
consulting with your mother

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:38.249 position:50% align:center
for a few months
regarding her bill with us.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A] Hospital policy
is that the entire balance

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
for her treatment
is due upon her release.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I see.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
Well, Mom, nothing's
left in your savings, right?

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Four hundred and sixty
thousand yen by next month?

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
I've got a ways to go.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.580 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of it somehow.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
What do you want, Bobby boy?

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
Hello, sir. I, uh...

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm quitting.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
I can't work for you anymore.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Why's that?

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.871 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's because...

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Whatever.
Get lost and stay gone.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
I'll explain!
Wait a second, I can--

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
[dial tone]

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Mr. Yanagida...

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
He knew I was inexperienced
and wouldn't be very much help.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
But he chose to
take me on anyway.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
There's no way I could ask
him to give me more work.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.567 position:50% align:center
Or get him to pay me
a higher rate.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
Doing that would be wrong of me.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
Half of this applause
goes to you tonight.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
You know, your goals are valid.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
[inhales, exhales]

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center

Thank you for everything!

[phone ringing]

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.182 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Hello, this is Tsumura.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
Please, I need to speak
with Mr. Ayano right away.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Hey, Ikuto.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I've got my
hands full at the moment.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
If you need to talk,
then swing by the studio.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Here you go.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
This'll be your next task.

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Okay!

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
Ah, ha. That must be him.

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I didn't
mean to barge in.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:38.930 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
My apologies, you two, but could
you give Ikuto and me a minute?

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
We really need to
stop everything for him?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
Please, Kanami. Go on.

00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout this.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
[door opens, closes]

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
So? What's up?

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, right.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
You have nothing to share?
Well, if that's the case,

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.793 position:50% align:center
could you go back
to helping out Yusuke?

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:11.504 position:50% align:center
Things are insanely
busy right now.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I need to quit--

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
Well, I...

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Ikuto.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure why you're
hesitant to tell me,

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
but the thing is,
I'm your employer.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
So I feel like that does
give me the right to an answer.

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Okay.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
I see. Your poor mother.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
And so this is
your big solution--

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
to quit and take up multiple
part-time jobs to make money.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.625 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
Oh, man! I was worried
for nothing, then!

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
For a second, I thought
it was something serious.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
I can definitely help you
if that's the case.

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
Ikuto,

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
I'd like to officially
welcome you to my team.

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
And I don't just mean
as a part-timer, either.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
You're on the official
crew for my brand

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.148 position:50% align:center
and we're winning the show.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
What? Hold on, what're
you talking about?

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
Mr. Ayano, were you even
listening to me just now?

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Sure. I heard you.

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
And right now you're thinking,

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
"How could I get
away with working here

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
when I decided
to quit Hajime's?"

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
Kinda.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
Listen, take my advice.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:31.251 position:50% align:center
That kinda thing's not
worth worrying about.

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.419 position:50% align:center
Know why?

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
Because I've thought about this

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.755 position:50% align:center
and already see your
potential as a brilliant

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
patternmaker here with my brand.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
With you on board, I'll have
this year's festival in the bag!

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.221 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Please, I don't
think you understand.

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.390 position:50% align:center
I'm entering the finals myself.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
So I don't see how
I could join your team.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are you insane?

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
You said you were
gonna fill your days

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
with working part-time jobs.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
You'd need time and materials.

00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
How would you do it?

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
You have to be realistic.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
But I...

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
Oh, do you know better, then?
Is that really what you think?

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.330 position:50% align:center
Better than someone who
devotes their mind and body

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
to their craft
24 hours of every day?

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I can't--

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.592 position:50% align:center
I can't just give up like this.

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
I'll sacrifice my sleep.
I'll work hard.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
And I can use cut up old
clothes to make my entry.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Ikuto.

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
Do you seriously think
you have that kind of talent?

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
You don't.

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Since we're already talking,

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
now is probably
a good time for me

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.111 position:50% align:center
to set you straight about that.

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
Ikuto, your talent as a
designer is painfully average.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
Maybe even below average.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
You don't carry within you

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.544 position:50% align:center
the capacity to make
a living as a designer.

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
I'd encourage you
to take this chance.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
Set your sights on
being a patternmaker.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
But it's up to you.

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
You could obviously choose
to continue living in poverty,

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.226 position:50% align:center
sacrificing more and more,

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
desperately clinging
to your childish dream.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
Is that what you
want for yourself?

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm only
trying to help here.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.905 position:50% align:center
I think you should join my team.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
If you do, then you
can count on me

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center
to cover all of your
mother's medical expenses.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
Let's say I accept your offer.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
After the Geika Festival
is over, am I free?

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Whatever you want.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:42.757 position:50% align:center
But only accept if you think you
can handle what I'm asking for.

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
Deal?

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
How can he say that?

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
What does he know?

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
Nothing!

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
He doesn't know me!

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50% align:center
If he did, he'd know
that it doesn't matter

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
whether I have some
amazing talent or not!

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
I just wanna do
what makes me happy!

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO panting]

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I need more money.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm in high school!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center
What am I supposed to do?!

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.672 position:50% align:center
Nobody chooses to be born poor!

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
I'm not heir to a freaking
fortune like you, Ayano!

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.846 position:50% align:center
You don't get to
say a single word!

[IGARASHI]
Just as I figured.

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
I knew I'd run into you

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
if I waited around
the school long enough.

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:41.566 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're...

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
What do you want with me?

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] I happen to know
you're struggling with money.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
I'd like to make a deal.

[IKUTO]

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
what you're saying.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Oh, I think you do.

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
Hasegawa was acting strangely,
so I did a little digging.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.131 position:50% align:center
My investigation
led straight to you.

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Investigation?

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
I know your mother's condition
and your family situation.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
Plus, I see how much influence
you have on Hasegawa.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.394 position:50% align:center
You need the money, right?

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
In exchange for this,
I want you to convince Hasegawa

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
to give up on
becoming a designer.

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.282 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Why?

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
Why're people like this?

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
Taking advantage of
the things I value most.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
All so they can gain
something for themselves.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
There's no way I could do that!

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center

Wait, did I speak...?

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center

I'm not sure.

I can't.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
Don't think so hard.
You need it, right?

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:02.772 position:50% align:center

What'd you just say?

to put her future on the
line the way you seem to do.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.408 position:50% align:center
Irresponsibly?

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
You're only saying that because

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
you have no clue how
hard she's working!

Oh, grow up.

If this world truly
honored hard work,

then why isn't that

So I'm coming to you today
with absolute confidence.

over for you to buy

for the festival.

thing for Hasegawa, too.

So really, everyone wins.

Would you calm down?

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center

involved will be happy.

There's no way.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
You're not. This isn't a joke?

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
But why?!

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.169 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Not my business.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
No...

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
I need to call him.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] Even though I don't
really know how I could help.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:58.263 position:50% align:center
He's the one who
always helps me.

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
For someone as strong
as him to have to quit,

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
it must be something serious.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.395 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] Please, you have
to let me call him right now!

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO gasps]

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I don't care if you do,

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
but just remember that
you're on the clock.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
Now be quiet.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:21.911 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Mr. Ikuto...

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Sorry, sir,

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
but would you please
give me Mr. Ayano's number?

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
He might know something more.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
Hey, Big One.
Are you deaf or what?

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
I'll keep quiet!

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
I promise, okay?

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
I just ask that you please
don't let him quit! He can't!

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:45.894 position:50% align:center
But he must think he
should for some reason.

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
Please!

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Mr. Ikuto, where are you?

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I was only given two
months to pay off the debt.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Moving boxes.

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
Working registers.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
Mopping floors.

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
Factory gigs.

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
Delivering papers.

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I took as many
random little jobs as possible.

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:20.220 position:50% align:center
Honoka found work, too.

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
Aoi's been helping out
more with the chores.

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.183 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
We're all working hard

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
so we can cover our living
expenses and save a little.

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
Only three weeks
until the Geika Festival.

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
And I can't think of a design.

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
Do you seriously think
you have that kind of talent?

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
You don't.

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
Ikuto, the bath's all yours.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO grunts]

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
Come on. Try to cheer up.

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're already
under so much pressure.

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
Don't make it any worse.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
Have a soak,
it's really soothing!

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
Just leave me alone!

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
I'm exhausted!

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
I need quiet.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Fine. Sorry to bother you.

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ikuto. Your turn in there.

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzing]

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm the worst.

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:23.283 position:50% align:center
[buzzing continues]

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm sorry.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Well, that could've gone better.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:36.629 position:50% align:center
They didn't let
me walk two steps.

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
No.

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:47.932 position:50% align:center
I don't want to get
Miss Kokoro involved in this.

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
I can't respond.

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:55.565 position:50% align:center
Well, earning money by making
clothes is a great thing.

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:58.276 position:50% align:center
It's still in the industry.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.488 position:50% align:center
Nothing wrong with
being a patternmaker.

00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:02.989 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:07.452 position:50% align:center
I should go and apologize,
and I should thank Mr. Ayano.

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:09.120 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:10.705 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Do you have an appointment?

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:19.673 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Oh, um...

00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:23.009 position:50% align:center
President Fujito invited me.

00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:25.637 position:50% align:center
Sorry for calling
you in so abruptly.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.305 position:50% align:center
No, it's okay!

00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:29.265 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to see you again.

00:22:29.349 --> 00:22:32.102 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] Hey, there's
no reason to be nervous, okay?

00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:34.229 position:50% align:center
Relax. Have a seat.

00:22:34.312 --> 00:22:38.149 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] May I ask... why is
it you wanted to see me?

00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:42.529 position:50% align:center
Actually, Chiyuki's
returning from Paris today.

00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:44.531 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:22:44.614 --> 00:22:46.616 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Oh.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.661 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] Not one single place
would give her a chance.

00:22:49.744 --> 00:22:52.080 position:50% align:center
So she ran out of funds.

00:22:52.163 --> 00:22:55.917 position:50% align:center
You know, Chiyuki
talks about you a lot.

00:22:56.001 --> 00:22:59.546 position:50% align:center
I think if anyone could
cheer her up, it'd be you.

00:22:59.629 --> 00:23:02.507 position:50% align:center
I'd be grateful if
you would talk to her.

00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:07.804 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I'm not sure I'm
in the right mindset for that.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.725 position:50% align:center
Let's go. Change of scenery.

00:23:14.936 --> 00:23:16.980 position:50% align:center
President Fujito,

00:23:17.063 --> 00:23:20.900 position:50% align:center
there's something I need
to apologize to you about.

00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:23.820 position:50% align:center
Is it about you quitting?
Word travels.

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:26.614 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yes, I'm sorry.

00:23:26.698 --> 00:23:29.159 position:50% align:center
I know you're the
one who introduced us.

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:30.535 position:50% align:center
Well, honestly,

00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:33.079 position:50% align:center
turnover at Yanagida's
has always been pretty high.

00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:34.539 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:36.249 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
That isn't it!

00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:39.544 position:50% align:center
Mr. Yanagida didn't
do anything wrong.

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:41.713 position:50% align:center
It's because...

00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:45.592 position:50% align:center
...I just don't have the
things I need, you know?

00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:51.473 position:50% align:center
I just realized something.

00:23:51.556 --> 00:23:53.767 position:50% align:center
I think I owe you
an apology, too.

00:23:57.645 --> 00:24:00.065 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
I made you wait for so long.

00:24:02.192 --> 00:24:04.235 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
What? But that's...

00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:06.780 position:50% align:center
Tsumura,

00:24:06.863 --> 00:24:11.368 position:50% align:center
I don't know all the details,
but I heard you were struggling.

00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:14.662 position:50% align:center
According to Yanagida, anyway.

00:24:14.746 --> 00:24:16.790 position:50% align:center
How'd Mr. Yanagida know?

00:24:16.873 --> 00:24:19.000 position:50% align:center
I have a message
for you from him:

00:24:19.084 --> 00:24:20.001 position:50% align:center
Hi, Mr. Ayano...

00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:22.337 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
"Thank Hasegawa for this."

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.798 position:50% align:center
But I'm calling about Mr. Ikuto.

00:24:24.881 --> 00:24:27.175 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:24:27.258 --> 00:24:28.968 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Tsumura,

00:24:29.052 --> 00:24:31.680 position:50% align:center
do you remember the
first time that we met?

00:24:31.763 --> 00:24:33.848 position:50% align:center
Months ago?

00:24:33.932 --> 00:24:35.517 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Yes.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.977 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] Will you let
me fulfill my promise?

00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:40.689 position:50% align:center
Remember the one
we made that day?

00:24:40.772 --> 00:24:42.190 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:24:44.734 --> 00:24:47.320 position:50% align:center
I'd like to buy the
design for this outfit.

00:24:47.404 --> 00:24:50.323 position:50% align:center
If you'll let me, that is.

00:24:50.407 --> 00:24:53.326 position:50% align:center
I'll give you two million yen.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:54.911 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
That's too much.

00:24:54.994 --> 00:24:57.163 position:50% align:center
I can't accept it.

00:24:57.247 --> 00:24:58.540 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Top designers get up to

00:24:58.623 --> 00:25:00.917 position:50% align:center
hundreds of millions
for their designs.

00:25:01.001 --> 00:25:03.795 position:50% align:center
I'd say this is a fair amount.

00:25:03.878 --> 00:25:10.176 position:50% align:center
President, can I... ask you...

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.722 position:50% align:center
Do you think that I could
become a fashion designer?

00:25:13.805 --> 00:25:17.475 position:50% align:center
[KENJI chuckles] To tell you
the truth, at this point,

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:19.894 position:50% align:center
I'd be shocked if you didn't.

00:25:22.522 --> 00:25:26.443 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Tsumura, can I rely on you?

00:25:26.526 --> 00:25:29.946 position:50% align:center
Will you talk to Chiyuki for me?

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.908 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:25:33.992 --> 00:25:34.743 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:36.494 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Miss Chiyuki!

00:25:37.954 --> 00:25:39.789 position:50% align:center
Hi!

00:25:39.873 --> 00:25:42.792 position:50% align:center
How would you feel about
modeling in my show?

00:25:45.045 --> 00:25:49.257 position:50% align:center
Jeez, way to twist my arm.

00:27:24.602 --> 00:27:27.564 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Why do you always
show up like this?

00:27:27.647 --> 00:27:31.735 position:50% align:center
I don't get why, but your
words always save me.

00:27:31.818 --> 00:27:33.820 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Next time, "Rivals."
