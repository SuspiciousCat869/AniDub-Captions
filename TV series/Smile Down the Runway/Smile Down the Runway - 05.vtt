00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.437 position:50% align:center
I so didn't mean to
drag you into this.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.439 position:50% align:center
Don't even worry about it.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:47.774 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to wait here with you

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:50.485 position:50% align:center
till the trains
start running again.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.987 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:56.825 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Of course.

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
I mean, I feel like you
might've been better off

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.789 position:50% align:center
if you'd just gone to
a cafÃ© by yourself instead.

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:04.165 position:50% align:center
It's my fault.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.960 position:50% align:center
Hey now, it's no big deal!

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.840 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Come through,
communication skills!

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.341 position:50% align:center
You're drowning here.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50% align:center
Say something, Ikuto!
Change the subject!

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.096 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.889 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Uh.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.558 position:50% align:center
Uh, hello?

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sorry,
the trains are delayed.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.395 position:50% align:center
But I'll be home soon.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.397 position:50% align:center
Yup, I'm good.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.066 position:50% align:center
Okay, see ya in a bit.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
Little sister.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.820 position:50% align:center
She gets kinda
worried if I'm late.

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center
Aw, you have a younger sister?

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.657 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I do.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.784 position:50% align:center
I have three siblings, total.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.912 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO gasps] Really?
I have three siblings, too!

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
Wow. This is a
real first for me!

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:48.376 position:50% align:center
I've never known another
family with four kids before!

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.130 position:50% align:center
Yeah? I guess I haven't
known one either.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO, KOKORO]
Ready, go.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
--[IKUTO] I'm the oldest!
--[KOKORO] Second-oldest!

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] Well, it's a shame
we don't have that in common.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.848 position:50% align:center
It feels good to
connect with someone.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
I've just started school and
it all feels a little daunting.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.521 position:50% align:center
I was really nervous about
interning for Mr. Yanagida.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
Not just about my skills, but
also working with new people.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
But now I have one less
thing to worry about!

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
Miss Kokoro,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
are you aiming to become
both a model and a designer?

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:26.873 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Shoot, why did I ask that?

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
It looks like it's a really
sensitive topic for her.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
My dream <i>was</i> to become a model.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:42.389 position:50% align:center
But I got super nervous
at my first fashion show

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
and I wasn't sure
if I could do it.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
Then, the brand's designer
walked up to me.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
[MAI] Just move your
legs and keep walking,

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
as if you were
strolling around town.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
I want you to breathe

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
and let my clothes
lead you down the runway.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
And...

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
...her words truly inspired me.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:06.162 position:50% align:center
So much so, in fact, that
now... my dream is designing.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm at Geika.

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
What a story.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
The designer sounds
pretty wonderful, too.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
So, uh, can I ask whose show it
was that you walked in that day?

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, she's
actually pretty famous.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
She was at the exhibition, too.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
Her name is Mai Ayano,
do you know her?

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
The Mai Ayano?

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
So Miss Kokoro's
first-ever fashion show

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
was with the top
designer in all of Japan?

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.573 position:50% align:center
Incredible.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
She's been a real inspiration.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Miss Kokoro must
be a truly talented model.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
Welcome to... the Geika
Festival information session!

00:04:56.588 --> 00:05:00.342 position:50% align:center
My goodness, don't you all
look focused and ready!

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
Let's just jump right into it,
shall we? Here we go!

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
Now, I'd like to
start by explaining

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
what the winner of this year's
grand prize will receive!

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
The victor gets to
launch their own brand!

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
Also, they'll get
to study in Paris!

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] Okay, that pretty
much covers everything.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
The preliminaries will
be starting next week!

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
So see you then!

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Paris. That would be a dream.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
Especially for someone like me.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA]
Oh, Ikuto!

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Hm?

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
Now then, tell me
about your helper, Kokoro.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Sorry?
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] She's not exactly
the strongest player, is she?

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
But listen, that
girl's got potential.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
You'll see, she has
this way of mastering

00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
everything she's taught
by the very next day.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
Take care of Kokoro
for me. Will you do that?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Stop it! You're coming with me.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
You're done playing
the schoolgirl.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I'm sorry.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Huh?

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Quit being such a brat!

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
Miss Kokoro?

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.382 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] Your apologies
aren't good enough.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
What are you doing to her?!

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
Well, well. You are?

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:33.226 position:50% align:center
Good question. Who are you?

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] That model?
I happen to manage her.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
You're her manager?

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.860 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Like I said, Hasegawa...

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
...take care of it.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
You officially have
until the end of the month

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.741 position:50% align:center
to quit this school.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
You can't make her quit!

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] This is none
of your business, kid.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Miss Kokoro
and I work together.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure why you're
telling her to stop, but--

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
This girl here is the
hope of our agency.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
She's a 181 centimeters tall
and her inseam measures 93.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
So, you see,
she's a real treasure.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:13.099 position:50% align:center
We can't possibly afford to
lose her to some stupid fantasy.

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
That's absurd!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Hardly.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
Give it up. You'll never be
a designer--it's impossible.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
Know what I think?

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
You're just pretending
you're interested in design

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
because you're bored

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
and you think you don't
wanna be a model anymore.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
It's disrespectful to those

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:33.912 position:50% align:center
who are actually pursuing
that challenging career path.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No. I'm really...

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
What?

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
If you have something
to say, then do it. Speak.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Just... I'm sorry.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
Miss Kokoro.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What's this?

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Is that it?

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Hello?

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.046 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry that you
had to come all this way.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.173 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Oh, it's no big deal.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.803 position:50% align:center
So, uh, did you read
what I wrote inside?

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Uh, I apologize. I just... uh...

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:37.976 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
When I was first starting
out at the modeling agency...

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] ...I was scared
of the other models.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
You should've heard the things

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
they said to me
at my first show.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
"When I look at you,
I feel like quitting,"

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
or, "Be happy you don't have to
work as hard as everyone else."

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
I totally dreaded changing
in front of everyone.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
My mind would draw a blank when
I sensed people's eyes on me.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
I was terrified.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
That's why...
I couldn't deny it.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
You'll never be a designer...

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
You're just pretending
you're interested

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:11.760 position:50% align:center
in design because
you're bored...

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
It's disrespectful to those

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
who are actually pursuing
that challenging career path.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
What my manager said was right.
Modeling's all I can really do.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:29.027 position:50% align:center
I'm not the type of person
who becomes a designer!

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]

Maybe you're working
a little too hard.

Not at all.

Design an outfit for
the doll in front of you.

what the theme should be
for the big challenge today,

to keep it simple.

knowing what Miss Sara's

this for, or when, or why.

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
Will you please
tell me her name?

00:16:56.641 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
Being friendly and expressing
gratitude are different things.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
She stood up for me
when she didn't have to.

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50% align:center
I want to thank her properly.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE]
It's Kaoru Kizaki.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
And now...

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 5B]
I feel so bad for him.

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:19.330 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] ...no one will
ever have to pity me again!

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
No more! I won't let it happen!

'Kay, time's up!

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO] From this point,
you're on your own.

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
As for the participation fee...

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center
...that's your budget.

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:35.055 position:50% align:center
Use it to purchase the fabric
you need for your design.

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
These sure don't
come cheap, do they?

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way,
I told that kid your name.

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
What? Why would you?

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] He seriously
gets on your nerves, huh?

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
Not really.

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
I'm frustrated with
more than just him.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
I'm annoyed with
every single person

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
who destroyed Mr. Hajime's show.

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:02.374 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] If it weren't for
that pint-sized waif,

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't have
needed to change

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
the whole thing last second.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
So between the model,
her foolish management company,

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.258 position:50% align:center
and that dress-ruining kid,

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
I'm holding them
all responsible.

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:17.013 position:50% align:center
Every single one.

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE]
I see.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
...I'm not about trying
to stand in people's way

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.729 position:50% align:center
or anything stupid like that.

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
I just want to defeat him...
totally fair and square.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not like I want
to lose here, you know.

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
Guess it's time to put on
my game face. Bring it.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.370 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
What a relief.

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
If the budget comes from
the participation fee,

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
then my own money
will be plenty for this!

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
I can give 5,000 back to Honoka.

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
So that's my budget to
make something stylish

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
in Miss Sara's eyes.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
Let me see...

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I know!

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Patchwork!

The method where
you sew together

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
various pieces of fabric
to form a new design.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.484 position:50% align:center
I can buy cheap scraps of fabric

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
and build my piece
with patchwork!

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
It's, like...

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:19.409 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
...basically my specialty!

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center

It's fashion on the cheap!

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
Hey, look, he's still here.

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
Hold on, why does
he look so pale?

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
This outfit's not going to work.

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center

I'm sorry.

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
But I have to head home.

[STUDENT 5A]
Is he running away?

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:58.406 position:50% align:center
How disappointing. He was
just an amateur after all.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
It wasn't a bad idea.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
But there's no way I
could've designed something

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
Miss Sara would actually
like using fabric

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
made from such cheap materials!

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
I'd better ask for help.

Oh, hey. What's up?

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
Emergency! Tell me
about Miss Sara!

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
Okay. That's kind of random.

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] If I learn
more about who she is,

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
then I can make a better outfit!

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm still confused,
but sure, I'll bite.

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center

I'm so sorry to bother you!

[CHIYUKI]
Want some slippers?

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh! I'll leave that
up to you to decide!

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Weird.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
She wears heels inside?

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make sense.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
She's barely
wearing anything else!

00:20:57.549 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
So do you want to check out
Miss Sara's old runway footage?

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
I've recorded a few
variety shows, too.

Are you listening?

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, yeah!

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Hmm... Well,
the variety show, it is.

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
That way, you'll be able
to see her transformation.

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
So... question:

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
Why exactly do you wear heels
around the house, Miss Chiyuki?

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
Practicing to get
used to them, duh.

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
All right. Here it is.

[TV HOST 5A]
Tell me, Sara, is it true that

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
you choose every
outfit you wear on TV?

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
That's right! I do!

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
I think about fashion
24 hours a day!

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
I can't help it.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Miss Sara's
a celebrity who's known

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
for her fun,
easy-going personality.

[SARA]
Are you kidding? Of course not!

00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
Why would I?

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Apparently,
she became popular both because

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:48.058 position:50% align:center
of her beauty and her
occasional blunt comments.

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.102 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Um, Miss Chiyuki.

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center

[IKUTO]
Could you...?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.316 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
And... there!

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:01.988 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I can't concentrate
with her like this!

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:04.240 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Could you stop that for now?

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:07.243 position:50% align:center
No way, dude. It's part
of my daily training.

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:09.496 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] It's just,
my eyes keep wandering.

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
What? Just focus on the TV.

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:14.084 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
She's right!

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:15.460 position:50% align:center
The reason you get distracted

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.754 position:50% align:center
is because you're not giving
it your full attention.

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:19.547 position:50% align:center
All right! One, two!

00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:21.007 position:50% align:center
One, two!

00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:22.550 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
What am I doing?

00:22:22.634 --> 00:22:25.720 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Keep it up.
It'll help you focus better.

00:22:25.804 --> 00:22:28.306 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
This is tougher than it looks.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.433 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Y'know,
Miss Sara does this exercise

00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:32.018 position:50% align:center
to maintain her figure, too.

00:22:32.102 --> 00:22:33.269 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:34.688 position:50% align:center
Would you look at her?

00:22:34.771 --> 00:22:37.691 position:50% align:center
She's always cheesing and
making those silly jokes.

00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:39.109 position:50% align:center
I'll tell ya one thing.

00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:42.237 position:50% align:center
The Miss Sara on TV is
different from the one I know.

00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:47.033 position:50% align:center
On the runway, she's a stoic.

00:22:47.117 --> 00:22:48.910 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:50.995 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
She's kind of like an actor.

00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:54.791 position:50% align:center
Each time she walks in a show,
she plays a different role.

00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:56.126 position:50% align:center
Most designers make clothes

00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:58.878 position:50% align:center
for a specific person they
envision in their minds.

00:22:58.962 --> 00:23:00.588 position:50% align:center
An ideal.

00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:04.843 position:50% align:center
The model's job is to embody
that ideal on the runway.

00:23:04.926 --> 00:23:09.097 position:50% align:center
Of course, some models get by
on their powerful personalities.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.433 position:50% align:center
But the best can
manipulate their stride,

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:13.893 position:50% align:center
their arm movements,
their waist, shoulders,

00:23:13.977 --> 00:23:17.814 position:50% align:center
and at times, even
their head, masterfully.

00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:19.774 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:23:19.858 --> 00:23:23.194 position:50% align:center
All to achieve that ideal
image the designer demands.

00:23:23.278 --> 00:23:26.906 position:50% align:center
Although... what's
impressive about Miss Sara

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.366 position:50% align:center
is how she can somehow perform

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.745 position:50% align:center
the same exact walk with
heels of all different heights.

00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:33.288 position:50% align:center
She was able to
acquire that skill

00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:35.373 position:50% align:center
with a whole lot of training.

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:38.585 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Know why she did it?

00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:42.422 position:50% align:center
Her height's 171--

00:23:42.505 --> 00:23:46.176 position:50% align:center
which is considered pretty
short for a runway model.

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:48.887 position:50% align:center
A small model with
world recognition.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.472 position:50% align:center
When I think about Miss Sara,

00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:53.266 position:50% align:center
she seems like
the key to my path!

00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:58.646 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
See? Just look at her walk.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.692 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Miss Chiyuki's
recreating her steps for me.

00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:06.112 position:50% align:center
On the middle of the rug
running down the hall,

00:24:06.196 --> 00:24:09.532 position:50% align:center
she traces the straight
line of imprints perfectly

00:24:09.616 --> 00:24:12.285 position:50% align:center
as she strides
in her high heels.

00:24:14.287 --> 00:24:16.956 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] If I compare her
with the model onscreen,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.708 position:50% align:center
I see no difference
in the performance

00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:21.086 position:50% align:center
of the girl in front of me--

00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:25.215 position:50% align:center
this passionate,
158 centimeter model.

00:24:28.593 --> 00:24:30.679 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] So? Did you
find out anything helpful?

00:24:30.762 --> 00:24:32.931 position:50% align:center
Oh! For sure!

00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:35.016 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I definitely did!

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.310 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I didn't, to be honest.

00:24:37.394 --> 00:24:40.230 position:50% align:center
Hey, by the way, if you
don't mind me asking...

00:24:40.313 --> 00:24:43.483 position:50% align:center
Uh, are you about
to skip town or what?

00:24:43.566 --> 00:24:45.318 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Oh.

00:24:45.402 --> 00:24:50.031 position:50% align:center
On our next three-day weekend,
I'm planning on going to Paris.

00:24:50.115 --> 00:24:52.409 position:50% align:center
Paris?

00:24:52.492 --> 00:24:54.160 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
The thing is, models have to

00:24:54.244 --> 00:24:56.705 position:50% align:center
put themselves out there
if they want to get work.

00:24:56.788 --> 00:24:59.541 position:50% align:center
So this is my way
of taking action!

00:24:59.624 --> 00:25:01.001 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Amazing.

00:25:01.084 --> 00:25:02.794 position:50% align:center
While I, on the other hand,

00:25:02.877 --> 00:25:06.965 position:50% align:center
can't seem to get myself out
of this stupid creative block.

00:25:08.341 --> 00:25:09.551 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Look at her.

00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:13.138 position:50% align:center
She's trying so hard
to make her dream happen.

00:25:14.889 --> 00:25:16.349 position:50% align:center
Ikuto?

00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:22.147 position:50% align:center
Hey, you look tired.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.150 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're working
a little too hard.

00:25:27.902 --> 00:25:29.821 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:32.532 position:50% align:center
Where did that come
from all of a sudden?!

00:25:32.615 --> 00:25:35.201 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Huh? Look, you're
the one being weird here.

00:25:35.285 --> 00:25:36.453 position:50% align:center
Are you getting enough sleep?

00:25:36.536 --> 00:25:39.039 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Yes, okay?
I'm getting enough sleep!

00:25:39.122 --> 00:25:41.332 position:50% align:center
Besides-- [gasps]

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.420 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:25:45.503 --> 00:25:47.922 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
That's it. I've got it.

00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:49.507 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:54.095 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I've finally got an idea!

00:27:24.644 --> 00:27:27.063 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Ikuto, you have to win.

00:27:27.147 --> 00:27:30.650 position:50% align:center
After all, I only want to
compete with the best.

00:27:30.734 --> 00:27:33.945 position:50% align:center
Next time, "Superiority
and Inferiority."
