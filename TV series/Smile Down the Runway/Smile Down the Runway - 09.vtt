[CHIYUKI]
In Paris and Milan,

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.931 position:50% align:center
many brands hold open auditions
for their Fashion Week shows.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center
Anybody can try out.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.353 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] If they want,
a designer might even pick

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.314 position:50% align:center
a total novice to strut
for them on the runway.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
All you need is a good figure.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
Of course, that includes height.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.530 position:50% align:center
When it's your turn,

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
they have you walk in
front of the designer.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.326 position:50% align:center
Usually for about ten meters.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
I went to dozens of open calls.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.205 position:50% align:center
Forget ten meters.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
None of them let me
walk two steps.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
[speaking French]

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
"Oh, my goodness,
if you're a model,

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50% align:center
then an elementary schooler
could be a top model in France."

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.933 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Guess there's just no demand for

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
"new model on the scene,
Chiyuki Fujito."

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.689 position:50% align:center
None.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:05.690 position:50% align:center
[CAMERAMAN A]
You're ruining the balance.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
Could you go ahead and step out?

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
A shooting crew.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
You can't go to Paris...

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.446 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
My own dad.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.782 position:50% align:center
Even the one I admire most.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
They've all given up on me.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.994 position:50% align:center
So then, why?

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.705 position:50% align:center
Why do you always
show up like this?

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.957 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Miss Chiyuki!

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.669 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Right when
I'm needing you the most.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:29.673 position:50% align:center
How would you feel about
modeling in my show?

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:34.302 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Way to twist my arm.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:36.221 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
How do you do it?

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:41.685 position:50% align:center
I don't get why, but your
words always save me.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.312 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]
Are you okay?

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.398 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Man, what is it with you?

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.442 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI sniffs]
You throw me off.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center
Do you mind if I sit
next to you for a while?

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.739 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Yes.

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.417 position:50% align:center
When I went to Paris,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.460 position:50% align:center
I knew that it was a long shot,

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.672 position:50% align:center
so it seems silly
to let it get to me.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:14.009 position:50% align:center
But I met this amazing
model a little while back.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:19.472 position:50% align:center
Her aura was incredible, but she
didn't even want to be a model.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:21.766 position:50% align:center
I was so jealous.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.770 position:50% align:center
I think I've been dragging
that around with me ever since.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:28.606 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
What?

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
It's just... kind of a first.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.360 position:50% align:center
I've never heard you complain.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:34.863 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well, never again!

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:38.158 position:50% align:center
What? I didn't mean
anything weird by it!

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it adds to your charm.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.582 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Why?!

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
[KANAMI]
Hey, Toh?

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
I got the materials.
We're all set for the final.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.635 position:50% align:center
Very good.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.056 position:50% align:center
Right then.
Let's get started.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
[bell ringing]

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] So this is the timeline
leading up to the show.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
For my theme,
I'm going with "Wind."

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
How does that relate to "wa"?

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
I admit, it's a
pretty abstract idea.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
But as long as there's any
connection, it's allowed.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
So you're going to make
a total of ten outfits, huh?

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
Just to clarify,

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
this being an
actual show and all,

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
I can't be the
only model you use.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.637 position:50% align:center
How are you handling that?

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
The others?

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Ya know, you're the one who

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
inspired me to choose
"wind" as my theme.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI grunts]

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
With typhoons,

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
the lower the atmospheric
pressure is in the center,

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
the stronger the wind blows.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.072 position:50% align:center
Wait, "lower"?

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
Is that a reference
to my height?!

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.700 position:50% align:center
Please, just listen!

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
You're relentless
like a typhoon

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
despite what anyone
else says about you.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
But you're also quick
to support others

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
like a wind at their back,

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
with all the comfort
of a warm breeze.

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
Right? Doesn't that
sound just like you?

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
You're the star of
my show, Miss Chiyuki.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
I'd love your opinion on it.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
Feel free to let it rip!

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:53.436 position:50% align:center
First, use top-notch
models, 'kay?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
So I can outshine them.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
Will do!

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
By the way, I'm already
finished with the toile mockups.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center
Do you feel like trying them on?

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Sure, why not.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'll be back in a sec.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Right, I'll have to thank him.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center
After all, he sure knows how
to make a girl feel important.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
Wait, you do realize
this thing doesn't fit?

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
Or do I need to remind you
that this is what happens

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
when you don't
take measurements?

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I know that!

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
But I didn't wanna make
things awkward, so...

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
[heart pounding]

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
You silly nerd.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
You asked me to help you
and I said I'd do you a favor.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
Didn't I?

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
C'mon, take my measurements!

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
So, let me get to work!

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
If you wanna go pro, you need
to get used to this stuff!

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
AH! Okay, okay. Jeez.
Stripping down out of nowhere!

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
Do you think you could
at least turn around?

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.879 position:50% align:center
Don't get too excited.
You might have high hopes for me

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
but there's a chance
I won't measure up.

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
I'm stepping out.

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:11.973 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Hm?

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:13.767 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Once you finish up with that,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
you're free to call it a night.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
Ah! Thank you very much!

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME grunts]

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] So... what ever
happened with Mr. Yanagida?

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
I haven't been
able to contact him.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
Okay, then I'll call him myself.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 9] The number you
have dialed is currently

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
unavailable. Please try
your call again later.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure that means
he blocked you.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] What? Wow,
that actually hurts.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.725 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Things are
that bad between you guys?

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center
Well, I thought
things were okay,

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
which was all thanks
to my colleague, but...

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Hey, tell me
more about that person.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
Who is it?

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:09.906 position:50% align:center
You've mentioned them before,
so now I'm kinda curious.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.741 position:50% align:center
She really loves
to make clothes,

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
but people are very against it.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
Still, she's worked
incredibly hard.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
She's improved a ton
and even made the finals.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
So her hard work is paying off!

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
I guess it's not a myth!

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt she's out
there doing that right now.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
She knows she
won't truly be seen

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
unless she gives it her all.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ikuto.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
The thing about me...
is that more than anything,

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
I want to prove people wrong.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
People like my dad and
this woman named Shizuku.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
Is there anyone
like that for you?

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it...
Yeah, there is.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Good. Then let's show 'em...

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
...together!

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Yes!

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
No... How did we end up here?

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
I told you, it's best not to
let a fight drag on like this.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
Besides, if you're aren't
on top of your game,

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
you won't be able to
bring it to the festival.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
So get it together.

I'm sorry.

--[IKUTO] Please don't make me.

[CHIYUKI]
Chin up! Don't hunch like that!

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Look, I'm not in
the right headspace for this!

How do you... both...?

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.413 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Miss Kokoro!

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for causing
you so much trouble!

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.834 position:50% align:center
And, uh...

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
I want to introduce
you to my friend!

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
This is Miss Chiyuki Fujito.
She'll be modeling for my show.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.675 position:50% align:center
Ikuto.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.593 position:50% align:center
This is her.

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
The amazing model
I told you about before.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.557 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Sorry for barging in like this.

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
Is Mr. Yanagida here?

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:04.229 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO grunts] No, he's
actually gone right now.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:07.774 position:50% align:center
And I'm afraid I'm heading
out for a shoot, too. Sorry.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I see.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you
better get going, then.

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
Let's come back, Ikuto.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
Sorry, again.

[KOKORO]
Mr. Ikuto.

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.495 position:50% align:center
I'm happy that you came by.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
I'll give you
a call later, okay?

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
She really loves
to make clothes,

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:33.883 position:50% align:center
but people are very against it.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
She's worked incredibly hard.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
I'm serious about
becoming a real designer!

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
Are you... good?

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Sorry, Ikuto.
I'm going after her.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're what?

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] I'm so frustrated.
If you're serious...

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
If you're serious,
then stand up for yourself!

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
Just get in the car.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Hey!

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
May I? It'll only
take one minute.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:11.504 position:50% align:center
[grunts] I'm not letting
you get mixed up in this.

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
I see absolutely
no benefit to it.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
You know that your
dressmaking skills

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
will never surpass your
talent as a model, right?

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.139 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Well, here's an idea.

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
Just give her one shot.
One shot to be a designer.

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
Why don't you shut it, shrimp?

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
Look, what you're saying is
not even worth considering.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
Tsumura, you actually get to
design and you choose her?

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
I admit, I'm surprised.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.447 position:50% align:center
Seems like you're no longer
in need of money, though,

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
so good for you.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
What? All I did was suggest that

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
he ask Hasegawa to
model for his show.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.413 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
How could you?!

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
The offer still stands, too.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
Be smart--use
Hasegawa as your model.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
"Short n' Sassy" over here
will only screw it up for you.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
Might as well give it
your best shot, right?

00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
After all, you risked your
mother's health for this show.

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.347 position:50% align:center
Now I'm really mad.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
Fine, if you truly believe
talent is everything...

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
Okay! So what if she
shows talent as a designer?

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't have a problem if
she quit modeling then, right?

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
If she used a model like me
and still achieved results,

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:19.197 position:50% align:center
she'd be a genius
then, wouldn't she?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
Ikuto, got it?

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
Yes! So let's go show them!

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I just know.

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:32.002 position:50% align:center
My manager will never
approve of me. Not ever.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful and
so glad I didn't give up!

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
...together!

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
More than anything,
I want to prove people wrong.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
It's settled. I'll be
the model for her show.

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Thank you, Ikuto.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
But now?

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
We're rivals.

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center
Miss Hasegawa, you better
prepare for the worst.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Mr. Ikuto, um...

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
If I end up succeeding,
will you still speak to me?

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
You expect me to support
this? A reckless gamble?

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
Fine, but if you
don't achieve results,

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.267 position:50% align:center
you'll agree to quit
school and focus on modeling.

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
That seems pretty fair, right?

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:31.978 position:50% align:center
Hasegawa?

[gasps]

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
I'll only let go if
you win the finals.

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
You'll have to be that good.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
Get to the top, even if that
means defeating your friend.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
If you want out,
you better show me your resolve.

Yes. I will.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
What do I do?

Chiyuki so now I've got nothing.

not be thinking of

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center
losing on purpose or anything.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
I want this. I want
a real competition with you.

So don't hold back.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:19.734 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
I would never cheat
them out of that.

then why didn't he tell
us in the first place?

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
I don't know, maybe because

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
that's our duty
as patternmakers?!

Go home without me.

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:48.656 position:50% align:center
You know, there's no need
for you to be so flustered.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
And there's no point in killing
yourself over this competition.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
Not just to beat my record.

00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
If you want to go independent,
do that whenever you want.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
Thank you for that. Very kind.

it isn't that easy.

I'll always be the grandchild

I refuse to
disrespect your name.

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
So, I won't go out there
with mediocre skills.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
I would never do that.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
Do you really still call me
"the world's top designer"?

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, because you are.

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center

because I don't want
to have any regrets.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
Seriously! That's enough!

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO laughs]
Well, the operation went well

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
and I'm recovering just fine.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
After this, I'll be 100% cured!

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
So I'll never have to
be hospitalized again.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.685 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
I can tell, y'know...

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
...just like always.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:01.938 position:50% align:center
Ikuto.

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.566 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
Nope. Nothing at all.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] When Mr. Ayano
told me I had no talent...

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
...I felt broken.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
Then, when I was asked
to sell my design,

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
I wanted, more than ever,
to become a designer.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
After that,

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
I felt excited and
inspired when I was asked

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
if there was anyone
I wanted to prove wrong.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
But no matter what my goals are,

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
there's no way they're worth
ruining Miss Kokoro's future.

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
Who cares about getting
back at that rich jerk,

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
or winning some
silly competition?

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
My ego can wait.

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ikuto.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor
and read that will.

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Right now, I'm
honestly just so happy that

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
I get to be part of
the show at all.

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
It lists everything
I want to do before I die.

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
I remember, you were
only six-years old

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
when you started to sew.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
But you were able to design
the café's apron at seven.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
That's also the age you were

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
when you first said you
wanted to become a designer.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
You stopped saying that
at 15. Then suddenly,

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:19.599 position:50% align:center
you started saying it was
what you wanted again...

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:21.685 position:50% align:center
...this year.

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:23.728 position:50% align:center
So, my son...

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
I wanted to make sure the family
could come and support you.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
You will be!

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
I know it!

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO inhales]

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Will you really be
recovered by the Geika Festival?

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO chuckles]
Hey, don't you underestimate me!

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:50.880 position:50% align:center
I'll be skipping
over there by then.

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I can't lose.

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I have to give it my all.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
'Kay. First things first.

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
I need to come up
with a new concept.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make sense to use

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
the Miss Chiyuki-inspired
"wind" theme anymore.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
It needs to relate to "wa."

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
Wa, wa, wa.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
[pencil scratching]

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:23.371 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
The equal sign is called "wa"!

00:19:23.455 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
Those look like pants!

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
Hey, I got it!

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center
The theme is equality--
No, harmony.

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
And I'll feature pants that
blend men's and women's styles!

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.176 position:50% align:center
Can I do this?

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
Am I capable of seeing

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
Miss Chiyuki and Miss
Kokoro as real rivals?

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm not sure.

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
But I can totally picture this:
A person walking down

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
the runway wearing
these clothes.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
Miss Chiyuki takes it in.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
And smiles as she says,
"You really did it".

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
I'd be so happy.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center

All right. It's done.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center

already time to go to Geika.

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center

model request form!

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Ugh. I'm so nervous.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:24.057 position:50% align:center
I know I caught a glimpse
of his face earlier.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
What if I run into him now?

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I knew it!

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:34.901 position:50% align:center
But I mean, he did help
me out. That's a fact.

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
So I should thank him at least.

Um, excuse me, sir!

Oh, Ikuto.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I didn't notice you.

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
It's, um...

00:20:56.256 --> 00:21:00.010 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but something seems
kind of different about you.

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.220 position:50% align:center
Is it because I'm not
a patternmaker now?

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
Is that what it's about?

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
Well, who knows, right?

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:09.394 position:50% align:center

Now I get it.

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
I think I know why
I keep seeing his face

you wrong, Mr. Ayano.

than most of the others are!

ever join your team?!

Okay, well, that was needlessly
harsh, but I understand.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.412 position:50% align:center
I'll only work under
certain people.

00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:11.748 position:50% align:center
They gotta be more advanced

[IKUTO gasps]

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE]
First, I absorb their technique,

00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
their aesthetics,
everything about them.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.631 position:50% align:center
Then when the time
is finally right,

00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:21.549 position:50% align:center
I crush them!

afraid you just don't qualify.

you wrong, Mr. Ayano.

So that's why.

00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:59.004 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE sighs] Well... Guess
it's not a bad idea to use you

as a punching bag
to relieve my stress.

[IKUTO]
Great!

00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:15.186 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I've focused my
entire collection on pants.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.479 position:50% align:center
That's why I wanted your help,

00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:19.232 position:50% align:center
since you major
in men's clothing.

00:23:22.444 --> 00:23:24.988 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE]
These are totally mediocre.

00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:27.907 position:50% align:center
No surprise there,
he's in high school.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.952 position:50% align:center
Well, first, there are
many different types

00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:32.746 position:50% align:center
of pants out there.

00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:34.706 position:50% align:center
But all of them originate...

00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:36.166 position:50% align:center
...from slacks.

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:37.709 position:50% align:center
Which, in case you didn't know,

00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:40.462 position:50% align:center
are actually just suit pants
with a pleat down the middle.

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:43.548 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
His drawing's amazing.

00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:46.176 position:50% align:center
So really, as far as
men's fashion goes,

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:48.553 position:50% align:center
everything comes back to this.

00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:50.555 position:50% align:center
Will you teach me
how to make slacks?

00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:53.016 position:50% align:center
I'd love to learn from you.

00:23:54.768 --> 00:23:57.228 position:50% align:center
Try not to focus too much on
the body's natural curves

00:23:57.312 --> 00:23:59.397 position:50% align:center
and draw straight lines instead!

00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:01.941 position:50% align:center
Masculine silhouettes tend
to be flatter than female ones,

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:03.485 position:50% align:center
so be careful!

00:24:03.568 --> 00:24:05.695 position:50% align:center

[RYUNOSUKE]
This guy.

00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:11.826 position:50% align:center
Usually, pants are made up from
four separate pieces of fabric.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.037 position:50% align:center
And since they're fitted
for constant motion,

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.956 position:50% align:center
they wrinkle incredibly easily.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.169 position:50% align:center
A simple garment that's
hard to perfect, and yet...

00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:22.671 position:50% align:center

flawless patterns

00:24:22.754 --> 00:24:24.756 position:50% align:center
for them like it's nothing!

00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:28.760 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Women's designs
incorporate curves,

00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:31.262 position:50% align:center
while men's designs
incorporate straight lines.

00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:33.807 position:50% align:center
So it's a totally
different approach.

00:24:35.058 --> 00:24:36.685 position:50% align:center
Oh, man.

00:24:36.768 --> 00:24:39.062 position:50% align:center
Now I wanna redo these.

00:24:39.396 --> 00:24:40.689 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:24:40.772 --> 00:24:42.816 position:50% align:center
Aren't you supposed to be
making ten whole pieces?

00:24:42.899 --> 00:24:44.901 position:50% align:center
You've only got
two weeks left, kid!

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:46.111 position:50% align:center
You'd better hurry--

00:24:46.194 --> 00:24:49.531 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Don't worry,
I know I've got this.

00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:53.118 position:50% align:center
Just to be sure,

00:24:53.201 --> 00:24:55.995 position:50% align:center
you're not planning on
joining my team, are you?

00:24:56.079 --> 00:24:57.747 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE gasps]

00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:01.584 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO chuckles]
Well, then...

00:25:01.668 --> 00:25:05.338 position:50% align:center
Since I'm on my own, I don't
even need to draw a design!

00:25:05.422 --> 00:25:07.340 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE gasps]

00:25:08.717 --> 00:25:10.802 position:50% align:center
You know, thanks to you,

00:25:10.885 --> 00:25:12.721 position:50% align:center
this is gonna be really fun.

00:25:12.804 --> 00:25:16.641 position:50% align:center
Finding "harmony" between
men's and women's clothing.

00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:17.809 position:50% align:center
"Harmony"?

00:25:17.892 --> 00:25:20.937 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's my theme.

00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:22.522 position:50% align:center
No, that's crazy.

00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:25.150 position:50% align:center
You and Toh Ayano
picked the same theme.

00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:26.443 position:50% align:center
What?

00:25:26.526 --> 00:25:28.528 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE] Knowing that,
will you change it?

00:25:30.572 --> 00:25:34.659 position:50% align:center
No way. It's a head-on fight!

00:25:34.743 --> 00:25:36.244 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE grunts]

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.623 position:50% align:center
Thank you for holding still.

00:25:40.707 --> 00:25:43.877 position:50% align:center
You can go ahead
and put your arms down.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.503 position:50% align:center
Why're you acting so weird?

00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:48.048 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Sorry,
didn't realize I was!

00:25:48.131 --> 00:25:50.800 position:50% align:center
It's fine, do whatever.

00:25:50.884 --> 00:25:53.136 position:50% align:center
I'm not trying to
be friendly here.

00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:58.224 position:50% align:center
Uh... Fine by me,
I don't blame you.

00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:01.478 position:50% align:center
It's not draping as
fluttery as I was hoping!

00:26:01.561 --> 00:26:04.397 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, I can
always put a slit in!

00:26:04.481 --> 00:26:06.149 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Anything I can help with?

00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:12.614 position:50% align:center
I still haven't even started
any of my summer homework yet!

00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:16.034 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Seriously? Fine, just this once!

00:26:17.702 --> 00:26:21.289 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] And now, it's
finally the end of summer.

00:26:21.373 --> 00:26:23.375 position:50% align:center
The second semester has begun.

00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:24.876 position:50% align:center
And now that you've
hopefully all rested up...

00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:26.920 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm low on finishing thread.

00:26:27.003 --> 00:26:30.632 position:50% align:center
Gotta buy some more
Kingspun number 120.

00:26:34.302 --> 00:26:36.930 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Tomorrow's the Geika Festival.

00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:38.807 position:50% align:center
So tonight...

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.517 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Tonight...

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.060 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Tonight...

00:26:42.143 --> 00:26:44.229 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
I can't sleep!

00:26:44.312 --> 00:26:45.897 position:50% align:center
I think this might look cuter

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.483 position:50% align:center
if I can layer the
fabric here, more like this.

00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:50.860 position:50% align:center
I'm low on the red rayon though!

00:26:50.944 --> 00:26:51.736 position:50% align:center
You need more?

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.113 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Yes, please!

00:26:53.196 --> 00:26:55.448 position:50% align:center
I'll get it. I'm the fastest
runner in this house,

00:26:55.532 --> 00:26:57.283 position:50% align:center
so you can leave it to me!

00:26:57.367 --> 00:27:00.120 position:50% align:center
No, I want some elegant
volume in the shoulders!

00:27:00.203 --> 00:27:02.330 position:50% align:center
We can't take off the
120 thread and satin,

00:27:02.414 --> 00:27:04.708 position:50% align:center
so you'll have to make it
work with just a pattern.

00:27:04.791 --> 00:27:07.919 position:50% align:center
Go bring outfits numbers six,
seven, and nine to me, quickly!

00:27:08.003 --> 00:27:10.505 position:50% align:center
Then I want you to go
help with the others!

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.595 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] This feeling of being
pressed with a deadline;

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.639 position:50% align:center
it's a familiar rush.

00:27:19.723 --> 00:27:22.350 position:50% align:center
I've made arrangements
for the lighting, sound,

00:27:22.434 --> 00:27:23.643 position:50% align:center
even the fitters.

00:27:23.727 --> 00:27:26.271 position:50% align:center
It's coming together.

00:27:26.354 --> 00:27:27.731 position:50% align:center
All of this...

00:27:27.814 --> 00:27:29.524 position:50% align:center
...every bit...

00:27:29.607 --> 00:27:31.985 position:50% align:center
...I learned from Mr. Yanagida.
