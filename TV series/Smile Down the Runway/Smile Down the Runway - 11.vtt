[CROWD clapping]

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:44.604 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Thank you so much!

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:50.402 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] So? What did
you think of his show?

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:52.779 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Hm?

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:55.281 position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn't too bad.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.411 position:50% align:center
I'm into clothes designed
with the wearer in mind.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:00.829 position:50% align:center
Igarashi...

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:03.206 position:50% align:center
...you're not getting soft
on me over there, are you?

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.041 position:50% align:center
It's just who I am.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:09.295 position:50% align:center
I'd hardly be a good manager
if I couldn't judge objectively.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.842 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:15.468 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.178 position:50% align:center
You know it's about
to start, right?

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50% align:center
Better make it quick.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.809 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Yes.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.854 position:50% align:center
Of course. Thank you very much.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:31.151 position:50% align:center
Yes, that'll work fine.
Her schedule is wide open.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.737 position:50% align:center
[STAFF clapping]

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.781 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO chuckles]

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.707 position:50% align:center
Calm down.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.752 position:50% align:center
So, hey! Is it okay
to talk to you guys now?

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.754 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.174 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.759 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
What?

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO chuckles]

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center
I'll be watching you
from the audience.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
Break a leg, 'kay?

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.225 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm off.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'll see you later!

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
Please, wait!

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
Thank you. Here's hopin'.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
Hey. My battery just died.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50% align:center
So would you mind recording
this one on your phone?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.086 position:50% align:center
You're downright cooperative.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.712 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
That little model of yours.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
She's never watched herself

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:37.550 position:50% align:center
walking down the
runway before, right?

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
It's about time for
her to see it for herself--

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
how out of place
she actually is.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
Do you really think they
stand any sort of chance?

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
Their first interaction
was a disaster.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:51.773 position:50% align:center
It's obvious their
personalities clash.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
A designer with questionable
talents and a desperate model

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
with no fondness for
the designer's work.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
What can you expect from
a last-minute mash-up like that?

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.827 position:50% align:center
You mention fondness.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50% align:center
Do you mean like the affection
you have for Lale Faun?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
Are you picking a fight now?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.965 position:50% align:center
Hey, check it out.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.763 position:50% align:center
Looks like they're
making preparations.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
Is something going on?

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
I saw how you stopped shaking
when Ikuto talked to you.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
It was obvious.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
No, it wasn't like that!

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
Would you gimme a break?

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
Look, you and I are a team,
but we're rivals, too.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
Don't forget about
our promise. Got it?

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
Now that we're a team, are
you okay with that? Honestly?

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Uh, of course!

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
Well, looks like
it was meant to be.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
So we'll make it work.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Huh, she's actually pretty nice.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center
I was worried she might be
standoffish, but she's not.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
Hey, you look like you're
not getting enough sleep.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Oh, no, I get plenty!

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Whatever.

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
I bet she even went to work
with those bags under her eyes.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
I know, I know.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
Her goal isn't modeling,
so who cares?

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
She really is so lovely.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
Small and dainty.
And so feminine.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:32.040 position:50% align:center
I wish I was, too.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
Maybe, then...

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'm just going to say it.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I'm still not
satisfied with the situation.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:46.054 position:50% align:center
What I want is to
best you on that runway.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
So I want you in the show.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hey! Would you listen?!

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh. I'm so sorry!

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.942 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
She fell asleep!

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
The competition's soon.
But now's not the time to fight.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
Take a breath and take the lead.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
The only reason I've been able
to go my own pace...

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
...is because
Ikuto led the way.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Where are you on production?

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
What's your plan for the show?

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
Come over. I can show you
everything at my apartment.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
No way.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
She prepared eight outfits for
someone 170 centimeters tall?

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
And still found time to
tailor each one of them

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
to my size overnight?

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
She's a hard worker with
talent and will-power.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
One thing's for sure.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:54.873 position:50% align:center
If she put this kind of
passion into modeling,

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
I'd be crushed.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
She'd be unbeatable.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen. We need to talk.

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
I want you to model in the show.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.258 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Huh?

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
No need to sugar coat it.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
She's the real deal.
She can handle anything.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
We can't win with these.
You'll need to remake them.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO gasps]
But...

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
I feel like my
brain can't keep up.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
All of these are too bland.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
If I walk the runway in these
outfits, it'll be a bore.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.827 position:50% align:center
So change the show plan now?

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.871 position:50% align:center
Do you have any
ideas, Miss Fujito?

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
As the designer,
that's your job.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50% align:center
If designing is what you want,
don't let anyone do it for you.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
Why're you doing this?!

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
Telling me to model!

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.845 position:50% align:center
Bossing me around as a designer!

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
I mean, wouldn't it defeat
the purpose if I modeled?

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
No, the show is
around the corner.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
I... I...

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
I just hate you
so much right now!

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.486 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
That's fine.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
I don't like you much either,
Miss Hasegawa.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
We can win.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
Not as friends,
but as collaborators.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Miss Fujito!

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.419 position:50% align:center
Tell me what you think
of this show plan!

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
I'm rejecting it.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
Here, I drafted a new one!

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
No dice.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
How about this?

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Nuh-uh.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
Ah! You're impossible.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.
These are a lot more fun.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
You think so? Really?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] The <i>waku waku</i>
theme's a good call.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
"Excitement." Looks good!

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
But...

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50% align:center
...with this plan, it's going
to put a lot more on you,

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.573 position:50% align:center
as the model.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
My ability as a clothes-maker
won't be enough to win.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
So...

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] I need your walk
to be mind-blowing!

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
I depend on your
brilliance to lift me up!

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.345 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Hey, enough
with that polite stuff.

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:16.306 position:50% align:center
Aren't you older than me?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
Besides, you're the boss.

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
You really don't need to do
that with models, you know.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
And you can count
on me for the walk.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
But...

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
...you better
design some clothes

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.030 position:50% align:center
that blow my mind,
too, Miss Designer.

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
Is that a deal?

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO gasps]

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Yeah, I'll do my best!

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
So I'm thinking this walk.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
Thoughts?

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Um...

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50% align:center
Could you emphasize the shape
of the clothes a bit more?

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
What about this?

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] Hmm, a little more
elegance in the lower body?

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50% align:center
How's this?

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
The lower body looks good,

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
but the upper body lacks energy.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI growls]

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hey!

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
Look at this shoulder.
It's still too tight.

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
This is the third
time that's happened.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I'll fix it right away.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
Try this on!

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
Check this.

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI, KOKORO]
Oh, good.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
She fixed it!

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] What? No! How do you
have a modeling gig tomorrow?!

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
We don't have that kinda time!

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
You know how crucial the day
before the show is!

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.968 position:50% align:center
I do. But my manager
said there's no way

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50% align:center
I'm going to get
out of this shoot.

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
Honestly, you're a
real piece of work.

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
Why're you so loyal to Igarashi?

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.102 position:50% align:center
She always treats you like crap.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Would you stop?!

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.814 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
...I'm grateful!

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
For a while, I couldn't book
anything, no matter how I tried.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:58.950 position:50% align:center
She helped me foster some
measure of confidence in myself.

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
On my first day as a model,

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
I showed up at
work wearing a suit,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.249 position:50% align:center
and Ms. Igarashi said...

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.877 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] You're serious
and you have great posture.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
Your limbs are long,
and your head is small.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
But your height is
your best feature.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
Women who look good in
suits make great models.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
She's the first
one who did that--

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
complimented what I
hated most about my body.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
That's why...

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
Fine, do what you want.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
But remember, it's on you
if we run out of time.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
Yes, I know. I won't
distract you, Chiyuki.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
Actually, do you think you
could please help me?

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
What? You gotta be kidding me!

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
You said you'd
stay out of my hair!

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
No, I'm sorry.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center
Why the heck didn't
you ask me earlier?

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
I was afraid to because
you said I was on my own.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Igarashi's more impressed

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
by talent than anything else.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
I need you to compete as
a model so I can beat you.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
That's why.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
If you would agree to walk,
I'll take any requests.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO gasps]

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
Okay, Chiyuki.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
Thing is... I need a favor.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Huh?

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
This is it.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:25.995 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Mm.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
[music plays]

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.672 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I know her.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.882 position:50% align:center
She was in that show!

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA]
That outfit seems rather simple

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center
to use as the opener.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.141 position:50% align:center
Anyway,

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
who are those
other people up there

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
and what on earth is
going on with that rack?

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.285 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA]
How fascinating!

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
They're actually
changing her on the runway.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I totally knew it!
Tough designer.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
It looks like she's
gonna make this model

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
walk for the entire collection.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.302 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] It's a dress that's
simple. Yet complex!

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
So she changes just by adding
and removing elements.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:29.309 position:50% align:center
Something that simple can
still have a big impact!

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
Awesome! So cool!

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
Could you make that?

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
I could try.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
The model completely transformed

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
without even showing
any bare skin!

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:43.948 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] Is she going to make
her work the whole show?

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:47.285 position:50% align:center
Dear Kokoro,
how did I miss this?

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
When did you get so bold?

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
Earlier, by lowering her center,

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
she was able to
move her hips and legs

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:58.129 position:50% align:center
in a way that really
emphasized the pleats.

00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
This time,
she stabilizes her core

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
to bring attention towards
the lines of her upper body.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
[KINU]
Impressive transformations.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
I can't believe that dress
from earlier is now a shirt.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
'Bout to change again.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
Whoever produced this line
is seriously hardcore.

00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
How relentless!

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
[SARA]
Walking is acting.

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
And on top of that, you have
to highlight specific features

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
of the outfit as you move.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:28.368 position:50% align:center
This model is acting out
distinctly different roles

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:32.622 position:50% align:center
in every outfit up there...
without a break.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
There's no way I'd ever
agree to do this show.

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Okay, we've made it this far.

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Consider this
your payback, Igarashi.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
Her eyes just met mine.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
She's not focused on the runway.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:53.768 position:50% align:center
She's going to fall. Watch.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center

[CHIYUKI]
Ah...

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:07.407 position:50% align:center
What was the walk
for the next outfit?

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI gasps]

[IKUTO, ICHIKA gasp]

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Now, I remember.

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
Well, setting aside whether
it'll be a good strut or not,

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
I don't think she could
ever mess up that bad.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.597 position:50% align:center
She's been committed
to practicing her walk

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
religiously ever
since she was little.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.062 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] I think she
understands more than anyone

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
how useless a model is if
she can't even get up there

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.941 position:50% align:center
and move as instructed.

00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
And on top of that...

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
...this collection is very fun.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] A walk that finds
harmony between

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
the energetic orange cardigan
and the elegant coat.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center
This one's playful.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Eventually,

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
she'll put her entire
focus on walking that runway.

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
See?

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Hmph.

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center

They're switching racks.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
So it's a different outfit now!

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center

Well, this sure is exciting.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
Just as their concept says.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
Good for them!

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.910 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Why hasn't anybody noticed?

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
That girl's at least ten
centimeters shorter

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
than every other model
here... And yet.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
Man! Awesome! Between
the outfits and the mood,

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
I'm really feeling this vibe!

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
[KINU]
Six variations?

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
I was already
impressed with the four

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
from the first half,

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
and now they've added even more!

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
Initially, they introduced

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
and removed pieces
for a softer look.

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
But in this second half,
they're slimming down

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
from an A-line to
an I-line silhouette.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
[KAZUYA] Objectively, all of
the designs are rather simple.

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.419 position:50% align:center
But they're so much fun.

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:28.965 position:50% align:center
Is it just me, though, or
does something feel strange?

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey, Sara!

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
Is there something off about
her? Does she seem short?

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
It's all a deception.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
She's made sure the fitters are
short, and the racks are low.

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
That's how she's able
to hide the model's height

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
and fool this whole place.

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
What an eyesore.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
I can't take any more
of this hopeless model

and incompetent designer.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
Hold on! You, of all people,
can't leave right now.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] The results
will speak for themselves.

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter if I'm around
to watch it happen or not.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
Stay here.

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
I mean it. I'll never forgive
you if you leave. Seriously.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.677 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
That's rich.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
You can only say that if
you're on the winning side.

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.016 position:50% align:center
She's starting to
lose momentum, see?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
She's done more than ten walks,

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
mainly in high
heels to compensate.

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
Look at her--she's barely
holding it together.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50% align:center
It's starting to be obvious.

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
I'm getting distracted.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] Nobody wants
to keep watching that model!

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Just like
that other time!

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center

Didn't I tell you?

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
Sometimes her aura is
surprisingly stunning.

[JUDGES gasping]

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
Her aura. How?

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
See? Do you now understand why

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
I've looked after her
this entire time?

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.482 position:50% align:center
I--

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] She just lacks
the height. That's all.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
That's why I can't bring
myself to tell her to quit.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
She's good.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:22.412 position:50% align:center
[SARA]
Wait a minute. This is nuts.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
What's someone at her level
doing at a college fashion show?

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.668 position:50% align:center
She's like the girls from Paris.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
I mean, her grace just
takes over the room!

Hey, Kokoro.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
I want you to add one more
outfit to the collection.

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
The concept is...

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO, CHIYUKI]
Wind.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] It's so fun,
I can hardly stand it!

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
I want to win!

[KOKORO, CHIYUKI]
More than that,

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
I want to prove them all wrong!

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
Who's that model?

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:18.385 position:50% align:center
All this time,
we didn't notice.

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
That model is so tiny.

[gasps]

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
But why? Makes no sense.

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:30.313 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
I need a favor, okay?

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hm?

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
If you do this thing for me,

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
then I'll agree to
walk the runway for you--

--[CHIYUKI] Name it.
--[KOKORO gasps]

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
Like I said,

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
if you'll walk,
then I'll take requests.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.160 position:50% align:center
I mean, within reason, anyway.

[KOKORO gasps]

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
Great.

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:54.337 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I'll win.

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:57.716 position:50% align:center
And we'll make you a designer.

[FUMIYO gasps]

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
Look at her.

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
What a beautiful figure.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
Far above the average person's.

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
But I've got to admit...

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
It's amazing that
we didn't notice

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
how short the other model was.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
Despite being small, she's
incredibly well-balanced.

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
Yes. Her presence
is really powerful.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50% align:center
She might be kind of small,
but she fills the whole room!

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.829 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] Chiyuki Fujito
reminds me of my past.

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
Just a mediocre child
with a hopeless dream.

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
That's why...

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:41.051 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] So, hey, Kokoro.
What's the favor?

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] I want to
make two more outfits.

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU gasps]
Igarashi.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
That's your suit.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
It's funny.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:56.566 position:50% align:center
The girl's been making clothes
for about half a year.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.193 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Ms. Igarashi.

00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:00.111 position:50% align:center
I'll be wearing
this exact same suit

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.447 position:50% align:center
down the runway at
the Geika Festival.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.532 position:50% align:center
I don't mind if
you throw it out.

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
It's really okay if you do.

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:10.955 position:50% align:center
But will you please try
it on for me, just once?

00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] All this struggle.
It's never-ending.

00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.090 position:50% align:center
I only see you through
the lens of my past,

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:23.677 position:50% align:center
scrambling after a fantasy.

you were living my dream?

[gasps]

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.570 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I am.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.703 position:50% align:center
Miss Igarashi. Why, is this
your very first time

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:51.955 position:50% align:center
trying on a bespoke
tailored suit?

00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:55.000 position:50% align:center
Um, yes, actually.

00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:59.587 position:50% align:center
You're only 12.
Goodness, by your stature,

00:22:59.671 --> 00:23:03.091 position:50% align:center
I assumed you were much older.

00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:08.513 position:50% align:center
How wonderful. You look exactly
like a professional model!

00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:11.850 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] Those were
the words that inspired me

00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:15.854 position:50% align:center
to pursue my career.

00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:19.399 position:50% align:center
But that dream
crumbled and faded.

00:23:19.482 --> 00:23:23.445 position:50% align:center
Girls who can look good in suits
can look good in anything.

00:23:23.528 --> 00:23:26.489 position:50% align:center
I'll make you the number-one
model in the world.

00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:29.075 position:50% align:center
Maybe I wanted her
to reach new heights,

00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:30.910 position:50% align:center
because I could never
quite come close

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:33.913 position:50% align:center
to reaching them myself.

00:23:33.997 --> 00:23:36.791 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shizuku.

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:39.669 position:50% align:center
Does this suit look good on me?

00:23:39.753 --> 00:23:43.590 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Mm.

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:44.632 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
It would've been easier

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:47.052 position:50% align:center
if she'd just thrown a fit.

00:23:48.511 --> 00:23:50.638 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Hold on,
I can't believe this.

00:23:50.722 --> 00:23:54.392 position:50% align:center
The designer, Kokoro Hasegawa,
was that same Kokoro?

00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:56.436 position:50% align:center
The same one? Do you know her?

00:23:56.519 --> 00:24:00.565 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We used to be
represented by the same agency.

00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:03.610 position:50% align:center
Thing is, the Kokoro
that I knew from before

00:24:03.693 --> 00:24:07.030 position:50% align:center
was always kind of
cold and standoffish.

00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:11.242 position:50% align:center
I definitely don't remember
her aura being so warm.

00:24:14.537 --> 00:24:15.497 position:50% align:center
Hey, now.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.957 position:50% align:center
There's no crying in modeling.

I'm not... crying.

00:24:21.002 --> 00:24:22.921 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're looking
kind of rough yourself.

00:24:23.004 --> 00:24:25.423 position:50% align:center
Can you even handle
one more walk?

00:24:25.507 --> 00:24:27.133 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI chuckles]

00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:29.719 position:50% align:center

00:24:31.388 --> 00:24:34.683 position:50% align:center
Is that jacket a part
of the next outfit?

00:24:36.267 --> 00:24:37.686 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
I have to admit,

00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:39.896 position:50% align:center
they were a lot more
than just a short model

00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:42.691 position:50% align:center
and incompetent designer.

dress... it was lovely.

Despite her tiny size,
I could use her.

I'm so impressed!

00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:53.178 position:50% align:center
What Kokoro really
wants is to be a designer.

00:25:53.261 --> 00:25:54.971 position:50% align:center
I see.

is going on at your school?

surprised myself!

[CHIYUKI] I get it.
This isn't really a fair fight.

00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:13.239 position:50% align:center
My 14 walks down the runway won
against only one from Kokoro.

aren't that talented as a model!

So, now, you can put all of your
energy into becoming a designer!

succeed as a model!
