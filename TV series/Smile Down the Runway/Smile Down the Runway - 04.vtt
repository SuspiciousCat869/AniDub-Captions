[IKUTO]
Shoot!

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
I didn't even get a chance to
let Honoka know I'd be late.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm back!

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.321 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Hm?

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.451 position:50% align:center

Why won't it open?

--[ICHIKA crying]

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.837 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are you doing?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.965 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's punishment.
That's my guess.

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:13.550 position:50% align:center
You're a big traitor!

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.218 position:50% align:center
Don't you remember
you promised Ichika

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.720 position:50% align:center
that you would keep Ikuto out?

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.597 position:50% align:center
[AOI] But who's going to fix
the doorknob when it breaks?

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.890 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKA crying]

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.392 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Ichika...

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.353 position:50% align:center
Hey. Could you
guys keep it down?

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
Uh. My bad.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.900 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Okay, we get it.
Dinner's almost ready.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
Let's go wash our hands.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.320 position:50% align:center
Um... Honoka.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.947 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Last night...

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.158 position:50% align:center
...where were you
and what were you doing?

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:42.996 position:50% align:center
Oh, um... I was just kinda
helping out at Mr. Yanagida's,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.581 position:50% align:center
where I've been working.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.544 position:50% align:center
You took on another job?
Without even letting us know?

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I lost track of time, sorry.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
For what?

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Man, she's livid.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Even with mom's situation,

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.928 position:50% align:center
we're not in dire
straits or anything.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.348 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for you
to take on more work.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.433 position:50% align:center
It's not really a job.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.810 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] You could've
called home at the very least.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] It was too late by the
time I thought of it. Then...

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
Iku's good. He has
lots of excuses.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.192 position:50% align:center
Sounds like it.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, would you let me
help you out with dinner?

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
Sit down.
You're a terrible cook.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
Oh. [chuckles]

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center
[NURSE 4A] Are you saying you've
been working again, Ms. Tsumura?

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
No! I mean, this isn't work!

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50% align:center
[NURSE 4A] I hear you.
But the whole reason you're here

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
is because you
were overstressed.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:33.880 position:50% align:center
You simply can't sustain this.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
But it's not work, I promise.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
Haven't we been through this?

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
Oh, he's back.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
This is only a cloth flower that
my son sewed for me, that's all!

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's from Ikuto?

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
Just please don't overdo it,
all right, Yuriko?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
Duly noted!

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Hey, listen to
the nurse on this, okay?

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
Yeah, yeah. Off the subject,

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
but have you noticed how
on edge Honoka is lately?

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
Her grades fell a bit,

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
so I guess her professor advised
her to go to summer school.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.459 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I wonder...

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
Is Mr. Yanagida going to pay me?

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
Ikuto?

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.591 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Sorry, Mother. I have to go.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center
Oh? But you just got here.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I have to go to work.
See ya tomorrow!

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
Was that really necessary?

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
tell Ikuto everything.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO] I just hate this--
seeing the two of you fight.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
Whenever you get angry,
you immediately stop wearing

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
the clothes your
brother made you.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
He always uses a check pattern
when he designs pieces for you,

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.076 position:50% align:center
so I can usually
tell right away.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
Anyway, your mock exam scores
weren't all that great?

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
Who cares since
I'm not going to college?

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO] Now, if that were
true, you wouldn't carry

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
your study guides around
with you everywhere.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
You can use this
for summer school.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
Your brother works so hard.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
Let's not have him
pick up more jobs.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
But how--? What
about medical bills?

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO] Don't worry about that.
Just take the money, okay?

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
It's for you.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Thanks.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
Ikuto's a little more sensitive

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
than you are, you know.
He needs your support.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
I hope you realize that.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
It feels like it's been
a long time now, doesn't it?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.407 position:50% align:center
Since we heard him talk about
wanting to be a designer?

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Hey. Why do you
wanna be a designer?

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Uh. Oh, um...

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
Well, because I like
to make clothes, I guess.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
I highly doubt
you were born with

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
such a specific dream, though.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
So? What happened?

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
It's kind of a long story.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
That's the wrong answer.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
You won't last a second
in this industry

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
if you're only here because
you "kinda like it."

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
Designers handle
all sorts of things

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.395 position:50% align:center
you're not even aware of yet.

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
You have to juggle
the demands of deadlines,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
quality standards,
and creativity.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
And if you fail, people
will practically celebrate.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.530 position:50% align:center
If you don't love this work,
you'll end up hating it.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.907 position:50% align:center
When that day comes,
you'll have two choices.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.576 position:50% align:center
Keep fighting or give up.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center
You need to figure out why
you're really doing this.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
Or else all you'll
face is defeat.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
Good point. What is it
that I truly want?

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
Her grades fell a bit,

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
so I guess her professor advised
her to go to summer school.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Money...

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Do you have
some kinda big goal, sir?

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
See, my goal is to be featured
at Paris Fashion Week.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
And from there,

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
for my name to be
known all over the world.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] So, Bob,
what are your aspirations?

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Sure, I love
making clothes, but...

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
...what is it that makes
me wanna be a designer?

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
Moriyama should be released
from the hospital pretty soon,

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
so we won't be needing
you after that.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
Um, 'scuse me, sir?

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] What? Are you about
to beg for more scraps?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Sorry, yeah.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
No.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna beg for them...
buy them yourself.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
This is by far my
favorite café in town.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.743 position:50% align:center
Great hospitality here.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
Thanks. It's a real
treasure to me.

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
This is so cute!

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] You like that
pattern? It's called check!

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.174 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm home.

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I know it's late.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
Where is everyone?

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
They're asleep.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Did I disrupt
your study session?

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
How 'bout some coffee?

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center
No, thanks.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Honoka, could
I talk to you for a second?

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
Take this.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
What is that?

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.074 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] It's from helping
out at Mr. Yanagida's.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
He just paid me, so--

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
No! You have to stop doing this!

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
I'm responsible for myself!

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
You always put everyone
else first, Ikuto!

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
You're sacrificing your
dream by choosing to work.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
There's no way I could go
to college with that money!

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
I don't want a handout.

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
If I go, I'll make it
happen by myself.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
I don't need your help,
okay? I can't accept it.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
If I live my dream at
the expense of others,

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
I'll never be happy.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? Ichika
heard people yelling.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
Noka, are you crying?

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA sniffs]

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKA]
There!

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
Go change clothes,
Noka! Please, do it!

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
Whenever Ichika wears something
that Iku made, she smiles!

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
When Mommy doesn't come
home or Iku comes back late,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
it makes Ichika
feel better and not sad.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
So let's change.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:21.853 position:50% align:center
Come on. Let's go.
It's too sad when you're crying!

[ICHIKA crying]

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
It's not what you think, Honoka.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
Mr. Yanagida is a
professional designer.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.534 position:50% align:center
So I'm actually working
in the fashion industry

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
and I'm learning a lot from him.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Earlier today,
when I got my first paycheck,

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
he told me,
"If you want to earn more,

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
then you'll need
to improve more."

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
He's tough, but it's been
really fulfilling so far.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
You see? I'm not forcing myself
to do anything I don't want to.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
So you mean I was just
wrong this entire time?

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:05.563 position:50% align:center
Honoka, you need to focus
on getting into college.

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:08.358 position:50% align:center
You want to work
overseas someday, right?

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Aoi, you focus on getting into

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center
the best high school
for volleyball.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.782 position:50% align:center
Ichika, keep being a kid!

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
Just know I'm working
hard so when it's time,

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
you can do anything you want!

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
Also...

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
I wanna wear this so bad!

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO] Ikuto, do you know what
you want to be when you grow up?

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
I know exactly what I wanna be!

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
I want...

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
...to be...

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
...a fashion designer.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.891 position:50% align:center
And I will be.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.062 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Yes.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
You will be!

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
I know it!

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Thank you, Honoka.

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
It's my childhood ambition.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
Huh? You heading home?

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Yep.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Mr. Yanagida.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
I have an answer now.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.795 position:50% align:center
I know exactly why
I want to be a designer.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
I really love making
clothes for people.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
I know that I'm not
still anywhere close

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
to reaching the level where
I could start dreaming big.

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
But there are people in my life
who support and believe in me.

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
So I'm going to make
it happen--this dream.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
I'll design with
specific people in mind.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
My passion stems from that--

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
the feeling I get making
things for others to wear.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
Clothes that make people smile.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.413 position:50% align:center
That's what I really wanna
aim for as a designer.

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:49.709 position:50% align:center
So does that count
as an aspiration?

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
It does, and it's
a great one, too.

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
But it's boring.

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.590 position:50% align:center
What else you got?

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Well, I'd love to see
Miss Fujito on the runway again.

00:11:58.635 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Next.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Really?

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hm?

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Got it.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Everything okay?

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Moriyama's quitting
because her parents

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center
are against her working here.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
But... what about
the exhibition?

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
Looks like you're doing it.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
What about Iida?

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
He's out of the picture.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] And on top of that,
Miss Moriyama just quit!

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
Hello? Miss Fujito?

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
It's Chiyuki.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
You're weird.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
But it's about time you started
calling me by my first name.

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Oh.

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
Miss Chi--

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
Chiyuki it is.

[CHIYUKI grunts]

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Well... I believe in you, Ikuto.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center

Thank you very much, ma'am!

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:16.671 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Wow. There're so
many celebrities here.

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
That's Sara, a famous model.

[IKUTO] And that's
a major movie director.

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:24.971 position:50% align:center

is a big deal.

Holy crap, I know her!

She's Mai Ayano of Aphro I Dite!

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50% align:center
She's only one of the top
designers in all of Japan.

And she's buying tons of
Mr. Yanagida's clothes, too!

Pardon me.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
I don't see the dress
you altered anywhere.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
What? How do you
know about that?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.415 position:50% align:center
I heard from one of my students.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
They were helping out
backstage as a fitter.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.129 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Even though it was
a last-minute addition,

00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:01.299 position:50% align:center
I wish Miss Chiyuki's
outfit was here, too.

[FUMIYO]
Um.

acquaintance, sir.

I'm here for <i>MODE JAPAN</i> .

and a swatch card, please?

Thank you so much!

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO] But where's
that final showstopper?

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
[KASHIWABARA]
You the designer?

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
Have the model
put this piece on.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
Yes, right away, sir.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] That guy's got
a whole lotta faces.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course, sir.

Hey. Help her out.

[IKUTO]
What?

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Why the heck don't we have

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
a changing room
for this poor girl?

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] It's a cotton-based
fabric processed with polyester

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
so it perfectly mimics
the texture of silk.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
As you can see here,

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
it naturally accentuates
the lines of the female form.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Oh, wow. She's so tall.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
Her silhouette's
on flawless display!

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.153 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] It's a simple,
yet versatile piece

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
that can be worn in both
casual and formal settings.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
[KASHIWABARA sighs] We'll
commit to allocating a booth

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
for your brand in our
department store in two weeks.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
I'll need 40 types
of seasonal pieces.

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.250 position:50% align:center
And a total of at least
400 garments in all.

--Excuse me, sir.

[IKUTO]
Oh, wow. Is this his big break?

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
Okay, Bob, go find the Geika
principal who was here earlier.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
We'll have to
hire some more help.

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
Who do you mean?

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA]
Am I being summoned?

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
I'm leaving the rest to you.

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center
Hi, there! I was listening.
So let's see how I can

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Who knew she
was a school principal?

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
So let's see how I
can make the most

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
out of this little transaction.

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
How 'bout this?

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
I'll agree to organize
the extra help you need,

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:55.747 position:50% align:center
and, in exchange, you can
participate in our school's

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
upcoming fashion show.

00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] I think you'd
find it very rewarding.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center

Well, here we are!

[IKUTO] I'm standing in front of
Japan's premier fashion school.

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's Geika
Fashion School!

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
The particular show I'm
going to have you help with

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
is an important part
of the school festival.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
And this year, in response to
one student's special request,

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:27.570 position:50% align:center
I'm letting people who
don't go here join us.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
All right, then, come in!

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] An exhibit
of student works. Amazing.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] It's the same
name... everywhere.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear.

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center
Where did I put those
application forms?

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Huh?

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'm gonna say your
measurements are 82, 65, and 83.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:55.515 position:50% align:center
So tell me,
did I get them right?

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]
What? Who the heck is he?!

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
Well, hello there, Toh!
Oh, it's been a while!

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
Huh, you're 105, 101, and 105.

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
What, did you gain
weight, Principal?

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA]
Secret's out!

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
So I'm guessing he's our
non-student participant?

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:16.077 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] That's right.
Exciting, isn't it?

00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
[TOH] Based on his bone
structure, he's about 17 or 18.

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
A high school student.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:24.627 position:50% align:center
And that outfit--you're wearing
a school uniform button-up.

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.254 position:50% align:center
The vest is handmade.

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
From the look of it, a girl
used to wear it regularly.

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
You definitely
bought those pants,

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
but there's no doubt you
hemmed them yourself.

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] He's right about
all of it, but how?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:40.435 position:50% align:center
He barely touched the clothes.

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Excuse me, Principal,
would you mind introducing us?

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 4A]
Hey, it's Toh!

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
What're you doing here?

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
[TOH chuckles]

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 4A] Oh my gosh,
it's so good to see you, Toh!

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
[TOH chuckles]
It's been a while, huh?

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
Dear Toh, he's a particularly
special student of mine.

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
Very talented.

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
Out of this entire school-- No.

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
Maybe out of all the
120,000 students we've had--

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
I'd say that he probably stands
above every one of them.

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
He's a senior unlike any I've
ever seen in my entire career.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
Would you be interested in
interning at Hazime Yanagida?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
He couldn't possibly do that

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
because he already
works at Aphro I Dite.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I'm not
really interested

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
in that kind of thing.

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
Forgive me then--I was
out of line for asking that.

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
We're just desperate for help.

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Hey...

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.951 position:50% align:center
...did you do something to your
friend's tunic by any chance?

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
Not in a bad way!

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
It just looks different somehow
from the way it was earlier--

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
when she arrived.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
Because of this.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
[TOH] I took the decorative
ribbon off the waist.

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
Seriously, you need
to be more mindful

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
of the tunic's silhouette.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
The weight and
pressure of that ribbon

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
totally ruined
your gorgeous shape.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
You have to make
sure you consult

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
with the fabric before you
add something like this.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
I appreciate the tip! [chuckles]

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
[TOH] There's no way he could've
seen the ribbon from his angle.

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
He noticed the change just by
the way it hung in the front.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
Changed my mind.

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
I'll take the job--
helping out with that brand.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
--[IKUTO] What?
--[TAKAOKA gasps]

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center
[TOH] I have a feeling
it'll be fun with you around.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
If you could start
tomorrow, that'd be great!

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
Toh, are you sure about this?

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Yes, of course I am, Shoko.

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
Thanks again.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center
And I'm so glad
I made that request

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
for a non-student participant.

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
I can hardly wait to start.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.
I know that I'm late.

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:52.442 position:50% align:center
My name's Kokoro Hasegawa
and I'm here to help out.

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
The model from the other day?

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
Thank you for taking
care of me before!

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
Oh, no worries!
I thought I recognized you.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.749 position:50% align:center
I didn't know we were
expecting a model.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
Did you stop by to
help us with fittings?

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm just--

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Please, right this way!

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
Hey-o, coming through!

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
Mr. Ayano.

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Ikuto,
and my darling freshman.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, do you
really know who I am?

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
'Course I do!

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
How could I not notice the girl

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:28.103 position:50% align:center
with the most beautiful
figure in her entire class?

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center
Oh, and by the way,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
you can just call me
Toh from now on.

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:33.108 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
A freshman? You're
a student at Geika?

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
Huh? You're still
in high school?!

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
Oh, that was rude!
I'm just shocked!

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
It's quite surprising.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:45.995 position:50% align:center
You don't see too
many high schoolers

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
working for a brand
as fancy as this one.

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
Actually, I only got this gig
through a friend of mine.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
Kokoro Hasegawa.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.714 position:50% align:center
I know I modeled
for you the other day,

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
but my real dream
is to be a designer.

00:20:58.008 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful to be here!

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
I'm exempt from
introducing myself, right?

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
I'll wait till Mr.
Yanagida gets back.

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
Mr. Ikuto?

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:07.100 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Mister?

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
You don't have to call me that.

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
Besides, aren't you
older than me?

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
Sure, you're younger,
but you have seniority!

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Wow, she seems like
a totally different person.

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
Damn. Things just
got more complicated.

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
Hm? The student
helpers have arrived?

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
Let's get right to--

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:26.661 position:50% align:center
I'm Toh Ayano,
a senior at Geika.

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:30.081 position:50% align:center
Your measurements
are 86, 61, 86.

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
You've got a great figure-- Ugh.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
Did you bring
this person in here?

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
Wait. Ayano?

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
You must be the rumored
grandchild of Mai Ayano.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
What? That top designer?

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
Having a famous grandmother
isn't without its troubles.

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:49.768 position:50% align:center
Anyway, what just
got complicated?

00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] We're trying to fulfill
an order of these shirts

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:54.022 position:50% align:center
made with specially
made material.

00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:55.523 position:50% align:center
That fabric's processed.

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
It's meant to look like silk,

00:21:56.858 --> 00:22:00.070 position:50% align:center
but it isn't nearly
as soft, correct?

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:04.199 position:50% align:center
Yes. The factory I normally use
just happened to fall through.

00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
[TOH] Well, then, why don't you
go ahead and use real silk?

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:09.954 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:12.457 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] That's why we
special-ordered that material.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.127 position:50% align:center
Silk is too soft too
achieve that silhouette.

00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:18.088 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Do you have
a good source for it?

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:20.590 position:50% align:center
I can use my
grandmother's connections.

00:22:20.674 --> 00:22:21.883 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hmm...

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:24.594 position:50% align:center
Is it even possible to
make that with real silk?

00:22:24.678 --> 00:22:27.180 position:50% align:center
It is. There are
two ways to do it.

00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:29.516 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Then shouldn't
we discuss it and decide?

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.893 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, that's
not really how I work.

00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:34.771 position:50% align:center
The designer must maintain
their position at the top.

00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:38.441 position:50% align:center
The designer is the one to
come up with the designs.

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:40.985 position:50% align:center
As for us, we're slaves
to those designs.

00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:43.530 position:50% align:center
So, that being the case,
it would be unacceptable for us

00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:46.074 position:50% align:center
to contribute at this
point in the process.

00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:48.368 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Man. This guy's kinda scary.

00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:50.620 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I'll explain the process now.

00:22:50.704 --> 00:22:52.372 position:50% align:center
We're making a bias-cut shirt,

00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:54.332 position:50% align:center
and we're using
a crepe Georgette.

00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:56.334 position:50% align:center
Let's jump in and
start on the sample.

00:22:56.418 --> 00:22:58.086 position:50% align:center
You must know what to do, Ayano.

00:22:58.169 --> 00:23:02.048 position:50% align:center
Heh. Actually, I'm not
really feeling it right now.

00:23:02.132 --> 00:23:03.550 position:50% align:center
I think it might be a good idea

00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:05.719 position:50% align:center
for Ikuto to show us
all how it's done.

00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:08.805 position:50% align:center
What? Wait, are you being
serious? 'Cause, listen,

00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:10.890 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to do any
of this stuff yet! Plus--

00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:12.684 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I believe in you, Ikuto.

00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:14.019 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:18.565 position:50% align:center
I've got this.

00:23:18.648 --> 00:23:19.941 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Forty-five degree angle!

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:21.526 position:50% align:center
Needles seven and nine!

00:23:21.609 --> 00:23:24.487 position:50% align:center
If you can't shape it on
the table, do it on the torso!

00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:28.324 position:50% align:center
Set it on the paper
and cut! Carefully!

00:23:28.408 --> 00:23:30.368 position:50% align:center
See that? I told you
to keep the thread loose!

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:31.536 position:50% align:center
Um, can I--

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:32.996 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Kokoro.

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
Shh.

00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.209 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
The bias-cut technique he wants

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.047 position:50% align:center
places the fabric at an angle.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.549 position:50% align:center
By doing so,
it produces elasticity.

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:46.259 position:50% align:center
So when we use an
iron to shape it,

00:23:46.343 --> 00:23:48.762 position:50% align:center
we can achieve a
beautiful body line.

00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:51.639 position:50% align:center
But... it's really hard.

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:54.642 position:50% align:center
You don't know how
to handle the Georgette.

00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:56.686 position:50% align:center
The elasticity
produced by bias-cut

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.146 position:50% align:center
differs with each material.

00:23:58.229 --> 00:24:01.399 position:50% align:center
If it's not properly calculated,
it comes out warped.

00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:04.194 position:50% align:center
You're incompetent, stand back.

00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:05.820 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Yes, sir.

00:24:05.904 --> 00:24:07.489 position:50% align:center
Play time is over now.

00:24:07.572 --> 00:24:08.740 position:50% align:center
Your turn, Ayano.

00:24:08.823 --> 00:24:10.325 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Oh, all right.

00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:12.077 position:50% align:center
[TOH] I've got a good
sense of his abilities.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.288 position:50% align:center
But there's something
I really wanna know.

00:24:15.372 --> 00:24:17.624 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Ikuto, watch carefully.

00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:22.837 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
This is a real first for me.

00:24:22.921 --> 00:24:26.758 position:50% align:center
I've never actually
watched a professional sew!

00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:29.094 position:50% align:center
It's drastically different.

00:24:30.428 --> 00:24:32.305 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
And voilà.

00:24:34.057 --> 00:24:36.142 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I've got a long way to go.

00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:37.727 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
You passed.

00:24:37.811 --> 00:24:40.522 position:50% align:center
Next, we'll use this to draw up
the patterns for the factory.

00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:42.732 position:50% align:center
Oh, I've actually got
a suggestion for that.

00:24:42.816 --> 00:24:45.068 position:50% align:center
Hey, Bob. You do it.

00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:46.695 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:24:46.778 --> 00:24:47.946 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:51.825 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Now I see. He's noticed, too.

00:24:55.078 --> 00:24:56.621 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm done!

00:24:56.705 --> 00:24:58.790 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Hmm... It's a nice try,

00:24:58.873 --> 00:25:00.458 position:50% align:center
but you still don't
have a very good grasp

00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:03.253 position:50% align:center
of the material's elasticity.

00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:04.587 position:50% align:center
This part should be a millimeter

00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:07.549 position:50% align:center
shorter to avoid
producing wrinkles.

00:25:07.632 --> 00:25:09.592 position:50% align:center
[TOH] But this is an
impressive improvement,

00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:11.469 position:50% align:center
especially since it
was based solely on

00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:13.722 position:50% align:center
looking at the finished product.

00:25:13.805 --> 00:25:16.891 position:50% align:center
Just incredible. It's like
he already has the "eyes"
