00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:16.016 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
That's it, I've got it.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Is that the one
you came up with yesterday?

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Please don't
scare me like that!

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
My bad. But I gotta
tell you, though,

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
I'd buy this, for sure!

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thanks, I appreciate that.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
I admit, I'm proud
of what I did here.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
[MIKA, SHOKO]
Huh?

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
Know what? I bet Miss
Sara would like it, too.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.257 position:50% align:center
[MIKA]
Hey, Chiyuki.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:52.510 position:50% align:center
When the heck did you get so
tight with bean sprouts guy?

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.095 position:50% align:center
Bean sprouts?

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
Oh! Ikuto?

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yeah. Him.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
Weird! Do we seem close to you?

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe we are, but I don't
think I'd call us "friends."

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Oh.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.692 position:50% align:center
It's a different thing.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
I have a lot of respect
for what he does.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.071 position:50% align:center
[MIKA, SHOKO]
Why?

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.697 position:50% align:center
He's different from me.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.575 position:50% align:center
I'm dead-focused on
becoming a hypermodel.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.327 position:50% align:center
If something's not
relevant to modeling,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.746 position:50% align:center
I cut it out of my life.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.415 position:50% align:center
But Ikuto's not like that.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.543 position:50% align:center
Somehow, he takes
care of everything.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.128 position:50% align:center
He's been working
towards his dream

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.339 position:50% align:center
longer than I've even had mine.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.924 position:50% align:center
And trust me,
it's not because he hasn't

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.551 position:50% align:center
been putting in enough
effort to achieve it.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.138 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] He's got this fierce
determination to find balance

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.974 position:50% align:center
without abandoning
anything important.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.686 position:50% align:center
That's something I don't have.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:46.815 position:50% align:center
It impresses me and
I respect it. I seriously do.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.442 position:50% align:center
He's also a rival, though.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.860 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Ikuto.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.278 position:50% align:center
That's why...

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.155 position:50% align:center
...you have to win.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.284 position:50% align:center
After all, I only want
to compete with the best.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO]
Time's up!

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
Now let's move on
to the evaluations.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:36.132 position:50% align:center
It's done! Wow.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
Hold on, are you really
a high school student?

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I am.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO] Kaoru Kizaki.
Come on, you're up first.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
Bring your creation
to the front.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center
Before we begin the evaluations,

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.273 position:50% align:center
I'd like to introduce
our judges.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
Of course, our illustrious
principal, Shoko Takaoka.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
Good evening, everyone!

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.867 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO] Also, the faculty
in charge, which is me.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
And last...

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
...three of your fellow
competitors in this room

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
will also be judging you.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50% align:center
So that's a total
of five judges.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
The first three will be
Tsumura, Kato, and Yajima.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50% align:center
Come on up.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.966 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
We're judging each other?

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
Pardon me.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.347 position:50% align:center
But those with inferior skills

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
really shouldn't be
doing evaluations.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA giggles]

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
Oh, my! Has he really
not shown up yet?

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who do you mean?

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
Hey there!

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] Thank goodness!
You had me worried, Toh!

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
Kaoru, you were saying?

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
Any objections now?

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
No.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what're
you doing here?

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
Quiet, time to focus.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
Whenever you're presenting,
you want to start off

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
by explaining your
design's concept.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
My concept is... "Unbalance."

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:06.556 position:50% align:center
One thing really stood out to
me when I was researching Sara.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
She's different on TV
than when she's modeling.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
She can be equally
cool and reserved

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50% align:center
or warm and approachable.

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
I wanted to express
and honor that

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
by juxtaposing
leather and lace.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
Now, for the critiques. Yajima.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
Me? Wait, why do
I have to go first?

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
It's on you. The faculty
doesn't critique this stage.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
Look, we don't have all day.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
I mean, I guess the concept's
interesting and all,

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50% align:center
but, like, the result
is pretty lame.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE]
Here we go.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50% align:center
The preliminaries are gonna be
all about roasting each other.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
Exaggerating every
tiny flaw they can find.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I think it's
a really great design!

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
Would you mind showing
us the back of it, please?

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
Yes! See? It's so elegant!

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
The lace on the back
does such a wonderful job

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
of toning down the
ruggedness of the leather.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
Who does this high
school kid think he is?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
[TOH] I like the way
she handled the leather.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
--What?
--[TOH] I'm a fan.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.158 position:50% align:center
[TOH] You were meticulous
with your fabric choice.

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
This would look great on Sara.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Yes!

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
Next up, Ryunosuke.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.920 position:50% align:center
[RYUNOSUKE] I didn't have
a particular concept in mind.

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
As a professional, it's
her job to make it look good.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
Screams "tracht" to me.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Tracht is a traditional
garment of Switzerland,

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
which is part of
Sara's heritage.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
It's impressive that he found
a way to incorporate that.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 6A] This design's
straight-up boring.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
Those bottoms look fussy.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
They have way too
many pockets on them.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:41.651 position:50% align:center
I see what you're trying to do,
but it's not really working.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
[TOH] Honestly, I don't get
why it had to be a turtleneck.

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
These people are brutal.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
I'm almost up.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO]
Next, Ikuto Tsumura.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.703 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am!

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO]
As for the judges...

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me. Could I please
be a judge for this one?

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me, too!

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
Very well, come on up.

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.006 position:50% align:center
Okay, Tsumura. Let's see it.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
You just have fun, okay?

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center
Let's do our best!

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Ikuto.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
So this is what I designed.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.231 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Pajamas!

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
PJs? Why?

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
That's right! And why not?

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.949 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA giggles]

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
All right, convince me.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.536 position:50% align:center
Miss Sara said it herself--

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
what girl doesn't wanna look
fashionable at all times of day?

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.877 position:50% align:center
When I was researching,
I noticed how she always posts

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.837 position:50% align:center
what she's wearing
on social media.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
But there weren't many
photos of her in loungewear.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.468 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
That's why I designed pajamas

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.346 position:50% align:center
that she'd be excited
to share with her fans.

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:54.182 position:50% align:center
[TOH chuckles]

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
[TOH] So tell me, what part
of that design is stylish?

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.188 position:50% align:center
Huh? You mean you don't
think it's stylish at all?

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
Well, I, uh...

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
I don't really know how
to convince you that it is.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
Um, let's see.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
You've improved a lot, Ikuto.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
If you were able to achieve this
form, you must have mastered

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.578 position:50% align:center
the bias-cut that you
struggled so hard with before.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
[TOH] I'll happily be
the first to critique.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.169 position:50% align:center
Honestly, kid,
I'm pretty disappointed.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
Everything about
this is half-hearted,

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
from the positioning
of the buttons

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
to the length of the hem--
it's too conservative.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
Frankly, it offends me.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
It's pretty lame.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Lame?

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO] Great, initial
judging is now complete.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50% align:center
Now we'll select
the participants

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
who'll proceed
to the next round.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
we'll give you some time
to incorporate our notes.

[IKUTO gasps]

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:54.117 position:50% align:center
Some of you got a hefty amount
of negative feedback, right?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
Here's your chance
to address it.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.247 position:50% align:center
Don't give up yet.
Just believe in yourself.

Be brave and bold--
all great designers are.

If you're ready to submit
your design without fixes,

I'm lost. What should I do?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.889 position:50% align:center
So lame.

Hey, Ikuto.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
Nice. I gotta tell you...

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.733 position:50% align:center
I'd buy this, for sure!

fix up your lame pajamas?

Who cares? I mean,
it's his choice, isn't it?

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
Um, thank you! That's
twice you've been kind.

Huh?

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
I was already
grateful. Thank you.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

[TAKAOKA] Thanks for your
patience, everyone!

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
We're going to proceed
with the contest,

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
so please take a seat
and listen carefully.

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
The task you were presented with
today was to create an outfit--

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
one that Sara
would find stylish.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
Some of you received
harsh critiques

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
claiming your
designs were "lame."

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
But as I'm sure you know,

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
there's nothing more
subjective in the world

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
than whether or not a
thing is deemed stylish.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
What's more important,

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center
at least when it comes
to designing clothes,

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
is whether or not your
design is interesting.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center
Whether or not it
has something to say.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:37.470 position:50% align:center
Which is why, in that spirit,
the true task of this round

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
was to see if you could
believe in your design...

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.891 position:50% align:center
...even in the face of critique,

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center
even as you faced
your own doubts.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] So, thank you for
your interesting creations!

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
Very well done! You all
passed the first round!

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
No way. I did it?

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA] However,
we aren't quite finished here.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
Now, we're going to reveal
our top three participants.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
Those three individuals
will get to bypass the next step

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
and proceed directly
to the finals from here.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
After all, no point
in having judges

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
if they don't judge, right?

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.465 position:50% align:center
The finals...

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center

--[TAKAOKA] Tell me, Toh.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
Regarding Ikuto's design,
did you really find it that bad?

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
But it was clear what you
were plotting back there.

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.861 position:50% align:center
How naughty of you.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
Well, what are you
thinking, Shoko?

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
It's the stripes. Sara just
adores them, you know!

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.373 position:50% align:center
And if Ikuto knew that
and took it into account?

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
Well, then..

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
...that means he
possesses a rare quality:

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
He can tailor his vision
to his client's taste.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center

Yeah, thanks. I'm in shock.

expect anything like this.

ranked lower than this kid?

Uh...

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's easy.

Your process wasn't suited
for women's clothing.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
It's fine to challenge yourself
with an unfamiliar category,

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
but if you do that,
then do your homework.

Wow, that's a good question.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center
To tell you the truth,
I don't think I am.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
Or maybe I'm feeling
unsure about, like,

how well I really did.

Why did you decide not
to use your whole budget?

How did you know?

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
Oh, I could tell right away
just by looking at the fabric.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center

resources properly.

But you don't understand!

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:08.723 position:50% align:center
The thing is, it doesn't
matter. Not to a designer.

[IKUTO gasps]

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
You need to get serious.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.853 position:50% align:center
This afternoon, you prioritized
your personal issues

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
over achieving the
finest quality design,

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
which denotates a lack of
commitment to the project.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
I'm going to be blunt.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
The reason you failed
to place higher

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center
is because you went
cheap on the fabric.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
No matter what might be going
on in your personal life,

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
it can't affect
the client... ever.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
I didn't feel
like I had a choice.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:43.758 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I mean, that money
belonged to my sisters.

I have to look out for them!

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
If I have to use up
my sisters' money,

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.681 position:50% align:center
what does that say about...

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
...about...

Not a thing, 'kay?

not finishing that thought.

I definitely didn't intend to
come out here and lecture you.

you're going to have
to make full-size outfits

in order to compete
in the finals.

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center

need more money.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
Bye, Fashion Week!

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Cue the drama.

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.512 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Chiyuki, listen,
are you really going to Paris?

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I am.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Well, you've
saved up a little chunk.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
How long did that take you?

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI sighs]
Two years.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
You're going to waste
that in an instant.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
It's not a waste! Jeez!

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
Could you please try not to
be all negative in front of me?

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
Be supportive, pretty please?

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
Fine. Go and do
whatever you want.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I plan to apply to
as many magazines as possible.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
First things first:

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
I'll start by updating my
comp card and portfolio!

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
Shizuku? Do you think
Miwa is busy this month?

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
Oh. She's gone.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:32.761 position:50% align:center
Nope.

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
If you're making a portfolio,

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
how would you feel about
being this girl's mentor?

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
Think that could work?

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
It's an honor! I'm Haruka Sudo
and I'm working for Mille Neige!

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
Like, I just started.
It's actually my first day.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
A newbie?

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.654 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] That's right.
She's a year younger than you.

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.157 position:50% align:center
You're adorable.
Good to meet you.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, are you kidding?
You're, like, infinite times

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
more adorable
than me, Miss Chiyuki!

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap, now I've already gone
and exposed my fangirl self.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
A fangirl?

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
I've never been that well-known
for my work, though.

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
Of course you are!

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
When I was little, I had several
magazines with you on the cover!

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
That's amazing!

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
And I've been a huge
fan of yours ever since!

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Oh, wow.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
I guess I was in
more demand back then.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
Well, why don't we start
by looking at our workflow?

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
When it comes down to it,

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
models are responsible for
finding their own jobs.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:31.903 position:50% align:center
You submit yourself by applying

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
and hopefully you're
invited to audition.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
Then you go in and book the gig!

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
If you wanna start doing that,

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
you'll need to create a
comp card and a portfolio.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
Hey, there she is!
How's it goin', Chi?

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Miwa! Thanks so
much for squeezing me in!

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
It's my pleasure!

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
Why, you're practically
my own daughter, Chi.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
I couldn't say no.

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
So what kind of look
are we going for?

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] A comp card is
basically a promo photo

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
to include with your
application paperwork.

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
Your portfolio is
a collection of photos

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
that you'll use
to audition with.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:13.570 position:50% align:center
You'll put together a
collection of different looks.

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
The point is to show people

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
how interesting and
versatile you can be.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
the budget for this

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
comes out of your own pocket.

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:23.496 position:50% align:center
[MIWA]
Nice. All right.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
Next look!

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
Let's see, what should I wear?

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
I got it!

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
Oh, whoa. Another
unique one, I see.

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
It's not bad, right?

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
When I wore this the first time,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
I did so many crazy things.

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center
I thought I needed
to put on airs

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
and lie about
where it came from.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
[MIWA] Hey. Who's
the designer for this one?

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Things are different now.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:20:00.033 position:50% align:center
This time, I want everyone
to really see Ikuto's work!

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
It's special.
My friend made it for me.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
[MIWA]
Oh, yeah.

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
That's a lovely one.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:18.343 position:50% align:center
They all rejected me!

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center
Well... I'll just
call them directly!

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
Gotta try everything I can.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
I can't possibly quit now!

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
[click]

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Talk about rough.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
They hung up the second
I told them my height.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
Only one place left to call.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
If I can manage to snag
an interview there...

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
Hello? This is Niinuma
at <i>MODE JAPAN</i> .

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.338 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hi! My name is Chiyuki Fujito,

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
and I'm a model
from Mille Neige.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center
I was just wondering
if it would be okay for me

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
to send over my portfolio
for you to review.

00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
Is that acceptable?

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
Uh, just a moment, please.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
That name sounds so familiar.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
Of course! I would
love to see it!

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
How about Wednesday at 5?

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:27.120 position:50% align:center
We have an appointment
available around then!

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.
I'm looking forward to it!

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I've finally gotten this far.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
The rest of it is all
about selling myself.

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA]
Are you Ms. Chiyuki Fujito?

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
Yes! I'm Chiyuki Fujito
of Mille Neige.

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
Thank you for meeting me.

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA]
What? You're tiny.

00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:51.936 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA] Dammit Fumiyo, why did
you have to drag her in?

00:21:55.857 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Niinuma had to go on
location at the last minute.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:04.157 position:50% align:center
I'm Akasaka. I'm helping
her out by filling in.

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:08.661 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
It's not even her? Great...

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA] I've got
another appointment soon,

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:13.041 position:50% align:center
so we'll have to
make this quick.

00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:14.334 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Darn it.

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:16.878 position:50% align:center
I let myself get my hopes up.

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:21.341 position:50% align:center
No eye contact,
a cold and judgy attitude--

00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:23.301 position:50% align:center
it's nothing new.

00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:25.095 position:50% align:center
Keep it together!

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:30.016 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] In that case,
can we dive right in?

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.893 position:50% align:center
I brought my portfolio with me.

00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:34.521 position:50% align:center
Would you mind taking
a look through it?

00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:39.192 position:50% align:center
Wow. It's interesting--
you don't actually look

00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:41.486 position:50% align:center
as small as you
are in these photos.

00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:42.696 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:44.447 position:50% align:center
In fact, my proportions
are pretty much

00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:46.324 position:50% align:center
the same as any top model's.

00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:47.992 position:50% align:center
As long as it's
just a photograph,

00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:49.994 position:50% align:center
it wouldn't negatively
affect the brand.

00:22:50.078 --> 00:22:51.746 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Here's my big pitch.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.542 position:50% align:center
I've gotta prove that I'll be
good for this magazine!

00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:58.628 position:50% align:center
I know. If a photo
uses multiple models,

00:22:58.712 --> 00:23:00.672 position:50% align:center
I may not be that useful.

00:23:00.755 --> 00:23:04.342 position:50% align:center
But... would you mind taking
a look at page 20, please?

00:23:06.052 --> 00:23:07.929 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA gasps]

00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:09.889 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA]
Where is this?

00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:13.059 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] I arranged a
location shoot in a forest.

00:23:13.143 --> 00:23:15.895 position:50% align:center
I mean, from what I've learned,
high fashion brands

00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:19.024 position:50% align:center
value synergy between the
clothes and the location.

00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:22.986 position:50% align:center
Also, many girls reject
those types of jobs.

00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:24.237 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.282 position:50% align:center
Because one of my skills
is adapting to anything!

00:23:27.365 --> 00:23:30.869 position:50% align:center
So, I hope you'll consider me!

00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:33.747 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Okay. Clock the reaction.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.416 position:50% align:center
It can't be that bad.

00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:38.084 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:39.711 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:42.464 position:50% align:center
Ms. Fujito, I'll have
to end our meeting here.

00:23:42.547 --> 00:23:46.301 position:50% align:center
Ms. Igarashi!
I'm so sorry for the wait!

00:23:46.384 --> 00:23:47.552 position:50% align:center
I'll be with you in a jif.

00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:49.721 position:50% align:center
Please take a seat
in the meantime.

00:23:54.768 --> 00:23:58.063 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
A manager? From another agency?

00:23:58.146 --> 00:24:00.607 position:50% align:center
This is the worst timing ever.

00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:04.694 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Ms. Akasaka, I can
come back again if you'd like!

00:24:04.778 --> 00:24:06.696 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA]
Right, maybe some other time.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:07.947 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:16.414 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Thank you. I'll
reach out tonight to follow-up.

00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:20.126 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Who's she?

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.461 position:50% align:center
Oh, some model.

00:24:21.544 --> 00:24:23.296 position:50% align:center
I guess she's
with Mille Neige now?

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.757 position:50% align:center
But she just came
in looking for work.

00:24:28.009 --> 00:24:30.345 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Hmm...

00:24:30.428 --> 00:24:32.806 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we'd better
get to the point.

00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:34.307 position:50% align:center
Take a look.

00:24:34.391 --> 00:24:36.351 position:50% align:center
This girl is currently one of
our most popular newcomers

00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:38.019 position:50% align:center
working at Bon Rouge.

00:24:38.103 --> 00:24:41.648 position:50% align:center
She'd be perfect for <i>MODE</i>
<i>JAPAN</i> . Don't you think?

00:24:44.943 --> 00:24:46.528 position:50% align:center
Right. Of course
there's no answer

00:24:46.611 --> 00:24:48.488 position:50% align:center
when I seriously need one.

00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:51.616 position:50% align:center
Not like it's anything new.
What'd I expect?

00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:55.495 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Yes! Uh, hello?

00:24:55.578 --> 00:24:58.415 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA] Hello, this
is Akasaka of <i>MODE JAPAN</i> .

00:24:58.498 --> 00:25:02.043 position:50% align:center
I'm wondering if you'd be
available tomorrow morning.

00:25:02.127 --> 00:25:03.378 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Huh?

00:25:03.461 --> 00:25:05.463 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA] A model dropped
out at the last minute.

00:25:05.547 --> 00:25:08.049 position:50% align:center
I'm calling to see if you'd
be able to make the shoot.

00:25:08.133 --> 00:25:09.801 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:25:15.432 --> 00:25:17.892 position:50% align:center
Hi, good morning! Um...

00:25:22.313 --> 00:25:23.940 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Whoa!

00:25:24.024 --> 00:25:26.026 position:50% align:center
Pardon me! Sorry.

00:25:28.778 --> 00:25:30.697 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Uh.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.949 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Apologies, Ms. Igarashi!

00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:34.075 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:35.952 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I'm late again!

00:25:38.913 --> 00:25:40.206 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Wow.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.837 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
The star of today's shoot...

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.714 position:50% align:center
So pretty.

00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:53.678 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
...is her.

00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:27.731 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] The number one thing
a model needs isn't height.

00:27:27.814 --> 00:27:32.152 position:50% align:center
But then again, <i>she</i> never
had to worry about that.

00:27:32.235 --> 00:27:33.945 position:50% align:center
Next time, "Aura."
