00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.221 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Runway models.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.806 position:50% align:center
They're the lucky individuals

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.851 position:50% align:center
who own the spotlight
at fashion shows.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:24.274 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I'm Chiyuki Fujito.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
This is my story.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:29.946 position:50% align:center
The story of how
I became a top model!

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
And...

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:38.455 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
What?

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
Another growth spurt, Chiyuki?

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Yep, I'm 158 centimeters!

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Wow!

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
That's pretty tall
for a fourth grader!

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
How tall should I be in order
to walk Paris Fashion Week?

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
Well, at least 175 centimeters.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
Just 175, huh?

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.975 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
So if I'm 158 now...

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.228 position:50% align:center
No sweat! Just 17? I've got it!

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:05.523 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Shizuku works at
Mille Niege, my dad's agency.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:09.027 position:50% align:center
She was the first of his models
to walk Paris Fashion Week.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I'm completely obsessed

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.907 position:50% align:center
with this yearly
celebration of fashion.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.535 position:50% align:center
And to get there,
you have to be a top model!

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.081 position:50% align:center
I wanna do Fashion Week, too!

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
Then you need to grow
a little more, okay?

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
[MODEL 1A]
The president must be so proud.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:27.712 position:50% align:center
How cool is it that his daughter

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.006 position:50% align:center
has what it takes
to represent his brand?

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.426 position:50% align:center
She'll be 178 centimeters
in no time flat!

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.346 position:50% align:center
[MODEL 1A] It's all about height
when you're a runway model.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.889 position:50% align:center
--[door opens]
--[KENJI] Chiyuki!

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:39.224 position:50% align:center
Hey, Dad!

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:42.143 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] Hi there.
I've got a little job for you.

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:43.186 position:50% align:center
Fashion Week?

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.145 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Of course not.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.438 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Aww...

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.565 position:50% align:center
Okay, but it's gonna
happen really soon though!

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:48.566 position:50% align:center
I know it!

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.027 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It will.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.154 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
But believe it or not,

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:56.324 position:50% align:center
I never grew another
centimeter after that.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.374 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Shizuku!
Can't I still do Fashion Week?

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.252 position:50% align:center
Dad! I really want
to go to Paris!

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.339 position:50% align:center
Chiyuki, listen to me.

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.801 position:50% align:center
You can't go to Paris--
not at your height.

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.761 position:50% align:center
And honestly,
if you keep this up...

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center
Who said it was impossible?!

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:22.308 position:50% align:center
...I'll fire you.
That's a promise.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
So two years ago,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.191 position:50% align:center
I ended up getting
fired by my own father.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Oh, come on, Chiyuki.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten what I
told you at the last audition?

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
And the one before that?
And even the one before that?

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
"Fashion Week, here we come!"

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Ugh. No,
I said, "Don't come back."

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
You've got a heck
of a lot of nerve

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.878 position:50% align:center
showing up again like this.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Oh, yeah?

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.464 position:50% align:center
Well, you're only here
because you want to

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.507 position:50% align:center
retire early with
a halfway stable income.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
What?!

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.053 position:50% align:center
You're so fired! Get out!

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
Hang on. Let's
give her a chance.

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:04.476 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Fine. Okay.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
So what's with this look?

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Well, it's the outfit
you wore to Paris Fashion Week.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
If I rock it, I pass, right?

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
The heels, seriously?

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.491 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing more pathetic

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
than wearing heels in
order to fake your height.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.952 position:50% align:center
There are plenty
of models out there

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
who don't have to
cheat to look good.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
Runway models aren't there
to showcase themselves.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
They showcase the clothes.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
That's why you need the height.
Those specific proportions.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
We're not one of those big
agencies that can pull strings.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid there's no hope.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
You'll never have
the height you need.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
It's... impossible.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
Just give up.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center
[TAKAHASHI]
Chiyuki.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
Thought this might... help.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
[TAKAHASHI] I compiled a
bunch of audition paperwork

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center
for several of
the other agencies.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.704 position:50% align:center
You've obviously got the looks.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
they wouldn't take--

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Takahashi?

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
Thank you.
But, hey, don't worry.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
Please tell Shizuku
that I'll be back.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
My dream isn't simply
to walk the runway

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
at Paris Fashion Week.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
You know me. I won't give up.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 1A]
If you haven't submitted

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center
your post-graduation plans, give
them to the teacher's assistant.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
Please collect them all, Fujito.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
Get them to me after class.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Will do!

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1A]
Whoa!

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
Looks like you've got
a glamorous future ahead!

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
I love it!
Your father'll be proud!

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1B] Do you think
you might even take over

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
as president some day?

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Are you kidding?
No, thank you very much!

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.630 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1A]
Why not?

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1B] I mean, you're
already a model, aren't you?

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
I'll be a hypermodel!

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Wow!

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Miss Fujito?

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to interrupt.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
It's just, the post-graduation
plans that I submitted.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
Oh. Who're you?

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
Chiyuki! Come on,
this guy's in our class!

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but what was your name?

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
Ikuto. Ikuto Tsumura.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
Oh! The bean sprouts guy!

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
Bean sprouts?

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me
you don't remember.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
Everyone teased him
for bringing bean sprouts

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.380 position:50% align:center
with rice for
lunch on sports day.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps] How does
everyone know about that?

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Oh, are you poor?

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.302 position:50% align:center
Wow, Chiyuki, rude much?

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
So? What's up?

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Right, about that.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
I wanted to rewrite
my plan, if that's okay.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
I'll bring it right back!

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Sure. That sounds fine.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.
Sorry for the trouble.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.699 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1C] Hey, could
we stop by the library?

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center

He said he'd be right back!

[CHIYUKI]
Hey, about that Tsumura guy.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.797 position:50% align:center
Tsumura? Who is that?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
From this morning?

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
The guy with the
unfortunate bob?

[STUDENT 1B]
Oh, right.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center

Any clue where he could be?

Hmm. Let me think.

Oh!

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
This must be it.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
Never knew we had a crafty-club.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:39.733 position:50% align:center
Excuse me!

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Miss Fujito?

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Your plans?

Oh, right! I'm sorry!

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
He didn't even change anything.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
So sorry! Please forgive me!
I'm the worst.

[CHIYUKI gasps]
Hey! That's Paris Fashion Week!

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
Why do you have this?

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
Why? Well, 'cause my
advisor lent it to me.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] And it's the
one that featured Shizuku!

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
She's so beautiful. [gasps]

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
Tsumura, what were
you doing watching this?

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:11.848 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Oh. I'm trying to
recreate that same outfit.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hmm.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm working with what we have!

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
There's no money to buy fabric,

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:25.528 position:50% align:center
so I'm just recycling old
clothes that were donated.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Hmm. This guy's
pretty interesting.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
Hey, so...

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:39.459 position:50% align:center
Do you think that I
could pull off this outfit?

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] What? I mean,
you're a model, Miss Fujito.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
You'll look good in anything.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.092 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
So vain!

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
Do you have anything
better for me?

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center
For you?

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
Let's see. Possibly.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50% align:center
I'll go check in the closet.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Whoa. Did you
really make all this stuff?

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Yeah, I did,
since I am the only club member.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Miss Fujito,
what do you think of this one?

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:13.201 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Are you actually
trying to piss me off?

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need you to explain

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.705 position:50% align:center
what the heck made
you choose this one!

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
Oh, I mean no offense!

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
I guess it's due
to the fact that

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
you always seem
to speak your mind,

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
and in a lot of ways,
you're way more manly than I--

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
Well? Finish that thought.

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
But let's see.

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:29.884 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hmm?

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
For you, it's important
to find the right balance.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
The balance between
femininity and strength.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
So maybe if we cut the
sleeves, then lengthen it.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:42.022 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Seriously?
Did he really call me manly?

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
But look at this.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center
You can tell he took it apart

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
and sewed it back
together more than once.

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
He didn't let a lack of
fabric keep him from trying.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Making clothes
must be his passion.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
You should do this.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.122 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
Be a fashion designer.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Um. I mean,
there's no way I could do that.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
And that's not what
I want to do, anyway.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
Oh? You sure?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
'Cause I saw what you wrote.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
Tokyo Designer Fashion School?

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
But you erased it.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.729 position:50% align:center
Miss Fujito.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
Do you think I could
be a fashion designer

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
with just a high school diploma?

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
See? It is what you want.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:32.197 position:50% align:center
But, no, I don't really think
it's possible without a degree.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
All the designers I know
went to college for it.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:38.078 position:50% align:center
I mean, even my dad's company
only seems to accept new grads,

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
fresh out of college, or at
least some kind of conservatory.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
The designer industry
is pretty tough.

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
There's no way around it.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Right, yeah. I knew that.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
I assume you have
some financial reasons

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center
that are preventing
you from going, right?

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just look into

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
getting some
kind of scholarship?

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
Well, I have three
younger sisters.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] One of them
is ridiculously smart.

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50% align:center
One's a talented
volleyball player.

00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
And the youngest is so cute,
it's almost impossible to cope.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
But the first one
refuses to go to college

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:17.951 position:50% align:center
even though she could
get into any one she wants.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center
The other one
rejected an offer from

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
a top-ranking school because
it would be too expensive.

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
As for the youngest,
she's only five years old.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
I want her to dream big.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center
And so...

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.718 position:50% align:center
The plan is I'll work
full time after graduation,

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
which solves a lot.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.264 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm
not going to school.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
I'd just rather do this.

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Ah, I see. Tsumura's
in the same boat as me.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
We're both dealing
with circumstances

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.779 position:50% align:center
that threaten to prevent us
from fulfilling our dreams.

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
But, come on,
that's no reason to quit!

00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.123 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
What?

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
You can't go to Paris.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
No, without a degree,
it's not possible.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
Hold on. What did I say?

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.974 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
No. Not possible?

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
Who said that? Tsumura?

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
Or was it really me?

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
--Anyway...
--[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.148 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] ...thanks for
what you said earlier.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
I think it actually helped
confirm things for me.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
I feel even more determined now.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.574 position:50% align:center
Huh? Miss Fujito?

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI panting]

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
How could I, of all people,

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
say that something
is impossible?

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Chiyuki.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center
I think it's time
to give up now.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Failed. Again.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
You're accepted.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.739 position:50% align:center
You'll be working with us
starting tomorrow if you like.

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
You mean I got it?

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
Yes. I've got
your contract here.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
Fill it out and bring it back.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I knew it was possible!

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
I've got the potential!

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] I passed an
audition for a major agency,

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
just like that! I did it!

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
I've so got this.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 1A]
Fujito! We need to have a talk.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
I'd like an explanation.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by
supermodel and hypermodel?

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
A supermodel is a model who
appears in Paris Fashion Week.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 1A]
Well, that's not exactly

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
common knowledge, you know.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
What's a hypermodel?

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.198 position:50% align:center
A hypermodel.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:11.791 position:50% align:center
A hypermodel... is a model
from my dad's agency.

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
The ones who manage
to get featured in Paris.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
The Mille Neige model
who goes to Paris.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
That's what I've gotta be!

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:23.136 position:50% align:center
I'll be the Mille Neige
model who goes to Paris!

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
Nothing's gonna stop me!
Because I'm never gonna give up!

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
Thanks, great talk!

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
I made up my mind!

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.901 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Runway models aren't
there to showcase themselves.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
They showcase the clothes.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
That's why you need that height.
Those specific proportions.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
All I have to do is wear the
outfit and look amazing in it!

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
Tsumura!

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
Huh? Miss Fujito?

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
Hey! I promise to give you all
my clothes I don't wear anymore!

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
I just need you to
make me look amazing, okay?

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
What?

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
<i>Smile Down the Runway</i> .

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.432 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO'S MOTHER] Wow, you're
making clothes for a model?

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Mm-hm. She's someone
who's in the same class as me.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh.
Now tell me the truth.

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
Could it be that
she's your girlfriend?

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
No, of course not!

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? Then why
are you so embarrassed?

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
I swear, it's not
like that at all.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
We've never even talked,
I mean, not before today.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
Well, your clothes
have always had

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
a special magic that
makes people happy, Ikuto.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
So these will, too.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.835 position:50% align:center
You just wait and see.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center

Thanks.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center

[ICHIKA]
Yay! Iku's home!

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.264 position:50% align:center
We missed you!

[AOI]
Hey, you!

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
Why would you make me a skirt?

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.436 position:50% align:center
I told you that I needed
to be able to move around!

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Ah, check again.

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
If you look, you'll see,
that's actually a skort.

--See, be nice!
--[AOI] Oh.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
But, wait, that's not the point!

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
That hurts. Aoi, stop.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.821 position:50% align:center
That's not nice!

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
And if you don't want it,
Ichika will take it!

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Ikuto. Your plans.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
Have you submitted them yet?

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKA]
Ao, no fair, give it to Ichika!

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Absolutely not!
It's too big on you.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKA]
Give it!

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
So what did you put down?

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
That... I'll find employment.

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ikuto.

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
You don't have to do that
if you don't want to.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.727 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
It's fine, Honoka.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
That's actually
what I want to do.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.522 position:50% align:center
Just work.

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
But you have a passion.

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
You're holding back.

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:46.863 position:50% align:center
And I--I hope you know you
don't have to do everything

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
just like Mom.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:50.909 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKA]
Iku!

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
Noka and Ao, Ichika and Mom.
We're your best customers!

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
The things you make us
are all our very favorites!

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
And that means you're our very
favorite dressmaker, Iku!

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
I promise. You're gonna
be our forever favorite!

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:14.557 position:50% align:center
Also, I could still do what
I want and work on the side.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
Like that last job.
You remember that one?

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
The paper delivery?

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:20.689 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Yup.

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
I was able to
make the owner's son

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
a custom suit for
his entrance ceremony.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
They really loved it.
It was the best.

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
If my clothes make people happy,

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
then really, what
more could I ask for?

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.995 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
But I kind of think
you're missing the point.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Thanks, Honoka,
but I'm happy with my decision.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.301 position:50% align:center
[MODEL 1C]
Thank you very much.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:53.304 position:50% align:center
[TAKAHASHI] Hmm.
You think she'll show up today?

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
I can't decide.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
Who knows...

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
Y'know, I always
wondered something.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
Why haven't we
officially banned her?

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] The president told
her to do whatever she wants.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.859 position:50% align:center
On top of that,

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
she's the type who won't give
up unless she actually wants to.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
So it's our job to keep
telling her she has no talent.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
Over and over again,
as many times as it takes.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.871 position:50% align:center
But that's a pretty tough role.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
Compared to what she's doing,
it's a walk in the park.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:22.667 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
Uh, she's here.

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Right on cue.
Sure, let her in.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:29.049 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
There's nothing more painful

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
than pursuing a hopeless dream.

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
Believe me, Chiyuki.
That's why I do this.

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
I'm going to tell you
repeatedly, again and again,

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:39.476 position:50% align:center
that this isn't for you.

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] You just
don't have what it takes.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU gasps]

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
Um, what is that look?

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
Oh, why, is it weird?

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.303 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
No, I mean...

00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Shizuku, the thing is...

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
...I'm not going to give up.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] My dad started
this modeling agency,

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
and after seeing you walk
at Paris Fashion Week,

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
I've dedicated my entire life
to following this one dream.

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
That's why...

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
...if I gave up now,
then I wouldn't be me!

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
How fun, pursuing a hopeless
dream for the rest of your life.

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
Not hopeless! I'll succeed!

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
You're being
completely ridiculous.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] A petite
Paris Fashion Week model.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
There's no way.
There's just no way.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
But for a moment...

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
...I saw a glimpse of Paris.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Like, one percent.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
I'll be honest, I just
saw a one percent chance.

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
Come to the back later on.
We can go over our contract.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] Mille Neige is exactly
as old as you are, Chiyuki.

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
It was established the
same year you were born.

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
That was a dream of mine.

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:51.775 position:50% align:center
To have a French name
for my company.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
And I named it after the most
precious thing in my life.

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.071 position:50% align:center
Can you guess?

00:19:56.154 --> 00:20:00.033 position:50% align:center
"Mille... neige." Chiyuki.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
It's your name.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
That's right.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
My dream isn't just to
appear in Paris Fashion Week.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:13.296 position:50% align:center
I only want to be there

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center
if I can represent my
dad's company, Mille Neige!

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
Okay, I think
we're all set, now.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you already know this,

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
but you're only
allowed to accept work

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
approved through us
from here on out.

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
That's always been
strictly enforced.

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
What?

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
It happened before
so it doesn't count!

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
What did you do?

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
Well, I might've
done a street snap.

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Ah, yes, where magazines

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
feature random amateurs.

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
Handle yourself
like a professional.

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
Don't bother with that anymore.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:50.959 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
It had been a while since

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
I felt that kind of attention.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:54.963 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Where exactly did it happen?

00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
It was just downstairs,

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
by the agency,
in front of dad's store.

00:20:58.842 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
I was trying to find something

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
that went with
my outfit, but no luck.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Wait, what do you mean?

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
Didn't you buy everything
you're wearing at Mille Neige?

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah! You're right. [laughs]

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I mean, I can't very well say

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
this was made by an amateur!

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
So cute! Love your outfit!
May I ask where it's from?

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh... Well, uh...

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:25.827 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] I'm going to be
a hypermodel really soon!

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
I can't say that it's
handmade by a friend.

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.460 position:50% align:center
Here, at Mille Neige!

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.762 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:45.555 position:50% align:center
Sara! You're up.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.349 position:50% align:center
Why don't you follow me?

00:21:57.484 --> 00:21:58.693 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 1A]
Oh, that's cute.

00:21:58.777 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1G]
Don't you love this?

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.030 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1H]
So much!

00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 1B]
Super cute!

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.159 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1A]
Chiyuki looks great here.

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.787 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1B]
Hey, it's Chiyuki!

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.580 position:50% align:center
[phones ringing]

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:11.998 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE 1A]
We're checking right now.

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:13.583 position:50% align:center
What is going on?

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center
It's this.

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:17.587 position:50% align:center
There's a rush of customers
contacting us about it.

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:19.714 position:50% align:center
How should we handle this, sir?

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.760 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Let me talk to Chiyuki.

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:26.930 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:29.683 position:50% align:center
Yes? You've reached
the Tsumura Dress Shop!

00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:31.518 position:50% align:center
Cut it out, Ichika.

00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:33.937 position:50% align:center
It's for you. Name's Fujito.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.730 position:50% align:center
Who is that, your girlfriend?

00:22:35.814 --> 00:22:37.148 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:41.611 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] Sorry for calling
out of nowhere, Tsumura.

00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:44.698 position:50% align:center
I'm Kenji Fujito,
Mille Neige president.

00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:45.740 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure.

00:22:45.824 --> 00:22:49.703 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same! But, uh,
how can I help?

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:52.163 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] I'm sure you heard
the gist of it from Chiyuki.

00:22:52.247 --> 00:22:53.790 position:50% align:center
So I'll get to the point.

00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:56.167 position:50% align:center
The design that you
created for Chiyuki,

00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:57.335 position:50% align:center
I would like to buy it.

00:22:57.419 --> 00:22:58.586 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.880 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] I apologize
for how this turned out.

00:23:00.964 --> 00:23:02.716 position:50% align:center
Our company got
a lot of unfair credit

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:04.718 position:50% align:center
and recognition
for your hard work.

00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:07.512 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Oh, no.
I'm just glad they liked it.

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:08.930 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
I called you here to talk about

00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:10.974 position:50% align:center
an official launch
of that design.

00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:12.600 position:50% align:center
How does that sound?

00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:15.145 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Amazing! Yes, absolutely!

00:23:15.228 --> 00:23:16.187 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Thank you!

00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:17.856 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I know.

00:23:17.939 --> 00:23:20.233 position:50% align:center
Actually, there's one more
thing, if you don't mind.

00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:21.609 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure!

00:23:21.693 --> 00:23:24.195 position:50% align:center
Not to pressure you,
I'm just putting this out there.

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.239 position:50% align:center
Sadly, we just
lost a designer...

00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:29.451 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
That gaze. I remember it.

00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:31.077 position:50% align:center
You know. How about it?

00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:33.538 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] The same gaze
I felt when I was young.

00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:34.831 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Would you like to design for us?

00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:36.791 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:39.878 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] As if he's
gazing at a rough diamond.

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:42.505 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
That's right.

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:45.592 position:50% align:center
I'm Chiyuki Fujito.
This is my story.

00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:48.553 position:50% align:center
The story of how
I became a top model!

00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:50.055 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI, IKUTO]
And...

00:23:51.306 --> 00:23:53.433 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
...I'm Ikuto Tsumura.

00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:57.145 position:50% align:center
Designers are the true
stars of this industry.

00:23:57.228 --> 00:24:00.899 position:50% align:center
We're nothing without them.
That's why I need your eye.

00:24:00.982 --> 00:24:02.525 position:50% align:center
I know it's kind of a lot,

00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:04.652 position:50% align:center
this being your
first time and all,

00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:06.988 position:50% align:center
but you'll have freedom
to create what you want.

00:24:07.072 --> 00:24:08.490 position:50% align:center
You see,

00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:12.452 position:50% align:center
you're the star of this project,
this story, Ikuto Tsumura.

00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:14.204 position:50% align:center
Get used to it.

00:24:16.206 --> 00:24:19.501 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
And I'm Ikuto Tsumura.

00:24:19.584 --> 00:24:23.588 position:50% align:center
This is my story of how I
became a top fashion designer.

00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:26.800 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Clothes can transform a person.

00:24:26.883 --> 00:24:28.510 position:50% align:center
That's why I wanna make them.

00:24:28.593 --> 00:24:31.096 position:50% align:center
I wanna be a
professional designer.
