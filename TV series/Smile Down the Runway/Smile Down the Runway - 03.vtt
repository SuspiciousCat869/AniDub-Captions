00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:10.051 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Miss Fujito.

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:12.846 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Go away. I'm fine.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.222 position:50% align:center
I know more than anyone else

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:17.726 position:50% align:center
that I don't have the right
to be here right now.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:19.602 position:50% align:center
But I'm doing it.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
Because this show is my chance.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
I've toiled away the
last six months.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
All to make this show a success.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
Everyone is doing their part
to make my show spectacular.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you okay?

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
Chiyuki, don't move!

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:37.954 position:50% align:center
If you get any blood
on yourself,

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
you're going to stain
that dre... dress.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
The rest is up to you.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I can do it.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
I can fix Miss Fujito's dress.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
But only if you let me.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center
Trust me!

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.199 position:50% align:center
What could you possibly do?
What's your plan?

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:41.286 position:50% align:center
I honestly have
no clue, but I'll do it!

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 3A]
Does he even know how to sew?

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me, sir!
We're out of time!

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.918 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] All right. I'll guide
you through the redesign.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:49.919 position:50% align:center
Just do exactly as I say--

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center
It's worse than that!

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but the 40 dresses
are out of order now!

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
So we really can't do this
without you directing us!

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:57.886 position:50% align:center
Tch.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.973 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] You'll find him
intriguing. Trust me.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
Yeah? And will he
be ready to work?

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Sure, he's still young

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
and little rough
around the edges,

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
but he's the type who's
got entire designs

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
from start to finish completely
mapped out in his head.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
You of all people should
know what that's like.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
How difficult it can be.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.454 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hey, Bob!

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:26.831 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
Just promise me you won't forget
what this brand is about.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting--

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
Still on makeup, but
we'll be done in a minute!

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
Where's Ms. Moriyama?

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50% align:center
They took her to the infirmary.

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.640 position:50% align:center
Okay, all set.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'll... do my best.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
This is starting to
feel kinda familiar.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
I got this.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
Just promise me you won't forget
what this brand is about.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Mr. Yanagida's brand
is all about helping

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
the independent woman
feel strong and resilient.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
I need to maintain that feeling

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
while adapting this
to Miss Fujito's size.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
Think. Come on. Think!

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO whimpers]

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] First, let's
maybe go for the obvious

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
and fix the length!

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
Hey, you sure about
cutting that hem?

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
Huh? Should I not be?

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.478 position:50% align:center
I don't know, it's just, Miss
Moriyama said she couldn't, so.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Right, it'd be too
much of a hassle to polish up.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center
I'd have to figure out a way to
prevent the edges from fraying.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
On top of that, thick fabric
takes more time to alter.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
There's no time
to do it by hand.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
Well, then...

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
Should I use the sewing machine?

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.081 position:50% align:center
I've never used
this type before.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
But I've got no choice!

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.836 position:50% align:center
Miss Fujito! Would you
please get undressed for me?

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
Okay. I need a fitter!

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
I don't have a thick enough
needle for this fabric.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.888 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I need durability.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
Do I risk using a thinner one?

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center
Unwieldy material and an
unfamiliar sewing machine...

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50% align:center
If the needle gives
out on me, I'm screwed!

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'm gonna go
draw up a design.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.569 position:50% align:center
What? Hey! There's no time!

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
I know that!

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
That was intense.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I've got to figure out
another way to make this work.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
There's more to fix
than just the hem.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
The dress is way
too big overall.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
And most importantly,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
this piece has to live up
to the Yanagida name!

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
Hey. What do you
think? Is he okay?

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
Doesn't look like it.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 3C]
How much time do we have?

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 3D]
Less than a minute.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 3C]
Yeah... he's not gonna make it.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. This isn't good!
We should start brainstorming!

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
Hey, what if we used
the tallest woman on staff?

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
Like as a replacement model?

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.864 position:50% align:center
Would that work, Mr. Yanagida?

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.375 position:50% align:center
Just look at me.

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
You're good at this, remember?

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
Making me look all
beautiful and stuff?

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:28.888 position:50% align:center
It's showtime.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Go!

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.189 position:50% align:center
Okay, so the show has started.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
Which means I'm up
in about 13 minutes.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
You good?

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.487 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Just now...

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] ...Miss Fujito's
hands... were trembling.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Of course they were.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
I'm not the only one who's
been forced into a corner.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
Know what?

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
This is turning into a thing--

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
you putting me on the spot.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Thank you for that.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
It's what I needed.

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
Leave it up to me!

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.027 position:50% align:center
Hold on, shouldn't
I take this thing off

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
before you begin cutting it up?

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
No.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Please stand perfectly still.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.452 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] What are
Miss Fujito's strengths?

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
First off,
she has a great figure.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
When I saw her photo,

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
one of the first things
that struck me was that

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.503 position:50% align:center
her proportions are no different
from a runway model.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center
She simply lacks
the height, that's all.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.716 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, she's no
different than they are.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Another thing that
shines is her powerful presence.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
She has this great energy.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
Because of that,
she was even able to

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
get me out of my own head,
which is no small feat.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
Now on to the dress.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
It's designed to
be an elegant shape

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
that conceals the
lines of the body.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:08.863 position:50% align:center
However, if I want to showcase
Miss Fujito's best qualities,

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:10.532 position:50% align:center
the dress is going
to need some texture

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
to match her youthful energy.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.536 position:50% align:center
I want to make a dress

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
that makes her feel
comfortable and in charge.

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Tsumura?

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Hmm. Please excuse
me for just a minute.

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
Uh... What the heck
are you doing down there?

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Ow, Ow! Ouch!

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:26.464 position:50% align:center
Would you stop?

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
I'm doing something
about the length!

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
The dress has
a sort of a cushion

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:33.179 position:50% align:center
that was built in to create
a very specific shape.

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:35.515 position:50% align:center
We're gonna need
to take it out first.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
But don't worry, it's so dark in
here and I can't see anything!

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
Seriously, nothing at all!

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
Would you shut up?!

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Look, please just
bear with me! There's no time!

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
So weird.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
He was super flustered seeing
naked girls just a minute ago.

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Shoot. I hope I don't smell.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
I did just run over here.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Miss Fujito, could you
open your legs a bit wider?

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI grunts]

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Oof! Hey! Ow!

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Okay. I'm going to shorten this.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
What? You <i>are</i> cutting it?

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Yep! I am!

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
I realized that if
I can't process this hem,

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
my only choice is
make it disappear!

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.347 position:50% align:center
So...

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
He's rolling it up.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Now we're gonna use this belt!

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.522 position:50% align:center
Obviously, the back is
as important as the front.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] There's no way
I could sew together

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
a big bundle of
thick fabric in time.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
Solution? Tie it up!

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Bob! Five-minute call!

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I need to make sure

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
Miss Fujito walks this runway!

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Hang tight, okay?

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
I just need to get this
finished up real quick!

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:09:56.012 --> 00:10:00.433 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Think! There's no time
to waste, so figure it out.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
Factor in the
quality of the fabric

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
and the desired silhouette
with no pattern and no test run!

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
I gotta get it
right on the first try.

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Almost there...

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Almost there.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Almost there!

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Damn it!

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
I bet it's not ready yet, right?

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
No worries. I have
a feeling we'll be able

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
to buy you just
a little more time.

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO] Oh, weird.
The music just shifted.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
Because they're
going for elegance.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
You can tell by the way
the models are walking now.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.531 position:50% align:center
They are walking slower.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
Every time one of us
came back from the runway,

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
your dress had changed again.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
Everyone's excited
to see how it turns out!

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
[MODEL 2A]
You can do this.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Miss Fujito.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hm?

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
The dream that
I told you about--

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
it already came true.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Huh? What do you mean?

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I wanted you
to wear my clothes again.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
And, look, here you are.

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
Wait, what're you talking about?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
This isn't your brand.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center
So there's no way
this dress counts.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
You had better get on it.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
At the rate things are going,

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
I might already be a
hypermodel you can't afford

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50% align:center
by the time you're finally
starting up as a designer.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
Chop, chop!

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
You were trembling earlier,
which seems telling, for you.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
Wait. You watched me?

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.502 position:50% align:center
It's more like... I felt it.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
Felt it? That's creepy!

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
Listen, just don't get
nervous and fall, okay?

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
Who do you think I am? I got it!

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
The model's coming
back in ten seconds!

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
All right, Miss Fujito.

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Good luck.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO, CHIYUKI]
<i>Smile Down the Runway</i> .

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO sighs]

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
What? Are you
bored now, Niinuma?

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
You have to pay attention
to the designs.

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
The models all just seem totally
bored and expressionless.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
This show's about
showcasing the clothing.

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
Bringing attention
to their faces

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
would be far too distracting.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
That's why models aren't ever
supposed to smile on the runway.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
It's what works.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
That's why it's
industry standard.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.645 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO] She's just giving me
the generic textbook answer

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:52.605 position:50% align:center
because I'm young.

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
I know there's
no way I could ever

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center
look that amazing
when I dress up.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
And even if I did, it's not
like anyone would notice.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
Nothing looks good
on a shorty like me.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
Nothing will ever change that.

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
What... is this?

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
When you don't fit in,

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
it's hard not to
make a fool of yourself.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO gasps]

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
Even I've gone through a phase

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
where I was
interested in fashion.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
Look at her. She's so tiny.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
How is she in this show?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
[ALL murmuring]

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:40.487 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 3B]
Huh? What is this?

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 3C]
Some kind of mishap?

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 3D]
Looks that way.

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 3C]
It has to be, I mean,

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
there's no other way a girl that
short gets to walk the runway.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI sighs]
There it is, the commotion.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
But don't pay any attention.
None of that matters.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.881 position:50% align:center
Everything in
front of me is white.

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
And all I hear...

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
...is the pounding of my
heart and the faint music.

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
Was I ever the type
to get this nervous?

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
How was Tsumura so chill?

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center
I can't afford to be
worried right now.

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
Plus...

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center
...if I am, Tsumura wins.
Definitely can't have that.

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
Niinuma, would
you please sit down?

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.579 position:50% align:center
But do you see?

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:34.624 position:50% align:center
That dress was made to fit
that tiny model perfectly.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, of course.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:40.547 position:50% align:center
It was obviously tailored
specifically for her.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
It's an interesting choice.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.509 position:50% align:center
Maybe Hajime Yanagida
wanted to make

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
some kind of a statement
by using her as a model.

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:51.474 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Get ready for the finale.

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:52.767 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:01.151 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME gasps] Hold on!
Why is number 15 missing?

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.319 position:50% align:center
You were specifically
told to choose the shoes

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
from numbers one through 12!

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but number
15 was the smallest,

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
so it was the best
fit for the model.

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Idiot!

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
You should've listened!
Those heels are broken!

See?

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
That's what you get
for trying to fit in

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
where you don't belong.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO] You fail,
and everyone laughs at you.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
Look at that.

Bob, tell me.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
How did you know to do that?

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
I had no idea she was going
to fall down, I swear I didn't.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center
But... things were tense,
so I wanted to lighten the mood.

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.697 position:50% align:center
A shape-shifting dress
sounded really fun to me.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:52.077 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] That's why I didn't
tie off the last thread.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
Like the flutter of a butterfly.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.838 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO] Everyone's
looking, but she's fine.

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:05.298 position:50% align:center
So...

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
...if it's okay to try
to fit in where you don't,

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
then... can I try, too?

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.599 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Shoot. I ruined it.

00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
How'd this happen?

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
The heel gave out?

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
It didn't come off,
but it's pretty unstable.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
Looks like I'll have to change

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:26.653 position:50% align:center
my walk for the
rest of the runway.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I've got this.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.616 position:50% align:center

Sheesh. What a punk.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Right on brand.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
That little chicken can't seem
to do anything without my help.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
Chiyuki, as a runway model,

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
there are two
things that you should

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
always try your
best to remember.

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
First and foremost,
you can never fall.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
And second...

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
...never smile on the runway.

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:04.441 position:50% align:center
That dress better
still look good

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
when she stands back up, Bob.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It will.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.866 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] I don't get it,
Tsumura. You're so annoying.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
I don't know how you
keep saving me like this!

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
She smiled... on the runway!

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
--I, uh...

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:29.215 position:50% align:center
--[applause]
--I, uh...

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. What's wrong?

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center
It's just... is this okay?

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.932 position:50% align:center
She's tiny like me.

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
She doesn't
belong here, and yet...

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course it's okay.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
[YAGAMI]
It's a huge success.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Shoot! I got distracted.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:59.329 position:50% align:center
I even smiled! Poker face!

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO] This reminds me of
something a writer once said.

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.424 position:50% align:center
One who bravely declares
they aren't trying to please

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
their readers or deliver
a certain message

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
or fit into a particular mold.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
Art is about being honest.

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
Being who you want to be.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter
what anyone else thinks.

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center
People create in order
to express themselves

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:29.275 position:50% align:center
and discover who they are.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
That's the whole reason we write
or design or do anything!

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
The same goes for fashion.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
Why'd I care so much
about what others thought?

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
Fashion is something
you have to make your own!

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.416 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI sighs]

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
Someone, switch out her
heels out right now!

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
[sighs] No, it's okay.
I'll keep going with these.

00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI sighs]

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] Quick! Get her
some water and an ice pack.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
[FITTER 2A]
That was amazing! Great job!

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I only did two trips
and my legs are screaming at me.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Wait. Where's Tsumura?

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:40.221 position:50% align:center
So get ready, because
the responsibility's yours.

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:41.723 position:50% align:center
Our success is on you.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
Just promise me you won't forget
what this brand is about.

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Fine, I'll give you half.

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
Half of this applause
goes to you tonight.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
A split's the best I can do.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
It is my brand.

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
That work for you?

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.623 position:50% align:center
But I didn't--

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Sure, I know,
your design was simple.

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.460 position:50% align:center
You used an apron
to cover up the portion

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
that had been altered and
had therefore lost its shape.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
But, somehow,
you made it happen.

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
A standing ovation.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
Most importantly, you made that
dress look good for the model--

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
for her.

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:29.604 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
The door's over there!

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
Go home.

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Please let me help you.

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
Please, Mr. Yanagida!

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
In this business we call all
the kids like you "wannabes."

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
Well, there you go.

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
You might have a
speck of potential

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
as a designer after all.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
A-A designer.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:54.963 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I'm sorry.

00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
I can't really find
my words right now.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:00.010 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
He's gone.

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hey!

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you be, like,

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
showering me with
praise right about now?

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Yeah, sorry. I was out of it.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
Figures.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Next time we're here,

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
let's go ahead and take
credit for all of the applause.

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:21.948 position:50% align:center
Not just half.

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
How does that sound?

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.536 position:50% align:center
Good to you?

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:29.497 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
I'm getting greedy for more.
Guess you're rubbing off on me.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't get too
carried away if I were you.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
You didn't even succeed.

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
You couldn't finish
the fix on time,

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
so everything had to be changed.

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
The tempo of the song,
its particular arrangement,

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
and the walking speed
were all carefully planned

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
and timed out
for those pieces.

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
Since everything
went out the window,

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
the show wasn't at its best.

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
Yes, we still received
a standing ovation,

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
and that's because
of Mr. Hajime's

00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:59.361 position:50% align:center
39 wonderful dresses--

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:02.989 position:50% align:center
not because of <i>one</i>
dress you tailored.

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:05.408 position:50% align:center
Seriously, get over yourself.

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.411 position:50% align:center
What's her problem?

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:10.789 position:50% align:center
I don't know, but she's right.

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:14.125 position:50% align:center
Look at it, my fixes
were incomplete, at best.

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:17.629 position:50% align:center
The fabric around the
waist barely holds its shape.

00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:19.089 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't been smart enough

00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:20.840 position:50% align:center
to keep your hand on
your hip to hide it,

00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:24.594 position:50% align:center
then the awkward part would've
been completely exposed.

00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:29.516 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Miss Fujito.

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:33.269 position:50% align:center
I really can't thank you enough
for making this happen for me.

00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:35.730 position:50% align:center
So much has happened
since we first met.

00:22:35.814 --> 00:22:37.565 position:50% align:center
I feel like...

00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:39.693 position:50% align:center
...it's as if I'm living
somebody else's life

00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:41.111 position:50% align:center
or something.

00:22:41.194 --> 00:22:42.320 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:44.989 position:50% align:center
I can't figure out how
to get this across.

00:22:46.324 --> 00:22:48.618 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Ahh, so basically,
you're saying that your life

00:22:48.702 --> 00:22:51.246 position:50% align:center
has changed
because of me, right?

00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:53.415 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah, I think so.

00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:56.209 position:50% align:center
But when you say it,
it's embarrassing.

00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:57.293 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Are you kidding me?

00:22:57.377 --> 00:22:58.628 position:50% align:center
Don't you realize
that you've done

00:22:58.712 --> 00:23:01.214 position:50% align:center
the exact same thing for
me that I've done for you?

00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:02.757 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:05.844 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] You know, we all
wear clothes all the time.

00:23:05.927 --> 00:23:08.096 position:50% align:center
Think about it.
Clothes are always with you,

00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:12.017 position:50% align:center
even when you're at a major
crossroads in your life.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.561 position:50% align:center
That's why, sometimes
special feelings become

00:23:14.644 --> 00:23:16.938 position:50% align:center
attached to certain outfits.

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:18.314 position:50% align:center
Clothes most definitely have

00:23:18.398 --> 00:23:21.651 position:50% align:center
the power to transform
someone's life.

00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:23.945 position:50% align:center
Niinuma, you actually wanted

00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:27.115 position:50% align:center
to be in the literature
division, right?

00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:31.077 position:50% align:center
Want me to put in a word
for you to the chief editor?

00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:33.788 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying we were
perfect or anything.

00:23:33.872 --> 00:23:35.999 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that fitter
was totally right.

00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:39.127 position:50% align:center
We both have our
flaws to deal with.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:43.006 position:50% align:center
But even so, we got
that standing ovation.

00:23:43.089 --> 00:23:44.883 position:50% align:center
That means people
were really moved.

00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:47.218 position:50% align:center
All the elements must've
come together with your dress

00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:49.262 position:50% align:center
and the way I wore it.

00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:50.764 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:23:50.847 --> 00:23:53.391 position:50% align:center
We might've changed someone
else's life out there, too.

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:58.438 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
No. I'd like to stay here.

00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:00.565 position:50% align:center
I have more to learn.

00:24:12.285 --> 00:24:15.163 position:50% align:center
I want to become a designer.

00:24:15.246 --> 00:24:18.124 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be
a designer no matter what.

00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:21.044 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.973 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] It's going to be
a long and difficult road

00:25:57.057 --> 00:25:58.933 position:50% align:center
for me to become a professional.

00:25:59.017 --> 00:26:01.561 position:50% align:center
But I'll never give up,
no matter what!

00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:03.980 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Young Talents."
