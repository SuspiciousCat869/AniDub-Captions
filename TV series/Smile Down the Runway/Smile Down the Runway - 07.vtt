00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.975 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] The winter of
my last year in junior high...

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.186 position:50% align:center
...I stopped growing.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.980 position:50% align:center
And suddenly,
I started hearing murmurs

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.191 position:50% align:center
of disappointment
all around me.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.402 position:50% align:center
I often found myself
looking down at my legs

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
and wondering why.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.572 position:50% align:center
Hey, keep your head up.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:57.075 position:50% align:center
Chiyuki,

00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:00.829 position:50% align:center
what do you think a model
needs more than anything else?

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:01.663 position:50% align:center
To be tall.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.039 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
No.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.084 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I'm so sorry!

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.087 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I know I'm late.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.008 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
No, what's most important...

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.676 position:50% align:center
...is your aura.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.055 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Height is just another tool

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.808 position:50% align:center
that can help you project
the right energy.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.853 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
So don't forget.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.896 position:50% align:center
Keep your head up.

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:30.984 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Let your soul
shine through your eyes.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.738 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] And walk into
the room with confidence.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50% align:center
That's the mark of
a true professional.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.075 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.703 position:50% align:center
I'm Chiyuki Fujito
of Mille Neige.

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:43.038 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:45.623 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
What's this?

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.083 position:50% align:center
Using a short model like her

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.462 position:50% align:center
will only bring down the
quality of the final product.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center
Get her out of here.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.380 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.798 position:50% align:center
[AKASAKA]
Uhh...

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:57.427 position:50% align:center
All right. Who called
in this model?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.970 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Uh, pardon me, ma'am!

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
Please wait. Tell
me about the shoot.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.599 position:50% align:center
I brought my own heels.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.809 position:50% align:center
They're between 12
and 15 centimeters,

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
so they help a lot.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
As long as our feet
won't be visible,

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.107 position:50% align:center
it should work out fine.
No one will know!

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:15.695 position:50% align:center
Well, I did say to get whoever
was available for the shoot.

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.199 position:50% align:center
Would you be willing to let
us off the hook this time?

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. This will
be our set-up for today.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] So I guess... it
really could've been whoever.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Well then,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.219 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to
give it my best!

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
My face will be hidden,

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:44.099 position:50% align:center
but whatever's visible can
still be stunning... right?

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
If I'm prepared.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Excuse me, do you happen to know

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
how you'll be posing today?

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.481 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Solidify a plan.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be the best
supporting model I can be!

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
--[CHIYUKI] Hello?
--[KOKORO gasps]

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] Sorry! Were--
Were you talking to me?

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
[MODEL 7A] If you're
unmotivated, just leave.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
[MODEL 7B]
Is this a joke?

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
Are we really just masked
props for that one girl?

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
That's right.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
She's not my only rival here.
This place is full of 'em.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
Do you understand
where an aura comes from?

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
Two places.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
The first is
through your bearing.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.227 position:50% align:center
That includes your posture,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
mannerisms, and
finally, your height.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
[CAMERAMAN 7A]
Ms. Hasegawa isn't ready,

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
so could we get everyone
else for rehearsal, please?

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.863 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
Where else?

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
I'm just saying, how does
the lead miss rehearsal?

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
I know, it's so irresponsible.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
And the second spot,
well... that's right here.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] A strong aura is
powered by your self-confidence.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI gasps]

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
So here's the lesson--

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
any time you open the
door to new challenges,

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
you can expect
to face new trials.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] You'll find that
rude and immature people

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
are pretty much everywhere.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
Tempting as it may be,

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
don't look for relief
by putting others down.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
Don't try to justify your own
issues through toxic behavior.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
That won't build confidence.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
An audience might
very well see something,

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
but it won't be your aura.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.567 position:50% align:center
[CAMERAMAN 7A]
Hey, actually.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
The tiny girl on the far right,
you're ruining the balance.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.698 position:50% align:center
Could you go ahead and step out?

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:05.907 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
[CAMERAMAN 7A] Huh...
Guess we've got a problem, huh?

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys! Anyone have
some black gloves?

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] It could be
retouched, though, couldn't it?

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
[CAMERAMAN 7A] Well, I don't
want to count on anything.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.141 position:50% align:center
I'll do two versions
just in case.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.769 position:50% align:center
Black gloves? I have some.

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.354 position:50% align:center
Great, that's a relief.

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
Ms. Hasegawa's left hand is
totally covered in little cuts.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:41.901 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I was listening,

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
but in my heart,
all I could think was

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
the only way I can keep fighting
is if I'm still on stage.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50% align:center
Hey. I'm sorry.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
For causing trouble, I mean.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.708 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Don't worry about it.

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Being careful not to get cut up

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.920 position:50% align:center
is pretty stinking
basic, though.

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
Take this seriously!

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
There are plenty of models

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
who'd love to be
in your position.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50% align:center
They'd give anything.
We want what you have.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
It's not fair.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50% align:center
Why? Why?

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Chiyuki.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
Putting others down
won't foster confidence.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] I'm Chiyuki
Fujito of Mille Neige.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
I'd like to give you my card.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
I work hard and I'd really
appreciate your consideration.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
That girl, she's tough.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
What a shame,
if only she were taller.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.092 position:50% align:center
Because at a 158 centimeters,

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
no designer is going to want
to book her for a show.

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That's done.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
She really is an amazing model.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.026 position:50% align:center
Of course, I've seen
a lot of those.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
Still, she had
something different.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
It was almost as if she
was closing off her heart.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] Which is what creates
that unique aura around her.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.623 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Ms. Igarashi.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] Please, will you
please stop doing this?

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, kid.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
Talent always wins
out in the end.

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
You'll see that one day.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
Even so...

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.263 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
But I don't like it.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
It isn't fair!

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
Others shouldn't
suffer because of me.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I'm begging you!

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.611 position:50% align:center
Please let me quit modeling!

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You're telling
me you can't handle

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
people getting dismissed
because of you?

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.620 position:50% align:center
Am I understanding correctly?

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
That's not what I said.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
What are you saying?

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
That it's my fault?

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.129 position:50% align:center
What, are you implying
that you felt sorry for me?

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
Well, I resent that!

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
You have zero right
to feel pity for me!

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.846 position:50% align:center
And listen, it's not my business
how you feel about modeling,

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:17.932 position:50% align:center
but at least
I'm serious about it!

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
You...

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center
You didn't even
come in prepared!

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
That wasn't good.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I held it together earlier.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center
Why not now?

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI yells]

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.164 position:50% align:center
I'm not crying!

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:41.790 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
'Kay!

I'm not crying!

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
I'm not, okay?!

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
Ah! I'm not!

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
Hasegawa.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
We're going back to the office.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
At least I'm serious about it!

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] Ms. Igarashi,
please let me quit modeling!

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Don't worry,

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
I'll still finish out the
bookings I've accepted.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
All right?

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hey! Are you serious?

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
Were you listening to
a word I said just now?

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
You've really got
some nerve, lady.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I am serious.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
I'm serious about
becoming a real designer!

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
Not a chance.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
The key to happiness is knowing
where your talents thrive.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
Trust me on that.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you again--

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
your body is a treasure
to the modeling world.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
To waste it on the
design industry--

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
I simply won't allow that.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
I suppose that shoot for <i>MODE</i>
sure was a tough one, huh?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
If it makes you feel better, my
first gig was a nightmare, too.

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Oh, dear. What's all this?

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
There, there now.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna grab some dinner?

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] If you're
not fit for your dream,

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
then you've got three choices.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
Only three.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
You can give up...

[MODEL 7D cries]

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
...go at it fair and square

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
and face inevitable defeat...

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
...or do whatever it takes to
make your dream come true,

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
clinging to it for dear life.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
That's how I succeeded.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.683 position:50% align:center
And I was happy.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
I got to walk for
Lale Faun, my dream brand.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
Of course I was happy.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
Or at least that's
what I thought.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.778 position:50% align:center
By then, my heart
had become jaded.

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
I couldn't see the beauty
in any of the scenery.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:24.953 position:50% align:center
So? How is that model
of yours getting along?

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
She begged me to let
her quit again today.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
Oh, my.

[IGARASHI gasps]
Shizuku?

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:39.009 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey! Been quite a while.
It's so good to see you.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
But why...?

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
Miwako!

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.722 position:50% align:center
Okay, it was me!

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
I thought it might
be good for you guys

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.017 position:50% align:center
to talk since you're
both managers...

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
...who just happen
to be former models.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
Talk?

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.772 position:50% align:center
I don't have
anything to say to her.

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
Hey, is that any way to
treat your former colleague?

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:58.945 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'll take a
Macallan on the rocks.

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
You've been managing
a pretty great model, right?

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
Miss Kokoro Hasegawa, wasn't it?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI gasps]

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:12.334 position:50% align:center
As long as she's there,
the agency stays afloat.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center
I'd be worried if I were you.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.381 position:50% align:center
Why would Mille Neige
keep such a tiny model?

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:19.799 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I don't
even understand

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
how you can afford to do it.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
How sweet. Are you
really concerned about me?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
Nope.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Hmm.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
Watching Chiyuki struggle
to fit into this industry

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center
seems kinda hard for you.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
Does it remind you
of your past self?

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
She isn't just unfit.
She's finished!

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
The truth is,

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
I chose to pursue my dream
no matter what it took

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.699 position:50% align:center
and it didn't make me happy.

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
In the end, I had to
find a place in the world

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
where I could thrive
on my talent alone--

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
just like you.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
Do you still resent me
for quitting Bon Rouge?

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
I've been wondering.

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.047 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.174 position:50% align:center
You made the right choice.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
And I only just realized...

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:10.058 position:50% align:center
...Hasegawa is
facing that choice now.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:13.812 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
But she's going to fail.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
It's simply impossible.
She'll never become a designer.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
We can only do
what we're able to do.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:29.786 position:50% align:center
That tiny model? She'd better
prepare for the worst.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I thought so, too.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
I actually already
told her that.

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
But, no, we're both wrong.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:41.047 position:50% align:center
Chiyuki's nowhere
close to being done.

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center
Nepotism doesn't
look good on you.

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:47.178 position:50% align:center
That's not what's going on.

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you, just wait.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
You'll see like I did.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
Give her a chance and
she'll show you herself.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.479 position:50% align:center
Her aura--

00:14:56.563 --> 00:15:00.942 position:50% align:center
sometimes she radiates
this incredible quality!

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI gasps]

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
I've decided,

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.660 position:50% align:center
wherever she chooses to go,

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
I'll be right there beside her
on the journey, come what may.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] And what if the
defeat shatters her in the end?

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
You know it can.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] You can't be
sure that'll happen.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
But I'll be there...
to comfort her.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
That's that.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:41.483 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ikuto, is your
favorite part the design work,

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:42.942 position:50% align:center
or making the clothes?

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
I can't say I've ever thought
of the two as separate things.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.656 position:50% align:center
Why the sudden question?

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
Dude, I only asked because
our conversation lagged.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
You're welcome.

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Right. Sorry.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.164 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
You okay? Did something happen?

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.546 position:50% align:center
You just seem a
little down today.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
Aw, look at you, being
all clever and sensitive!

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
Are you hitting on me right now?

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.555 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm heading to
Paris over summer break,

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
so I guess I might
be a little nervous.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:17.394 position:50% align:center
So, uh--

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Hey, that's right!

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
You're starting a new job
tomorrow, aren't you?

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
Guess we're both putting
ourselves out there!

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
We'll knock 'em dead!

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I have a feeling
Paris wasn't the thing

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.662 position:50% align:center
that was distracting Chiyuki.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
I wonder...

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
Maybe something bad happened
while she was working.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
Hey, what a surprise!

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Uh, Miss Kokoro?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.510 position:50% align:center
Hello?

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Oh! Sorry about that!

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
I was in my own world.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
Listen, are you all right?

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
The second round's tomorrow,

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.854 position:50% align:center
so maybe you should
take it easy today.

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
I can't afford to slack off.

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go all out for
work and the competition!

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.194 position:50% align:center
Whatever you say.

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] So have they
said what task is gonna be?

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
Oh, yeah.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
That day, they'll give us each a
design and we have to make it.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
How weird.

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
I mean, isn't that actually
a patternmaker's job?

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.001 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
I've been cramming practice.

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
Is your favorite part the design
work, or making the clothes?

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
I really like doing both.

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
Although...

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I completed the task!

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
All right. Let Big One
handle the final check.

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
You'll have another task.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Yes, sir!

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Big One! Pay attention!

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay!

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I wonder what kind of design

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
they'll give us for
the second round.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
Pleats? Flares?

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
Hey! What's taking so long?

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO gasps]
Sorry, sir!

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
I'm finished.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Get out.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
What job did I assign you?

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
Huh? I, uh--

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
I told you to do a final check
on the coat that was finished.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
So tell me something,

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
what's this?

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
Why were there two marking
pins left in the coat?

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Even a child could've
handled this, but you failed.

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:37.784 position:50% align:center
Mr. Yanagida, please!

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Shut it! Hurry up and go.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
You annoy me.

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I'm... really sorry.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
Kokoro...

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
Forget what he said!
You can't go!

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
I...

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
I'm just...

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry for messing up.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
It was stupid.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
I know better.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO crying]

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
It's okay.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
Everything is fine.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
Let's go apologize.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.585 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
He'll understand.

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
No way. I'm done.

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
You're so stubborn!

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
I don't get it! Why aren't
you even willing to listen?

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
Shut your mouth!
You keep causing all the drama!

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
Come on! Look at her!

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to back off.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center
That's a cheap apology!

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
Think you can get away with
everything by bowing like that?

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
I don't!

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
But you've put her in
an impossible position!

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
If the boss commands us to quit,
then what are we supposed to do?

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
How can we show we're sincere?

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:01.159 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME grunts]

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
It won't happen again.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
I swear. I'll pay
much closer attention.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
Please, let me
keep working here!

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Please, sir!

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.388 position:50% align:center
Pick your head up.
It's an eyesore.

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
If you're feeling incompetent,
then focus on two things.

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
Are you listening?

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
Always be improving your skills,

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
and if you're given a task,
give it your all.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
Once you swear something,
you'd best follow through.

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
Right. Of course!

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.448 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Oh, yeah.

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
And pass that next round
no matter what.

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:45.995 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, I'll just be
humiliated for hiring you.

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO gasps]

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO] Gotta practice
every type of pattern!

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
We're here.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.690 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
We're in this building?

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
My studio's on
the basement level.

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:21.031 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Come on in.

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. This rocks.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
[TOH] If you're going to
be working here with me,

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
I'll have to explain
a couple things.

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what
I told you the other night?

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:35.295 position:50% align:center
My goal?

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
Oh. That you're hoping
to get the approval

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:40.717 position:50% align:center
of your grandmother to
launch your own brand?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
That's the one.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:43.928 position:50% align:center
But there's a problem, you see.

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
I'm seen as a successor
to the great Mai Ayano.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.477 position:50% align:center
I'm expected to inherit
my grandmother's brand.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.936 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
[TOH] So why don't I want to
succeed Aphro I Dite? Heh.

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.400 position:50% align:center
The answer's pretty simple.

00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:00.153 position:50% align:center
I don't want to create
Mai Ayano's designs.

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
It's honestly nothing more
complicated than that.

00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:05.450 position:50% align:center
No juicy drama.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.243 position:50% align:center
I'm also very focused
on putting my all

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
into this year's Geika Festival.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:10.538 position:50% align:center
It's the prime opportunity

00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:12.957 position:50% align:center
to get approval from
my grandmother.

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:14.834 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:22:14.918 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
[TOH] The Geika Festival
fashion show tends to double

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.839 position:50% align:center
as an unofficial buyer's market.

00:22:19.923 --> 00:22:21.549 position:50% align:center
Wanna know something crazy?

00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:23.510 position:50% align:center
When she participated
as a student,

00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:26.179 position:50% align:center
she received 52
requests for her designs

00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:28.139 position:50% align:center
after they were seen in show.

00:22:28.223 --> 00:22:28.973 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Whoa.

00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:31.059 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna do better.

00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:34.979 position:50% align:center
I think that'll prove that
I'm ready to step out on my own.

00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:36.231 position:50% align:center
This show is my last chance

00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:38.358 position:50% align:center
to attempt to break
that 40 year-old record,

00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:41.569 position:50% align:center
so I have to try.

00:22:41.653 --> 00:22:43.780 position:50% align:center
That's why I wanna go
at it with the best plan

00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:46.116 position:50% align:center
and the best
collaborators possible.

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:49.619 position:50% align:center
Did you know that you're allowed
to have a team for the finals?

00:22:49.703 --> 00:22:51.037 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:53.873 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
So, Ikuto...

00:22:53.957 --> 00:22:57.043 position:50% align:center
...I hope you'll
consider joining my team...

00:22:57.127 --> 00:22:58.962 position:50% align:center
...as a patternmaker.

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:00.171 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:01.423 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:02.424 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:23:02.507 --> 00:23:04.217 position:50% align:center
[TOH]
Please, I'm only kidding.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.427 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.637 position:50% align:center
You're such a good guy, Ikuto.

00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:10.098 position:50% align:center
I think you were
really considering it.

00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:12.809 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Phew! What a relief.

00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:15.353 position:50% align:center
I was seriously trying to
figure out how I could say no.

00:23:15.437 --> 00:23:17.313 position:50% align:center
I seem to have been mistaken.

00:23:17.397 --> 00:23:18.648 position:50% align:center
You see,

00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:20.108 position:50% align:center
I thought maybe as long
as you could make clothes,

00:23:20.191 --> 00:23:22.152 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't care that much
about being a designer.

00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:25.488 position:50% align:center
Huh? No, that's not true at all!

00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:29.951 position:50% align:center
I wanna design! It's
the main thing I wanna do!

00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:32.203 position:50% align:center
I'm really happy to hear that.

00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:35.457 position:50% align:center
Well, afraid I've gotta
take off for the second round.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.875 position:50% align:center
That's it for this afternoon.

00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:38.626 position:50% align:center
What? You're going, too?

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.796 position:50% align:center
[TOH] Oh, yeah,
can I ask you something?

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.257 position:50% align:center
That girl--

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:45.759 position:50% align:center
she wasn't going to participate

00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:48.136 position:50% align:center
in the festival
initially, right?

00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:50.388 position:50% align:center
But now she's working
incredibly hard every day

00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:53.433 position:50% align:center
to get past the preliminaries.

00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:56.353 position:50% align:center
She must have
a specific reason for it.

00:23:56.436 --> 00:23:59.856 position:50% align:center
Tell me, if Kokoro
makes it to the finals,

00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:02.359 position:50% align:center
will you be able
to compete against her?

00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:07.280 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
How do I even answer that?

00:24:07.364 --> 00:24:10.116 position:50% align:center
I guess it's never
occurred to me.

00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:13.953 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Miss Kokoro and I are rivals.

00:24:14.037 --> 00:24:15.955 position:50% align:center
But while that's true...

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:18.375 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzing]

00:24:18.458 --> 00:24:19.626 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:24:22.837 --> 00:24:23.922 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Miss Kokoro!

00:24:24.005 --> 00:24:25.799 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're here!

00:24:25.882 --> 00:24:26.633 position:50% align:center
So?

00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:29.052 position:50% align:center
The second round's finished.

00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:30.261 position:50% align:center
Did you...?

00:24:30.345 --> 00:24:32.389 position:50% align:center
[KOKORO]
I passed it!

00:24:32.472 --> 00:24:35.392 position:50% align:center
I really did! I passed
the second round!

00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:38.645 position:50% align:center
It's done. I'm moving on.

00:24:38.728 --> 00:24:40.855 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, congratulations!

00:24:40.939 --> 00:24:44.109 position:50% align:center
And that means I get
to be in the finals now!

00:24:44.192 --> 00:24:48.238 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful and
so glad I didn't give up!

00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:50.407 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:24:51.366 --> 00:24:52.492 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Wow.

00:24:52.575 --> 00:24:55.704 position:50% align:center
Miss Kokoro deserves
every bit of this.

00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:58.498 position:50% align:center
That's why I'll...

00:26:29.673 --> 00:26:30.674 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA]
Everyone,

00:26:30.757 --> 00:26:34.094 position:50% align:center
congratulations on
making the finals!

00:26:34.177 --> 00:26:37.722 position:50% align:center
Now I think it's about time
for us to reveal the theme.

00:26:37.806 --> 00:26:41.434 position:50% align:center
The theme for the finals
is the Japanese letter "wa."

Anything associated
with "wa" is fine by me!

00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:49.859 position:50% align:center
Just promise me you'll make the
collection your very own, okay?

00:26:49.943 --> 00:26:51.236 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
"Wa"?

[STUDENT 7A]
Excuse me.

00:26:53.488 --> 00:26:56.491 position:50% align:center
How should we arrange
to have a runway model?

00:26:56.574 --> 00:26:58.201 position:50% align:center
[TAKAOKA]
Ah! A good question.

00:26:58.284 --> 00:26:59.953 position:50% align:center
You can obviously use the models

00:27:00.036 --> 00:27:01.871 position:50% align:center
which will be
provided by the school,

00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:05.375 position:50% align:center
or you can make arrangements
for one yourself, if you wish.

00:27:05.458 --> 00:27:06.543 position:50% align:center
Your choice.

00:27:06.626 --> 00:27:08.795 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] That means
I can ask Miss Chiyuki!

[phone ringing]

00:27:10.714 --> 00:27:13.341 position:50% align:center
Ikuto, c'mon, you gotta pick up.

She's in a critical condition.

[DOCTOR 7A]
Prep for emergency surgery!

00:27:20.724 --> 00:27:22.559 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Mother is--

00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:26.896 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Why're people like this?

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.317 position:50% align:center
Why do they take advantage
of the things I value most?

00:27:31.401 --> 00:27:33.945 position:50% align:center
