[KENJI]
Wait, you're in high school?

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.352 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.563 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] But Chiyuki told me
you were a Geika student.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:50.610 position:50% align:center
[sighs] It looks like
you lied to me, Chiyuki.

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:52.487 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.990 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I'll have
to take back my offer.

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:59.160 position:50% align:center
We're looking for a designer
who can get to work right away.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.579 position:50% align:center
We could've made it work if
you went to a fashion college,

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:05.000 position:50% align:center
but we can't hire
such a young amateur.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.085 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:08.336 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Chiyuki,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.797 position:50% align:center
listen, don't let
this to go to your head.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.090 position:50% align:center
You only managed to get here

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.217 position:50% align:center
because of Tsumura's
efforts, young lady.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.137 position:50% align:center
You can't keep being
disrespectful like this.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.640 position:50% align:center
We both know you simply
don't have the talent...

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:21.808 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
That was harsh.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.184 position:50% align:center
This is pretty awkward.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.019 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Do you understand?

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.106 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.819 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Uh--!

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:36.072 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm the one who
asked her to stay quiet.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.908 position:50% align:center
I didn't want anybody to
know I was making clothes.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.994 position:50% align:center
I never wanted to
be a real designer.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.997 position:50% align:center
And honestly, it's not
that big of a deal to me.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.707 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.295 position:50% align:center
All right, Ichika.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:53.048 position:50% align:center
Your big brother's here
to take you home, okay?

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.507 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.260 position:50% align:center
It looks like somebody
is still sleepy.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I got a little held up.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.141 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center
A princess. Ichika's
gonna be a princess!

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
What's that?

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.399 position:50% align:center
Oh, we're having Ichika act
as Cinderella in our next play!

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
Wow. So does that mean...?

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
That's right. Would
you mind helping us out

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
with the costume designs again?

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.866 position:50% align:center
Sure thing!

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Bye now!

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
[ICHIKA]
See ya tomorrow.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.247 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 2B] Ikuto's
such a nice boy, isn't he?

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 2A] It's sweet how
he looks after his family.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I don't have
to be some big designer.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.300 position:50% align:center
I can still make clothes.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] It's been a while,
how are you doing?

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
That sounds like you,
very interesting.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
You really mean anybody?

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:51.231 position:50% align:center
Well then, you're
in luck, Yanagida.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting this go.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.987 position:50% align:center
I'm going to go back there
and ask my dad again!

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
I'll get him to hire you!

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
Please, you really
don't need to do that.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:06.413 position:50% align:center
The fact he gave you an offer
means he sees your potential.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
If you don't take chances,
then nothing's going to change.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
It's your dream, isn't it?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
Being a fashion designer?

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
I really enjoy making clothes.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
Every time I sew for someone,
I see them filled with joy.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
As long as that's true, then
it's more than enough for me.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:31.354 position:50% align:center
That's how I feel.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
So I'll be okay.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
I'm happy with
the way things are.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
Huh... That so? Well then, here.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
This is...

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.325 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I don't want it anymore.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Hold on, you should keep it!

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Why?

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:53.877 position:50% align:center
No-name designer duds?
I'm not interested.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO gasps]

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I can't believe you.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?!

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
You better stop walking and
stay right where you are, missy!

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
How selfish can you be?!

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
I made this outfit
because you asked!

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.226 position:50% align:center
And now you don't want it?

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
What the-- Tsumura!

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
You're the one who dragged me

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
into this stupid mess
in the first place!

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50% align:center
You haven't even apologized!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Careful!

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
And this is how
you're treating me?!

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
You're acting like
this is all my fault!

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Too close!

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.535 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO yelps]

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
No, you're right.
I feel so ashamed.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
I know I'm being
self-centered here.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
It's just... I don't
want you to give up.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
I guess that I...

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.593 position:50% align:center
I guess that I wanted
to prove myself wrong.

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
That maybe I can walk in Paris.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
And that you... You can
become a designer someday.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
I wanted to prove that
none of it's impossible.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec!

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Making clothes.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
Clothes can transform a person.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
That's just one of the
reasons I enjoy making them.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
I just saw a one percent chance.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
Facing your dad... it's scary
to think of doing that again.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
And so I'm gonna
make something that'll

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
turn all of that
fear into courage.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
If I become the real deal,

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
will you wear my clothes again?

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 2A] Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Tsumura is here to see you.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
Very well then. Let him in.

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
Did you design that
entire outfit by yourself?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.764 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I put everything I had
into making this ensemble.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Although, I don't
know much about modeling.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
But still, when I saw your
daughter wearing my creation,

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
I know I saw her
transform my clothes.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
That photo got reposted
and it went viral...

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
...all because a famous
model noticed Miss Chiyuki.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50% align:center
She saw something.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
If it had been anybody else
wearing my clothes that day,

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.792 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be here now!

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:42.796 position:50% align:center
I guess that I... I wanted
to prove myself wrong.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
It's true.
And beyond that...

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
You mind explaining why
you feel that way, Tsumura?

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
...she's great!

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.973 position:50% align:center
It's why she'll
become a top model!

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:08.446 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I got carried away.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center
[KENJI] You came here
just to tell me that?

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Well, and to ask
if you would still hire me, sir.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
Well, we can't hire you because
you're a high school student.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
Although, to be honest,

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
the quality of your
work was quite good,

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50% align:center
especially for a novice.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
You sure have potential.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
you lack the necessary

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
knowledge and experience.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
But... the fact you came back

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.065 position:50% align:center
despite rejection
shows you're determined.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50% align:center
[KENJI]
Chiyuki's the same way,

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
it'll make her a great
model someday.

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
How about this, Tsumura?

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
Earlier, we received a call
from a designer who left us.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
He's starting his own brand,
and he's currently hiring.

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
So are you interested?

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50% align:center
That means you'd get
to meet a real pro.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Sorry I'm late!

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
I hope you weren't waiting long.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
I was just about to leave
when my little sister--

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
Save it. Don't care.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Uh?

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.225 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Remind me again,

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
why did you need me to
chaperone you to this place?

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Oh, uh...

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
Sorry for dragging you out.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
Right. So what'd
you discuss yesterday?

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

What?

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
I only asked him if he
would reconsider hiring me.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:44.959 position:50% align:center
You liar.

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
My dad wouldn't
end my suspension

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
out of the blue for no reason.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center

I'm happy to hear that.

Here we are.

Why is it in a

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
Well, most designers start
out their businesses like this.

Before he went indie,
Hajime Yanagida won big prizes.

I heard that celebrities
would often seek him out, too.

Hes the real deal.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center

independent this year.

Okay.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
We don't have much time.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
There's still a lot of things
around here we need to get done.

Moriyama, fix this.

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
Wait. Why?

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I asked you
to blind stitch the pieces

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
so the seams
wouldn't show, remember?

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.240 position:50% align:center
You gave me a
regular blind stitch

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
that only conceals
the seam on the front,

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
which means you failed.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
I assumed you would
understand the difference.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
Honestly, did you really
think you could get away

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center
with leaving the
other side a mess?

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
Obviously, the back is
just important as the front.

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:41.381 position:50% align:center
Unbelievable.

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center

I don't have any
formal training.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
I'm only 17.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.141 position:50% align:center

Does he think this is funny?

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Oh, wait,
the girl in the picture

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
wearing your outfit
was his daughter, right?

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
So both the model and the
designer are mediocre at best.

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Ugh. Such a pain.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.531 position:50% align:center
Fine, whatever.

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Thank you so much!

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
How should I cut the fabric?!

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.502 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna be able
to draft out the curve

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.254 position:50% align:center
on a flat sheet from scratch.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:45.797 position:50% align:center
So how?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.591 position:50% align:center
The hem's totally destroyed,
but the shape is still the same.

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
You can always try
tracing it to get the pattern.

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate the help!

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
I'm all done.

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hmm...

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:06.526 position:50% align:center
Moriyama. Get this one
ready for tomorrow.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
I did it!

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
It's nothing to be proud of,

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
so don't get on
that high horse yet.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:13.658 position:50% align:center
Leave. The door's over there.

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
Go home.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
No way.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
I refuse.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
I want to become a designer.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
But I don't have
the skills or experience.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
And so, if I stop now,
then I'll never become one!

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
This is my only chance.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
Please let me help you.
Please, Mr. Yanagida!

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Are you sure?

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
That's right!
I'm ready and willing--

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.980 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Here's a tip.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
In this business we call all
the kids like you "wannabes."

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center
You'll never make it.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I want this place
spotless by tomorrow morning.

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
Don't let whatever he
says get to your head.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
He's just uptight
because the show's tomorrow.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
Sounds important.

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
It sure is,

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
considering that it's only
Japan's biggest fashion show.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
It's every designer's
dream to be featured there.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, we go to
Tokyo Fashion Week.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA] Sorry for making you
pull an all-nighter last minute.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
No worries. I'm fine.

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
Mr. Yanagida's an incredibly
talented designer.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
He may have a sharp
tongue and a big ego,

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
but I'm very grateful
that I get to work with him.

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA] Professionals
from all over the world

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
have gathered here today
in the name of fashion.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
PR reps from the top style
magazines and boutiques

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
will be here as well.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
He's positioned his line as
"the brand of the future."

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
To make the people believe that,

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
we need to crush this
show no matter what.

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
In that case,
I'll do my best as well--

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hey, Bobby.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:56.678 position:50% align:center
There isn't anything you
can do, just stay quiet.

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
This crowd's huge, and I had
trouble finding you! Uh!

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
You're very late!

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center
In case you've forgotten,
you represent Japan's premier

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
high-fashion magazine,
<i>MODE JAPAN</i> .

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
Do try to keep
yourself together.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
But I...

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
[YAGAMI] And what on earth
are you wearing right now?

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO] You told me I
should wear the best clothes

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center
I have in my closet.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
[YAGAMI]
That's them?

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
Hideous.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.083 position:50% align:center
[FUMIYO]
Ouch.

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.002 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you expect?

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
I wanted to work in literature,

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
so I don't know
anything about fashion!

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:34.841 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 2A]
Thank you all for waiting!

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
Please enter in order.

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
[YAGAMI] They're seating
us now. Let's go.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
Make sure you pay close
attention to Hazime Yanagida.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
There have been rumors that

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
it just might end up being
the brand of the future.

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.230 position:50% align:center
We'll see.

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:52.233 position:50% align:center
He'll need this show to
be a giant success first.

00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
Hey! Tell me what's
taking her so long!

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
We don't know.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
She'll be arriving shortly.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
I don't have any
more time to lose!

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.283 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware!

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
Uh, sir. What's going on?

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.830 position:50% align:center
Not now! Don't talk to me.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
[MODEL 2A]
There's been a little mishap.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
Something with
one of the models.

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
She couldn't make it
last minute. It happens.

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
They had to pull some strings

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
with an acquaintance
to find a replacement.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
A substitute model?

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center

Sorry for the delay.

Thank you for having me.

[HAJIME]
Wait... what the hell?

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
Is this some kind of joke?

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
You have to be
kidding me, you geezer!

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
He knows better than anyone
how crucial this show is to me!

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:46.496 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, am I supposed
to be laughing right now?

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
Well? Explain!

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
Sending you down the
runway will ruin my show!

00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:52.460 position:50% align:center
You would destroy
my entire career!

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
I'm begging you!

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
Give me a chance.

Fujito.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
We'll show the 40 dresses,

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
but without our last model.

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
We're changing
the whole program.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
Follow me, girls.

Miss Fujito.

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Go away. I'm fine.

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
I know more than anyone else

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
that I don't have the
right to be here right now.

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
But I'm still doing it...

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
...because this
show is my chance.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:27.203 position:50% align:center
Even if it sucks for Mr.
Yanagida, this is happening.

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Well, what do you think?

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
This is never going to work.

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
No matter what we change,

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
we simply won't be able
to show the last dress.

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Then we have to <i>make</i> it work!

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
I refuse to let that
shorty spoil everything!

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
[MODEL 2B] What if we
leave out one of the dresses?

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
We can't.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.888 position:50% align:center
The audience is expecting 40.

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.556 position:50% align:center

So then...

Chiyuki Fujito.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
Make sure to steel
yourself for the worst.

that from the start.

Oh, all right!

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:04.884 position:50% align:center
Models and fitters,
note all changes!

00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:06.803 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI] We have to
change multiple times.

00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:08.096 position:50% align:center
Each outfit is unique,

00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:11.725 position:50% align:center
with different levels
of exposure of the body.

00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:13.601 position:50% align:center
Every second counts
during a show,

00:23:13.685 --> 00:23:16.646 position:50% align:center
so there's no time
to change underwear.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:17.814 position:50% align:center
Nobody's gawking.

00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:19.899 position:50% align:center
This is a
professional workplace.

00:23:19.983 --> 00:23:22.235 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows
models wear "nude."

00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:25.113 position:50% align:center
You get that, right?

00:23:25.196 --> 00:23:26.906 position:50% align:center
Tsumura?

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.617 position:50% align:center
Ah... sure. I'll do my best.

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:30.869 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
You bring pasties?

00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:32.037 position:50% align:center
[CHIYUKI]
Yes!

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.329 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
Wear some or you'll chafe.

00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:35.457 position:50% align:center
Okay, try this on.

00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:39.753 position:50% align:center
The silhouette is worse
than I thought it'd be,

00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:44.841 position:50% align:center
but it was made for someone
at least 180 centimeters tall.

00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:48.178 position:50% align:center
Though I'm actually impressed.
The waist fits perfectly.

00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:50.805 position:50% align:center
Outside of height,
you're basically sample size.

00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:53.141 position:50% align:center
You can't do this
eating twice a day.

00:23:53.224 --> 00:23:56.436 position:50% align:center
Someone's been working hard.
You're a great model.

00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:58.772 position:50% align:center
I need a fitter!
Get the heels ready!

00:23:58.855 --> 00:24:00.857 position:50% align:center
Number one through
number twelve are totally new.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.984 position:50% align:center
Get me the smallest
size you can find!

00:24:03.068 --> 00:24:04.402 position:50% align:center
[FITTER 2A]
Right away.

00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:07.530 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA] Great.
Now to try and figure this out.

00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:10.992 position:50% align:center
Crap. The fabric's too thick
to just alter the length.

00:24:11.076 --> 00:24:12.952 position:50% align:center
Should I cut it? No.

00:24:13.036 --> 00:24:15.955 position:50% align:center
Sewing the hem would
be too much of a hassle.

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.540 position:50% align:center
Fifteen minutes left.

00:24:17.624 --> 00:24:21.127 position:50% align:center
No good. What to do?
There isn't any time!

00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:22.128 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
Hey, Bob!

00:24:22.212 --> 00:24:23.421 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:27.759 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're bleeding.

00:24:27.842 --> 00:24:28.426 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.260 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:24:29.344 --> 00:24:30.303 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you okay?

00:24:30.387 --> 00:24:31.930 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
Chiyuki, don't move!

00:24:32.013 --> 00:24:33.348 position:50% align:center
If you get any
blood on yourself,

00:24:33.431 --> 00:24:36.393 position:50% align:center
you're going to stain
the dre... dress.

00:24:38.728 --> 00:24:40.522 position:50% align:center
--[STAFF 2B] What happened?
--[STAFF 2E] Moriyama's down!

00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:41.606 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 2C]
Is she all right?

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.941 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 2D]
Someone call an ambulance!

00:24:43.024 --> 00:24:46.069 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
I knew it. She wasn't okay.

00:24:48.947 --> 00:24:51.825 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 2B]
Oh, god. This is really bad!

00:24:51.908 --> 00:24:53.201 position:50% align:center
Mr. Yanagida!

00:24:53.284 --> 00:24:55.412 position:50% align:center
I need to call the hospital,
but I'll be right back.

00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:56.871 position:50% align:center
Can you finish the dress?

00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.665 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I'm screwed.

00:24:58.748 --> 00:25:00.792 position:50% align:center
It's over.
I'm completely finished.

00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:03.003 position:50% align:center
I'm a designer,
not a seamstress.

00:25:03.086 --> 00:25:04.921 position:50% align:center
I can't fix it.

00:25:06.131 --> 00:25:08.008 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
How could this happen to me?

00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:09.259 position:50% align:center
First a model backs out,

00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:12.012 position:50% align:center
and is replaced by
someone totally useless,

00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:15.223 position:50% align:center
then my only dressmaker
goes out of commission.

00:25:15.306 --> 00:25:18.393 position:50% align:center
Well... what the hell do I do?!

00:25:18.476 --> 00:25:20.228 position:50% align:center
I feel bad for Mr. Yanagida.

00:25:20.311 --> 00:25:21.938 position:50% align:center
But I'm still doing it
because it's my chance.

00:25:22.022 --> 00:25:23.314 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Everyone is doing their part

00:25:23.398 --> 00:25:24.899 position:50% align:center
to make my show spectacular.

00:25:24.983 --> 00:25:26.359 position:50% align:center
If you get any
blood on yourself,

00:25:26.443 --> 00:25:27.861 position:50% align:center
you're going to stain the dre...

00:25:27.944 --> 00:25:30.822 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
Oh, Bob, I'm so sorry.

00:25:32.532 --> 00:25:34.951 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.623 position:50% align:center
[MORIYAMA]
The rest... is up to you.

00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:46.963 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] I can do it.
I can fix Miss Fujito's dress.

00:25:47.047 --> 00:25:51.301 position:50% align:center
But only if you let me.
Please, Mr. Yanagida!

00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:26.688 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Can I pull this off?

00:27:26.771 --> 00:27:28.690 position:50% align:center
I'll finish it in time!

00:27:28.773 --> 00:27:31.151 position:50% align:center
Wait for me, Miss Fujito!

00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:33.945 position:50% align:center
