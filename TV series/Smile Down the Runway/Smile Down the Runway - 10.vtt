No way.

no business sitting here,

I'm really just here to observe.

I know Ikuto can make
beautiful clothes, obviously,

but I had no idea so many
other people his age could.

to adjust the size.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
Is Toh Ayano the most
noteworthy designer here?

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he might be.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center

[KAORU gasps]

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.623 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] The original
design of that dress

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
was much more elegant and
delicate than it was in the end.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
By adjusting it
to fit that short model,

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
it was turned
into something else.

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:54.010 position:50% align:center
All because, when
the moment came...

Ikuto Tsumura so much?

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:03.687 position:50% align:center
Is it because he ruined
Mr. Hajime's show?

No.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
Because he completely ditched
Mr. Hajime's concept?

Very interesting.

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
They made good use
of the billowing skirt

between kimono and modern dress.

Making minimalist clothing

You could compare
it to cooking meat.
