(knocking on door)

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.181
Captain.

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:18.018
I guess he's not back yet.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.119
(door sliding)

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.722
I wonder where he... (gasping)

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.491
(door closing)

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:25.659
Captain.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.828
If you were in here, you
might at least have answered-

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.263
[Shunsui] Nanao.

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:34.334
I'm afraid this may be goodbye.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.069
(Nanao gasping)

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.042

(Shunsui sighing)

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.550
Give me a break.

(Ichigo screaming)

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.332
Well, you flunked
that test, you idiot.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.968
Didn't you ever take a
bath when you were a kid?

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.169
Didn't your parents teach you

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:50.270
that you can't
get out of the tub

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:51.939
until you've counted to 100?

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.073
What are you, crazy?

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.975
Who the hell makes their
kid count up to 100

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.009
with their head underwater?

00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:57.945
Ah, quit your whining, will ya?

00:02:57.978 --> 00:02:59.646
Kazuo, Kazuhiro.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.881
Right, in you get.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:02.282
Don't fight it, kid.

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:04.384
-It's nothing personal.
-(Ichigo yelling)

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:05.986
Damn you, kid!

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.055
[Ichigo] Stop calling me kid!

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:09.690
[Tenjiro] Hold it.

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:10.691

(Ichigo yelling)

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:18.198
What the hell was that for?

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:19.833
[Tenjiro] Yep, you're healed.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:20.868
Huh?

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:22.469
(water splashing)

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.637
If you weren't healed,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.507
that last punch of mine
definitely woulda killed you.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.641
Take a look.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.176
Your wounds are all gone.

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:30.978
You're right.

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.846
Looks like my work here is done.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.749
Time for me to send you
on to the next stop.

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:38.185
-The next-
-(water splashing)

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.521
-Wait for me.
-(Ichigo gasping)

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.390
I'll be coming with you.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:44.491
You kidding me?

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.827
You're not even close
to being healed yet.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.596
(water splashing)

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:52.666

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.177
You see?

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.379
I'm still standing, aren't I?

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.549
(Renji grunting)

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.851
(Tenjiro growling)

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:12.352
Just barely.

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:14.555
But if you really think
you're up to it, go ahead.

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:15.656
It's your funeral.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:16.990
I won't stop you.

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:18.425
Yeah, all right.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.661
(air whooshing)

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:22.029
-Ready?
-Go!

(Renji screaming)

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.899
[Ichigo] Don't you
people have any other way

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:28.836
of getting around this place?

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:30.070
Well, that's that.

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.673
Okay, you two, we're done.

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:33.974
(thudding sound)

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.242
Thanks for helping me out.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.810
You can go ahead and take
those things off now.

00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:37.811
[Kazuo And Kazuhiro] Yes, sir.

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:38.812
(clothes rustling)

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:40.480

(skin sizzling)

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:44.818
Whoa!

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:46.019
We never would've survived that

00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:48.188
without these protective
bathing robes.

00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:51.458
Even so, another few minute
and we'd have been parboiled.

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.627
Those two guys weren't
wearing anything

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.996
and they survived both
the White Bone Hell

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.965
and Blood Pond Hell.

00:04:57.998 --> 00:04:59.433
It's unbelievable.

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.637
Yeah, I knew they had potential,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.639
but not that kind of potential.

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:08.308
Especially that Ichigo kid.

00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:09.409
Little punk.

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:11.945
Not only did he survive
that punch I threw at him.

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.681
He blocked my fist
outta pure reflex.

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:15.682
He fractured it.

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:16.683
(Kazuhiro gasping)

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:17.851
No way.

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:19.887
People used to call me
"Lightning Fast Tenjiro"

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.022
for my Hoho skills.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:25.526
As far as I can tell, I
haven't lost my touch.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.998
So, yeah, that kid is
something else, all right.

00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.234
I can see why the Soul
King is so fond of him.

00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:37.804
[Central 46 Member] You
want two lieutenants?

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:41.842
Yeah, Third Seat Okikiba
and Lieutenant Ise.

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:44.011
Because he can manage the squad,

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:46.780
and because she can manage me.

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:49.950
I'll need them both if I'm
going to fulfill my duties.

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:51.451
No, absolutely out
of the question.

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:53.820
The power to appoint
a squad's lieutenant

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.289
lies solely with its captain.

00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:57.824
You people came
up with that rule,

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.860
or did you forget?

00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:01.328
(Central 46 Member gasping)

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:05.832
Moving on to more
important matters,

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:09.503
namely my plans for
Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:14.107
(clothes rustling)

00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:17.945
We're gonna train him
and teach him Zanjutsu.

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:19.980
[Central 46 Member] What?

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:21.682
Captain Kuchiki and the others

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.116
have gone to the Royal Palace,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.186
but there's no guarantee
they'll return safely.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.022
Captain Zaraki is a great
asset to us in battle,

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:31.992
but he'll be even more of
one with further training.

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:33.393
Are you mad?

00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:35.362
If he were to become even
more powerful than he is now,

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.998
we'd never be able to stop
him if he turned against us.

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.700
Have you forgotten
when Genryusai

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.101
was training him in Kendo?

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.270
We stopped the training when
we saw how dangerous he was.

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:45.806
What do you suggest then?

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.207
In its current state,

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:50.677
the Soul Society will never
withstand the next invasion.

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:52.312
And I certainly don't see you

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:54.314
being able to save yourselves.

00:06:54.348 --> 00:06:56.116
(Central 46 Member growling)

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:02.356
(dramatic music)

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:03.490
Nothing more?

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:06.059
Then I take it I
have your permission.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.296
You can come in.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:13.300
I want you to handle this
Captain Zaraki business.

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:18.505
-(footsteps shuffling)
-(dramatic music)

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:21.108
I can rely on you,

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:24.478
can't I, Captain Unohana?

00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:26.013
Or should I say

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:30.184
The First Kenpachi
Yachiro Unohana?

00:07:31.018 --> 00:07:34.121
(Ichigo and Renji screaming)

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:35.322
Here, you go first.

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:37.024
My injuries were a
lot worse than yours.

00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:38.525
I'm not gonna hit
the ground first.

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:39.660
You go first!

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:40.894
A second ago you were saying

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:42.963
you were all healed,
you big wuss. Come on!

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:45.132
Who are you calling
a wuss, you coward?

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:46.900
(Ichigo and Renji gasping)

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:48.936
Oh, hi.

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.671
(Ichigo and Renji gasping)

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:52.005
Aah!

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.842
Boy, did I pick the wrong
guys to hitch a ride with!

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:58.378
(Ichigo, Renji,
and Kon crashing)

00:07:58.412 --> 00:07:59.179
[Renji] Ah.

00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:00.714
(Ichigo and Renji sighing)

00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:01.849
[Renji] Hoo-wee.

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:03.350
Lucky thing he came along.

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:04.718
This finely-tuned body of mine

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:06.520
-wasn't made for crash landing.
-Hey, where are you going?

00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:08.622
Yeah, I wasn't that
worried about it.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.724
I knew I could always
pull off a break fall

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:12.326
and land perfectly safe.

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:13.327
Pull off a what?

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.728
-A break fall.
-Break this fall.

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:15.896
[Ichigo] Don't you
even know what-

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.531
-Hello!
-(Ichigo and Renji screaming)

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:21.001
Ichigo, Renji, I'm so
glad you boys could come.

00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:23.136
Welcome, welcome to
my humble Gatonden!

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.374
I am going to take such
good care of you. (laughing)

00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:28.408
(Ichigo grunting)

00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:32.813
[Ichigo] Is there anybody
normal in this damn place?

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.848
(pan sizzling)

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.350
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:37.918
We're flipping, we're
flipping, we're flipping,

00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:39.553
and tossing, and
tossing, and tossing,

00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:40.821
and flipping, and tossing

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.990
until everything is
yummy, yummy, yummy,

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.325
and ready for the tummy!

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.661
(exciting music)

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.563
(Ichigo and Renji grunting)

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:52.266
(ominous music)

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.969
She said she'd take care us,

00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:58.172
but I figured that meant
she was gonna work us hard

00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.773
and whip us into shape.

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:02.643
No, I guess she meant she'd
really take care of us.

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:04.845
Ah, this is amazing!

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.346
Well, come on, let's eat!

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.981
We don't want it
getting cold, do we?

00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:08.949
That would be rude to the chef.

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.450
Wait, you idiot.

00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:13.353
You know she didn't make us
this huge feast for no reason.

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:16.390
It's gotta be some kinda
weird training exercise.

00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:17.691
Really?

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.193
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:23.363
That Kisuke really raised you
to be distrustful, didn't he?

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:25.866
Well, trust me, you have
nothing to worry about,

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.936
because this is a palace
of food, nothing else.

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:31.271
My only job here
in this Gatonden

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:33.874
is to make sure that
your bellies are full,

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.976
and you, your job
is to sit there

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:37.477
and eat to your heart's content,

00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:38.712
and maybe a little more.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:39.813
So hop to it, boys.

00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:41.215
Chow down!

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:43.951
I know you must be starving
after what you've been through.

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:46.320
(stomachs growling)

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:49.990
[All] All right, dig in!

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:51.725
(Ichigo chewing)

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.727
(Renji gulping)

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.862
(Ichigo chomping)

00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:57.397
(Renji slurping)

00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:00.267
(plates clinking)

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:03.704
Good, you brought an appetite.

00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:04.705
Keep at it!

00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:06.874
But save some room for dessert.

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:07.941
(plate clunking)

00:10:07.975 --> 00:10:09.810
Oh, it's so good,
I can't resist.

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:11.345
Well, I can.

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:13.113
Some of this stuff
is so weird-looking,

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:15.315
it's kinda freaking me out.

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:17.751
I mean, what the
hell is this thing?

00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:20.654
(crunching sound)

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:21.655
(Renji gasping)

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:22.656
Whoa!

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:23.991
This is unbelievable, Ichigo!

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:25.125
You've got to try this.

00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:26.627
It looks disgusting,

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.463
but this lizard skin's
got a great crunch to it,

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:32.866
and inside there's a slimy
center that melts in your mouth!

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.867
Shut up.

00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:35.335
Man, you suck as a food critic,

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.005
unless you're trying to
make me lose my appetite.

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:41.642
(Ichigo sighing)

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:43.477
(chopsticks clinking)

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.811
Hmm?

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:46.980
What, are you done
already, you wimp?

00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:47.981
I'm just getting started.

00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:49.683
Hell no, I'm not
done, you idiot!

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:51.185
I'm not even close
to being done.

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:53.120
I'm just taking a little
break, that's all.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:55.088
-Mm-hmm.
-(tableware clinking)

00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:00.127
(Ichigo grunting)

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.196
(utensils clinking)

00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:04.198
-Hey, Renji.
-Hmm?

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:06.200
I don't know.

00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:08.502
Should we really
even be doing this?

00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:12.673
Down in the Seireitei,
everybody's training

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:15.642
and getting ready for the
next battle right now.

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:17.611
While we're up here taking baths

00:11:17.644 --> 00:11:21.815
and stuffing our faces,
as if things were okay.

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:24.251
We oughta be training with them.

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:25.953
How are we gonna
get any stronger

00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:28.088
sitting around here like this?

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.291
Ugh.

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:33.227
Are you really that dumb?

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.027
What?

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:35.762
Look, we were both
badly injured.

00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:39.132
Those baths were hydrotherapy
to heal our wounds.

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.434
Once our wounds healed,

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:43.604
we needed to eat in order
to regain our strength.

00:11:43.637 --> 00:11:46.273
It all makes perfect sense
if you think about it.

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.609
We've gotta rebuild our
bodies and our spirits

00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:51.178
if we wanna be ready for
the tough training ahead.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:55.215
You know, every once in a
while you actually make sense.

00:11:55.249 --> 00:11:56.149
Shut up!

00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:58.018
We're supposed to be
eating, so start eating!

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.553
Unless you're gonna quit.

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:01.021
Like hell, I will!

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:04.358
I can eat you under the table!

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.660
Dream on, little man, dream on!

00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:08.128
(Kirio laughing)

00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:10.631
Very clever of you to
figure it out, Renji.

00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:13.600
I guess that's why they
made you a lieutenant.

00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:18.105
You guessed it, that's the
whole purpose of this exercise.

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:19.973
(water gushing)

00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:21.308
Yep, that's right.

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:23.944
What we're doing here is
basically a warmup exercise.

00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:25.112
This sort of thing you would do

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:27.181
before any strenuous
physical training.

00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:29.116
The difference is
that here we do things

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:32.052
on a much, much bigger scale.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.657
The Soul King, it's
his power and wisdom,

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.192
and a million years of history

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:40.360
that have created our rituals.

00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:43.163
When it comes to healing,
therapy, and diet,

00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:45.832
we leave the
Seireitei in the dust.

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:48.335
Just focus on rebuilding
your strength.

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:50.637
So you don't die
in the next palace.

00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:55.709
And now, with that said, how
about we move on to dessert?

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:56.977
(Ichigo stammering)

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.346
[Ichigo And Renji] Wait
a second! Who are you?

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:00.514
Huh?

00:13:00.547 --> 00:13:03.550
Oh, I always use up a lot
of my spiritual pressure

00:13:03.584 --> 00:13:04.618
whenever I cook.

00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:05.652
By the time I'm done cooking,

00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:09.256
I'm just a shadow of my
former self. (giggling)

00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:15.195
(footsteps pattering)

00:13:15.229 --> 00:13:19.867
Ichigo, Renji, be
careful out there.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.270
As I said, all our
rituals are imbued

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:26.039
with the history of
the Soul Society.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.876
Each one of us in Squad Zero

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:31.011
has contributed to
the Soul Society

00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:33.547
by creating something new.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.615
It's for that reason,

00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:37.017
we were recognized as
part of its history,

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.654
and invited by the Soul
King to join this squad.

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:43.957
The concept I created had
never been thought of.

00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:48.128
The concept of an
artificial soul, a Gikon.

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.163
I even created the
technology needed

00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:52.199
to insert it into a body.

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:55.702
This Gikon technology
was later used by others

00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:57.971
to develop the Soul Candy.

00:13:58.005 --> 00:13:59.840
But the main purpose of a Gikon

00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:01.275
is to increase one's power

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:03.844
by inserting the essence
of a completely foreign

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:06.647
Spiritual Pressure
into one's body.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.117
The food you ate was infused
with just such an essence.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.886
Your bodies now contain
a Spiritual Pressure,

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.656
such as you've
never felt before.

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:18.659
And now you're both beginning
to sense it, aren't you?

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:22.362
All the same, it doesn't mean
you shouldn't be careful.

00:14:23.664 --> 00:14:25.999
There's no telling what
you'll have to go through

00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:27.201
at your next stop,

00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:29.102
Hoohden.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.073
In that palace, you will have
Oh-Etsu Nimaiya to deal with.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:38.045
The man who created Zanpakuto.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.993
(suspenseful music)

00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:56.096
(ominous music)

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:05.072
(door clanging)

00:15:09.843 --> 00:15:12.980
(door creaking open)

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:17.684
(Kenpachi scoffing)

00:15:17.718 --> 00:15:19.620
(metal clanging)

00:15:19.653 --> 00:15:23.023
(footsteps pattering)

00:15:23.824 --> 00:15:25.659
(Kenpachi scoffing)

00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:28.328
(footsteps thudding)

00:15:28.362 --> 00:15:32.666
Pretty exclusive place you
picked for our little date.

00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:36.970
I'm surprised you even
got permission to use it.

00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:39.740
[Retsu] It was the new
Head Captain's idea.

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.809
The Muken level of the Central
Underground Great Prison

00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:44.278
is immeasurably vast,

00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:48.148
and completely sealed off from
the rest of the Soul Society.

00:15:48.182 --> 00:15:50.918
It was decided that this
was the only safe place

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:53.086
in which to let you
unleash your full power

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.689
and swing your sword freely.

00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:59.259
Otherwise, it would've
been off limits, of course.

00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:01.962
They would never have allowed
we who are not criminals

00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:03.797
to enter this place.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.032
(Kenpachi scoffing)

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:07.668
Not criminals, huh?

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:09.303
Who are you kidding?

00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:11.839
They consider us
criminals, all right,

00:16:11.872 --> 00:16:14.007
if we weren't as
powerful as we are.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:20.380
(clothes rustling)

00:16:22.616 --> 00:16:25.853
But you are not as
powerful as you think.

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:28.822
I will confess, it was
I who chose this place,

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:30.991
because this is
where you belong.

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:31.992
(Kenpachi scoffing)

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:34.962
Yeah, I kinda figured as much.

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:36.430
That's fine by me.

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:39.333
I'll live as a captain
or die as a criminal.

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:41.902
But whether I kill
you or you kill me,

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:44.972
either way I'll end
up in eternal hell.

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:47.908
You're awfully talkative
today, aren't you?

00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:49.610
(Kenpachi grunting)

00:16:49.643 --> 00:16:53.046
I preferred you when you
were a man of few words.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.083
Every time I hear your voice,

00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:59.152
this scar you gave me
begins to throb and burn,

00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:02.289
urging me to spill your blood.

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:03.156
Oh, boo-hoo.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.092
Am I supposed to
feel sorry for you?

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:07.961
Like you are the
only one with a scar?

00:17:07.995 --> 00:17:09.663
(footsteps shuffling)

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:10.664
(sword clanging)

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:13.500
(suspenseful music)

00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:16.937
[Shunsui] Yachiru Onohana,
one of the original

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.273
Thirteen Court Guard Squads,

00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:22.142
said to be the strongest
in its history.

00:17:22.176 --> 00:17:24.278
She was the first
captain of Squad 11,

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:26.847
and made it what it is today.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.950
Before being made a
captain by Old Man Yama,

00:17:29.983 --> 00:17:31.818
she was the most
notorious criminal

00:17:31.852 --> 00:17:34.087
in the history of
the Soul Society.

00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:36.256
To show her proficiency
with the blade,

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.293
as well as her mastery
of many styles of combat,

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:42.829
she ultimately gave herself
the name, "Yachiru."

00:17:42.863 --> 00:17:44.064
(static buzzing)

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:47.801
I wronged you by calling it

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:50.304
a mere Zanjutsu
lesson, didn't I?

00:17:51.772 --> 00:17:53.073
(book thudding shut)

00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:56.543
I know that once you and
Captain Zaraki cross blades,

00:17:57.544 --> 00:17:58.545
(book thudding)

00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:03.383
it means that one of
you will have to die.

00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:05.953
I'm sorry.

00:18:05.986 --> 00:18:08.989
(suspenseful music)

00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:26.974
(suspenseful music continues)

00:18:27.007 --> 00:18:28.208
(Kenpachi yelling)

00:18:29.476 --> 00:18:31.979
(suspenseful music)

00:18:32.012 --> 00:18:33.780
(Kenpachi crashing)

00:18:33.814 --> 00:18:35.582
(suspenseful music)

00:18:35.616 --> 00:18:36.617
Oh Kenny.

00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:38.852
(Isane sobbing)

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:40.654
Captain Unohana.

00:18:40.687 --> 00:18:42.823
(sword clanging)

00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:44.291
(Kenpachi growling)

00:18:45.025 --> 00:18:48.195
(suspenseful music)

00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:55.502
(Kenpachi grunting)

00:18:56.803 --> 00:19:00.007
(suspenseful music)

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:05.445
(clothes rustling)

00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:08.048
(mellow music)

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:14.254
I'm glad you've removed your
eye patch for this battle.

00:19:14.288 --> 00:19:16.657
I must commend you for that.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.927
But then, if this is the
full extent of your power,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.962
I pity you.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.664
(blood gushing)

00:19:23.697 --> 00:19:26.834
(swords clanging)

00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:29.102
(air whooshing)

00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:30.804
(suspenseful music)

00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:34.641
Alas, you are too weak.

00:19:34.675 --> 00:19:37.678
(suspenseful music)

00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:39.947
(knife clanging)

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.249
You only need one
arm to swing a sword.

00:19:42.282 --> 00:19:45.919
Why is it that you won't put
your other arm to good use?

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:47.688
I had hoped you
would've put your heart

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:50.090
and soul into our last battle.

00:19:50.123 --> 00:19:52.159
Huh, listen to you.

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:53.994
Spare me the
sentimental sweet talk

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.863
if you're gonna use
cheap tricks like that

00:19:55.896 --> 00:19:57.731
-to try and beat me.
-(sword clanging)

00:19:57.764 --> 00:20:00.801
Man, you really have
changed a lot, haven't you?

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:02.703
(suspenseful music)

00:20:02.736 --> 00:20:05.405
What the hell happened to
that person I used to admire?

00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:07.674
What do I care about
your admiration?

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:09.443
This is a battle to the death!

00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:10.911
(air whooshing)

00:20:10.944 --> 00:20:13.614
(sword clanging)

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:16.650
(melancholic music)

00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:25.726
And for the record, I
haven't changed at all.

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:29.263
The only difference is
that when we last fought,

00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:31.932
I didn't resort to such cheap
tricks as you call them,

00:20:31.965 --> 00:20:34.134
because I didn't
have that luxury.

00:20:35.836 --> 00:20:37.070
What are you...

00:20:37.104 --> 00:20:39.540
Are you saying I've
gotten weaker since then?

00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:48.549
Oh, how I admired you.

00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:53.820
No matter what I killed,
people, trees, bugs,

00:20:53.854 --> 00:20:55.489
it all felt the same.

00:20:55.522 --> 00:21:00.994
Boring, like swinging a sword
around all alone in the dark.

00:21:01.028 --> 00:21:02.963
Then I met you.

00:21:02.996 --> 00:21:05.966
Fighting you was the
first time I felt fear.

00:21:05.999 --> 00:21:09.069
The first time I felt
the joy of battle.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:13.006
I wanted to fight like
you, become like you.

00:21:13.807 --> 00:21:15.142
And now you are saying

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.983
that I am gonna die here today,

00:21:23.016 --> 00:21:26.086
never having known what
it's like to defeat you.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.922
(sword squishing)

00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:32.092
(dramatic music)

00:21:37.998 --> 00:21:39.867
(Kenpachi coughing)

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.669
(dramatic music)

00:21:45.939 --> 00:21:47.174
Damn it to hell.

00:21:48.642 --> 00:21:51.078
(Kenpachi grunting)

00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:53.947
(dramatic music)

00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:55.482
What's the matter?

00:21:55.516 --> 00:21:58.685
For a moment there, your
mind seemed miles away.

00:21:58.719 --> 00:21:59.820
(Kenpachi scoffing)

00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:01.522
(Kenpachi yelling)

00:22:01.555 --> 00:22:03.357
What just happened?

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.526
I swore I was...

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:07.127
Ah, screw it.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.796
No time to worry about that now.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.932
I need to focus on this battle

00:22:11.965 --> 00:22:14.835
and savor every minute of it.

00:22:14.868 --> 00:22:16.436
(dramatic music)

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.774
Kenpachi Zaraki, I
won't let you die.

00:22:20.807 --> 00:22:24.845
It's only on the verge of
death that you grow stronger.

00:22:24.878 --> 00:22:28.682
That is the flaw you
chose to give yourself.

00:22:28.715 --> 00:22:30.517
It is also

00:22:31.618 --> 00:22:33.487
my greatest sin.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.879
("Saihate" by SennaRin)

00:22:42.912 --> 00:22:47.717
(singing in Japanese)

00:24:14.837 --> 00:24:17.440
[Retsu] Battle is everything.
