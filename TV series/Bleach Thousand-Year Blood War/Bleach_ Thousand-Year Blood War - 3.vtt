WEBVTT

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.798
(tense music)

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:18.638
(fire crackling)

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:23.948
[Nel] No way.

00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:25.117
I don't believe it!

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.789
That guy beat the Tres Bestia?

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:32.164
[Quilge] A Soul Reaper carrying
an Arrancar on his back?

00:00:32.197 --> 00:00:34.970
Unusual, but not surprising.

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.943
You see, I know all about you,

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:40.480
Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.119
Oh yes, you were
included in the Daten

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:45.959
provided to us by His Majesty.

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:48.163
In fact, you're listed
as a "Special Threat"

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:51.870
whose elimination
is a top priority!

00:00:51.937 --> 00:00:53.440
A "Special Threat?"

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:56.446
That technique!

00:00:57.047 --> 00:00:58.718
The Hirenkyaku!

00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:02.024
(intense rock music)

00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:03.661
(Ichigo gasping)

00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:07.034
(arrows exploding)

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.971
Are you guys what
I think you are?

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:10.140
Oh, dear.

00:01:10.173 --> 00:01:11.610
Am I to believe you
are actually going to

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:15.317
engage us in battle without
even being sure of who we are?

00:01:15.317 --> 00:01:18.356
How very impulsive of you.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.662
But to answer your question,

00:01:20.695 --> 00:01:23.734
(intense rock music)

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:30.414
as a matter of fact, we
are what you think we are.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.251
We're Quincies.

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:38.898
Quincies.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.035
Well, I suspected that
might be the case,

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:42.505
but I wish I'd been wrong.

00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:45.143
Do we yet know where
they are operating from?

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.185
No. Thus far, I haven't
been able to find it.

00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:50.688
[Yamamoto] I see.

00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:54.195
Which means we have no
way of attacking them.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.366
Very well.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:59.573
All Squad Captains are hereby
ordered to prepare for war.

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:02.044
According to the Rebel
Army's advance guard,

00:02:02.077 --> 00:02:04.415
the battle shall
begin in five days.

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:06.754
But we have no reason
to trust the words

00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:09.058
of anyone who would
launch a surprise attack.

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:10.962
So prepare at once for an attack

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.099
that could come at any time!

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.770
For I shall not allow our enemy

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:17.107
to catch us unaware ever again!

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.119
("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:42.625
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:52.532
-("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:12.204
Every blow struck home.

00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:13.473
What's the matter?

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:15.845
I know you can do
better than that!

00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:19.553
(sword crashing)

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:22.024
-(Quilge humming questioningly)
-[Ichigo] That's weird.

00:04:23.527 --> 00:04:27.101
I thought Quincies used a
bow to shoot their arrows.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:28.336
But how?

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:34.850
-(Ichigo grunting)
-(arrows exploding)

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:37.087
Ichigo!

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:38.323
Oh, good.

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:39.860
Look after Nel!

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.329
(Orihime stammering)

00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:42.532
(Orihime grunting)

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:47.074
(sword clanging)

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:49.111
[Quilge] Impressive.

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:51.415
It's enough to make me
feel deeply dismayed

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.052
at my lack of skill.

00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:54.255
Don't feel too bad.

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:57.060
Your arrows were a lot
stronger than Uryu's.

00:04:57.094 --> 00:05:00.568
Though it's been a while
since I got hit by one of 'em.

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:02.572
Uryu?

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:06.045
Are you by any chance
referring to Uryu Ishida?

00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:08.049
(gasps) Yeah, that's right.

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:10.120
How do you guys know about him?

00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:12.892
You're saying Uryu
Ishida's Heilig Pfeil

00:05:12.892 --> 00:05:14.061
is weaker than mine?

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.067
That seems unlikely.

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:19.539
Impossible, in fact.

00:05:19.573 --> 00:05:21.877
And what is that
supposed to mean?

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.146
Whoopsie!

00:05:23.213 --> 00:05:25.818
Speech is silver,
silence is golden.

00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:28.289
Forgive me for
speaking out of turn.

00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:29.593
Forget I said it.

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:32.932
(Quilge humming quietly)

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:34.101
What a shame.

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:35.805
Our little chat
must come to an end.

00:05:35.872 --> 00:05:39.378
I've just received orders
from His Majesty, you see.

00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:40.882
And who is that?

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:43.921
There's really no point in
my answering that question.

00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:46.225
You won't live long
enough to do anything

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.062
with that information, anyway.

00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:50.635
Now then, watch carefully.

00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:53.006
You may have heard
stories about this power,

00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:55.243
perhaps from one
of your friends.

00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:57.481
A Quincy's final state.

00:05:57.515 --> 00:05:59.318
-Letz Stile!
-(Ichigo gasping)

00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:04.194
(energy humming)

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:06.165
Is this that secret Quincy move

00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:08.002
that Uryu used before?

00:06:10.073 --> 00:06:12.144
(glass shattering)

00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:17.020
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:20.160
Now, just so you understand
what you're witnessing,

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:23.333
the proper name for this form is

00:06:23.366 --> 00:06:26.873
Quincy Voll Stern Dich.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.944
(Ichigo sighing anxiously)

00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:31.550
[Quincy 1] An update
from Jagd Armee 1, sire.

00:06:31.617 --> 00:06:33.721
Quilge Opie has
engaged in battle

00:06:33.787 --> 00:06:36.125
with "Special Threat,"
Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:38.697
[Yhwach] Good.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.467
-Let us go, then.
-(Quincy 2 gasping)

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:42.104
Go where, Your Majesty?

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.876
Isn't it obvious?

00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:47.447
[Quincy 3] By order of
his Imperial Majesty,

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.619
all Stern Ritters
are to immediately

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:51.389
equip themselves for battle

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:54.228
and assemble at the
Gate of the Sun.

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:55.397
To repeat-

00:06:55.463 --> 00:06:58.637
[Yhwach] The time has
come for the Wandenreich

00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:01.843
to launch its invasion
of the soul Society.

00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:17.809
(intense rock music)

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.321
Do you feel it?

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:27.160
The pulsation of my power?

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:30.534
(Ichigo gasping)

00:07:30.534 --> 00:07:33.674
The power of he who will
deliver your punishment!

00:07:37.381 --> 00:07:38.684
This technique...

00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:40.721
Is this what Kisuke
told me about?

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:44.361
(Ichigo grunting)

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:46.065
(swords clanging)

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:49.171
I can see you're a bit
confused, aren't you?

00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:50.675
I know what you're thinking.

00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:53.179
Allow me to answer
your question.

00:07:53.212 --> 00:07:55.417
No, it's entirely different.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.920
-(Ichigo grunting)
-(swords clanging)

00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:58.691
The Quincy Letz Stile
you're thinking of

00:07:58.724 --> 00:08:01.530
is a hopelessly obsolete
relic of the distant past

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:03.701
that was abandoned
more than 200 years ago

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:06.138
due to its fragile
and unstable nature.

00:08:06.205 --> 00:08:09.078
The only one foolish
enough to continue using it

00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:12.217
was Soken Ishida, who
rejected the whole idea

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.721
of research and evolution!

00:08:13.754 --> 00:08:17.461
To compare that old relic
with Quincy Voll Stern Dich

00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:20.935
is like comparing night and day!

00:08:22.538 --> 00:08:25.644
Okay, so putting aside
the history lesson,

00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:27.147
what you're saying
is that your power

00:08:27.214 --> 00:08:30.988
is a different kind of
power than Uryu's, right?

00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:32.124
I'm glad to hear that.

00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:34.261
'Cause if I thought he was
gonna turn into something

00:08:34.294 --> 00:08:37.969
as creepy as you, I'd just
have to take him out myself.

00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:41.576
-(Quilge growling)
-Careful, you're losing focus.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.578
-(Ichigo grunting)
-(sword clanging)

00:08:42.612 --> 00:08:44.081
Getsuga tensho!

00:08:45.283 --> 00:08:48.122
(ground rumbling)

00:08:50.126 --> 00:08:54.669
-[Quilge] A valiant effort.
-(Ichigo gasping)

00:08:54.703 --> 00:08:58.176
Maybe aim a little more
carefully next time.

00:08:58.242 --> 00:08:59.813
(Ichigo grunting)

00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:01.348
But even if your
aim were better,

00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:05.123
I don't think you'd be able to
find any weak spots, frankly.

00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:06.125
"Creepy?"

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:07.695
Is that what you called me?

00:09:07.762 --> 00:09:10.133
Yes, that would be an
appropriate response.

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:13.439
In the eyes of a lowly Soul
Reaper such as yourself,

00:09:13.473 --> 00:09:15.443
I'm sure that my
current form must appear

00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:17.715
very "creepy" indeed.

00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:19.351
Horrifying, in fact.

00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:21.388
Because you're
looking on the face

00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:23.994
of your own holy executioner!

00:09:23.994 --> 00:09:27.167
(intense rock music)

00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:31.543
Oh, no!

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.148
My Sotenkishun's
being peeled away!

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.690
Now, I shall give you
a good taste of it.

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:41.228
My Voll Stern Dich,

00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:43.232
the awesome power of Piskiel!

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:46.640
(glass shattering)

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:49.311
-Huh?
-(punch thudding)

00:09:49.344 --> 00:09:50.346
(Orihime gasping)

00:09:54.656 --> 00:09:58.095
Who, or should I
say, what is that?

00:09:58.162 --> 00:09:59.498
(foot stomping)

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.003
You weren't expecting to
see us again, were you?

00:10:02.037 --> 00:10:04.742
We told you not to
underestimate us.

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:08.349
Go on, teach this cocky
four-eyed monkey a lesson!

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:10.688
Smash his stupid face in, Ayon!

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:15.731
(Ayon roaring)

00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:17.000
(Orihime gasping)

00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:18.670
What the hell?

00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:20.508
What is that?

00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:22.410
Ayon's a pet monster we created

00:10:22.444 --> 00:10:25.116
by fusing our left
arms together!

00:10:25.183 --> 00:10:28.524
Watch yourself, he can be
a little unpredictable!

00:10:28.557 --> 00:10:30.761
(Ayon roaring)

00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:32.965
Surely a mindless
beast like that

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:35.103
is no match for my
Voll Stern Dich-

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:37.207
-(punch thudding)
-(Quilge grunting)

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:38.710
(Quilge coughing wetly)

00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:41.448
(book tapping)

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.452
So far, I've found nothing.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.290
[Ryuken] What are
you doing here?

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:47.695
[Uryu] Ryuken.

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:50.634
I seem to remember telling
you not to come in here

00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.437
without my permission.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.609
The Soul Society
is under attack.

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:57.214
And Hueco Mundo's been invaded.

00:10:57.247 --> 00:11:01.322
And from the looks
of it, it's Quincies.

00:11:01.388 --> 00:11:04.562
But there are no Quincies
in existence besides us.

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:05.631
So what's up?

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.635
What do you know?

00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:10.373
None of this even
remotely concerns you.

00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:11.442
(Uryu growling)

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:14.481
-Drop it.
-Don't you brush me aside!

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.318
Not again!

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:18.724
I am the last Quincy there is.

00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:20.493
I need to know.

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:22.732
I have a right to know!

00:11:25.838 --> 00:11:27.808
The answer you're looking for,

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:29.812
you won't find it here.

00:11:29.846 --> 00:11:33.286
-(footsteps tapping)
-(door thudding)

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:35.658
You're not scared, are you?

00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:38.597
-Of course not.
-Glad to hear it.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.866
Shino?

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:42.470
This might be a strange
time to ask this, but...

00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:43.472
Yeah, what is it?

00:11:43.507 --> 00:11:45.243
The Soul Reapers
and the Quincies

00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:48.015
share the same goal of
defeating Hollows, right?

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.420
So can you tell me why
we're even fighting

00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:51.656
each other in the first place?

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.094
What? You don't know that?

00:11:56.098 --> 00:11:58.169
Oh, uh, well...

00:11:58.202 --> 00:11:59.839
[Kajomaru] You know
that in ancient times,

00:11:59.872 --> 00:12:03.446
Soul Reapers were referred
to as Balancers, right?

00:12:04.047 --> 00:12:05.784
[Shino] Sixth Seat Kajomaru!

00:12:06.653 --> 00:12:07.555
It's an honor, sir!

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:08.724
Thank you.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.561
But since we have time,
why don't we look into

00:12:10.628 --> 00:12:12.698
this question of
yours for a bit?

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:18.009
You both understand the basic
law of this world, don't you?

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:21.382
That souls circulate between
the world of the living

00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:22.551
and the Soul Society?

00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:24.454
-Of course.
-Yes, definitely.

00:12:24.488 --> 00:12:25.958
Good.

00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:28.797
When a living creature
becomes a Hollow, however,

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.203
they can't return
to the Soul Society.

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:35.911
It is our job as Soul Reapers
to purify these Hollows,

00:12:35.978 --> 00:12:38.984
and by delivering their
souls to the Soul Society,

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:41.923
lead them back to the
normal circulation of souls.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.595
That is why we are
called Balancers.

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:47.568
But Quincies seek to
destroy and extinguish

00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:49.706
souls that have become Hollows.

00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:52.243
And what happens
when they do that?

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.716
Those souls are
never able to return

00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:56.485
to the Soul Society then?

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:57.722
That's right.

00:12:57.755 --> 00:12:59.358
Normally, a balance
should be maintained

00:12:59.391 --> 00:13:02.330
between the number of souls
that exist in the Soul Society

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:04.836
and the number existing in
the World of the Living.

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:06.940
But as Quincies
extinguish more Hollows

00:13:07.007 --> 00:13:08.610
in the World of the Living,

00:13:08.677 --> 00:13:10.380
the numbers of souls is reduced,

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.916
disrupting the natural balance.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.352
If we don't stop them,

00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:15.958
the balance will eventually
be irreparably damaged,

00:13:16.025 --> 00:13:17.862
causing the Soul Society to flow

00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:20.099
-into the world of the Living,
-(hands clapping)

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:23.439
resulting in the ultimate
destruction of both.

00:13:23.507 --> 00:13:24.509
(both gasping)

00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:26.880
(book tapping)

00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:29.184
Nothing.

00:13:29.217 --> 00:13:32.223
There isn't even much here
about Quincies to begin with.

00:13:34.729 --> 00:13:35.898
Master...

00:13:36.866 --> 00:13:38.537
-(chain rattling)
-(Uryu sighing)

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.245
"You won't find it here."

00:13:44.414 --> 00:13:46.485
(door thumping)

00:13:46.553 --> 00:13:49.559
(footsteps tapping)

00:13:50.728 --> 00:13:53.900
(somber guitar music)

00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:58.910
(drawers clattering)

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:02.551
Huh?

00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:06.425
(gasps) The Master's diary!

00:14:08.396 --> 00:14:11.068
[Kajomaru] To prevent such a
catastrophe from happening,

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.072
the Soul Society
repeatedly tried

00:14:13.105 --> 00:14:14.976
to negotiate with the Quincies,

00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:18.182
but they were
rebuffed every time.

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:20.521
The Soul Society could
see that the world

00:14:20.587 --> 00:14:22.323
was heading toward destruction,

00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:27.500
so 200 years ago, after
endless discussion and debate,

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:31.408
the Quincy Extermination
Operation was initiated.

00:14:31.442 --> 00:14:34.414
Our goals are antithetical,
and they'll never forgive us

00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:38.089
for the genocide we
perpetrated on them.

00:14:38.122 --> 00:14:41.629
The Soul Reapers and Quincies
have no choice but to fight.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:47.107
Now do you understand,
Squad Member Ryunosuke Yuki?

00:14:47.808 --> 00:14:49.979
Just one more question.

00:14:51.783 --> 00:14:53.452
Are we sure that,

00:14:53.486 --> 00:14:56.125
that we're the ones with
justice on our side?

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.034
There are times when justice

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:03.640
lies wholly on one
side or the other.

00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:06.546
But we are at war.

00:15:06.613 --> 00:15:11.556
Wars take place when both sides
believe their cause is just.

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:16.498
[Yamamoto] You know why I have
called you here, don't you,

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:19.539
Squad 12 Captain Kurotsuchi?

00:15:19.572 --> 00:15:22.043
I'm assuming it's because
I failed to get permission

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:25.517
before ordering my squad
to expunge 28,000 citizens

00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:27.988
of the Rukon District
in order to correct

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:29.725
the imbalance of souls?

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:32.397
And why did you
not get permission?

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.002
We could have avoided all
the confusion that arose

00:15:35.036 --> 00:15:36.973
when mass disappearances
in that district

00:15:37.006 --> 00:15:40.313
were reported by Squad 11's
Third Seat Ikkaku Madarame

00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:42.818
and Fifth Seat
Yumichika Ayasegawa.

00:15:42.852 --> 00:15:44.922
You would've been
granted permission

00:15:44.989 --> 00:15:46.225
if you had only asked.

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:48.162
And while I sat
waiting for permission,

00:15:48.195 --> 00:15:50.934
the situation might well have
escalated beyond control.

00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:53.172
That is not something
I particularly wanted

00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:55.076
to be responsible for.

00:15:55.109 --> 00:15:57.748
The mass extermination of
Hollows by the Rebel Army

00:15:57.781 --> 00:15:59.552
was meant to disrupt
the balance between

00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:02.257
the World of the Living
and the Soul Society.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.793
Considering that the
loss of those people

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.966
in the Rukon District prevented
the collapse of both worlds,

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.605
it seems to me a
small price to pay.

00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:11.175
And it seems to me

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:14.014
that we might have avoided
this entire situation

00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:16.118
had your Department of
Research and Development

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:19.024
reported the matter earlier
and dealt with it promptly.

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:20.561
Utter nonsense.

00:16:20.594 --> 00:16:23.800
From the moment that the
Quincy known as Uryu Ishida

00:16:23.867 --> 00:16:26.104
infiltrated the Soul
Society as a Ryoka,

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:28.275
I foresaw that something
like this would happen

00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:30.581
and advised you
accordingly, remember?

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:35.056
It was you who chose to
heedlessly disregard my warning.

00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:37.227
Oh, and let us not
forget the fact that

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.464
everything that is
happening now is happening

00:16:39.497 --> 00:16:42.170
because you, head captain,
couldn't kill that man

00:16:42.237 --> 00:16:43.807
a thousand years ago!

00:16:43.874 --> 00:16:45.744
It was you who
brought this upon us!

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:49.886
(Ayon roaring)

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:52.591
(fists slamming)

00:16:55.831 --> 00:16:57.066
(Quilge choking)

00:16:57.735 --> 00:16:58.737
(Orihime gasping)

00:16:59.572 --> 00:17:02.110
(Ayon roaring)

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.489
(laughs) Look at that!

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:11.194
This guy's tough, all
right, I'll give him that.

00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:13.165
I can't believe he's
even in one piece

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.436
after the clobbering
he just got from Ayon-

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:17.841
(flesh crunching)

00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:18.910
(both gasping)

00:17:18.944 --> 00:17:20.012
(Emilou grunting)

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.783
Impressive.

00:17:21.783 --> 00:17:23.853
Intelligence reports
never indicated

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.489
this level of power.

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:28.329
Clearly, I will have
to advise his majesty

00:17:28.362 --> 00:17:30.601
to adjust the
strength of our Blut.

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:32.805
-(bones snapping)
-But that's for later.

00:17:33.807 --> 00:17:36.713
As for here and now,

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:38.817
all of you are going to die.

00:17:38.817 --> 00:17:41.488
(energy humming)

00:17:41.488 --> 00:17:42.490
No!

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.893
Not again!

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.962
(Chad grunting in pain)

00:17:44.996 --> 00:17:47.735
(energy humming)

00:17:53.145 --> 00:17:55.951
(Ayon roaring)

00:17:55.984 --> 00:17:57.053
Hold on.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.322
No, Ayon!

00:17:58.322 --> 00:17:59.224
Stop!

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:01.194
When I said all of
you are going to die,

00:18:01.228 --> 00:18:02.965
I may have misspoke.

00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:04.134
(Ayon roaring)

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:05.336
(both gasping)

00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:09.177
(body thudding)

00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:13.052
Sklave Rai.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.058
a Quincy's ability
to absorb Reishi,

00:18:16.091 --> 00:18:17.695
pushed to its furthest limit.

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:21.669
It can achieve the complete
subordination of that Reishi.

00:18:21.703 --> 00:18:24.575
I wanted to avoid
using it, if possible.

00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:28.883
I can't stand thought of my
holy wings being besmirched

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:32.156
by such grotesque impurities.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.158
(both grunting)

00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:35.062
A wise choice.

00:18:35.096 --> 00:18:38.402
However, you still haven't
grasped the disparity

00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:40.941
between your power and mine.

00:18:41.008 --> 00:18:43.112
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:18:43.178 --> 00:18:46.886
-(bodies thudding)
-(Cyan screaming)

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:49.859
(Orihime gasping)

00:18:49.892 --> 00:18:50.861
No!

00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:51.929
Orihime!

00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:55.036
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:18:55.069 --> 00:18:57.708
-(Chad straining)
-Chad!

00:18:57.741 --> 00:19:01.181
Whenever I see such suffering,
it just confirms my belief

00:19:01.214 --> 00:19:05.289
that killing the weak is
invariably disappointing.

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:10.032
Why is it they always make an
unsightly spectacle of dying?

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.869
I can't bear to watch this.

00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:12.905
Just die.

00:19:13.907 --> 00:19:15.142
(glass shattering)

00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:18.883
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:19:20.987 --> 00:19:23.827
-(swords clanging)
-(attack exploding)

00:19:23.893 --> 00:19:25.162
A Bankai!

00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:27.467
I'm guessing if I could
destroy that disk on your head,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.638
you can't do so much
"subordinating of Reishi,"

00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:30.439
can ya?

00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:32.210
Figuring that out is one thing,

00:19:32.243 --> 00:19:34.815
but to actually have
the audacity to try it!

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:38.489
You really are an extremely
difficult person to deal with,

00:19:38.556 --> 00:19:39.290
aren't you?

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:41.996
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:19:42.063 --> 00:19:43.833
Hurry, hurry!
Keep up!

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.971
Come on, gimme a break, will ya?

00:19:46.004 --> 00:19:47.407
Correct me if I'm wrong here,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.077
but I think you were
the one who insisted

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.647
that we find and
save Dondochakka

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.152
while Ichigo is
distracting the enemy!

00:19:53.185 --> 00:19:54.822
Oh, and I'm so glad you did!

00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:57.093
I didn't know at the time
that he was going to end up

00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:58.429
being this much trouble!

00:19:58.462 --> 00:20:01.034
We should've left you back
there hiding in the sand,

00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:02.971
you overgrown polka-dot buffoon!

00:20:03.005 --> 00:20:05.009
You know that hurts, right?

00:20:05.076 --> 00:20:05.944
(Urahara gasping)

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:10.587
(cloth fluttering)

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.264
[Ryuken] Now you're in my
room without permission?

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:17.768
That's twice now.

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.370
You've read this, right?

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:22.811
Is it true, what's
written in here?

00:20:22.811 --> 00:20:23.680
I see.

00:20:23.713 --> 00:20:25.984
So you've known
everything all along.

00:20:25.984 --> 00:20:27.554
About the Wandenreich,

00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:29.959
about the one
who's leading them,

00:20:29.992 --> 00:20:31.495
about Mom, even.

00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:36.004
Uryu, I told you, this
doesn't concern you.

00:20:36.037 --> 00:20:37.106
(Uryu growling)

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.312
(footsteps tapping)

00:20:43.318 --> 00:20:46.959
(Soul Reapers murmuring)

00:20:46.993 --> 00:20:48.963
There's no need to
look so nervous.

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:50.667
Was I? Sorry about that.

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:52.704
Don't you worry.

00:20:52.738 --> 00:20:55.209
Squad 11 is right
outside the gate.

00:20:55.242 --> 00:20:56.478
We'll be safe here.

00:20:56.512 --> 00:20:57.714
-(fire exploding)
-(all gasping)

00:20:57.748 --> 00:20:59.050
[Soul Reaper 1]
What's happening?

00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:01.087
[Soul Reaper 2] It's
some kind of blue fire!

00:21:01.154 --> 00:21:01.923
But how?

00:21:03.091 --> 00:21:05.864
How I dislike conflict.

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:08.001
It is so disagreeable.

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:09.972
(fires exploding)

00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:11.676
-What's going on?
-An attack?

00:21:11.676 --> 00:21:14.582
(doors clattering)

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:16.084
What the hell?

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:16.919
What is that?

00:21:19.157 --> 00:21:20.493
Reishi?

00:21:20.527 --> 00:21:21.996
Is that what that is?

00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:25.871
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:33.520
(swords clattering)

00:21:36.893 --> 00:21:38.028
Well, come on!

00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:39.297
What is it?

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.067
[Reishi Investigator]
Spiritual pressure analysis,

00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:43.038
a 93% match!

00:21:43.038 --> 00:21:44.508
It's a Quincy!

00:21:44.542 --> 00:21:47.079
-(fire roaring)
-(Izuru grunting)

00:21:47.113 --> 00:21:51.254
(Izuru gasping and gurgling)

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.258
(body thudding)

00:21:53.292 --> 00:21:55.196
Lieutenant Kira!

00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:58.068
(growls) You'll pay
for that, you coward!

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.740
Spiral and Rise, Shunjin!

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.809
Mogaribue!

00:22:01.876 --> 00:22:03.111
Now blow!

00:22:03.145 --> 00:22:04.715
Counteract, Katakage-

00:22:04.748 --> 00:22:07.220
-(Katakura grunting)
-(body slamming)

00:22:07.253 --> 00:22:09.157
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:22:09.224 --> 00:22:11.127
-(fire roaring)
-(blood squelching)

00:22:11.161 --> 00:22:12.330
(body thudding)

00:22:12.396 --> 00:22:14.568
Sorry about this,

00:22:14.602 --> 00:22:17.473
but we're gonna have to
kill every one of you.

00:22:17.541 --> 00:22:21.414
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:22:25.222 --> 00:22:27.293
Tremble, Soul Reapers.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.401
For the Stern Ritters have come.

00:22:33.405 --> 00:22:36.311
We're going to purge
you from the world.

00:22:39.585 --> 00:22:44.327
("Saihate" by SennaRin)

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:49.572
(singing in Japanese)

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.275
[Toshiro] A frostbitten
world turns to fire.

00:24:15.342 --> 00:24:17.179
A shadow of a wing remains.

00:24:18.348 --> 00:24:21.454
I try and try again.

00:24:21.522 --> 00:24:24.561
It slips away, shadow of a wing.
