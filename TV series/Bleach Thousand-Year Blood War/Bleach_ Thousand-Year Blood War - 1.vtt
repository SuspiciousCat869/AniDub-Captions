00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.918
[Yhwach] The confined
Quincy King

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:21.755
regains his pulse
after 900 years,

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:26.126
his mind after 90 years,

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:29.763
his strength
after nine years,

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.633
and finally-

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.104
(Yhwach chuckles)

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.873
(alarm wailing)

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:42.376
[Mayuri] What is the
Sutra Scale at now?

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.045
[Akon] Category four,
it's getting serious.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.213
[Mayuri] You certainly took

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.582
your sweet time reporting this.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:49.883
[Akon] I'm sorry, sir,

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:51.752
there have been minor
surges in the past,

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.053
but we've been
able to handle them

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.755
with some very
slight adjustments.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.758
112 more Hollows
have just disappeared

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.126
from my sector!

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.396
Correct border intensity by
point-twenty-four degrees!

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.065
Third Seat Akon,
the Hollows are continuing

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.067
to disappear from the
World of the Living.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.203
At this rate, if we
don't do something soon-

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.205
I am aware of that already.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.874
Now if you have nothing
new to report, leave us.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.409
Yes, sir.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:16.376
(radar beeping)

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.579
[Akon] Captain, what do
you think it could be?

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:20.914
Isn't is obvious?

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:23.217
Something or someone is erasing

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.053
the very existence of Hollows.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.755
Only they are capable of that.

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:33.627
(dramatic music)

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:47.207
(bracelet jingling)

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:55.215
(Zennosuke)All right,
out you get!

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.521
My work here is done,
it's up to you two now,

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:01.455
so try to get along

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.291
and focus on exterminating
Hollows, okay?

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.393
Fight them, not each other.

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.164
What was that, Shino?

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:12.666
Didn't you hear what he
just said about not fighting

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:13.700
with each other?

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:16.303
Then let's see a little
more confidence, Ryunosuke,

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.138
stop looking so nervous
and get a grip on yourself,

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:20.807
because like it not, we've
been assigned to this post.

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:21.808
You got it?

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:23.310
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.979
I'm just, you know, a
little worried, that's all.

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:27.347
[Shino] Oh, relax, will you?

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:28.315
You're with me.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.450
Yeah, you're not what
I'm worried about.

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:33.153
I hear that Karakura
Town has a high incidence

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:34.488
or Hollow appearances.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.157
I just wonder if I'm the
right person to be assigned

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:38.659
to a post like this.

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:40.327
And anyway, from what I heard,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.796
this town already has a really
strong Substitute Soul Reaper

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.666
so I mean, what's the point
of me even being here, really?

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:46.767
Listen to yourself!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.269
Would you try and stop
being a wuss for one second?

00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:51.972
That's why they have two
of us stationed here now,

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.140
so we don't have to rely

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.142
on the Substitute
Soul Reaper as much.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.978
Which means, they
recognize your abilities,

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.146
even if you don't.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.314
I would've thought we'd be here

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.982
to support the
Substitute Soul Reaper,

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.150
not to fight instead of them.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.484
That's the point I don't-

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.652
Shut up, will you?

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:06.987
I'll patrol the north side,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.622
you take up the south, okay?

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.325
[Ryunosuke] Wait, we're
not patrolling together?

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.160
That would be a waste of time.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.829
What's the point of
sending two of us then?

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:18.999
Or maybe you're scared,
is that what it is?

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.468
If it is, just say so, go ahead.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:23.270
Okay then, I'm scared.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.806
[Shino] You say that
like you're proud of it.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.140
Unbelievable.

00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:29.476
I'm through with you,
you're on your own.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.677
Hey, wait!

00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:38.385
(wind howling)

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.055
(horn honking)

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:48.395
(crows cawing)

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.808
That Shino, I told
her that I was scared,

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:04.611
and she still makes
me patrol alone.

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:08.482
Just please, don't let
any Hollows appear.

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:09.983
(objects clattering)

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:11.218
What was that?

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:18.692
(dramatic music)

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.530
(Ryunosuke screaming)

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:27.968
Come in, come in, Shino!

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.637
Shino, I found one!

00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:33.340
(intense music)

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.819
Come on, come on, Shino.

00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:47.521
Shino, where are you?

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:49.356
Why aren't you answering?

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:56.530
(Ryunosuke gasps)

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:04.505
(sword clatters)

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:10.277
I have to do this, it's
only the two of us here.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.048
There's no one else to save
Shino, I have to do it.

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:24.992
What, no way, how?

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.661
Just from that one blow?

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.697
Am I really going to die?

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.370
No, no,

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.206
I don't want to die.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:47.514
Huh?

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:13.273
There, now I've stabilized you.

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:15.809
And I'll be back to
finish healing you both

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:18.478
just as soon as this
business is over.

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:19.513
Okay then.

00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:23.350
(intense music)

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:28.222
Let's get this over with.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.160

Who are you anyway?

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:54.201
Ichigo Kurosaki,
Substitute Soul Reaper.

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:12.753
Oh, good, you're awake.

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:14.154
Now get lost.

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:16.623
What?

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:21.094
Look what I've got,
fresh bread and pastries!

00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:24.431
Oh, so you're finally
awake, thank goodness.

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:27.267
You sure that stuff
is actually fresh?

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.536
Those were all the leftovers
that didn't sale, right?

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.738
Fine, if you're gonna
be rude about it,

00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:33.073
you won't get any.

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:35.409
She's right, you are being rude.

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:37.411
You enjoy her bread
more than anyone else,

00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:40.614
so maybe you should stop
being so ungrateful.

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:41.615
I agree.

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:43.083
Hey, screw you.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:45.586
What are you guys doing just
barging into my room anyway?

00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:47.554
[Uryu] We met Yuzu
outside and she let us in.

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:50.090
Now how about you stop talking
and fetch us some plates?

00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:51.158
[Ichigo] What?

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:52.759
Since when do I take
orders from you?

00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:53.927
[Uryu] I'm not ordering you,

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:55.262
I'm just making a suggestion,

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:57.631
one that would be in
your interest to take.

00:09:57.664 --> 00:09:58.632
Go to hell!

00:09:58.665 --> 00:09:59.800
(Ryunosuke screams)

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:00.934
What are you screaming about?

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.237
You're the guy who
saved me last night.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.738
If you just realized that now?

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.406
You really were out of it.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.775
And for the record,
that was two days ago,

00:10:08.809 --> 00:10:10.544
not last night.

00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:13.914
Yeah, you were asleep
for over 24 hours.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.149
It's been that long?

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.284
What about Shino?

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:19.753
Here, you're hungry, right?

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.788
Eat, we have plenty.

00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:22.956
Thanks, but I-

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.558
[Ichigo] Yeah, I know,
you can't eat like that.

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:27.461
So climb into the gigai
suit next to you there.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:28.762
Next to me?

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:29.930
(Ryunosuke screams)

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.599
Do you have to scream
all the damn time?

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:34.902
Why are you so scared of
your own gigai anyway?

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:37.070
It's not that, there's
just something else

00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:39.907
I'm worried about
besides eating.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.608
Where's Shino, is she all right?

00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:42.576
I'm back.

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:45.312
Will these be enough
drinks for all of us?

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.649
Ryunosuke.

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:52.753
Oh, Shino, thank
goodness, you're alive.

00:10:52.786 --> 00:10:55.622
You are so pathetic,
you know that?

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:56.823
Okay, let's eat.

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:59.259
I think that our guests might
like this yakisaba bread.

00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:00.627
I'm gonna save it for him.

00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:03.630
What, you don't like fish heads
and fins in your sandwich?

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:07.601
Hey, I forgot to ask your
name, kid, what is it?

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:12.906
I'm hardly a kid, but
allow me to answer,

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.308
I am Ebern.

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:17.744
Or is it my full
name you wanted?

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:20.080
Asguiaro Ebern.

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:22.082
Were there any other questions?

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.451
[Ichigo] I don't know
who the hell you are,

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:26.086
but get off my bed.

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:29.089
I'm sorry, I didn't quite
catch what you said.

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:30.591
Would you mind repeating that?

00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:32.759
I said, I don't know
who the hell you are,

00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:34.928
but get off my damn bed.

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:36.496
I thought that's what you-

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:40.100
So who was that guy?

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:43.270
From that mask, I'd
guess an Arrancar.

00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:44.571
Whatever.

00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:47.140
I'll teach him to put
his feet on my bed.

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:53.447
You don't have any
idea who that was?

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.315
Nope, absolutely none.

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:00.921
[Ebern] What the hell was that?

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:03.290
He just kicked me
without warning.

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:04.258
Hey!

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:06.927
I figure it's me
you're after, right?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.763
Look, why don't we take
this somewhere else?

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:11.798
You think I'm here
because of you?

00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:13.767
You're flattering yourself.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.402
Why did you follow me?

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:18.272
You're curious about
who I am, right?

00:12:18.305 --> 00:12:19.306
Not really.

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:24.311
So was Uryu right,
are you an Arrancar?

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.581
[Ebern] An Arrancar?

00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:30.250
[Ichigo] Are you on your
own, or did someone send you?

00:12:30.284 --> 00:12:33.587
What do you have to
gain from fighting me?

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.490
You have the nerve to
call me an Arrancar?

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:44.164
Whoa, touchy.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:57.444
Wait, what are you
doing with a Quincy's?

00:12:57.477 --> 00:12:58.579
What's the matter,

00:12:58.612 --> 00:13:02.149
does something look familiar
to you, Ichigo Kurosaki?

00:13:06.954 --> 00:13:09.256
[Yumichika] It's
true, nobody's here.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.758
There's no way everyone in
the district could vanish

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.260
without it being noticed,

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.929
especially not with
our squad on watch.

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:18.265
That last report said
there were at least

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:19.733
a few villagers left here.

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:22.736
Which means that the
situation is getting worse.

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:24.071
[Soul Reaper]
Third Seat Madarame!

00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:25.739
Fifth Seat Ayasegawa!

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:26.740
No luck, sir.

00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:28.242
We've searched the whole area

00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:30.544
and couldn't find a single
man, woman, or child.

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:33.914
[Yumichika] An entire
villager spirited away?

00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:35.782
It's almost supernatural.

00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:37.084
[Ikkaku] Don't be ridiculous.

00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:39.152
I'm not buying that explanation.

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.289
[Soul Reaper 2] Sir?

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:43.090
What is it?

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:44.725
Did you find something else?

00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:47.461
[Soul Reaper 2] Actually,
it's something you should see

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.495
for yourself.

00:13:50.297 --> 00:13:52.799
These footprints,
they all come together

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:55.402
in this one spot then just stop.

00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:57.905
You see what I'm
seeing, Yumichika?

00:13:57.938 --> 00:13:59.406
I do.

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:03.076
These footprints were made by
either sandals or bare feet.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.913
So it clearly wasn't
the work of Hollows.

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:07.247
It's hard to believe,

00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:09.449
but the villagers
must've been abducted

00:14:09.483 --> 00:14:10.751
by their own people.

00:14:10.784 --> 00:14:11.752
What?

00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:13.253
But why would they do that?

00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:14.922
It's our job to find that out,

00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:16.790
why do you think we're here?

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.258
Keep searching the area!

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:20.093
There may be other
clues to find.

00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:21.495
[Soul Reapers] Yes, sir!

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:25.332
(dramatic music)

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:39.746
That is Sasakibe's lightning.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.749
[Soul Reaper 3]
Head Captain, sir!

00:14:42.783 --> 00:14:44.318
What is it you want?

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:49.089
[Ludaas] You are Shigekuni
Genryusai Yamamoto,

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:52.759
Head Captain of the 13 Court
Guard Squads, I presume.

00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:54.328
A pleasure to meet you.

00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:57.764
We have come to declare war.

00:14:57.798 --> 00:15:00.634
(lasers whirring)

00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:04.738
[Ichigo] That thing
he's carrying,

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:06.473
does that mean he's also a...

00:15:07.474 --> 00:15:08.609
But it can't be.

00:15:08.642 --> 00:15:12.913
That Hollow mask he's got on
is only worn by Arrancars.

00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:15.549
[Ludaas] I must admit,
I was surprised.

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.918
This is the private
office of the Head Captain

00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:20.420
of the 13th Court Guard Squads,

00:15:20.454 --> 00:15:22.723
and yet it was so
easy to infiltrate.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:27.094
Perhaps your attention to
security is a bit lacking.

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:28.762
I have nothing to fear.

00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:30.597
I know I am here,

00:15:30.631 --> 00:15:33.634
and there is no greater
security than that.

00:15:34.635 --> 00:15:36.136
[Ludaas] I see.

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:42.242
Sasakibe!

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:43.577
[Ludaas] Don't mourn for him,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.247
he deserves praise for
single handedly demonstrating

00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:50.250
the fate that awaits
all you Soul Reapers.

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:52.920
Namely, a desperate,
hopeless struggle,

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:55.923
followed by a miserable death.

00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:58.258
Five days from now,
the Soul Society

00:15:58.292 --> 00:16:01.662
will be annihilated
by the Wandenreich.

00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:09.303
-(glass shattering)
-(intense music)

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.908
That look in your eyes,

00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:18.412
you must want to ask
us, who are you people?

00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:20.914
And yet, you must know
that we would never

00:16:20.948 --> 00:16:22.482
answer that question.

00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:26.486
You should know
who we are by now.

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:30.490
Farewell.

00:16:31.792 --> 00:16:33.160
Stop right there!

00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:36.997
(fire rumbling)

00:16:38.131 --> 00:16:40.801
(intense music)

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.403
[Ebern] What's the
matter, Ichigo Kurosaki?

00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:46.907
Is dodging me the best you
an do with all your powers?

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.408
Pathetic!

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:51.445
[Ichigo] Strange, he seems
more interested in taunting me

00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:52.446
than killing me.

00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:54.448
[Ebern] At this rate, I
doubt you could beat me

00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:56.083
even using your Bankai.

00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:57.985
[Ichigo] Again with the taunts.

00:17:01.822 --> 00:17:03.423
I still don't know who he is

00:17:03.457 --> 00:17:06.093
or why he's attacking
me, but okay,

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:10.163
whoever you are,
I'll play along.

00:17:14.635 --> 00:17:17.070
[Master Genryusai]
They're gone for now.

00:17:17.104 --> 00:17:21.909
Master Genryusai,
there is something

00:17:21.942 --> 00:17:25.746
something about this enemy
that you must know.

00:17:25.779 --> 00:17:27.447
Ban-

00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:29.449
[Ebern] Here it comes.

00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:32.085
The enemy can-

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:35.088
[Ebern] Let me have
it, Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:37.157
Our Bankai, they can-

00:17:39.126 --> 00:17:42.996
[Ebern] Your Bankai ends here!

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.499
Kai!

00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:53.307
What is that?

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:54.608
(Ebern laughs)

00:17:57.444 --> 00:18:02.616
Aufreide Meer eh wolken, wolken
eh regen, regen eh nebel.

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:06.553
Sieht balle eh um sieht ballen.

00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:08.989
Wir gut freude, Danach
Vrund Dill Becher.

00:18:09.323 --> 00:18:10.324
Now!

00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:13.093
(intense music)

00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:16.330
(Ichigo exclaiming)

00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:21.468
Getsuga tensho!

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:38.552
No, impossible.

00:18:38.585 --> 00:18:43.257
What is it that's keeping his
Bankai from disappearing?

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.792
[Ichigo] Now you're talking
about my Bankai disappearing?

00:18:45.826 --> 00:18:47.127
Man, in the last five minutes,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.930
I've come up with a ton of
questions I wanna ask you.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.466
You are so coming with me.

00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:53.667
Am I?

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:58.906
Oh, don't worry,
it isn't for you,

00:18:58.939 --> 00:19:01.475
the shadow only
hides the chosen.

00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:08.582
Dammit, what was that shadow?

00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:11.985
It wasn't the Garganta
that the Arrancars use.

00:19:33.273 --> 00:19:38.478
-(intense music)
-(singing in German)

00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:47.554
If it isn't Ebern.

00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:49.923
How commendable of you
to be waiting for me

00:19:49.957 --> 00:19:51.792
with your head bowed down.

00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:52.960
Fool!

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:55.929
As if I would ever bow
to a worm like you.

00:19:55.963 --> 00:19:56.930
What was that?

00:19:56.964 --> 00:19:58.465
Repeat those words.

00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:02.736
Enough!

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.404
(Ludaas screaming)

00:20:04.438 --> 00:20:07.774
Honestly, how many times
do I have to say it

00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:09.243
to make you understand?

00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:12.779
Do not argue while
you're in my presence.

00:20:12.813 --> 00:20:16.416
You know how I dislike conflict.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:20.988
Now then, tell me how our work
towards peace is progressing.

00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:30.197
(closing theme song)

00:20:57.491 --> 00:21:02.496
(singing in Japanese)

00:24:05.245 --> 00:24:10.284
[Yhwach] Take one step
in, and never return.

00:24:11.251 --> 00:24:15.422
The sea of blood
of the universe.

00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:23.764
