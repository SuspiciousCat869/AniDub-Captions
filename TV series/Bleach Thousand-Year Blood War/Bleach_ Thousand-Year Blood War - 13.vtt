WEBVTT

00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:17.836
Right now I've gotta go.

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:19.940
Hey, hold up, Ichigo!

00:00:19.973 --> 00:00:21.476
Do you even have a plan?

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.446
How you gonna get
back there, huh?

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:26.520
Mm.

00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:29.125
(puff smoke)

00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:31.964
Right on time!

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:32.999
Let's go.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.243
Well, well look who it is.

00:00:51.503 --> 00:00:52.973
(harrumphing chuckle)

00:00:52.973 --> 00:00:55.110
You ready to give
it one more go.

00:01:01.523 --> 00:01:04.630
(melodious guitar music)

00:01:08.436 --> 00:01:09.438
(gasps)

00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:23.534
(surprised gasps)

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:33.486
[Ichigo] You're the one.

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:55.197
Nice job.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:57.702
Now come on up.

00:01:57.702 --> 00:02:01.342
As promised, I'll personally
reforge it for you.

00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:07.722
("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.194
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.934
-("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:47.287
(swinging weapon grunts)

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.158
Hone your swing!

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:51.630
Or you'll never cut
those Quincies down!

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:52.665
[All] Yes, sir!

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.337
(swinging weapon grunts)

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.874
Hm?

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.644
Captain Hitsugaya!

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:02.184
What brings you here today?

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:03.721
I'd like for you to train me.

00:04:03.788 --> 00:04:04.990
What?

00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:07.161
As you know, my
Bankai was stolen.

00:04:07.194 --> 00:04:08.864
If I'm to fight
using only Zanjutsu,

00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:11.904
I must return to basics
and relearn everything.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.074
(shocked gasps)

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:15.377
(swinging weapon grunts)

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.414
After the battle against Aizen,

00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:20.086
I refined my Bankai
to its highest point

00:04:20.153 --> 00:04:22.491
until it could be
called a true Bankai.

00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:26.365
But then, my Bankai was stolen.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:29.338
I must let go of
what's been lost.

00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:32.344
There's no time to waste
dreaming of getting it back.

00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:35.350
Right now, I need to look ahead.

00:04:36.753 --> 00:04:37.922
I don't understand.

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:39.659
Why'd you bring me out here?

00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:44.101
Shuhei, I want you
to master Bankai.

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:45.538
Huh?

00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:48.577
I was lucky my Bankai
wasn't stolen this time

00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.882
but it could very
well happen the next.

00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:53.787
The more Soul Reapers who
use Bankai, the better.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.259
(shocked gasps)

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:58.229
Now Mashiro, Hollowfy!

00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.465
Okay!

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.269
Transform!

00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:03.206
(gasps)

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:04.208
Wait, Kuna!

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.410
Better watch out.

00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:08.216
Mashiro's strong when
she's Hollowfied.

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:09.953
I think mastering your Bankai's

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.890
the only way you won't die here.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.629
Captain Muguruma, you
can't expect me to...

00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:17.635
(punching grunt)

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:19.973
(grunts)

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.309
You idiot.

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:23.146
I told you to be careful.

00:05:23.213 --> 00:05:24.248
That's right!

00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:26.118
After all, a lieutenant
shouldn't disobey

00:05:26.152 --> 00:05:27.789
a super lieutenant!

00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:28.791
See this?

00:05:28.824 --> 00:05:29.926
[Kensei] Get up.

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:32.632
You're either going to
master Bankai or die trying.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.638
I'm not soft like Tosen was.

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:40.882
Just hold on, Captain Muguruma.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:45.490
I've always looked up
to and respected you.

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:50.467
But still, even if
that's the case,

00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:53.507
you have no right to
badmouth Captain Tosen!

00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:01.188
(door opens)

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:02.457
Hey.

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:04.194
Mr. Akon!

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:06.198
Should you be
walking around yet?

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.201
Of course not.

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:08.771
I'm still in a lot of pain.

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:12.344
But I'm not the type to be
lying around in bed all day.

00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:14.616
Where's the Captain?

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:17.522
Oh, right, ever since
the Quincy attack,

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.626
he's just been staying
holed up inside his office

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.362
along with the Lieutenant.

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:22.799
And he hasn't come out?

00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:23.801
Not once?

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:24.836
No.

00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:35.725
Hm.

00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:36.893
(door opens)

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.363
Is something wrong?

00:06:38.396 --> 00:06:40.868
The Captain's been cooped
up for over 24 hours,

00:06:40.902 --> 00:06:43.139
but the Surveillance
Bugs are inactive.

00:06:43.172 --> 00:06:44.876
That has never happened before.

00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:46.012
What?

00:06:46.078 --> 00:06:48.651
So either a crisis has occurred
in the Captain's office

00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:50.220
or he's conducting experiments

00:06:50.287 --> 00:06:52.157
that he doesn't want
anyone else to see

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.161
through the Surveillance Bugs.

00:06:54.194 --> 00:06:56.566
At any rate, I'm
taking a look.

00:06:58.202 --> 00:07:00.006
Mr. Akon, what's that?

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:02.812
A hidden camera I planted
on the Captain's office.

00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:03.814
That's illegal!

00:07:03.847 --> 00:07:04.716
Just drop it.

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:05.751
Picture's up.

00:07:06.753 --> 00:07:08.724
(garbled static)

00:07:08.757 --> 00:07:09.526
(stunned gasps)

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:11.697
What the hell is that thing?

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:14.903
What in the world is the
Captain creating in there?

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.040
(static)

00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:19.879
Big Brother!

00:07:20.881 --> 00:07:21.717
Hey!

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.421
Where are you, Big Brother?

00:07:25.156 --> 00:07:26.158
Big Brother!

00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:29.264
Time to get up.

00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:31.035
Please, come and
play ball with me!

00:07:31.068 --> 00:07:32.037
No!

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.206
Now get lost!

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:34.676
(shocked gasps)

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:35.443
(teary)

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:36.913
(shocked gasps)

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:37.749
Hold on!

00:07:37.782 --> 00:07:39.953
Please don't start
crying, Mareyo!

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.556
Listen, I, uh...

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.863
(ingratiating chuckle)

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:47.769
Wanna play kemari?

00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:48.837
Okay!

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:50.941
[Marechiyo] Here it goes!

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:52.110
Wow!

00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:54.582
That's amazing, Big Brother!

00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:59.859
I guess that the Captain
decided not to take me with her.

00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:03.567
(determined inhale)

00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:11.115
Who's there?

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.721
It's been a long time,

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:16.092
Great Elder.

00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:19.799
So, Sajin...

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:23.941
You've got some nerve
coming back here.

00:08:23.974 --> 00:08:25.076
Well get on with it.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.112
What do you want?

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:30.621
Great Elder, I have
come in order to learn

00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:32.892
our clan's secret technique.

00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:37.935
(raucous laughter)

00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:41.643
Don't be ridiculous.

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:46.185
For years you shamelessly
donned a hat and armor

00:08:46.252 --> 00:08:47.955
and pretended to be human

00:08:47.955 --> 00:08:51.696
because you were embarrassed
by our clan's appearance.

00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:55.336
How dare you come here
and make demands of me.

00:08:55.403 --> 00:08:57.107
Please, just look at me!

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.512
I no longer hide my appearance.

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:03.119
The world has changed much
over the past few decades.

00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:04.789
I sense it's reached a point

00:09:04.823 --> 00:09:07.360
where our clan can
live out in the open.

00:09:07.427 --> 00:09:10.668
I see a future where
we can be accepted.

00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:13.707
That very world is
currently under threat!

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:15.878
Just shut your mouth!

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.817
You've got it all wrong.

00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:21.322
The world is under
no true threat.

00:09:21.355 --> 00:09:22.992
It will never perish.

00:09:22.992 --> 00:09:25.296
Only the bearer
of it will change.

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.837
Even then, our clan
will remain the same.

00:09:28.871 --> 00:09:31.710
Regardless of who
claims the world,

00:09:31.777 --> 00:09:33.981
we'll continue to
live in the shadows.

00:09:33.981 --> 00:09:36.853
And I'm telling you
we can change that!

00:09:36.887 --> 00:09:39.993
We must change it for
the sake of our children

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:41.997
and our grandchildren.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.834
Nothing will change.

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:46.038
Nor is there a need for it to.

00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:49.679
Ultimately, it doesn't matter
who the world may belong to.

00:09:49.712 --> 00:09:51.583
It's none of our concern.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.052
Please, Great Elder!

00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:54.054
(loud rumble)

00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:55.591
(shocked gasps)

00:09:55.658 --> 00:09:58.530
Don't you understand, Sajin?

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:02.170
I'm telling you not to
disrupt the peace we have.

00:10:02.204 --> 00:10:05.076
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:10:05.143 --> 00:10:07.214
And if you can't do that

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:11.088
then I shall have no other
choice but to crush you.

00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:13.092
All right!

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:14.094
Bring it on!

00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:17.334
(out of control yell)

00:10:19.939 --> 00:10:21.543
(splash)

00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:23.914
(coughs)

00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:26.686
(shocked gasps)

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:28.289
See that?

00:10:28.356 --> 00:10:29.726
This is why the Hoohden

00:10:29.726 --> 00:10:31.763
was built on a cliff!

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:35.604
A Bankai cannot be reforged
without all of this water.

00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:36.706
(stunned)

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.612
Now brace yourself, Ichigo.

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:42.785
Because this is where
you and your Zanpakuto,

00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:44.188
your old buddy Zangetsu

00:10:46.192 --> 00:10:47.862
must bid each other adieu!

00:10:48.362 --> 00:10:49.732
(shocked gasps)

00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:04.896
(water crashing)

00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:07.568
All right, everybody!

00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:08.537
Come on!

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.906
Let's begin!

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:10.941
It's time

00:11:11.308 --> 00:11:12.578
to start

00:11:12.578 --> 00:11:14.047
the show!

00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:15.049
Yeah!

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:16.151
[All] Yes, sir!

00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.989
(punched grunt)

00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:19.959
(finger cracks)

00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:23.065
The Nimaiya Bodyguards are here!

00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:26.405
(stunned grunt)

00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:27.608
Hey, what are you doing,

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:29.244
just standing there
staring at me?

00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:33.019
When I said "everybody," that
includes you, too, you know.

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:34.087
Asauchi.

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:41.803
(dodging grunt)

00:11:42.772 --> 00:11:44.976
Can somebody tell
me what's going on?

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:47.414
All right, it's party time!

00:11:47.447 --> 00:11:50.955
(upbeat electronic music)

00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:56.098
(rumbles)

00:11:57.635 --> 00:11:58.804
Ready!

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:02.878
Okay!

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:06.151
(rumbles)

00:12:12.163 --> 00:12:12.798
(digging efforts)

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:15.036
I hate this so much.

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:16.506
What a hassle!

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:20.681
I can't believe I'm being
dragged into this mess again!

00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:24.021
Oh, what a horrible
life I have--

00:12:24.054 --> 00:12:26.125
Don't be like that, Ms. Tokie!

00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:28.997
C'mon, we have a
job to do, remember?

00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:29.999
Here goes!

00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:32.070
There!

00:12:32.137 --> 00:12:33.339
Ha!

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:34.341
Yes!

00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:35.343
I got you!

00:12:38.684 --> 00:12:41.021
(inhales)

00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:46.031
(upbeat electronic music)

00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:58.724
Now then, let's get to
work and get this done.

00:12:59.692 --> 00:13:02.497
(metal clanging)

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.113
What're you thinking while
you're watching, Go-Ichi?

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:11.549
(metal clanging)

00:13:11.549 --> 00:13:14.354
Well, uh, it's
much brighter now?

00:13:14.388 --> 00:13:17.561
So I guess maybe you should
have left your sunglasses on.

00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:18.764
You fool!

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:21.368
If I kept my sunglasses on

00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:24.842
then I wouldn't be able to
see the color of the flames!

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:27.682
(metal clangs)

00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:29.519
Have you figured it
out yet, Go-Ichi?

00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:30.854
Huh?

00:13:30.888 --> 00:13:32.357
(metal clangs)

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:36.131
I'm talking about the reason
why this Asauchi turned white

00:13:36.198 --> 00:13:38.637
the moment that it touched you!

00:13:38.704 --> 00:13:39.906
No.

00:13:40.406 --> 00:13:42.745
I bet you thought,

00:13:42.745 --> 00:13:45.416
"It reminds me of the
Hollow within me."

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:47.087
(shocked gasps)

00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:48.890
(hiss)

00:13:48.924 --> 00:13:49.926
That's right.

00:13:49.926 --> 00:13:52.263
This guy is the
Hollow within you.

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:54.101
You see, that Asauchi

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:56.472
essentially became
a kind of catalyst

00:13:56.539 --> 00:13:58.643
and drew this Zanpakuto out.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.912
Mm.

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:02.718
What I'm trying to tell you

00:14:02.752 --> 00:14:05.891
is this Hollow is your
true Zanpakuto, Go-Ichi!

00:14:05.924 --> 00:14:06.893
(stunned gasps)

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:09.398
(metal clangs)

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.970
Aizen created the
Hollow known as "White"

00:14:12.003 --> 00:14:16.813
by layering countless Soul
Reaper souls, one atop another.

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:18.115
Oddly enough,

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.353
that's the same method I use

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.323
to create my Asauchi.

00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:25.029
That very same Hollow
entered your body

00:14:25.096 --> 00:14:28.269
and melded with your
natural Soul Reaper powers,

00:14:29.572 --> 00:14:31.943
thereby becoming your Zanpakuto.

00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:34.515
Wait, hold on a second.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.953
You mean Old Man Zangetsu is--

00:14:36.953 --> 00:14:38.422
I told you, didn't I?

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:42.932
That you'll be saying
goodbye to "Zangetsu?"

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:46.773
Yes, deep inside,
you already know.

00:14:46.806 --> 00:14:47.942
(metal clangs)

00:14:47.975 --> 00:14:50.714
On some level, you
recognize the truth

00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:52.350
about the man inside your soul

00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:55.056
who's been pretending
to be your Zanpakuto!

00:14:55.123 --> 00:15:00.199
-(shocked gasps)
-(metal clangs)

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.048
[Ichigo] Old Man Zangetsu...

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:12.490
[Oetsu] Go-Ichi, you
know that man, right?

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.994
[Ichigo] Of course, I do!

00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:15.396
-It's Zangetsu--
-No.

00:15:15.463 --> 00:15:17.233
Look closer.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.406
You've seen that man up
close with your own eyes.

00:15:20.473 --> 00:15:22.511
Quite recently, in fact.

00:15:22.511 --> 00:15:24.080
Surely you recognize him

00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:26.986
as the enemy who destroyed
the Soul Society!

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.857
(shocked gasps)

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:30.694
That man is not
the manifestation

00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:32.030
of your Soul Reaper powers.

00:15:32.063 --> 00:15:36.573
No. He is your Quincy powers
taking the form of Yhwach

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:38.342
from a thousand years ago!

00:15:39.812 --> 00:15:42.183
(wind howls)

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:48.362
I've been trying to
avoid thinking about it.

00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:53.105
That day, back when I
first confronted him,

00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:57.515
I felt as though I'd
been drawn there.

00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:04.862
All this time, I've been trying
not to let myself ask why.

00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:06.633
And why I was able
to go straight to him

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.235
without knowing anything.

00:16:09.605 --> 00:16:12.545
Or why I thought he was
the most important enemy.

00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:20.226
And finally why the
first time I saw him

00:16:21.395 --> 00:16:23.733
he reminded me of
someone I know.

00:16:36.425 --> 00:16:37.427
Zangetsu!

00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:42.738
(raining)

00:16:45.878 --> 00:16:49.117
What the hell is going
on here, Zangetsu?

00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:52.390
It's as you just heard.

00:16:52.423 --> 00:16:53.425
I'm Sorry, Ichigo,

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:56.833
I am not Zangetsu.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.002
(shocked gasps)

00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:00.406
(rumbles)

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.784
(stunned gasps)

00:17:05.784 --> 00:17:06.986
Ugh.

00:17:10.192 --> 00:17:14.134
So, then you truly are Yhwach?

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:15.837
Are you telling me that,

00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:18.075
that you're really not Zangetsu?

00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:21.081
What I am is the source
of the Quincy power

00:17:21.114 --> 00:17:23.018
that lies within you.

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:26.859
I am Yhwach, and yet I am not.

00:17:26.926 --> 00:17:28.262
I don't get it!

00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:31.134
Are you my enemy or my ally?

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.607
Was everything that you
said to me just a lie?

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:35.309
Answer me!

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.290
I am not an enemy
nor am I an ally.

00:17:43.158 --> 00:17:45.964
But my words held no lies.

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:48.335
Except for the name
that I told you.

00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:54.815
Ichigo, I know you've seen it.

00:17:54.815 --> 00:17:56.118
Think Back.

00:17:56.151 --> 00:18:00.059
Whenever I taught you how
to use your Zanpakuto,

00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:02.998
I always had help
from the Hollow.

00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:04.200
Whenever a time came

00:18:04.234 --> 00:18:07.808
when you couldn't handle
your Zanpakuto's power.

00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:12.150
Whenever you were truly in
danger of losing your life.

00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:17.093
The one that always ended
up saving you was not me.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.697
It was the Hollow.

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:23.339
I never wanted you to become
a Soul Reaper, Ichigo.

00:18:24.307 --> 00:18:26.813
That's why I suppressed
your true power,

00:18:26.846 --> 00:18:28.984
which had not fully matured.

00:18:29.017 --> 00:18:30.252
I took control of it

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:33.359
and became the center
of your power instead.

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:34.094
But why?

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.697
Why, you ask?

00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:37.333
The answer is simple.

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:40.272
I wished to keep you
from danger and conflict.

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:42.778
What else would I be after?

00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:44.849
If you became a Soul Reaper,

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:46.118
you'd be dragged into battle

00:18:46.184 --> 00:18:49.057
whether you wanted to be or not.

00:18:49.057 --> 00:18:50.894
You'd get hurt.

00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:52.263
You'd suffer.

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:57.173
And eventually, even
if I didn't want to,

00:18:57.206 --> 00:19:00.112
I'd have to kill you
with my own hands.

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:01.783
(shocked gasps)

00:19:04.054 --> 00:19:07.126
(energy buzzes)

00:19:07.193 --> 00:19:11.034
(taken aback gasps)

00:19:11.068 --> 00:19:14.207
I couldn't let you
become a Soul Reaper.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.315
Because if you did so,
I'd have to kill you.

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:19.952
I knew that's what would happen.

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:26.098
However, you chose the path
of a Soul Reaper, anyway.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.870
You seized your chance,
honed your strength,

00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:31.074
suffered through
pain and sorrow,

00:19:31.074 --> 00:19:33.245
and yet kept travelling
down that path

00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:34.915
of your own free will.

00:19:36.084 --> 00:19:38.990
As I watched you,
I could almost feel

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:41.763
my heart beginning to waver.

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:43.332
(bubbling)

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:46.304
Eventually, I decided
that I'd no longer

00:19:46.338 --> 00:19:49.411
try to keep you away
from the Soul Reapers.

00:19:49.444 --> 00:19:52.450
My heart turned toward
supporting your decision.

00:19:53.787 --> 00:19:57.761
And now, as I stand
here before you...

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.538
I feel a great sense of joy

00:20:02.604 --> 00:20:05.276
at the thought of
stepping away from you.

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:10.086
Ichigo, you've become strong.

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:13.292
I've been able to stand
right there beside you,

00:20:13.292 --> 00:20:15.296
watching you grow.

00:20:16.364 --> 00:20:18.202
Now I'm happy to leave,

00:20:18.268 --> 00:20:20.807
knowing that you can
stand on your own.

00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:21.943
(shocked gasps)

00:20:23.312 --> 00:20:25.116
I am satisfied.

00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:26.118
No.

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:27.521
Wait, Zangetsu!

00:20:28.322 --> 00:20:29.792
I still need you!

("Number One - Bankai"
by Shiro Sagisu)

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:46.692
Ichigo, what you've
been using so far

00:20:46.726 --> 00:20:50.166
is merely a fragment
of your total power.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.838
It's only the part
I couldn't suppress.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.344
But now no one can stop you

00:20:56.344 --> 00:20:58.983
from fighting with
your own, full power.

00:21:00.352 --> 00:21:02.423
Go on, take it.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.695
That is your true Zanpakuto.

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:07.935
That is Zangetsu.

00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:10.807
(explosive burst)

00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:14.414
[Ichigo] That's right.

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:16.819
There were no lies...

00:21:16.853 --> 00:21:19.859
Not in his words or yours.

00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:24.869
You used a Quincy's shadow
in order to help me.

00:21:26.338 --> 00:21:29.845
You used a Quincy's blood
in order to stop mine.

00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:32.584
And you lent me the
power of a Quincy

00:21:32.618 --> 00:21:34.722
to help me win when I was weak.

00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:39.264
Zangetsu...

00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:42.538
I don't care who you really are.

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:45.844
You might try to
deny this, but...

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.556
You and him are
both Zangetsu to me.

00:21:53.358 --> 00:21:55.564
Let's just agree
to that, all right?

00:21:56.599 --> 00:21:57.601
Zangetsu?

00:22:01.374 --> 00:22:04.280
(flames roaring)

00:22:09.925 --> 00:22:10.927
What the?

00:22:10.927 --> 00:22:12.330
Hey, what are you doing?

00:22:12.396 --> 00:22:14.568
-Your hands'll--
-It's all good.

00:22:14.602 --> 00:22:16.539
Isn't that right, Go-Ichi?

00:22:16.572 --> 00:22:18.910
Funny, I was thinking
the same thing.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.412
I had a nagging suspicion

00:22:20.412 --> 00:22:22.383
that until you poured
your soul into it,

00:22:22.416 --> 00:22:24.254
it'd remain incomplete.

00:22:24.254 --> 00:22:25.724
(harrumphing chuckle)

00:22:25.757 --> 00:22:26.491
Go on.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:29.063
show us what you got, Go-Ichi!

00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:30.399
(triumphant yell)

00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:32.403
That... is your Zanpakuto!

00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:35.644
(explosive burst)

00:22:40.954 --> 00:22:44.093
(steam hissing)

00:22:44.127 --> 00:22:45.095
The sea!

00:22:45.129 --> 00:22:46.498
It evaporated!

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:49.437
What do you say, Go-Ichi?

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:51.609
You think you'll
be okay with them?

00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:56.786
Those two Zangetsu
you have now?

00:22:57.788 --> 00:22:58.590
Two Zanpakuto?

00:22:58.623 --> 00:23:00.359
-No way!
-His soul's in both?

00:23:00.426 --> 00:23:01.696
That's incredible!

00:23:01.762 --> 00:23:02.664
Yeah.

00:23:02.698 --> 00:23:04.935
After all, they were both real.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.776
Zangetsu...

00:23:10.446 --> 00:23:13.118
I won't ask you to lend
me your strength anymore.

00:23:15.489 --> 00:23:18.362
I won't tell you to stay
out of my way, either.

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:22.804
And I won't ask you guys
to fight alongside me.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.354
From here on out,
I'll fight on my own.

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:38.368
Thank you, Zangetsu.

00:23:40.807 --> 00:23:43.078
You are me.

00:23:47.988 --> 00:23:50.527
(footsteps)

00:23:51.361 --> 00:23:54.033
You have returned, Haschwalth.

00:23:55.002 --> 00:23:56.137
And the target?

00:23:57.507 --> 00:23:58.843
Right here.

00:23:58.843 --> 00:24:01.147
(footsteps)

00:24:08.028 --> 00:24:12.036
I welcome you, Uryu Ishida.

00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:16.044
Now, then...

00:24:16.044 --> 00:24:18.716
Let us fight together,

00:24:19.885 --> 00:24:20.887
my son.
