WEBVTT

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:11.912
There you have it, sir.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.447
That is my full report.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.450
I see.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.253
Your unauthorized intervention
was a serious violation

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:22.456
Squad 10 Captain
Shiba, that said,

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.925
your quick and decisive
action helped prevent

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.793
further casualties to
the squad and damage

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.495
to the world of the living.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:29.663
Therefore,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.764
(cane thuds)

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.099
I shall overlook
your contravention

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:34.268
of the rules this time.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:35.402
Yes!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.638
Uh, I mean, thank
you very much, sir.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.639
Ha!

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.973
If you would ask me,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.576
your most grave offense was
your failure to retrieve

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:45.579
the remains of this mystery
Hollow, as you call it.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.914
Captain Shiba.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.815
Your report is rather complete

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.051
as far as describing
this unusual Hollow,

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.419
but I have been wondering

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.922
if there might be something
else that you have left out.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.456
Are you absolutely certain

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.592
that nothing else
worthy of note occurred

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:01.094
that you might have
forgotten to mention?

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.099
[Isshin] No, sir.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.267
There's nothing else.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:13.473
-(horn honking)
-(board clanking)

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.543
(Masaki sighs)

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.613
[Masaki Voiceover] I hope
that Soul Reaper made it back

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.582
to the Soul Society all right,

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.451
and that he didn't get in
trouble for helping me.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.157
I wish I'd at least
gotten his name.

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:34.828
-(birds chirping)
-(gentle music)

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:36.463
(Isshin groans)

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.931
[Isshin Voiceover]
I guess the rumors

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:40.501
about there still being
some Quincies alive

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:41.702
are actually true.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.405
It took guts for her
to step in and save me

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.741
and even more to tell
me that she's a Quincy,

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.376
knowing that I'm a Soul Reaper.

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:53.447
She's quite a girl, that one.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.117
I didn't even really
thank her properly.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.057
Maybe I should go back and
try to get to know her better.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:08.295
I told you, Ryu's my
cousin. That's all.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:09.763
Nothing's going on between us.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:10.898
Oh, what's it like living

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.766
with the most
popular boy in town?

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.767
(Masaki laughs)

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.936
Stop, will ya? (gasps)

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.605
-Whoa, hey.
-Masaki?

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.241
(grunts) Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.076
Oh, don't give it
a second thought.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.546
As long as you're
okay, I'm okay.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:28.382
[Shiho] You all right?

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.751
[Kanan] Is that your
new way of meeting guys?

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.252
[Masaki] Would you
give it a rest?

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.655
-Please!
-(Shiho and Kanan laughing)

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.722
(Kisuke grunts)

00:02:37.558 --> 00:02:42.563

-("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.161
[Masaki] I'm back!

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:22.763
Masaki, welcome-

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.831
-Masaki.
-Uh, y-yes?

00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:27.267
Are the stories true?

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.237
I have been told that you
fought against a Hollow

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:32.606
the other night to
save a Soul Reaper.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.941
-Huh?
-(Ryuken gasps)

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:35.742
N-No, I would never think

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.244
of even doing
anything of the sort.

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:39.580
You only make it worse by lying.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:40.981
[Ryuken Voiceover] Katagiri!

00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:42.916
[Izumi] How could
you do such a thing?

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.918
Have you no shame?

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:46.820
You've break the
rules of the Quincies

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:48.922
while in the care of
the Ishida Family?

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:49.923
(door slams)

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.158
Katagiri!

00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:53.994
You told Mother
about what happened.

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:55.095
You did, didn't you?

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.464
We agreed there was
nothing to report!

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:01.635
I'm sorry, but it
had to be done.

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:03.070
But why?

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:04.905
Because Miss Masaki
sustained a grievous wound

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:06.607
from the Hollow's attack.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.276
If she doesn't get proper
Quincy spiritual treatment

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.979
from your father and
mother immediately,

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.947
there's a very good chance
the future bloodline

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.650
of the Ishida could
become tainted forever!

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:17.751
Don't be absurd, Katagiri-

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:19.286
Absurd, Master Ryuken?

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.089
The bloodline means
everything to us.

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:23.624
Didn't you say so yourself?

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:26.093
That your marriage to
Miss Masaki was to secure

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:27.794
the future of the Quincies?

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.930
-(tense music)
-(Ryuken groans)

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:30.931
Damn it!

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:32.666
(footsteps tapping)

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:33.767
Now, what happened?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.735
Tell me the truth.

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.470
Ah, well, uh-

00:05:36.537 --> 00:05:38.438
Mother! That's enough.

00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:41.041
Masaki isn't to blame for
what happened that night.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.409
She was just trying to-

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.077
No, it's all right, Ryu.

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.245
Let me handle it.

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:47.114
-(Masaki gasps)
-(bag thuds)

-(Masaki thuds)
-What in the world?

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.250
Masaki!

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:54.087
What is it? Are you all right?

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:58.158
-(Masaki groaning)
-(dramatic music)

00:05:58.225 --> 00:05:59.226
No!

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.095
Is that a Hollow's hole?

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.498
(gasps) Stop it, Ryuken. What
do you think you're doing?

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:05.766
[Ryuken] Where's Father?

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:07.634
Someone has already
gone to find him.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.803
Just wait here till he comes.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.071
(Ryuken grunts)

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:12.906
No, no. Wait, Ryuken!

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.408
Put that thing down!

00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:16.910
You don't know what
danger you might be!

00:06:16.944 --> 00:06:19.112
No! Come back, please!

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:21.081
Ryuken, come back!

00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:26.053
(dramatic music continues)

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:29.456
[Ryuken Voiceover] What is this

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.258
that so resembles
a Hollow's hole?

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:33.927
And why is she in so much pain?

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:36.230
What is happening to Masaki?

00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:38.398
I should have stopped her
from leaving that night.

00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:40.100
I should have intervened
in that battle

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.935
and kept her from being hurt.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.272
Why did I do nothing?

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:46.440
(Hollow roaring)

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:49.142
(tense music)

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.949
You're lucky I happen
to be in the area.

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:58.285
That thing almost gotcha.

00:06:58.318 --> 00:06:59.920
It's you!

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:01.321
Hm? Have we met?

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:03.924
-(Masaki groans)
-(suspense music)

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:06.994
(gasps) Wait, let me
take a look at her.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.762
Stay back.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.231
Don't you dare touch
her, Soul Reaper.

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.368
You're the reason this
is happening to her!

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:17.070
Masaki broke the rules

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:20.240
of the Quincies to protect
you, a Soul Reaper.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.110
And now, because of
that, she's dying!

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:24.978
Why did this have
to happen to her?

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:26.713
She did nothing wrong!

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.918
That's what's causing
this? The wound she got?

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.487
Is there any other explanation?

00:07:33.554 --> 00:07:34.821
I'll never forgive you.

00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:36.390
Okay, break it up.

00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:40.594
This is no time to be arguing

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:44.298
so put your grudges on
hold and come with me.

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:47.534
And I'll show you the
choices you have to save her.

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:08.589
-(air whooshing)
-(gentle brooding music)

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:13.093
[Masaki Voiceover] I'm falling,

00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:17.231
falling into a deep,
peaceful place.

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:22.903
It's quiet, dark, and lonely,

00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:26.940
and yet I don't feel
frightened at all.

00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:28.308
I have a strange feeling

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:32.446
that someone who needs me
is waiting for me down here.

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:35.415
Who is it?

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:38.118
(Hollow roars)

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:41.088
(water patters)

00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:44.224
(rain pattering)

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:46.793
[Kisuke] I'm familiar

00:08:46.827 --> 00:08:48.428
with those symptoms
she's exhibiting.

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:51.965
I've been researching them
for almost a hundred years.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:53.100
A hundred?

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.736
Hey, you mind telling
us who you are?

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:57.905
[Kisuke] I'm Kisuke Urahara,

00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:00.574
an exile from the Soul Society.

00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:03.076
Kisuke Urahara? So that's you?

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.946
I don't give a damn
who or what you are.

00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:08.248
Just make Masaki normal again!

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:10.918
I never said I could
make her normal again.

00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:11.919
But I thought-

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:14.087
I'll give it to you straight.

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:16.089
Your lady friend?

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:19.059
She's never going back to
the way she used to be.

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:20.594
-(Ryuken gasps)
-(tense music)

00:09:20.627 --> 00:09:24.097
She's undergone what's
known as Hollowfication.

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:27.601
Hollowfication occurs when
a Hollow's soul is infused

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:29.403
into another being soul,

00:09:29.436 --> 00:09:31.905
destroying the boundaries
between the two.

00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:34.575
It's an experimental
effort to translate a soul

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:38.412
to a higher level, creating
a whole new type of being.

00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:42.416
The original purpose was to
create stronger Soul Reapers.

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:45.953
The problem is souls that
undergo Hollowfication

00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:48.755
eventually become
mindless monsters

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.924
and ultimately self-destruct,

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.927
in a process known
as Soul Suicide.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.597
The end result has
always been inevitable.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.098
How could it be inevitable?

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.433
What do you mean?

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.902
Are you really saying there's
no way we can save her?

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.905
I can't return her
to what she once was

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.140
but I'm not saying I
can't save her life.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.046
During my research over
the last hundred years,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.248
I've discovered a means

00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:16.917
of preventing the Soul
Suicide from happening.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.419
It involves injecting
a counteractive agent

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:23.223
into the victim's soul to
offset the Hollowfication.

00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:25.259
This creates a
balance between souls

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:27.794
so that one doesn't
overpower the other

00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:30.297
thereby preventing
a Soul Suicide.

00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:34.902
If, for example, we inject
a Hollowfied Soul Reaper

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:36.069
with a vaccine made

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:38.939
from a Quincy's light
arrow and a human soul,

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.908
the imbalance will be corrected,

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.075
and they'll remain

00:10:42.109 --> 00:10:44.211
in whatever state they
were in when vaccinated.

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:46.747
However, Quincies have
no natural resistance

00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:51.418
against Hollows so the vaccine
by itself is not enough.

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:53.086
I'm not following.

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:55.088
To put it another way,

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:56.390
in order to halt
the progression,

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:59.259
we need to hit it with
a counteractive force

00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:01.929
but to save this
Quincy girl's life,

00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:03.263
prevent her Hollowfication,

00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:06.400
and allow her to retain
her existence as a human.

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:10.404
We're talking an extremely
powerful counteractive force.

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:12.406
Something enduring
enough to stay

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:14.408
at her side as
long as she lives,

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:18.412
strong enough to continually
suppress her Hollowfication.

00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:19.413
Something like-

00:11:19.413 --> 00:11:20.214
No, you're wrong!

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.082
-(Isshin gasps)
-It's madness.

00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:24.318
There has got to
be some other way.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:26.954
Well, look at you.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:29.089
You've figured it out,

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:32.292
but I'm afraid it's
not your call to make.

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.262
The one who has to choose

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:37.965
-is you, Isshin Shiba.
-Huh?

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:42.236
Soul Reapers are the
opposites of Quincies.

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:45.239
Humans are the
opposites of Hollows.

00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:50.077
Right now, Masaki is a
hybrid of Quincy and Hollow.

00:11:50.077 --> 00:11:52.546
So in order to counteract that,

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:56.116
we need a hybrid of
Soul Reaper and human.

00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:01.421
This Gigai is a special
creation of mine.

00:12:01.455 --> 00:12:04.224
It was created
from a human soul.

00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:06.793
It subsumes any
soul that enters it,

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:09.096
making it completely human.

00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:11.598
You get it now, don't you?

00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:12.933
If you use this Gigai,

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:16.904
you'll become a hybrid
of Soul Reaper and human,

00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:20.574
which means you'll
become Masaki's opposite.

00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:22.943
-(Masaki breathes heavily)
-That is if you choose

00:12:22.976 --> 00:12:26.079
to go that way,
but before you do,

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.550
you should know there's nothing
but downsides in it for you.

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:32.252
For starters, I'll
have to bind your soul

00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:35.088
to both Masaki's soul
and the Hollow within her

00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:36.757
with a string of Reishi,

00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:40.961
and this bond will have to last
for as long as Masaki lives.

00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:42.563
No, longer.

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:46.066
It'll be passed down to all
her descendants forever.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.202
And once you've
entered this Gigai,

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:52.039
not only will you be unable to
use your Soul Reaper powers,

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:55.075
but you won't even be
able to see Hollows.

00:12:55.075 --> 00:12:57.077
And if you should
choose to get in,

00:12:57.077 --> 00:12:59.246
it's more than likely
you'll never return

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:01.448
to being a Soul Reaper again.

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:05.085
[Ryuken Voiceover] It's true.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.087
There's nothing but
downsides in it for him.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.589
It's no choice at all.

00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:09.756
He'll never do it.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:10.958
Who in the right mind-

00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:12.626
All right then, I'll do it.

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:13.627
(Ryuken gasps)

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.928
-[Kisuke] What?
-You heard me.

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:16.964
I said I'll do it. So
come on, let's do it.

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.966
Enough explanations. I get it.

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.934
I just have to quit
being a Soul Reaper,

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:22.603
and I can protect her, right?

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:24.137
Hell yeah, I'll do it.

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:27.040
And you're really okay with it?

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.575
Am I okay with it?

00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:29.910
No. Of course, I'm not.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.746
But how I feel about
it doesn't matter.

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:36.917
If I were to hold back and not
try to save her when I could,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.953
my future self would
never forgive me.

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:42.422
(Ryuken gasps)

00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:44.925
(Ryuken sighs)

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.293
[Kisuke] All right then.

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:51.431
-Let's begin the procedure.
-(suspense music)

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:54.067
(Hollow roaring)

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.069
(Masaki exclaims)

00:13:56.069 --> 00:14:00.240
-(sword clangs)
-(air whooshing)

00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:01.441
It's okay.

00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:02.376
(Masaki gasps)

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:04.244
Don't worry, I've
come to protect you.

00:14:06.914 --> 00:14:08.048
(Isshin chuckles)

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:09.449
Sorry, Hollow.

00:14:09.483 --> 00:14:10.951
But now that I'm here,

00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:12.586
you're never gonna
lay another finger

00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:14.922
on this girl's soul, got it?

00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:16.924
(Hollow roaring)

00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:20.928
Getsuga Tensho!

00:14:20.928 --> 00:14:24.097
(Hollow exploding)

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.207
(Masaki gasps and sighs)

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:35.242
(Kisuke laughs)

00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:38.579
Looks like I've successfully
bound your souls together.

00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:39.913
She'll be all right now.

00:14:39.947 --> 00:14:42.916
What a relief. Thank goodness.

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:45.586
(Masaki laughs)

00:14:45.586 --> 00:14:46.587
I remember you.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.557
You're that Soul Reaper
I met before. Hi there.

00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:52.926
It's funny. I don't
even know your name.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.428
(Masaki laughs)

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:56.964
[Isshin] I'll tell
you when you wake up.

00:14:56.997 --> 00:15:02.202
-(rain pattering)
-(gentle music)

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.438
(Ryuken gasps)

00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:16.917
[Katagiri] Does this mean
you've left Miss Masaki

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:18.252
with the Soul Reaper then?

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:22.122
[Ryuken] Yes.

00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:25.259
Go home and tell my mother

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:27.928
that her son has proven
himself incapable

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:30.464
of protecting the Quincies.

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:31.465
No, I won't.

00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:33.100
[Ryuken] Do as I say.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.401
[Katagiri] I'm sorry, but no,

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.770
I won't leave you
here by yourself.

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:38.906
-[Ryuken] Katagiri-
-Master Ryuken.

00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:40.707
Have you forgotten?

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:41.909
My duty is to serve you,

00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:44.778
and I've devoted my
entire life to it

00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:46.980
and done so without regrets.

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:49.917
From the very first
day I met you,

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:54.054
my life has belonged
to you and only you.

00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:58.158
That's why I beg you.
Please, don't be sad.

00:16:00.661 --> 00:16:03.397
I can't bear to see you unhappy.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.400
It's tearing my
heart into pieces.

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:09.069
When I see you
crying, it makes me-

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:12.072
Katagiri. That's enough.

00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:13.273
Let's go home.

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:21.481
[Katagiri] As you
wish, Master Ryuken.

00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:26.920
-A little later,
-(soft music)

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.089
as soon as she'd graduated
from high school,

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:31.792
Masaki left the Ishida Family.

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.261
Her soul was mixed
with the Hollows now.

00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:38.232
So for the Quincies, it was
an understandable decision.

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:41.568
As for me, I made use of the
medical skills I'd picked up

00:16:41.602 --> 00:16:44.404
at the academy to
open a small clinic.

00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:46.573
I still had a ton
of things to learn,

00:16:46.607 --> 00:16:51.245
but with Urahara's help, I
managed to get by, more or less.

00:16:51.278 --> 00:16:53.247
Masaki went off to college,

00:16:53.247 --> 00:16:55.782
but she still found
time to swing by

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:57.784
and tease me now and then.

00:16:57.818 --> 00:16:59.419
I never told her the truth.

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:01.722
I told her I'd lost
my Soul Reaper powers

00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:05.092
when I was banished from the
Soul Society for screwing up.

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:07.761
I don't think she ever
really bought it though.

00:17:07.794 --> 00:17:10.063
I've always been a
terrible liar anyway

00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:12.933
and her intuition
was incredibly sharp.

00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:14.434
I don't know why
I even bothered.

00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:17.404
My lying was probably a
pretty pointless exercise

00:17:17.404 --> 00:17:18.572
for both of us.

00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:21.775
I'm sure she knew all
along it wasn't the truth,

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.044
but it was like a
little game we played.

00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:27.915
I'd lie to her and she'd
see through my lies

00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:29.950
and forgive me for telling them.

00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:32.753
We went to this movie once,

00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:34.254
and there was this scene in it

00:17:34.288 --> 00:17:37.157
where an old man told the
woman he'd spent his life with

00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:39.960
that she was like the sun.

00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:41.962
I don't remember anything
else about the movie

00:17:41.995 --> 00:17:44.431
except that it made Masaki cry

00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:47.100
and that one line has
always stayed with me.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:51.371
To me, Masaki was like the sun.

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:54.241
She attracted everything,
forgave everything,

00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:58.078
illuminated everything, and
sent everything spinning

00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.279
in orbit around her.

00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:01.381
Me?

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:05.586
I was more than happy
to be spun around.

00:18:07.588 --> 00:18:10.924
Then you were born.

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.226
(rain pattering)

00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:14.962
I think you already
know the rest of it.

00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:18.398
Through Rukia, you gained
your Soul Reaper powers.

00:18:18.432 --> 00:18:22.102
By training with Urahara,
you gained your Zanpakuto,

00:18:22.135 --> 00:18:25.739
and over the course of your
many battles at the Soul Society

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.941
the Hollow in you was awakened.

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:30.944
The very fact that
it was released

00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:32.813
meant that the spiritual
pressure I'd been exerting

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.917
all these years was no longer
capable of suppressing it.

00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:38.752
And so the bond tying me

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:41.221
to my Gigai and that
Hollow was broken

00:18:41.255 --> 00:18:43.223
and I regained my
Soul Reaper powers

00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:46.093
for the first time in 20 years.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.395
You probably don't need
me explaining things

00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:52.065
that you've already
experienced yourself, do you?

00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:53.767
But there's still one
thing you don't know

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.071
the whole story about, and
you need to know about it.

00:18:58.071 --> 00:19:02.910
It was on June 17th, nine
years ago, this very day,

00:19:02.943 --> 00:19:04.411
that your mother died.

00:19:06.413 --> 00:19:11.084
That you know, but you
don't know the real reason

00:19:11.118 --> 00:19:13.954
why your mother died that day.

00:19:16.056 --> 00:19:20.994
("Saihate" by SennaRin)

00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:26.266
(singing in Japanese)

00:20:46.313 --> 00:20:48.081
(rain pattering)

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.149
[Isshin] Your mother.

00:20:50.117 --> 00:20:52.419
She wasn't supposed
to die that day.

00:20:53.287 --> 00:20:55.155
What do you mean "she wasn't?"

00:20:56.657 --> 00:20:58.225
Let me explain.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:02.095
Your mother, Masaki, may
have merged with a Hollow,

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.965
but she was originally
an Echt Quincy.

00:21:04.998 --> 00:21:07.401
Her defensive ability,
the Blut Vene,

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:11.738
was exceptionally strong,
virtually impenetrable.

00:21:11.772 --> 00:21:13.240
Not only should
she have been able

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.410
to easily defeat
Grand Fisher that day,

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:17.411
she could have done it

00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:19.413
without getting a
single scratch on her.

00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:28.222
(Masaki gasps)

00:21:28.989 --> 00:21:31.291
But that's not what happened.

00:21:31.325 --> 00:21:32.392
Why not?

00:21:32.426 --> 00:21:35.429
Because on that day, she
lost her Quincy powers.

00:21:35.429 --> 00:21:36.964
But how can that be?

00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:40.601
What happened on that
day nine years ago?

00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:41.969
Auswahlen.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.275
It's a Quincy selection process
conducted by Yhwach himself.

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:49.576
(Ichigo gasps)

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.746
There's an old Quincy
tale I've heard that tells

00:21:52.746 --> 00:21:55.048
about how their king
was sealed away.

00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:57.417
According to the story,

00:21:57.451 --> 00:22:02.256
the confined Quincy King regains
his pulse after 900 years

00:22:02.289 --> 00:22:07.494
his mind after 90 years, and
his strength after 9 years.

00:22:08.262 --> 00:22:09.763
Yhwach regained his strength

00:22:09.763 --> 00:22:14.268
by robbing those Quincies he
deemed impure of their powers

00:22:14.268 --> 00:22:17.037
and making those powers his own.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.939
It was this selection process

00:22:18.972 --> 00:22:22.042
that caused Uryu's frail
mother, Kanae Katagiri,

00:22:22.075 --> 00:22:24.244
to fall ill and die,

00:22:24.278 --> 00:22:27.915
and it's what caused your
mother to lose her powers

00:22:27.948 --> 00:22:30.217
and her life in battle.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.253
[Ichigo] What? How is
Yhwach able to do that?

00:22:33.954 --> 00:22:36.056
Is it 'cause he's their king?

00:22:36.089 --> 00:22:37.658
Who is he anyway?

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.797
[Isshin] Yhwach is the
Father of the Quincies.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.567
The Quincies all sprang from him

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.038
and every Quincy has Yhwach's
blood running in their veins.

00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:53.373
-(Ichigo gasps)
-The memories lying dormant

00:22:53.407 --> 00:22:57.578
within your spiritual pressure
have awakened too soon.

00:22:57.611 --> 00:23:00.581
It was never meant to
hold Quincies like us.

00:23:00.581 --> 00:23:03.750
You don't know the first thing
about yourself, do you, boy?

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:08.055
Not even about your own mother.

00:23:08.989 --> 00:23:12.426
Ichigo Kurosaki, I will
come back for you.

00:23:13.594 --> 00:23:17.664
My son born in the dark.

00:23:20.968 --> 00:23:22.236
I get it now.

00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:25.405
Thank you, Dad.

00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:31.478
[Isshin] Anytime, son.

00:23:34.081 --> 00:23:37.584
(birds chirping)

00:23:37.618 --> 00:23:40.087
Huh? Oh, Ichigo.

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:44.791
Here. You forgot this.

00:23:44.825 --> 00:23:46.460
I figured you'd want it back.

00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:53.600
(Ichigo grunts)

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.469
Thanks a lot, Miss Ikumi.

00:23:57.437 --> 00:23:58.438
You too, Dad.

00:24:01.942 --> 00:24:04.211
But right now, I've gotta go.

00:24:09.116 --> 00:24:12.786
[Zangetsu] I believe the
world is full of danger.

00:24:12.819 --> 00:24:14.655
I want to protect you from it

00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:21.161
only because inside me is the
same impulse as that danger.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:28.602
-("Saihate" by SennaRin)
