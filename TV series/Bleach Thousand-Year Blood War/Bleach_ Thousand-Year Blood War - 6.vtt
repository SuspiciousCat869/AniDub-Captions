(birds chirping)

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:18.485
Huh?

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:24.591
(gasp)

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:27.494
[Uryu] It was 1,000 years ago?

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:28.996
I thought it was 200.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.666
Wait, what's this?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.569
(fire roaring)

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:48.649
("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:07.968

-("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

(fire roaring)

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:35.756
Huh?

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:46.500
It has been 1,000 years,
has it not, Yhwach?

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:50.737
And now I have come
to put an end to you.

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:54.942
(dramatic music)

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:56.310
Ah, good one.

00:02:57.578 --> 00:03:01.281
Your leader's presence
has revived your spirit.

00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:05.185
Quite inspiring, but I'm
afraid you Soul Reapers

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.721
have misjudged one thing.

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:10.591
It is not only your leader
who has joined the fight,

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:12.226
but ours as well,

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.896
and we are just as
inspired by his presence.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.632
That's why you're
gonna lose this battle!

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.868
[Bazz-B] Time to die, old man!

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.637
(fire exploding)

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:25.873
(gasp)

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:30.143
You're right, one
of us misjudged.

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:33.280
You can throw an army of
"inspired" Stern Ritters at him

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:36.083
they're no match for
Old Man Yama's powers.

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:40.587
(dramatic music)

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:45.325
What fools.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.195
They brought that
fate on themselves

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:51.565
for having the temerity
to interfere in my battle.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:52.599
(neck cracks)

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:55.536
What is it?

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.005
You look like
you want to say something?

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.242
Your Majesty!

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.045
(steam hisses)

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.649
You have not changed
at all, Yhwach.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.651
You have always shown contempt

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:12.619
for your own subordinates.

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.655
But that ends here and now.

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:21.061
You've grown old indeed,
Shigekuni Yamamoto.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:25.132
And yet, seeing that outburst
of uncontrolled rage,

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:27.768
I'm reminded of
your younger days.

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:29.369
Nonsense!

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:32.072
(intense music)

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.109
(tiles crack)

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.645
(Yamamoto yells)

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:44.017
(explosion booms)

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.120
(gasp)

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:01.969
(fire explodes)

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:08.275
You have finally drawn it, good.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.711
[Yhwach] You talk as if
you've been waiting for me

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:12.212
to draw my sword.

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:14.581
And do you know why that is?

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.785
Because I intend to
crush your flesh,

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:24.024
blood, soul, and sword until
there is nothing left of them.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.628
(gasp)

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:28.629
(gasp)

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:33.667
(deep rumble)

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:37.404
(gasping)

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.541
[Jushiro] This dryness
in my throat...

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:41.575
Huh?

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.410
Oh.

00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:47.414
My lips are cracking, uh oh.

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:50.250
Captain Unohana?

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:53.453
Does your skin feel dry all
of a sudden like mine does?

00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:54.955
It's so cute, Isane,

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:56.223
with everything that's going on

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:58.292
you can be worried
about your complexion.

00:05:58.325 --> 00:05:59.259
(gasp)

00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:01.295
[Isane] Oh, I didn't
mean it like that.

00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:03.730
[Unohana] You don't have
much time, Head Captain.

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:05.132
Please be quick about it,

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:07.301
or you could end up
destroying the very world

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:08.535
you're trying to protect.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.370
(glass cracks)

00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:12.573
(steam hissing)

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:16.109
So much for using my Hyorinmaru.

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.111
You've noticed, right?

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:20.914
How all of a sudden
every drop of water

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:24.051
in the Soul Society
seems to be evaporating?

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:25.886
[Jushiro] This can only mean-

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.321
[Shunsui] He's using it.

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:33.126
[Shigekuni] Bankai,
Zanka no Tachi!

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:37.030
[Jugram] Bankai?

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:40.033
That sad, scorched old
sword is his Bankai?

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:43.036
[Yhwach] Don't be fooled
by its appearance,

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.273
Zanka no Tachi is a Bankai
that seals the power

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:50.277
of all his flames within
that single blade.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.813
It is a sword of hellfire,

00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:55.883
one blow from it
and it's all over.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:59.386
That's right, you should
know this Bankai well.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.956
It is the one you
saw 1,000 years ago.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.058
Then again, is it?

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:07.961
After all, it has
been quite a while

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:10.163
since the last time we fought.

00:07:10.197 --> 00:07:13.367
Judge for yourself whether
it is still the same.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.435
(dramatic music)

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:16.436
(gasp)

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.272
(sword swish)

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:21.875
[Yhwach] He cut me, but
there are no flames.

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:26.914
Is his Bankai really different
than it was 1,000 years ago?

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:30.584
Flames are still his
Bankai's power, clearly.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.052
But where are they?

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:34.755
Where are those accursed flames?

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:40.027
(spark)

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.196
(explosion)

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:44.331
The tip of his blade!

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:45.332
Correct!

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.668
(dramatic music)

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:48.702
(explosion)

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:58.545
Zanka no Tachi
East, Kyokujitsujin!

00:07:58.579 --> 00:07:59.746
By using this technique,

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.416
I have focused all the heat
and powers of my flames

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:05.085
into the very
the tip of my sword.

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:07.988
It does not burn or
admit an explosive flame,

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.791
instead, everything it
touches is simply blown away

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.259
without a trace.

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:13.527
Like this!

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.561
(chuckle)

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.464
(explosion)

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.867
Then I'll have to
avoid it, won't I?

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.969
Until the moment I cut you down.

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:24.705
(gasp)

00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:30.544
But how?

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.014
What happened 1,000 years ago

00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:35.983
is that every one of you died.

00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:40.120
(fire roaring)

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:46.059
Now I am finally going
to force you to realize

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:48.462
that you and all of
your subordinates

00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:50.697
are nothing more than
a pile of corpses

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:54.568
just waiting for my flames
to light their funeral pyre!

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:57.237
(flames rumbling)

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:01.775
The flames!

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:06.113
There, I have told you about
my Zanka no Tachi East.

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:10.017
But where there's an East,
there is also a West.

00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:16.323
Zanka no Tachi West,
Zanjitsu Gokui!

00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:24.431
It burns at a temperature of
15,000,000 degrees Celsius.

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:28.035
You can no longer touch me
or even get close to me.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:32.906
When I use my Bankai think
of my body and my blade

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.143
as having been
enveloped by the sun!

00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:40.080
[Jugram] Flames that are
15,000,000 degrees Celsius.

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:42.983
How can such an immense
heat even be visible to us?

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:46.153
Is this an illusion

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:50.657
or could it be that
your Spiritual Pressure

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:52.793
is so overwhelmingly powerful

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:56.129
that it takes on the appearance
of flames when it bursts

00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:59.266
out of you, Shigekuni Yamamoto?

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.102
(breaths out)

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:06.940
Now then, I must bring
this to a close, Yhwach.

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:09.543
You see, if I do
not end this soon,

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:11.011
it will not be just you.

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:14.114
I and the rest of
the Soul Society

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:15.949
will burn to ashes as well.

00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:19.386
(fire roars)

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:23.357
[Uryu] "1,000 years ago, seeking
to annihilate all Hollows,

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.626
"the Quincy empire
known as the Licht Reich

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:28.161
"invaded the Soul
Society who opposed them,

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:32.232
"but were wiped out by
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:36.270
"Then 200 years ago, the Soul
Reapers unilaterally decided

00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:38.872
"to exterminate the
surviving Quincies,

00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:40.207
"believing that
they would disrupt

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.609
"the circulation of souls."

00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:45.846
So that explains why
Quincies and Soul Reapers

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:48.081
will never coexist peacefully.

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:51.285
[Ichigo] I'm a Soul Reaper,

00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:54.688
even without the Soul
Society helping me.

00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:57.891
[Uryu] That's incorrect, you're
a substitute Soul Reaper.

00:10:57.925 --> 00:10:59.693
And furthermore, you
have been abandoned

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:01.395
by the Soul Society.

00:11:04.198 --> 00:11:08.435
I'm a Quincy, I can't be helping
out Hollows or Arrancars.

00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:10.137
I know.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.774
After all, Quincies exist to
destroy Hollows, don't they?

00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:15.008
[Uryu] Ichigo.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.011
(chuckle)

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:25.052
[Yhwach] It feels like
I'm burning alive.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:28.655
My eyes, my hair, my throat.

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:30.057
If it weren't for my Blut,

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.226
I'd be ashes by now.

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:36.463
Well, are you just going
to watch yourself burn?

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:40.067
Forgive me, that question
was spiteful and unfair.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.035
You stand there
with a broken sword

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:43.871
scarcely able to move.

00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:46.607
There is not much
you can do, is there?

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.109
You could try running away.

00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:52.212
But that would only delay
your inevitable death!

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.081
(grunts)

00:11:57.451 --> 00:11:59.386
(explosion)

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:01.421
Ah yes, of course,

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:05.058
your sword may be broken,

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:10.998
but you still have your arrows
to fight with, don't you?

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:17.271
Very well then.

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.407
Shall we dance?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.409
(dramatic music)

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:23.644
[Yhwach] Kirchenlied

00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:30.450
Sankt Zwinger!

00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:33.687
This is a Quincy's ultimate
defensive incantation,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.156
combining offense with defense.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.960
Step through it and you will
be torn apart by God's light.

00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:41.595
That will not save you!

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:47.401
I call on the dead,
I summon the ashes

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.570
of those who've
perished by my flames!

00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:54.708
Come to my aid, and
for one brief moment

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:56.977
feel again the joy of battle.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.116
Zanka no Tachi South.

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:14.161
Kakajumanokushidaisojin!

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:24.004
What is this?

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:28.308
What in the name of
Heaven or Hell is this?

00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:34.448
Kakajumanokushidaisojin.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.117
It allows me to revive
those I have slain

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.619
by reanimating their ashes

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:41.288
with the very blade
that struck them down.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.224
Reawakened, they are now
an army that serves me.

00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:48.962
One that will not stop until
they turn my enemies to dust!

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:50.130
(laugh)

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.699
How pathetic that the
head of the Soul Reapers

00:13:52.733 --> 00:13:54.401
would be reviving the dead.

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:57.037
It betrays everything you're
supposed to stand for,

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.605
you old hypocrite!

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.040
And to what end?

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:03.744
Do you really think a trick
like that can stop me?

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:10.184
Your mouth works well, Yhwach,

00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:13.020
but you have forgotten
to use your eyes.

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.366
What?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.367
Seydlitz?

00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:33.540
Argola, Hubert?

00:14:33.574 --> 00:14:34.541
[Shigekuni] What is wrong?

00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:35.943
Are you surprised to see

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:38.045
so many of the
subordinates you killed?

00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:39.313
[Yhwach] Damn you!

00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:41.348
Or are you regretting

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:44.618
that you did not steal my
Bankai when you had the chance?

00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:46.520
No, that's not it.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:50.757
Because you knew that you
could never steal my Bankai.

00:14:50.791 --> 00:14:53.227
And now I think I
know why that is.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.962
To steal anothers Bankai,

00:14:54.995 --> 00:14:57.364
you Quincies must
first understand it

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.433
and fully comprehend its power,

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:00.834
is that not correct?

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:03.704
But you have never
witnessed my true power,

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.372
not even 1,000 years ago.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:08.942
You can not steal what is
beyond your understanding.

00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:10.911
[Yhwach] Wait,
where are you going?

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:12.513
[Shigekuni] Not
far, do not worry.

00:15:12.546 --> 00:15:15.115
If you want to kill
me, I shall be waiting.

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:17.951
Of course, you will have to
deal with all of them first.

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:19.653
[Yhwach] You worthless coward.

00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:29.563
(Yhwach yells)

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.298
So even one as lost as you

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:34.234
still has a shred of
humanity left in him.

00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:38.405
(dramatic music)

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:42.776
You have the nerve to
talk as if you know me.

00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:46.713
I told you before, you're wrong
if you think you can stop me

00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:48.081
with tricks like these!

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:58.425
I can see your tears and
anger of frustration, Yhwach.

00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:00.227
(bones cracking)

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:04.631
Painful, is it not, to have
to walk over the bodies

00:16:04.665 --> 00:16:07.634
of your loyal subordinates
in order to reach me?

00:16:08.902 --> 00:16:11.438
How you must hate
me for resorting

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.474
to such a despicable ploy
as to bring them back

00:16:14.508 --> 00:16:15.309
from the dead.

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.214
And yet, nothing that
you are fearing now

00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:22.616
can compare to the
hatred and suffering

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:27.120
of all those Soul Reapers
that you have slaughtered!

00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:32.059
Zanka no Tachi North!

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:34.661
Tenchi Kaijin!

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.434
-(dramatic music)
-(bones rattling)

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:42.436
(explosion)

00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:10.664
(rain falling)

00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:36.156
(rain falling)

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.725
I thought I was strong enough,

00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:43.163
but it seems I failed.

00:17:43.197 --> 00:17:46.033
I hope you can forgive me.

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:49.102
[Yamamoto] What?

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:51.638
Whose forgiveness does he seek?

00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:53.507
He is the Quincies' king.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.578
He started this
war and he lost it,

00:17:57.611 --> 00:18:00.047
so who is he apologizing to?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.618
Please forgive me for not
carrying out your orders.

00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.820
Who are you talking to?

00:18:06.854 --> 00:18:08.188
Your Majesty.

00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:10.657
(explosion)

00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:12.259
The Squad One Barracks!

00:18:16.363 --> 00:18:17.564
Okikiba!

00:18:22.803 --> 00:18:25.639
Curse you, Yhwach.

00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:28.809
Can you hear me, Stern Ritter Y?

00:18:28.842 --> 00:18:33.280
The Yourself, the
R of Royd Loyd?

00:18:33.313 --> 00:18:37.317
You saw to it that my
absence was not noticed.

00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:38.585
You did well.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.691
You said that if I did well

00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:47.694
you'd do me a great honor, Your-

00:18:52.366 --> 00:18:55.802
[Shigekuni] You villain,
where have you been hiding

00:18:55.836 --> 00:18:57.070
all this time?

00:18:58.739 --> 00:19:02.209
[Yhwach] What lies beneath
the Squad One Barracks?

00:19:02.242 --> 00:19:03.477
(gasp)

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.180
The Central Underground
Great Prison!

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:10.250
I went to see Sosuke Aizen.

00:19:13.854 --> 00:19:15.756
Sosuke Aizen.

00:19:23.096 --> 00:19:24.331
Hello, Yhwach.

00:19:25.766 --> 00:19:28.168
Oh, your name is
well known to me.

00:19:28.202 --> 00:19:30.604
Though I never imagined
I would get to see you

00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:32.206
with my own eyes.

00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:34.374
I won't ask why you're here.

00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:36.710
The battle of Spiritual
Pressures raging

00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:39.379
on the surface
above explains that.

00:19:39.413 --> 00:19:42.115
Well then, I'll get
right to the point.

00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:45.886
I want you, Special
Threat Sosuke Aizen

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:49.022
to serve me in my cause.

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:52.159
Am I to understand
that you would welcome

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.828
a Soul Reaper into
the Wandenreich?

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:56.496
We both share a common goal,

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.166
the destruction of
the Soul Society.

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.668
We can pursue that
goal together.

00:20:02.503 --> 00:20:04.004
A common goal.

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:07.040
I refuse.

00:20:07.674 --> 00:20:09.209
[Yhwach] Why?

00:20:09.243 --> 00:20:11.845
[Sosuke] I serve
in no one's cause

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:14.982
and pursue no one's
goals but my own.

00:20:15.015 --> 00:20:17.084
That is your final answer?

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.189
We are done talking then.

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:24.892
[Sosuke] Really?

00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:26.994
You're going to
leave it at that?

00:20:27.027 --> 00:20:29.496
Didn't you come here
because you see my power

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.465
as a threat to you?

00:20:31.498 --> 00:20:32.866
I do.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.801
But since you're fused
with the Hogyoku,

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:36.336
I know it would
take too much time

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.206
to kill you or neutralize you.

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.475
Time that I don't have.

00:20:41.508 --> 00:20:43.777
A wise decision.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.315
We best not waste time
pursing the same goal either.

00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:51.485
One of us won't reach the end
of that journey anyway.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.664
Now then, Shigekuni Yamamoto,

00:21:03.697 --> 00:21:07.000
am I wrong or have you just
about exhausted your powers

00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:08.869
battling my imposter?

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:10.637
You are wrong!

00:21:10.671 --> 00:21:11.872
Bankai!

00:21:11.905 --> 00:21:14.675
(dramatic music)

00:21:18.178 --> 00:21:22.049
It's not that your Bankai
couldn't be stolen, you fool.

00:21:22.082 --> 00:21:23.150
Not at all.

00:21:23.183 --> 00:21:24.985
It's just that your
power is so great

00:21:25.018 --> 00:21:27.821
that only someone as
strong as I can handle it.

00:21:27.855 --> 00:21:30.224
That's why Royd's
orders were to keep you

00:21:30.257 --> 00:21:33.827
and your Bankai occupied
until I was able to return.

00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:35.829
So what will you do now

00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:38.165
knowing that, like you,
I can use the power

00:21:38.198 --> 00:21:40.501
of this Bankai to
awaken the corpses

00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:45.305
of your subordinates,
Genryusai Yamamoto?

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:46.139
You dare?

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.809
(dramatic music)

00:21:48.842 --> 00:21:51.578
(energy gleaming)

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:16.303
Now farewell,
Shigekuni Yamamoto.

00:22:21.575 --> 00:22:22.576
