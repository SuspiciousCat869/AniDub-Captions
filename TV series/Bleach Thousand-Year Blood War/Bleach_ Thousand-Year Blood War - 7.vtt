00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.014
(flames crackling)

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:18.652
(explosion booms)

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.121
(intense exciting music)

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:25.192
(singing in Japanese)

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:46.046
(exciting dramatic music)

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:05.999
(singing in Japanese)

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:46.507
(exciting heavy metal music)

00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:19.339
("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:38.992
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:49.029
-("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.444
-(door opening)
-I told you what would happen

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:05.779
if you ever came into
my chambers again

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.181
-without permission, Shunsui!
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:10.717
-My bad, my bad, my bad!
-My bad?

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.853
What kind of an apology is that?

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:13.954
-You incorrigible little-
-(blows landing)

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:15.155
I know I shouldn't
have, Old Man Yama!

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.657
But I couldn't help myself!

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.791
It's that painting!

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:20.027
I keep wondering what it is!

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.828
(Shunsui coughing)

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:22.829
You grumpy old coot.

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:24.998
It is a painting of a monster

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:28.202
that showed up in the Soul
Society a long time ago.

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:29.269
Huh?

00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:31.171
We were already facing a threat

00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:33.473
to our very existence.

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:36.343
And that monster only
made things worse.

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.513
Have no fear.

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:42.683
I do not think it will
ever appear again.

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:46.019
But if I am wrong,
and it does...

00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:48.655
(rain falling)

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:10.844
Then you will likely never see
this grumpy old coot again.

00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:11.945
(body falling)

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.649
-(gasps)
-(rain falling)

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.017
Old man!

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:19.720
-(gunshots firing)
-(grunting)

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:20.687
(gunshots fire)

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.528
(rain falling)

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.698
(blood splattering)

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.405
(thunder rumbling)

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.976
The head captain of
the Soul Reapers.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.180
And now there you lie
in a pitiful heap.

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:48.682
Shigekuni Yamamoto.

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:50.817
(gentle music)

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.687
Let us go, Haschwalth.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.721
[Haschwalth] Sir.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.724
Hmm?

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:03.497
(blades slicing)

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.501
Even in death, you
would try and stop me?

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.502
(blow landing)

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:09.536
How pathetic.

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:13.340
You soft-hearted old fool.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.976
It's for precisely this
reason that I stopped

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.713
considering you one of
the five Special Threats.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:22.482
Shigekuni Yamamoto.

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:27.588
Tell me, why didn't you
restore your left arm?

00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:30.824
You could have ordered
that human girl to do it,

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:33.527
and yet you chose not to.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.462
And I know why.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:38.966
You didn't want to
exploit the humans.

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.134
It's been true all along.

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:43.270
Even in your battle
against Aizen,

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:46.940
you hesitated to
involve Ichigo Kurosaki,

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:49.343
because he's a human.

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:53.347
Even now, against me, you
tried to carry the burden

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.850
of the Soul Society, and
the world of the living

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:58.986
on your shoulders alone.

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.288
But you failed.

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:05.659
You grew soft,
Shigekuni Yamamoto,

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:08.295
but you weren't always that way.

00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:11.532
The members of the original
Thirteen Court Guard Squads

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:14.501
you founded were Court
Guards in name only.

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:17.638
They were lawless
savages, killers,

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:21.508
but that just made them all
the more fearsome as opponents.

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.977
And you their leader,
you were no better

00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:25.946
than a beast with a sword.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.116
You would sacrifice anything
to crush your enemy.

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:32.319
The lives of your subordinates
meant no more to you

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:35.189
than ashes beneath your feet.

00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:40.494
But that all changed, once
you exterminated us Quincies.

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:43.530
Having gained a peaceful
world, you now found

00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:46.967
that there were people you
wanted to protect and love.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.704
You developed a sense
of justice and mercy,

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:53.073
and that made you weak.

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:56.944
I wouldn't want you to
die without knowing this,

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:58.712
so I'm going to tell you.

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:04.117
Though the Soul Society
will perish today,

00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:07.821
the Thirteen Court
Guard Squad you founded

00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:11.024
died along with us a
thousand years ago.

00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:14.394
(explosion rumbling)

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:24.571
(rain falling)

00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:27.708
Notify every member
of the Stern Ritter.

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:32.379
It's time for us to finish
what we came here to do.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.782
Tell them to show no mercy.

00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:39.386
Crush the Soul Society.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.189
(hands slamming)

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.360
(air whooshing)

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:49.062
(intense music)

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:50.964
(gasps)

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:52.199
What is that?

00:08:58.739 --> 00:08:59.740
Soldat.

00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:02.509
Advance.

00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:04.678
They're just a bunch
of Quincy grunts.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.679
Hold fast.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.848
We can take these guys!

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.550
-(blade squelching)
-(man grunts)

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:10.584
(man yelping)

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.188
(blades clashing)

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:19.426
-(man grunts)
-(all shouting)

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.195
(blade slices)

00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:22.796
(explosion booming)

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:24.031
(arrows piercing)

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.702
(tense dramatic music)

00:09:33.707 --> 00:09:34.675
(man grunting)

00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:36.543
They're too strong.

00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:38.812
Need to find some help!

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:40.347
(grunting)

00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:44.718
-(flames crackling)
-(somber music)

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:55.329
-(thunder rumbling)
-(rain pouring)

00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:56.363
It's over.

00:09:58.732 --> 00:10:01.635
(Ichigo trembling)

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:09.676
Please no!

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:12.379
Hold on!

00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:16.183
You can't!

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.521
Don't die!

00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:24.558
(glass shattering)

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:25.792
Ah, there we go.

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:26.960
Finally.

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:28.295
Sorry about that.

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:30.464
We would have busted you
out of that thing sooner

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:33.867
but we ran into a few minor
complications on the way.

00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:36.970
Better late than
never though, right?

00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:38.672
(grunting)

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.674
[Shaz] Who the hell are you?

00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:42.009
(chuckles) Doesn't matter.

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:44.111
Well I'm Shaz Domino
of the Stern Ritter.

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.013
And by the power given to me by-

00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:49.383
(explosion booming)

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:51.318
(gasps)

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:54.188
(deep rumbling)

00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:55.689
Come on, don't give up!

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:56.723
(gasps)

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:08.735
(wind rustling)

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:12.005
Hmm?

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:13.841
That Spiritual Pressure!

00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:15.509
What the hell was that?

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:18.412
(rain falling)

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:26.353
(soft mysterious music)

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:31.525
What of Rukia and Renji?

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:35.829
Are they both still alive?

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:37.130
[Ichigo] Yeah.

00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:38.599
Don't worry about them.

00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:41.034
They're alive.

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.003
I see.

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:45.539
Thank heaven for that.

00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:50.010
I guess it's obvious.

00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:53.080
My time is almost done.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:57.818
I failed in my duty as a captain

00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:00.454
of the Thirteen
Court Guard Squads.

00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:02.689
I failed to prevent
these monsters

00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:04.958
from invading the Seireitei.

00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:06.126
(all shouting)

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:09.096
I led so many of my
squad to their deaths.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.199
I brought sorrow
to their comrades

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:15.969
and to their families,
and for what?

00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:20.174
Their sacrifice ended
in defeat and disgrace.

00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:22.543
I will die with that shame.

00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:27.781
But what is all this to you?

00:12:27.814 --> 00:12:29.283
You are a human.

00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:31.151
This fight isn't your fight.

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:34.121
You have no reason to
risk your life for us.

00:12:34.154 --> 00:12:38.725
In fact, you shouldn't even
be here in the first place.

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.627
You must forgive me.

00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:44.831
I realize I have no right
to place this burden on you.

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.734
And yet, I must ask
this one last favor.

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:52.239
Please.

00:12:53.373 --> 00:12:58.345
Will you protect the Soul
Society, Ichigo Kurosaki?

00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:03.517
(steam hissing)

00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:08.722
(loud rumbling)

00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:23.537
You feel that, sir?

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.638
[Yhwach] Yes.

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:27.007
It must be Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.009
Shall I go and purge him?

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:30.711
Not now.

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:32.012
Let us be off.

00:13:33.547 --> 00:13:35.682
(blade crashing)

00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:38.685
(rocks rumbling)

00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:45.192
So it is you.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.729
(rain falling)

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:05.012
(rain falling)

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.752
[Byakuya] He left without
giving me an answer.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.888
But that's all right.

00:14:14.922 --> 00:14:17.524
That's just the
kind of man he is.

00:14:18.592 --> 00:14:22.129
I know what his answer
is without him saying it.

00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:31.438
I leave it in your
hands, Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:38.145
(blade shattering)

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:43.517
(rain falling)

00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:50.757
[Haschwalth] I'll handle
this, Your Majesty.

00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:56.964
Ichigo Kurosaki, however you
managed to free yourself,

00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:59.433
it'd be a lie to
say I'm unimpressed.

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:01.568
But do you really
intend to fight me

00:15:01.602 --> 00:15:05.105
in that weakened and
ragged condition?

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:07.608
You're the leader of
the enemy, aren't you?

00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:10.911
Enemy. (scoffs)

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:12.880
You could say that.

00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:15.182
But you could also say I'm not.

00:15:15.816 --> 00:15:17.618
What the hell's that mean?

00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:18.652
Answer me!

00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:20.587
Are you the bastard
responsible for destroying

00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:22.356
the Soul Society or not?

00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:24.591
I am indeed.

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.927
(explosion booming)

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.961
(tense dramatic music)

00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:28.962
[Haschwalth] Your Majesty-

00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:30.497
As you can see, Haschwalth,

00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:32.299
he leaves us no choice.

00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:34.635
For us to ever get out of here,

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:36.703
he must first die.

00:15:36.737 --> 00:15:40.007
(explosions booming)

00:15:42.743 --> 00:15:47.147
(singing in Japanese)

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:52.119
(blades clashing)

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.662
(Ichigo screaming)

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.499
(explosion booming)

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:08.168
(body crashing)

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:20.414
[Ichigo] Getsuga.

00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:21.415
(gasp)

00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:22.516
Tensho!

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:26.286
(explosion booming)

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:29.523
-(body slams)
-(Ichigo grunts)

00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:32.626
(dramatic music)

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.596
(Haschwalth gasps)

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:44.972
(Ichigo gasping)

00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:49.176
(blade clinks)

00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:53.780
He's immobilized, but alive.

00:16:53.814 --> 00:16:55.182
Bring him to the castle.

00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:59.119
Once he's revived, I will
put him to use in my service.

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:00.587
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:04.958
(tense dramatic music)

00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:06.493
(Yhwach gasps)

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:08.929
(lights whirring)

00:17:08.962 --> 00:17:10.430
[Yhwach] Is that?

00:17:10.464 --> 00:17:12.499
No, impossible.

00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:14.935
Blut Vene?

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:16.637
(explosion booming)

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.638
(intense dramatic music)

00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:18.739
(rocks shattering)

00:17:18.772 --> 00:17:20.007
Your Majesty!

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:24.311
(lights whirring)

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.049
I should have known better.

00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:30.050
(blade slicing)

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:31.118
You're right, you should've.

00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:32.753
Just 'cause you
dodged a few attacks

00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:35.122
doesn't mean the fight's over.

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:37.658
Well it's over now.

00:17:37.691 --> 00:17:38.892
(whooshing)

00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:41.461
-(blades clinking)
-(Ichigo yelps)

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:44.298
(blades slicing)

00:17:45.632 --> 00:17:46.667
[Yhwach] So it's true.

00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:49.670
I wasn't imagining it.

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:52.372
What are you talking about?

00:17:52.406 --> 00:17:55.075
It seems I might have
made an error in judgment

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:58.378
when I ordered Quilge
Opie to imprison you.

00:17:58.412 --> 00:18:01.281
I should have used an
Arrancar to keep you at bay

00:18:01.315 --> 00:18:03.684
instead of a true born Quincy.

00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:07.120
Because of that mistake,
the memories lying dormant

00:18:07.154 --> 00:18:11.225
within your Spiritual Pressure
have awakened too soon.

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:14.127
I assume you must have
exerted vast amounts

00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:16.897
of Spiritual Pressure in
your efforts to break free

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.399
from Quilge's jail.

00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:22.769
The shards of Spiritual Pressure
dispersed by your efforts

00:18:22.803 --> 00:18:24.671
must have mixed with
some of Quilge's

00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:29.109
own Spiritual Pressure as
they return to your body.

00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:32.112
His Quincy Spiritual
Pressure slowly seeped

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:34.414
into the depths of your soul,

00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:36.617
drawing forth
memories from the core

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.886
of your Spiritual Pressure,

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:41.655
and awakening your
dormant powers.

00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:45.492
Quilge's jail was
designed to restrain

00:18:45.526 --> 00:18:47.461
the enemies of Quincies.

00:18:47.494 --> 00:18:51.465
It was never meant to hold
actual Quincies like us.

00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:53.734
What?

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:55.269
What are you saying?

00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:58.739
What's all this about
memories, and Quincies?

00:18:58.772 --> 00:19:00.240
I'm not following.

00:19:00.274 --> 00:19:01.408
I see.

00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:03.710
You really don't know the
first thing about yourself,

00:19:03.744 --> 00:19:05.112
do you boy?

00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:10.617
Not even about your own mother.

00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:12.419
(Ichigo gasping)

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:15.289
My original plan was to
take you back with me

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:17.658
and gradually reeducate you.

00:19:17.691 --> 00:19:18.759
Hold on.

00:19:18.792 --> 00:19:20.727
[Yhwach] But I can see by
the way things are going

00:19:20.761 --> 00:19:23.096
that I no longer
have that luxury.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.097
What are you saying?

00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:25.933
I see I shall have to use

00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:28.869
more forceful means
of persuasion.

00:19:28.902 --> 00:19:30.204
(Ichigo gasping)

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:32.506
You just tell me what the
hell you're talking about!

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:35.776
I'll tell you back
at the Wandenreich.

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:38.412
(lights whirring)

00:19:38.445 --> 00:19:39.947
(Ichigo gasps)

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.648
(lighting crashing)

00:19:41.682 --> 00:19:42.683
Qualkreis!

00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:45.519
Now then.

00:19:45.552 --> 00:19:48.755
Let's see what you're
capable of, Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:52.092
(electricity cackling)

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:53.360
(Ichigo shouting)

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:56.663
Getsuga!

00:19:56.697 --> 00:19:58.332
Tensho!

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:00.634
(energy zapping)

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:04.304
(intense dramatic music)

00:20:06.073 --> 00:20:09.109
(Ichigo shouting)

00:20:10.677 --> 00:20:13.514
(rocks crumbling)

00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:20.120
(somber music)

00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:26.793
(blade whooshing)

00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:29.263
I'll run you through this time!

00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:32.633
Not even your Blut Vene
will be able to save you!

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:34.168
Not this time!

00:20:36.637 --> 00:20:39.873
(mist whooshing)

00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:41.108
No.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.445
It is time to go, Your Majesty.

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:46.747
We've reached the
limit of our time

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.882
outside the Schatten Bereich.

00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:50.117
We must go back.

00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:52.119
It's too soon.

00:20:52.152 --> 00:20:53.987
We should still have time.

00:20:56.623 --> 00:20:57.758
Of course.

00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:59.526
Sosuke Aizen.

00:21:00.627 --> 00:21:02.462
This is one of his tricks.

00:21:02.496 --> 00:21:05.465
I thought I only spent a
few minutes in that dungeon,

00:21:05.499 --> 00:21:08.435
but he must have played
with my sense of time.

00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:10.904
You knew this, didn't
you Haschwalth,

00:21:10.938 --> 00:21:12.940
but you kept quiet about it.

00:21:12.973 --> 00:21:15.876
Would my warning you
have made a difference?

00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:17.311
Hmm.

00:21:17.344 --> 00:21:18.912
Well, no matter.

00:21:18.946 --> 00:21:20.147
Let us go.

00:21:20.948 --> 00:21:24.218
(mist whooshing)

00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:27.621
(dark dramatic music)

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:30.657
Whoops my time's up.

00:21:30.691 --> 00:21:32.559
I have to be going now.

00:21:32.593 --> 00:21:35.462
You can't hear me, why
am I even talking to you?

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:42.102
(mist whooshing)

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:43.303
(explosion booms)

00:21:43.337 --> 00:21:44.338
Stop!

00:21:45.072 --> 00:21:47.274
You're not going anywhere!

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.676
After what you did
to the Soul Society!

00:21:50.577 --> 00:21:53.113
There's no way I'm
letting you leave here!

00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:57.651
I said stop, you bastard!

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:01.989
(blades slicing)

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.193
(sword lands)

00:22:14.301 --> 00:22:16.937
Farewell, Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.239
I will come back for you.

00:22:19.273 --> 00:22:23.110
Until then, heal
your wounds and wait.

00:22:24.645 --> 00:22:25.746
My son.

00:22:26.914 --> 00:22:29.316
Born in the dark.

(singing in Japanese)

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.190
[Kukaku] I look to the
heavens and chase that star,

00:24:17.257 --> 00:24:22.029
burned into my eyes, the
afterglow of its smoke.
