WEBVTT

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:18.838
I am Asguiaro Ebem.

00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:22.444
Getsuga tensho!

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:27.556
What is it that's keeping
his Bankai from disappearing?

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.693
[Nel] You've got
to help us, Ichigo,

00:00:29.726 --> 00:00:31.597
it's Hueco Mundo,

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.402
Hueco Mundo is-

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:36.206
Quiet, please.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.476
Now will you leave
or will you die?

00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:40.915
To determine that, we
will be selecting Hollows

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.021
and Arrancars by means
of a little competition.

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:45.525
You've got the
nerve to talk trash

00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:49.098
about Master Halibel, and yet
you have no idea who we are?

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.916
(dramatic music)

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.686
Are you guys what
I think you are?

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.026
As a matter of fact, we
are what you think we are.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.730
We're Quincies.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.005
[Uryu Ishida] The Soul
Society's under attack.

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:11.242
And Hueco Mundo's been invaded.

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:14.415
And from the looks
of it, it's Quincies.

00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:17.722
Now just so you understand
what you're witnessing

00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:20.193
the proper name
for this form is

00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:23.801
Quincy Voll Stem Dich.

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:26.039
So as Quincies
extinguish more Hollows,

00:01:26.072 --> 00:01:28.043
the number of souls is reduced,

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:30.213
disrupting the natural balance.

00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:31.717
If we don't stop them,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.823
the balance will eventually
be irreparably damaged,

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:36.760
causing the Soul Society to flow

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:38.731
into the World of the Living,

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:41.904
resulting in the ultimate
destruction of both.

00:01:41.937 --> 00:01:43.608
Oh, and let us not
forget the fact

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.377
that everything that
is happening now

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.381
is happening because
you, Head Captain,

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:50.053
couldn't kill that
man 1,000 years ago.

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:53.126
It was you who
brought this upon us.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.230
[Quilge] Sklave Rai,

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:58.537
I wanted to avoid
using it possible.

00:01:58.571 --> 00:02:01.275
I can't stand the
thought of my holy wings

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:05.450
being besmirched by such
grotesque impurities.

00:02:05.484 --> 00:02:08.189
(dramatic music)

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:14.870
A Bankai!

00:02:14.903 --> 00:02:17.308
I'm guessin that if I can
destroy that disk on your head,

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.515
you can't do so much
subordinating of Reishi, can ya?

00:02:20.548 --> 00:02:21.583
And so it was,

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:25.457
the Quincy Extermination
Operation was initiated.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.733
The Soul Reapers and Quincies
have no choice but to fight.

00:02:32.304 --> 00:02:35.043
[Yhwach] How I dislike conflict,

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:37.549
it is so disagreeable.

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:38.951
What the hell?

00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:42.191
Reishi, is that what that is?

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:46.065
Sorry about this, but
we're gonna have to kill

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.702
every one of you.

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:50.374
Tremble, Soul Reapers,

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:53.313
for the Stern Ritters have come.

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:57.254
We're going to purge
you from the world.

00:02:58.924 --> 00:03:03.934
("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:23.440
(singing in Japanese)

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:33.279
-("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:44.870
[R&amp;D Member] Sir, we've
confirmed the presence

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:47.976
of enemy Spiritual
Pressures in 16 locations

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.111
within the Seireitei.

00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:50.380
[R&amp;D Member Two]
They've gotten past

00:04:50.413 --> 00:04:52.017
the Soul Shield Membrane,
but we don't know how!

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.754
[R&amp;D Member Three] The Spiritual
Pressures of Soul Reapers

00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:55.791
have disappeared across
an even wider area

00:04:55.825 --> 00:04:57.762
and it appears they
all died in combat.

00:04:57.795 --> 00:04:59.465
[R&amp;D Member Two] The Spiritual
Pressure of Squad Three's

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:00.902
Lieutenant Kira has vanished,

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:03.273
along with those other
three seated officers.

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:05.076
25 squad members have perished

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.379
in the West 601 District.

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:09.318
And 61 more in the
West 224 District!

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:13.426
[Akon] Over 1,000 dead
in the seven minutes

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:15.230
since the invasion started?

00:05:15.263 --> 00:05:16.633
This is madness.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:18.804
There's no way we
can beat this enemy.

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:23.948
(dramatic music)

00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:32.799
Stay back or you die.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.738
If I frighten you,
feel free to run.

00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:38.243
You're not really
worth my time anyway.

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:41.115
You mock the 13
Court Guard Squads?

00:05:41.148 --> 00:05:42.652
Don't come any
closer, I warn you.

00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:44.656
Have you noticed
that you keep trying

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.127
to dissuade me from my purpose,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.265
rather than engage me in battle?

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:51.937
That smells a lot
like fear to me.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.811
Unfortunately for you,
the war has already begun.

00:05:55.845 --> 00:05:58.751
(Hidetomo yelling)

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:12.512
(ringing)

00:06:18.223 --> 00:06:20.093
I see, understood.

00:06:22.497 --> 00:06:25.036
It wasn't good news, I take it.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.940
You lose a loved one?

00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:29.779
There any reason I
should answer that?

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:33.186
You betcha.

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:34.856
See, I'm thinking
it must've happened

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.526
in Bazz-B's location.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.496
'Cause if there's anyone
still alive there,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.400
he's lost his touch.

00:06:41.603 --> 00:06:45.176
Questioning the abilities
of your own comrades?

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.314
There's no art in that.

00:06:47.347 --> 00:06:50.320
Izuru Kira has not only
been a loyal lieutenant,

00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:52.725
he's been a source of
great inspiration to me.

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.963
Just having him around
when I pick up a guitar

00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:58.671
causes the melodies to flow
out of me like a river.

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:01.543
It will be devastating
for both me and my guitar

00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:03.379
if Izuru is truly gone.

00:07:03.413 --> 00:07:05.383
Sorry, man, I don't
know much of anything

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:07.087
about art or music.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.657
But I wouldn't worry about it.

00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:10.160
I promise that you
and your guitar

00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:13.199
won't even have a chance to
weep for your fallen comrade,

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.268
'cause you're gonna
be dead yourself

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.038
in about five minutes.

00:07:16.072 --> 00:07:19.378
You're right, you don't
know anything about art.

00:07:19.411 --> 00:07:22.484
Do you think I could see
so many of my men dead

00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:24.254
and not grieve?

00:07:24.288 --> 00:07:27.929
My guitar and I are
gently weeping already.

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:32.437
We'll shed no tears
over your death, Quincy!

00:07:34.576 --> 00:07:37.548
(Squad Members screaming)

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.753
[Soul Reaper One] What
kind of monster is that?

00:07:39.786 --> 00:07:41.823
[Soul Reaper Two] It's like
something out of a nightmare.

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:46.232
None of our attacks
work against it.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:49.204
But what I really
don't get is...

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:52.077
(Soul Reaper screaming)

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.818
Why are they still screaming
like that when they're dead?

00:07:57.822 --> 00:08:00.561
-Run!
-Let's get out of here.

00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:01.963
Stand your ground!

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:04.969
Since when is it the mission
of the 13 Court Guard Squads

00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:06.205
to save our own skins?

00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:10.146
We swore we'd lay down our
lives to protect the Seireitei!

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.654
(dramatic music)

00:08:13.687 --> 00:08:15.858
Stand your ground!

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:21.536
[Renji] Bravo, well said.

00:08:22.337 --> 00:08:24.041
Lieutenant Abarai!

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:27.180
Stand aside, trooper,
I'll take it from here.

00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:33.660
(Bambietta yelling)

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:38.036
(intense music)

00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:42.444
Don't tell me they have
little girls like you

00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:43.981
fighting for them.

00:08:44.014 --> 00:08:46.953
Don't tell me they made a
doggy like you a captain.

00:08:46.987 --> 00:08:49.158
Wow, they must be
seriously understaffed.

00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:51.763
I mean, that's just sad.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.052
(Renji yelling)

00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:06.225
[Renji] What's with this guy?

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:11.368
Every time he parries an attack,

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:13.339
some sort of weird mark appears.

00:09:13.372 --> 00:09:16.178
I'll just have to
attack quicker then.

00:09:16.212 --> 00:09:19.886
(Mask De Masculine yelling)

00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:27.167
There's no reason to hold
anything back, Renji.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.006
Keep in mind that these
enemies are determined

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:33.212
to exterminate the
entire Soul Society.

00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:35.250
They'll show us no mercy.

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:39.324
Show them none as well.

00:09:39.358 --> 00:09:42.264
(computer beeping)

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.913
So they are not sealing
away our Bankai.

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:52.284
Captain?

00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:55.089
Don't try it.

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:59.599
No use, our weapons
can't even touch them.

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.603
Can't touch them, you say?

00:10:01.636 --> 00:10:03.574
Oh, I beg to differ.

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:10.019
You let them catch
you off guard.

00:10:10.053 --> 00:10:12.992
[Byakuya] You might want to
be more careful yourself.

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:19.171
[Mask De Masculine]
What the hell?

00:10:23.479 --> 00:10:25.684
Scatter, Senbonzakura.

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:43.319
(dramatic music)

00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:54.374
You can't be serious.

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:08.035
(Sajin and Bambietta grunting)

00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:13.279
Captain!

00:11:18.524 --> 00:11:19.726
(Sajin growls)

00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:24.736
(ice shatters)

00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:29.011
(swords clanking)

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:31.650
Captain!

00:11:31.683 --> 00:11:34.021
Try using that right arm now.

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:40.199
I've seen many of my
comrades fall here today,

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:42.404
and for that,
you're going to pay.

00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:48.015
It didn't even slow him down.

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:58.737
[Soi Fon] Suzumebachi
can't pierce him?

00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:04.114
(swords clanking)

00:12:19.545 --> 00:12:22.050
I see what you're planning.

00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:25.056
But sir, according to
Lieutenant Sasakibe's report,

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:28.664
this enemy has found a way
of sealing away our Bankai.

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:29.933
Don't do it.

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:32.838
I'm aware of that, but
there must be a reckoning.

00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:35.544
These swine attacked
us without warning,

00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:37.180
murdered Lieutenant Sasakibe,

00:12:37.213 --> 00:12:40.219
and caused bloodshed
within the Seireitei.

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:42.925
Besides, we can never
hope to defeat them

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.063
without using our Bankai,

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:48.202
which means we must find
a way to break that seal,

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:51.375
if we are to have any chance
of surviving this battle,

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:53.012
let alone winning it.

00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:56.920
Therefore, Renji, if they
do seal away my Bankai,

00:12:56.953 --> 00:13:00.861
I need you to finish
them off with yours.

00:13:00.894 --> 00:13:02.765
Yes, Captain.

00:13:08.442 --> 00:13:09.444
Bankai.

00:13:14.522 --> 00:13:17.293
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

00:13:27.748 --> 00:13:30.453
Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh!

00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:32.490
Jakuho Raikoben!

00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:35.129
Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

00:13:42.377 --> 00:13:44.481
(Sajin groaning)

00:13:44.515 --> 00:13:45.517
We were wrong.

00:13:46.986 --> 00:13:48.857
This is not a seal.

00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:00.981
Our Bankai,

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.021
they're stealing it.

00:14:18.517 --> 00:14:19.919
(electricity sparking)

00:14:21.623 --> 00:14:22.992
-(gasping)
-What?

00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:24.929
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:28.269
She stole my Bankai?

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:31.876
Yeah, that's right, your
Bankai's mine now, doggy.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.847
Where are you?

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.253
I'm not sensing
you, are you there?

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:39.291
Say something.

00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:40.326
Hyorinmaru!

00:14:41.563 --> 00:14:43.165
Hyorinmaru!

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.543
Captain.

00:14:48.577 --> 00:14:50.614
Why are you worrying about me?

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.054
Don't just stand there,
use your Tenteikura!

00:14:54.087 --> 00:14:56.391
Send an emergency message
to all squad captains

00:14:56.425 --> 00:14:58.797
warning them not to
use their Bankai,

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.603
because the enemy isn't
sealing our Bankai,

00:15:01.636 --> 00:15:02.638
they're stealing it.

00:15:09.484 --> 00:15:11.422
[Rangiku] Tenteikura!

00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:17.434
(somber music)

00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:19.137
They're able to steal it?

00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:25.283
Those fools, letting
them steal their Bankai.

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:28.790
Squads two, six, and seven
have lost theirs as well.

00:15:28.824 --> 00:15:29.926
Idiots!

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:31.629
Why couldn't they
at least have waited

00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:33.834
until my analysis was complete?

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:36.038
Of all the blind stupidity.

00:15:42.852 --> 00:15:45.757
Better now than
later, I suppose.

00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:48.162
You see, when Captain Kurotsuchi

00:15:48.195 --> 00:15:50.601
has enough information, it
usually doesn't take him long

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:53.840
to come up with a solution
to just about anything.

00:15:53.874 --> 00:15:55.309
But in this case, he didn't,

00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:58.349
have enough
information, that is.

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:00.153
We initially had
no way of knowing

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:03.125
just what your
abilities really were.

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:05.864
But clearly, you weren't
a foe we were gonna beat

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:07.535
without our Bankai,

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:08.970
which means sooner or later,

00:16:09.004 --> 00:16:11.643
someone was gonna
have to be sacrificed.

00:16:11.676 --> 00:16:13.547
I just wish it had been later.

00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:19.525
Grimmaniel.

00:16:25.336 --> 00:16:27.473
(chuckles) Well, how about that,

00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:30.146
here I am trying to
put on a brave face,

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:31.850
and you blow a hole in it.

00:16:31.883 --> 00:16:33.753
I'm in trouble here, aren't I?

00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:40.901
What the hell, Bankai-

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:42.505
No, Renji!

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:43.807
The last thing we need

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.211
is to have you lose
your Bankai as well.

00:16:46.245 --> 00:16:49.819
But Captain, then
with all respect,

00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:54.194
how are we supposed
to fight these guys?

00:16:54.227 --> 00:16:57.500
How can we beat them
without our Bankai?

00:16:57.535 --> 00:16:58.904
(dramatic music)

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:02.678
(Soul Reapers yelling)

00:17:02.711 --> 00:17:05.349
(computers beeping)

00:17:05.383 --> 00:17:07.387
Put me through to
Ichigo Kurosaki now!

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.192
Sir, don't we need the
Captain's permission?

00:17:10.226 --> 00:17:12.163
The Captain's on
the front lines.

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:15.236
Just do what I say.

00:17:16.104 --> 00:17:17.575
(phone ringing)

00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:19.477
Akon, hello, I had a feeling

00:17:19.512 --> 00:17:22.217
I'd be hearing from
the Soul Society.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.421
So how are things
with you, long time-

00:17:24.454 --> 00:17:26.391
[Akon] This is an emergency,
don't you get that?

00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:29.030
Put me through to
Ichigo Kurosaki now!

00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:30.734
I don't think it's
gonna be possible

00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:32.638
to talk to Ichigo at the moment.

00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:33.740
[Akon] Why not?

00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:35.376
[Kisuke] Because right
now, he's fighting a Quincy

00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:38.717
who claims to be the captain
of the Hueco Mundo Hunt Army,

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.752
if you can believe that.

00:17:43.627 --> 00:17:44.862
Damn you!

00:17:44.895 --> 00:17:46.365
Why isn't it working?

00:17:48.102 --> 00:17:49.170
[Kisuke] What's interesting,

00:17:49.204 --> 00:17:51.275
is that the enemy
seems to be trying to,

00:17:51.308 --> 00:17:54.381
I don't know, seal Ichigo's
Bankai or something.

00:17:54.414 --> 00:17:56.051
But he's getting
really frustrated,

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:57.621
'cause it's not working.

00:17:57.655 --> 00:17:59.491
-It's not?
-Why isn't it?

00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:03.399
I knew the Soul Society

00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:05.469
was dealing with some invaders.

00:18:05.504 --> 00:18:07.574
I guess the fact
that you contacted me

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:10.446
must mean things are
getting pretty serious, huh?

00:18:10.479 --> 00:18:13.085
So let me go back to
my first question,

00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:15.824
how are things going
with you guys over there?

00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:17.761
(dramatic music)

00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:19.832
[Quilge] How can this be?

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:21.468
I'm using my Voll Stern Dich,

00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:24.809
and I even absorbed
that monstrous Arrancar!

00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:26.378
So how?

00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:29.552
How can his power surpass mine?

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.481
Funny thing is, I met
a guy the other day

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:46.786
who wanted to seal
away my Bankai as well.

00:18:46.819 --> 00:18:50.359
So tell me why you people are
so obsessed with it anyway?

00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:51.495
Interesting question,

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:53.667
but I hope you won't
be too disappointed

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.469
if I don't answer it.

00:18:55.504 --> 00:18:59.679
[Ichigo] Could it be that you
guys are afraid of Bankai?

00:18:59.712 --> 00:19:01.616
Don't be absurd, you worm!

00:19:01.649 --> 00:19:03.953
The Wandenreich fears
nothing in Heaven or Hell

00:19:03.987 --> 00:19:05.891
or anything in between-

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.199
Nice work, Ichigo.

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:12.671
Whatever you said really
got under his skin,

00:19:12.705 --> 00:19:15.476
disrupting his defensive
Reishi just long enough

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.548
for me to land a fatal blow.

00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:18.717
Kisuke!

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.554
Sorry, no time to chat.

00:19:20.587 --> 00:19:23.860
It seems we've got ourselves
a little emergency.

00:19:23.893 --> 00:19:24.995
Akon's on the line there,

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:27.868
he can fill you
in on the details.

00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:29.972
[Akon] Ichigo, the news is bad,

00:19:30.006 --> 00:19:32.310
but I need you to stay strong.

00:19:32.343 --> 00:19:35.182
Request successful,
Ichigo Kurosaki confirms

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.686
he's on his way here.

00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:40.059
Inform the Secret Remote
Unit that he's already-

00:19:40.092 --> 00:19:42.363
[Rin] Everything's
gonna be all right now.

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:43.800
Leave it to Ichigo,

00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:46.873
if anyone can save the
Soul Society, he can.

00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:52.216
[Yasutora] Kisuke!

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:53.520
[Kisuke] Ah, perfect timing.

00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:55.189
That corpse down
there should have

00:19:55.222 --> 00:19:57.360
a palm-sized metal
plate on it somewhere.

00:19:57.393 --> 00:20:00.032
You mind finding it
and bringing it to me?

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:03.005
But Kisuke, what
happened to Ichigo?

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:04.542
He got an emergency request

00:20:04.575 --> 00:20:06.879
from the Soul Society
and headed out.

00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:08.550
But I'll explain it all later.

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.455
At the moment, I need
to analyze this Quincy.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.260
They can do what?

00:20:14.294 --> 00:20:16.198
What do you mean they
can steal Bankai?

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:17.366
How is that even possible?

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.270
It's hard to believe, I know.

00:20:19.304 --> 00:20:20.607
But we've had it confirmed

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.913
that the captains of squads
two, six, seven, and ten

00:20:23.947 --> 00:20:25.751
have all had their
Bankai stolen.

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.757
[Ichigo] No, no way!

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:33.767
[Kisuke] Sorry to jump in here,

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.204
but I've analyzed
the data I gathered

00:20:36.238 --> 00:20:38.943
from your earlier battle
with the enemy, Ichigo.

00:20:38.977 --> 00:20:40.246
[Ichigo] Kisuke?

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:42.584
I've found that there
are three major abilities

00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:44.755
of note that the
Quincies possess.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.464
The first is the
Quincy Voll Stern Dich.

00:20:49.497 --> 00:20:51.836
The second is
referred to as Blut,

00:20:51.869 --> 00:20:54.575
by releasing Reishi directly
into their bloodstream,

00:20:54.608 --> 00:20:57.146
they can radically
increase their offensive

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.150
and defensive capabilities.

00:20:59.184 --> 00:21:01.488
It's powerful,
but it has a flaw.

00:21:01.522 --> 00:21:04.728
They can't use if for offense
and defense at the same time.

00:21:04.762 --> 00:21:07.935
The third ability, and the
most threatening for us

00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:10.072
is called Bankai Plundering.

00:21:10.106 --> 00:21:12.644
The thing is, for some
reason your Bankai

00:21:12.678 --> 00:21:15.617
seems to be the only one they
haven't been able to plunder.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.621
Now if we could
just figure out why,

00:21:17.654 --> 00:21:18.957
we might have a-

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.992
(Reishi arrow wizzes)

00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:22.363
(gasp)

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.504
The exit!

00:21:26.304 --> 00:21:28.977
Hey, Kisuke, what's going on?

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.012
Kisuke?

00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:40.634
[Kisuke] I let my guard down
thinking he had to be dead.

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:43.706
I forgot about Ransotengai.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.442
(dramatic music)

00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:47.614
I can't let him go to their aid.

00:21:47.648 --> 00:21:50.019
My orders are to
keep Ichigo Kurosaki

00:21:50.052 --> 00:21:52.290
from interfering in our plans

00:21:52.323 --> 00:21:55.362
even if it should
cost me my life!

00:22:00.172 --> 00:22:02.778
Oh, great, what the
hell is this thing?

00:22:02.811 --> 00:22:05.015
I'll tell you what it
is, Ichigo Kurosaki,

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:09.057
it is the end of all your hopes
of saving the Soul Society!

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.794
Neither you or any Soul Reaper

00:22:10.827 --> 00:22:13.498
can escape from that
prison I've put you in,

00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:15.402
and it will continue
to imprison you

00:22:15.436 --> 00:22:17.641
long after I've ceased to exist.

00:22:17.674 --> 00:22:21.481
You may have won the battle,
but you've lost the war.

00:22:21.516 --> 00:22:25.089
You will remain trapped in
that prison of pure energy.

00:22:29.865 --> 00:22:33.940
And there you will
sit, helpless, useless,

00:22:33.973 --> 00:22:36.646
as the Soul Society falls.

00:22:39.585 --> 00:22:42.123

[Chojiro] The vow rests in
the shade of the willow,

00:24:18.516 --> 00:24:22.858
even as the lightning fades.
