WEBVTT

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:13.561
You could see it too, right?

00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:16.834
Your little friend, Ichigo,
was never gonna pass the test

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:18.704
no matter how hard he tried.

00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:19.840
(Renji grunts)

00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:21.510
I knew that 'cause I
know the whereabouts

00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:24.550
of every Asauchi
I've ever forged.

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:25.818
(Renji gasps)

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:28.658
Every Soul Reaper
is given an Asauchi,

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:29.793
and through continuous training,

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:33.801
we transformed them into
our own personal Zanpakuto.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.607
That's the foundation and the
essence of the relationship

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.980
between Soul Reapers
and their Zanpakuto.

00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:42.519
That will never change.

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:45.892
It's true not just for every
squad member and captain,

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:48.531
but for us in Squad Zero too.

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:51.904
It's true even for a
stray, self-taught outlaw

00:00:51.937 --> 00:00:53.541
like Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.680
He gained an Asauchi by
lifting it off the corpse

00:00:56.714 --> 00:00:58.216
of a Soul Reaper.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.387
There are no exceptions.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.559
Since the dawn of
the Soul Society,

00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:04.028
not a single Soul Reaper

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:06.232
has ever awakened
their own Zanpakuto

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.838
without possessing an Asauchi,

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:11.276
an Asauchi forged by me.

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.482
Sheeit, it was obvious
from the get-go

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:17.321
that this kind of training
wasn't ever gonna work for him.

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:21.062
It was so obvious, you even
knew it too, right, brother?

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:23.333
The only one who
doesn't get it is him.

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.970
That's why I sent him home,

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:26.674
'cause he ain't
never gonna get it,

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:30.815
till he finds out who he is
and where his soul came from.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:36.727

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:56.165

(rain pattering)

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:20.200
I'm back home.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.672
Ichigo, where have
you been, boy?

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:25.678
Seems like forever
since (groans).

00:03:25.712 --> 00:03:28.016
He didn't seem very
happy to see me.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.657
(Ichigo panting)

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.226
(rain pattering)

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:38.537
What's wrong with you?

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:40.808
Why are you being
so melodramatic?

00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:43.179
You show up at my
door, out of the blue,

00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:45.150
acting like it's the
end of the world.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:46.486
Like you're some school girl

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.423
who had a fight
with her parents.

00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:50.260
Sorry.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.372
(water pattering)

00:03:56.406 --> 00:04:00.313
I got kicked out without even
getting my Zanpakuto fixed.

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.286
How can I face
anybody after that?

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:06.927
(valve squeaks)

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.766
Ms. Ikumi, thanks.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.768
(air whooshing)

00:04:10.802 --> 00:04:12.404
(grunts) Ow, it's hot!

00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:15.177
Shut up, just eat it.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.880
(rain pattering)

00:04:16.914 --> 00:04:21.422
I'm sorry, Ms. Ikumi, for
barging in on you like this,

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:23.627
after not showing up for work.

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:25.363
(hands thuds)

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:32.244
-(head thuds)
-(Ichigo grunts)

00:04:32.277 --> 00:04:34.516
You should apologize,
Ichigo, you're right,

00:04:34.549 --> 00:04:37.121
but not for that,
you stupid idiot!

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:38.423
From the day I hired you,

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:41.697
haven't I always been like
an older sister to you?

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.235
You can come to
me about anything.

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:46.439
I can't believe you
don't know that by now.

00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:48.143
I'm sorry.

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:50.213
(doorbell ringing)

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:52.284
Yeah, hold on, I'm coming!

00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:55.157
(Ichigo chuckles)

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.159
(rain pattering)

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:57.795
Huh, what the hell?

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.835
(Ichigo gasps)

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.607
(rain pattering)

00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:08.984
Must have been
some kind of prank.

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:11.255
Well, anyway, thanks.

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.592
I'm eh, I'm heading home.

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:14.295
[Ikumi] Hmm?

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:17.167
[Ichigo] Don't
worry, I'm okay now.

00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.169
Wait a second!

00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:19.271
(door thuds)

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:21.008
(Ikumi sighs)

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:22.044
Hmm?

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:27.321
Ichigo, you left your...

00:05:27.354 --> 00:05:30.327
(rain pattering)

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:37.107
Well, I guess it can
wait till tomorrow.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.880
(rain pattering)

00:05:42.017 --> 00:05:45.290
The fact that you came
for me wearing that outfit

00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:46.960
means you know, don't you?

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:50.635
Urahara told me what
happened in the Soul Society,

00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:53.139
that your Zanpakuto was broken,

00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:55.043
and that Squad
Zero came for you.

00:05:56.713 --> 00:05:58.984
They've kicked you
out, haven't they?

00:05:59.018 --> 00:06:00.153
(dramatic music)

00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:02.825
Well, I think I can see why.

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:05.363
There's no way you could
fix your broken Bankai,

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:07.602
not in your current state.

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:11.042
After all, you don't know the
first thing about yourself,

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:12.311
or where you came from.

00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:13.313

(dramatic violin music)

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:24.869
Remember how you once
said that I could wait

00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:29.044
till I felt the time was right
to tell you the whole story?

00:06:29.078 --> 00:06:31.550
(dramatic violin music)

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:33.554
I think that time is now.

00:06:34.421 --> 00:06:38.396
Listen carefully, you're
not a Soul Reaper,

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:40.735
but you're not an
ordinary human either.

00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:43.006
There's something
you need to know

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.343
about your mother, Ichigo.

00:06:45.377 --> 00:06:50.487
-(dramatic violin music)
-(rain pattering)

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:58.904
(Masaki panting)

00:07:02.578 --> 00:07:05.116
My name's Masaki Kurosaki.

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:08.389
I'm a Quincy.

00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:11.763
(dramatic violin music)

00:07:24.288 --> 00:07:26.627
Captain, where are you?

00:07:27.862 --> 00:07:28.831
(leaves rustling)

00:07:28.864 --> 00:07:30.400
(Rangiku gasps)

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:31.637
Captain?

00:07:34.441 --> 00:07:35.645
Found you!

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:37.782
My, what a big acorn!

00:07:37.815 --> 00:07:39.485
[Isshin] (groan) I think I
broke my beautiful pelvis!

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:41.255
I'll have to take the rest
of the day off (coughing)!

00:07:41.288 --> 00:07:43.159
Oh, you didn't break anything.

00:07:43.192 --> 00:07:44.963
Come on, let's go.

00:07:44.996 --> 00:07:45.765
I'm going to make sure

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:48.136
you do your job, Captain Shiba.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:52.444
Here, sir, I've finished them.

00:07:52.477 --> 00:07:53.947
See, that's why
I'm betting on you

00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:56.118
to be the next squad
captain, Toshiro!

00:07:56.152 --> 00:07:57.487
Whoa, based on rank,

00:07:57.522 --> 00:08:00.093
I'm next in line for
the captaincy, not him!

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:01.930
Rangiku, if someone like
you ever became captain,

00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:03.499
your whole squad
would end up broke,

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:05.203
sitting in a bar somewhere.

00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:06.339
I quite agree.

00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:08.677
Besides, my training's
coming along well.

00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:10.180
I'd make a fine captain.

00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:11.516
Shut up, Toshiro!

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.518
You're such a suck-up!

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:13.854
It's so annoying!

00:08:13.887 --> 00:08:17.294
(laughs) You kids play nice now.

00:08:17.327 --> 00:08:20.801
Hold on, what happened to
the manju I left in here?

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:23.607
(gulps) Oh, by the way, Captain,

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.813
there's one report here that,
uh, caught my attention.

00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:28.517
Wait, we'll deal with
that in a minute.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.053
First I want to
know what happened

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:31.088
to the manju I put in here

00:08:31.122 --> 00:08:33.226
that I was really looking
forward to eating.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:34.328
Will you shut up, sir?

00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:36.833
No one cares about your
stupid manju.

00:08:36.867 --> 00:08:39.238
(burps) It was
delicious, by the way.

00:08:39.271 --> 00:08:41.242
[Isshin] So it was
you! I knew it!

00:08:41.275 --> 00:08:42.812
That's gross insubordination!

00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:44.716
And forget what I said
about you making captain, I-

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:46.185
Sir, do you remember
the incident report

00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:47.187
from two months ago?

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.489
Huh?

00:08:48.524 --> 00:08:50.895
It came to us from a
city called Naruki.

00:08:50.928 --> 00:08:53.266
One of the Soul Reapers
stationed there

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.268
died in an accident.

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.005
Yeah, that does ring a bell.

00:08:56.038 --> 00:08:58.342
They're still
investigating it, right?

00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:00.246
[Toshiro] Correct,
now take a look

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.685
at last month's incident report.

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:03.721
Huh?

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:07.060
[Toshiro] Two more
Soul Reapers died.

00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:10.166
Captain, wait,
where are you going?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.507
[Isshin] To Naruki, I'm leaving
you guys in charge here!

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.711
Wait, you're going
off all by yourself?

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:18.049
Yep, I shouldn't be more
than a couple of days.

00:09:18.082 --> 00:09:20.220
Try not to burn the
place down, all right?

00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:23.527
But, sir, shouldn't we report
this to the Head Captain?

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.564
(groans) We'd
better go with him!

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:27.535
No, we'd better not.

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.271
(grunts) Why the hell not??

00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:30.741
The Captain wanted to go alone,

00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:33.514
because he figures it
could be dangerous.

00:09:33.547 --> 00:09:35.216
Of course it could be dangerous!

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.352
That's exactly why we should--

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:41.195
That's exactly why we should
stay here like he says.

00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:44.268
We're not strong enough
yet to do anything else.

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:45.604
We wouldn't be any help to him.

00:09:45.638 --> 00:09:47.340
We'd just get in his way.

00:09:48.644 --> 00:09:51.616
(dramatic music)

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:57.895
[Sosuke] Any progress?

00:09:57.929 --> 00:10:00.099
No, can't say that
there has been really.

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:02.437
We've been successful in
equipping some Hollows

00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:06.045
with the ability to Hollowfy
a target, but unfortunately,

00:10:06.078 --> 00:10:09.251
none of them has survived
the process so far.

00:10:09.284 --> 00:10:11.790
I see, no matter.

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:13.392
We're narrowing
in on the location

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:15.898
of Shinji Hirako and the others.

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:18.169
We'll continue the
Hollowfication experiments

00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:19.572
while we smoke them out,

00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:22.344
killing two birds
with one stone.

00:10:22.377 --> 00:10:24.983
Take your time, Gin, Kaname.

00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:28.657
Everything is working
out just fine.

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.836
[Soul Reaper] Kinda
looks like it might rain.

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:36.640
That's just what I don't like.

00:10:36.673 --> 00:10:37.742
If you remember,

00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:39.478
it was raining when
the last guy died,

00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:40.815
and the one before that.

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:42.819
Oh yeah, thanks a lot
for bringing that up.

00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:46.960
[Isshin] Ah, so it's on
rainy days it happens, huh?

00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:48.095
Good to know.

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:50.466
Oh, Captain Shiba,
what a surprise!

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.803
What're you doing here?

00:10:51.837 --> 00:10:54.609
Who me, I was looking for
a bathroom and I got lost.

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:56.412
Sir, you're a terrible liar.

00:10:56.445 --> 00:11:00.453
Look, men, if it does rain
tonight, you can go on home.

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:01.656
(Soul Reapers grunt)

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.861
Never could pee
with an audience.

00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:07.367
(dramatic music)

00:11:10.306 --> 00:11:13.412
[Izumi] How is school
coming along, Masaki?

00:11:14.849 --> 00:11:18.489
Hmm, oh, were you talking to me?

00:11:18.524 --> 00:11:20.026
Sorry, Aunt Izumi.

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:22.698
Well, I go in every day
and I'm always on time.

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:26.706
[Izumi] I see, and how
about your Seiren training?

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.544
Ah, ah, ah, my Seiren training.

00:11:28.577 --> 00:11:31.382
Well, it's going so-so, I guess.

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:32.384
(hand thuds)

00:11:32.417 --> 00:11:34.087
Just so-so, that's all?

00:11:34.121 --> 00:11:35.189
Yes, I'm sorry!

00:11:35.223 --> 00:11:38.229
I don't think you really
understand your situation.

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:41.035
You're the only surviving
member of the Kurosaki family

00:11:41.068 --> 00:11:42.872
without parents or
siblings of any kind!

00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:44.609
It's only because
you're a fellow Quincy

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:46.011
that we even took you in!

00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:47.013
Mother!

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:47.815
(Izumi grunts)

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:49.318
That's quite enough.

00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:52.390
I could hear you all
the way down the hall.

00:11:52.424 --> 00:11:54.529
(Izumi grunts)

00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:56.298
[Izumi] I'll be in my room.

00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:00.574
Where's Father?

00:12:00.608 --> 00:12:02.678
[Izumi] At the Funfte Feld.

00:12:02.712 --> 00:12:04.582
Don't ask me when he'll be back.

00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:06.151
He never tells me.

00:12:08.724 --> 00:12:10.393
(door thuds)

00:12:10.426 --> 00:12:11.395
Masaki.

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:12.565
[Masaki] Hmm?

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:15.236
I'm sorry, I hope you'll
forgive my mother.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.009
She's taking her
loneliness out on you.

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:20.915
(chuckle) Oh, don't
be silly, Ryu.

00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:22.284
There's nothing to forgive!

00:12:22.317 --> 00:12:23.687
I totally understand!

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.689
(Ryuken groans)

00:12:24.722 --> 00:12:26.927
Thanks for the meal!

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.402
Oh, be careful of the shrimp
casserole, it's addictive.

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:32.470
(chuckles) See you later!

00:12:41.523 --> 00:12:42.558
Katagiri?

00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:45.631
Oh, yes, what is
it, Master Ryuken?

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:47.802
It's about Masaki.

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:49.906
I think she's aware
of the real reason

00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:51.977
she was brought
into our household.

00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:54.882
She knows it's because
Mother wants to ensure

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:58.590
the Echt Quincy bloodline
of the Ishida family.

00:12:58.624 --> 00:12:59.926
[Katagiri] How does she know?

00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:01.395
Did your mother tell her?

00:13:01.428 --> 00:13:05.069
Do you really think
she needed to be told?

00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:07.474
She's not the ditz she seems.

00:13:08.677 --> 00:13:10.146
Makes you wonder.

00:13:11.281 --> 00:13:13.520
Could she be happy
marrying me, do you think?

00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:19.164
[Katagiri] Hmm, that's so like
you to think that happiness

00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:23.172
is necessary for a marriage
between Quincies, Master Ryuken.

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:24.575
Huh?

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:26.145
You're so kind.

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:31.088
Even putting aside
your other attributes,

00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:32.758
your kindness alone
will be enough

00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:34.494
to make her happy, I'm sure.

00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:37.267
Don't be ridiculous.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.471
Kindness has nothing
to do with it.

00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:43.012
I only care about her happiness,

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:45.617
because without it
it'll be difficult,

00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:47.020
if not impossible,

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:49.191
to secure our future.

00:13:49.224 --> 00:13:51.563
And I don't mean hers and mine.

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.934
I mean the future
of the Quincies.

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:04.154
(water dripping)

00:14:04.187 --> 00:14:06.926
(rain pattering)

00:14:08.062 --> 00:14:09.431
Man, it's coming down.

00:14:13.005 --> 00:14:15.309
Maybe it's not Soul Reapers
that are being targeted,

00:14:15.343 --> 00:14:17.447
but their high
Spiritual Pressure.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.086
Let me try baiting the trap.

00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:23.693
(thunderous explosion)

00:14:23.727 --> 00:14:25.196
Amazing, check it out!

00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:28.102
Now, that is what you
call Spiritual Pressure!

00:14:29.572 --> 00:14:31.810
(Soul Reaper screams)

00:14:31.843 --> 00:14:33.714
Damn it, I guess it's not about

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:35.651
Spiritual Pressure, after all!

00:14:35.684 --> 00:14:38.590
(thunderous explosion)

00:14:38.623 --> 00:14:39.659
(Isshin gasps)

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:42.631
(dramatic music)

00:14:45.838 --> 00:14:47.875
A black Hollow?

00:14:48.944 --> 00:14:51.616
(Hollow growls)

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.624
(Isshin gasps)

00:14:55.657 --> 00:14:59.097
(Hollow growls and roars)

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:02.905
Yeah, even if its
whole body is black,

00:15:02.938 --> 00:15:05.076
and the hole in its
chest is covered up,

00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:07.046
going off its
Spiritual Pressure,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.418
that is definitely a Hollow.

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:11.523
(dramatic music)

00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:12.558
[Masaki] (gasps)

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.595
I sense a massive

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:17.100
Spiritual Pressure on the move,

00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:20.339
a Hollow's and someone else's!

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:22.477
(door thuds)

00:15:22.511 --> 00:15:24.481
(Masaki panting)

00:15:24.515 --> 00:15:26.385
Masaki, stop,

00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:28.690
how many times do I
have to remind you?

00:15:28.723 --> 00:15:33.733
We Quincies only head out after
the Soul Reapers are dead.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:36.271
Even then, by long tradition,

00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:39.946
we let Gemischts like Katagiri
do the actual fighting.

00:15:39.979 --> 00:15:43.219
Remember your position
and who you are.

00:15:43.252 --> 00:15:46.425
You need to take good
care of yourself.

00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:49.131
Echt Quincies like
us are too valuable

00:15:49.164 --> 00:15:51.970
to risk our necks so hastily.

00:15:53.472 --> 00:15:54.775
I know that, but still!

00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:57.648
(air whooshing)

00:15:59.184 --> 00:16:01.121
[Isshin] This thing
acts like a Hollow,

00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:03.225
but fights like a Soul Reaper.

00:16:04.127 --> 00:16:06.498
This isn't gonna be easy!

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.469
(air whooshing)

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:11.743
Captain Shiba, what're
you doing here, sir?

00:16:11.776 --> 00:16:13.345
You're out of your jurisdiction!

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:14.347
(air whooshing)

00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:15.517
Look out!

00:16:15.551 --> 00:16:16.586
(thunderous explosion)

00:16:17.822 --> 00:16:18.623
(Ryuken and Masaki gasp)

00:16:21.328 --> 00:16:23.600
Ryu, before you take any action,

00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:26.338
you always think about how
it might affect Aunt Izumi,

00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:30.112
the Quincies, the future,
and so many other things,

00:16:30.146 --> 00:16:33.018
and I admire you for
that, I really do.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.591
But I'm sorry, to me,

00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:39.532
taking good care of myself
means following my heart,

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:43.105
and doing whatever I
can whenever I can.

00:16:43.138 --> 00:16:46.445
If I were to hold back
and allow my position

00:16:46.478 --> 00:16:49.351
to prevent me from saving
a life when I could have,

00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:53.793
I know my future self
would never forgive me.

00:16:53.827 --> 00:16:55.664
(Ryuken sighs)

00:16:55.697 --> 00:16:56.833
(dramatic music)

00:16:56.866 --> 00:16:59.371
-(Masaki gasping)
-(footsteps thudding)

00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:02.545
(dramatic music)

00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:04.982
[Ryuken] Katagiri,
we're heading out.

00:17:05.016 --> 00:17:07.588
(dramatic music)

00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:08.657
What the hell was that?

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:12.531
A Cero, this thing's
fighting like a Menos now.

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:15.403
With every Soul
Reaper it devours,

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:18.677
it's getting
stronger and smarter!

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.148
(dramatic music)

00:17:21.181 --> 00:17:23.385
Hey, there's no way
a monster like you

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:26.058
could go on a rampage in
the World of the Living,

00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:28.697
and not get noticed
by the Soul Society!

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:29.699
So who sent you?

00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:33.272
Right, as if you'd tell me.

00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:36.411
Burn, Engetsu!

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.253
(dramatic music)

00:17:42.323 --> 00:17:43.760
What?

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:46.498
(dramatic music)

00:17:49.572 --> 00:17:51.008
(thunderous explosion)

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:54.180
(dramatic music)

00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:57.387
That slash in the back
was done with a Zanpakuto

00:17:58.222 --> 00:18:00.226
by a Soul Reaper!

00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:04.434
So it's a traitor behind
all of this, White!

00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:08.375
[Sosuke Voiceover]
Ironic, isn't it?

00:18:08.409 --> 00:18:11.716
He's encased in black armor,
yet he's called White.

00:18:11.749 --> 00:18:14.187
That's because of the
whiteness within him.

00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:17.861
(dramatic music)

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:22.236
It'll take more than what
you've got to get rid of me,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.840
you piece of shit (grunting)!

00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:26.913
(yelling)

00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:30.152
(thunderous explosion)

00:18:31.823 --> 00:18:32.891
(Masaki gasps)

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:34.929
(dramatic music)

00:18:34.962 --> 00:18:37.868
(thunderous explosion)

00:18:37.901 --> 00:18:40.941
You can still fight even
after losing an arm, huh?

00:18:40.974 --> 00:18:42.511
Color me impressed!

00:18:42.544 --> 00:18:43.847
(White roars)

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.517
(gasp) Oh, no!

00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:47.153
(air whooshing)

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:48.857
(Isshin gasps)

00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:52.230
(dramatic music)

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:54.000
What the hell?

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:55.202
Who is that?

00:18:56.138 --> 00:18:57.841
A Quincy!

00:18:57.875 --> 00:18:59.645
This wasn't part of the plan.

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:00.947
I'll deal with her.

00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:03.319
No, wait, let's see
how this plays out.

00:19:04.855 --> 00:19:08.128
Leave her alone (gasps)!

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:10.867
(dramatic music)

00:19:12.036 --> 00:19:16.345
[Masaki Voiceover] It's
quick, all right then.

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:18.182
You idiot, what're you doing?

00:19:18.215 --> 00:19:21.021
(dramatic music)

00:19:21.054 --> 00:19:24.995
-(White roaring)
-(dramatic music)

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:28.135
Good boy, now, stay
right where you are.

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:30.707
(thunderous explosion)

00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:33.513
(dramatic music)

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:48.710
Are you all right?

00:19:49.044 --> 00:19:50.814
Ow, yeah,

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:54.020
hey, thanks for saving my neck.

00:19:54.054 --> 00:19:56.692
No, you're the one who saved me.

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:59.665
Protecting me is what
got you hurt so badly.

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:02.070
(laughs) You're right, I
hadn't even thought of that.

00:20:02.103 --> 00:20:04.207
Well, let's call it
even, then, okay?

00:20:06.579 --> 00:20:08.983
Hold still, I'm
going to heal you.

00:20:09.017 --> 00:20:13.693
Sure, man, you took out that
monster all by yourself.

00:20:13.727 --> 00:20:15.229
Who are you, anyway?

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:19.070
Do I dare tell him?

00:20:19.104 --> 00:20:21.676
After all, he's a Soul Reaper.

00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:24.582
What will he do if he
finds out I'm a Quincy?

00:20:24.615 --> 00:20:27.320
(rain pattering)

00:20:30.994 --> 00:20:32.931
My name's Masaki Kurosaki.

00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:36.004
I'm a Quincy.

00:20:36.037 --> 00:20:38.943
(rain pattering)

00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:40.981
(Isshin groans)

00:20:42.818 --> 00:20:43.753
(Masaki sighs)

00:20:43.787 --> 00:20:46.258
No kidding, so
you're a Quincy, huh?

00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:50.734
You're the first real Quincy
I've ever laid eyes on, wow!

00:20:50.767 --> 00:20:52.538
I mean I've heard
a lot about 'em,

00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:53.973
but I never thought I'd actually

00:20:54.007 --> 00:20:55.610
be lucky enough
to meet one!

00:20:56.011 --> 00:20:58.750
(laughing)

00:20:58.783 --> 00:21:01.789
[Masaki Voiceover] Is something
wrong with this person?

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:03.927
This isn't what I
was expecting at all.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.799
(melancholy music)

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:09.939
I wonder if all the other
Soul Reapers are like this.

00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:13.378
(melancholy music)

00:21:13.412 --> 00:21:16.451
(giggles) I hope they are.

00:21:16.485 --> 00:21:18.556
Then maybe Ryu, Aunt Izumi,

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.929
all of us can work
towards a better future.

00:21:21.963 --> 00:21:25.102
(melancholy music)

00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:28.877
It's time to go,
Katagiri, Masaki's safe.

00:21:29.845 --> 00:21:34.020
There is nothing to
report here, understood?

00:21:34.053 --> 00:21:36.458
(melancholy music)

00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:38.897
[Katagiri] As you
wish, Master Ryuken.

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:41.836
The fact that he
self-destructed means

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:45.142
not only did he surpass the
targeted Hollowfication phase,

00:21:45.176 --> 00:21:47.815
he reached the final
metastasizing phase!

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:50.954
But why did he have to
pass it on to a Quincy?

00:21:51.622 --> 00:21:53.993
What a waste of time and effort!

00:21:54.027 --> 00:21:55.429
Not at all.

00:21:55.462 --> 00:21:57.968
There are times when straying
from the initial goal

00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:03.478
can result in a superior
outcome, it's intriguing.

00:22:03.513 --> 00:22:06.519
A Hollow created from
a dead Soul Reaper

00:22:06.552 --> 00:22:09.625
decides to target a
Quincy of all things,

00:22:09.658 --> 00:22:12.831
the polar opposite of himself.

00:22:12.865 --> 00:22:16.404
Personally, I can't wait
to see what happens next.

(rain pattering)

[Isshin Voiceover]
Even with your sins,

00:24:13.138 --> 00:24:15.075
you are like the sun.
