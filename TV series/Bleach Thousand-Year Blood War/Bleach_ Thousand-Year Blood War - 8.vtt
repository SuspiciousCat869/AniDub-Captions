WEBVTT

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:11.456
[Squad Member] Over here!

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:12.626
-I think I found someone.
-Units 11 and 16.

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:13.628
-Hurry.
-Hurry up

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:15.097
and search for survivors.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.034
The rest of you,
you're coming with me.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:18.136
[Squad] Sir.

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.540
[Yasochika] Leave
the dead for later.

00:00:19.573 --> 00:00:22.411
The wounded are our
priority right now.

00:00:22.444 --> 00:00:23.881
-He didn't make it.
-That one looks critical.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:26.052
Take him to room 203, hurry.

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:31.897
(Isane sighing)

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:35.270
Captain Unohana, was it
really the right thing

00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:38.443
for us to do, to remain
here in the barracks?

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:40.949
We might've saved more
lives if we'd been out there

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:43.253
-with the rest of the-
-Isane.

00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:46.426
We can't let our feelings
dictate our actions.

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:48.831
The natural reaction
would have been for us

00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:50.668
to leave our posts
out of concern.

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:54.643
But I know you are not so
short-sighted that I need

00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:57.949
to explain to you why that
would have been wrong.

00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:00.053
We both know you're
wiser than that.

00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:02.926
Right.

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.330
I'm sorry, ma'am
(sobs), forgive me!

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.604
There's no need
for tears, Isane.

00:01:08.638 --> 00:01:12.444
"Do not leave the Squad
4 barracks," he told us.

00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:14.783
"No matter what."

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:19.158
Who knew that when the Head
Captain gave us those orders

00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:22.097
they would be the last
that he would ever give?

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.805
(rain pattering)

00:01:32.652 --> 00:01:37.662
("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.101
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:07.174
-("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:19.098
Kisuke Urahara wanted you
to know he's alive and well.

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.704
And that Orihime Inoue
and Yasutora Sado

00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:23.039
are both safe, too.

00:03:23.073 --> 00:03:24.208
That's about it, Sir.

00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:26.446
We don't have any more
details than that.

00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:28.349
All right.

00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:30.120
What?

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:32.091
That's a goddamn lie!

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:33.226
There's no way.

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:35.097
No way Captain Zaraki
lost to that guy!

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.232
[Nurse] You need to calm down.

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:37.669
-Please.
-I need to see him!

00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:38.704
-Captain!
-Ichigo.

00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:40.908
You need some proper
medical treatment as well.

00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:42.244
Why don't you come
along with me.

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:44.081
Nah, I'm okay.

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:46.587
They already looked me
over and bandaged me up.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.089
Come on, I'm not
just talking about

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:49.291
those scratches on your face!

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:52.030
I can tell you've been
seriously wounded!

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.266
Ichigo.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.305
Rukia and Abarai just
got out of surgery.

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:00.280
They're no longer in
critical condition.

00:04:00.313 --> 00:04:01.717
They're stable now.

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:05.390
Just call me if
you need anything.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.133
Ichigo.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.169
Rukia!

00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:12.271
Hey, you shouldn't
even be talking.

00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:13.406
[Squad Member] This
came for you, Sir.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.177
She just said we're
in stable condition,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.147
or have you gone deaf.

00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:18.684
On top of being dumb?

00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:20.655
Dumb huh?

00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:22.926
Sounds like your mouth
is working just fine.

00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:25.598
(heart monitor beeping)

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:30.006
Ichigo, I knew you'd come to
help defend the Soul Society.

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:31.342
Thank you.

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:32.979
Of course I came.

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:34.181
A little late, though.

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:36.653
I can't say I was
very much help.

00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:37.822
Shut up.

00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:41.028
You drove off the leader
of the enemy's forces.

00:04:41.062 --> 00:04:42.866
If you hadn't done what you did,

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:45.370
things would've gotten
a whole lot worse.

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:48.511
So hold your head up
high, you damn idiot.

00:04:48.544 --> 00:04:50.180
[Ichigo] If you say so.

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:51.382
(Rukia chuckling)

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:53.219
Pardon the intrusion, Sir.

00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:55.157
Captain Kurotsuchi
wants to see you,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.793
regarding your Zanpakuto.

00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:00.367
-(rain pattering)
-(worrisome music)

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.703
[Shinji] So typical.

00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:03.072
He's always running
off somewhere,

00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:05.010
no matter what the situation is.

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:06.914
I wish he'd sit still and think

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:08.884
of his own well-being for once.

00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:12.491
Captain Hirako,

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:15.397
did Ichigo seem
different to you?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.234
He seemed troubled.

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:20.407
Yeah, I couldn't help
noticing that as well.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.046
Though to be fair, his
Zanpakuto was broken.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:26.687
He's exhausted and disappointed
he couldn't do more.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.958
But I wouldn't worry
about him too much.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.097
I don't know.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.301
I think there's more
to it than that.

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:39.245
It seems like he's dealing
with something else.

00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:42.417
Something serious that
he's hiding from us.

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:45.925
(gentle music)

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:50.768
[Jushiro] The Head Captain's
body has yet to be found.

00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:54.676
The enemy destroyed
virtually everything.

00:05:57.414 --> 00:05:59.385
I have an update, Sir.

00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:01.890
It appears that Squad
Captain Byakuya Kuchiki

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:05.898
as well as Kenpachi Zaraki
have both managed to survive.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:08.537
But they have yet to
regain consciousness.

00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:10.440
It's unlikely they
will be able to return

00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:12.612
to their duties any time soon.

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:15.116
In fact, they may never
regain consciousness again,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.620
-it would seem-
-Get out!

00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:19.258
We've had enough grim
tidings for one day.

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:20.628
Where have you been?

00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:23.266
Haven't you heard we lost
the Head Captain, you fool?

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.237
How much more bad news
are we supposed to take?

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.239
Get a grip.

00:06:26.272 --> 00:06:27.241
It's embarrassing.

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:28.309
[Soi] Get a grip?

00:06:28.343 --> 00:06:29.813
That's easy for you to say!

00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:31.750
You guys have always
held a grudge against

00:06:31.783 --> 00:06:33.419
the Head Captain
all these years!

00:06:33.453 --> 00:06:35.156
Don't you dare.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.593
Enough, Soi Fon!

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:39.198
Do you think you're the
only one who feels shattered

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.200
by our loss?

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.302
(Soi gasping)

00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:42.639
Now, now.

00:06:42.672 --> 00:06:44.576
-No fighting, no fighting.
-(hands clapping)

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:46.947
Play nice, everyone.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.320
If Old Man Yama was here to
see us squabbling like this,

00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:53.159
he'd give us all a
good smack on the head.

00:06:53.192 --> 00:06:55.598
Nor would he want
us standing around

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:58.269
bawling our heads
off over his memory.

00:06:58.303 --> 00:06:59.773
Shunsui, you bastard.

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:02.277
Remember what our purpose is.

00:07:02.311 --> 00:07:05.016
The Thirteen Court
Guard Squads aren't here

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.989
to mourn the Soul Society.

00:07:08.022 --> 00:07:11.596
Our only job is to
protect the Soul Society.

00:07:12.497 --> 00:07:14.536
Or at least what's left of it.

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:18.443
So let's all just try and
keep moving forward, shall we?

00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:20.881
You can't fix it?

00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:21.850
Why can't you?

00:07:21.883 --> 00:07:23.954
What do you do when your
Zanpakuto gets broken?

00:07:23.988 --> 00:07:26.359
Are you really telling me
you can't fix your own?

00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:27.862
When will you learn?

00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:32.805
I have never fixed my Zanpakuto,
I have merely modified it.

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.477
The only thing that
can fix a Zanpakuto

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:38.483
is its owner's own mind
and Spiritual Pressure,

00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:40.487
and enough time to
infuse them both

00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.324
into the Zanpakuto itself.

00:07:42.357 --> 00:07:44.361
That's the only way.

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:46.165
(sighs) Okay, fine.

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:48.637
So what you're saying is,
I have to take it back

00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:50.373
and fix the damn thing myself.

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:51.643
Not quite.

00:07:51.677 --> 00:07:53.179
I hadn't finished
my explanation.

00:07:53.212 --> 00:07:54.214
Huh?

00:07:54.248 --> 00:07:56.485
That only applies to Shikai.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.056
If we're talking
about the destruction

00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:01.730
of a Zanpakuto's Bankai,
then that's a bit trickier.

00:08:01.763 --> 00:08:04.001
Because once destroyed,
a Bankai can never

00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:06.238
in fact be restored,
I'm sorry to say.

00:08:06.272 --> 00:08:07.240
What?

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:08.811
Wait a minute.

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:11.382
But then, what's that mean?

00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:13.252
(communicator beeping)

00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:14.622
Yes, I'm here.

00:08:15.624 --> 00:08:17.394
(door whooshing)

00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:18.530
(Kon screaming)

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:19.766
-Get away from me.
-Come back here, you.

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:21.168
-Kon?
-[Squad Member] Get him!

00:08:21.202 --> 00:08:24.809
What the heck is Kon doing
here in the Soul Society?

00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:26.580
-(door whooshing)
-I see.

00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:28.349
Just as I thought.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.586
Very well.

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:32.057
-I'm headed there now.
-Huh?

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.130
You can come with
me, Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:36.399
We're expecting visitors.

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:38.302
And if I have to meet them,

00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:40.608
you should have
to meet them, too.

00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:43.847
The great Squad
Zero is on its way.

00:08:47.955 --> 00:08:49.391
-Shinji!
-Huh?

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:51.530
Oh, you've come to
welcome them, too?

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.168
You might regret this, Ichigo.

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:57.875
Why's this Squad
Zero coming now?

00:08:57.909 --> 00:09:01.883
I mean after the Seireitei's
been completely annihilated?

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:04.254
Where have they
been all this time?

00:09:04.288 --> 00:09:05.624
In the Royal Palace.

00:09:05.658 --> 00:09:08.964
Okay, but isn't that
within the Seireitei?

00:09:08.997 --> 00:09:11.570
Remember how those walls
fell out of the sky

00:09:11.603 --> 00:09:13.106
when you first came here?

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:14.441
(Ichigo gasping)

00:09:14.475 --> 00:09:16.078
Those walls have remained down,

00:09:16.112 --> 00:09:19.118
forming a barrier around
this area, ever since you

00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:20.755
and your friends got here.

00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:22.491
The walls were
only ever intended

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:25.564
to surround the Seireitei
during emergencies.

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.637
Why is it then, they're
still down here,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.409
instead of where they
should be up in the sky,

00:09:31.442 --> 00:09:33.446
protecting the Royal Palace?

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:34.448
(Ichigo gasping)

00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:35.483
Look, here they are.

00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:36.720
(Ichigo gasping)

00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:41.563
(ground rumbling)

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:46.138
What is that?

00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:47.474
Tenchuren.

00:09:47.508 --> 00:09:50.246
Squad Zero uses it
to get around in.

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.354
It has plenty of room
for five squad members.

00:09:54.388 --> 00:09:55.356
[Ichigo] What?

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.492
There's only five?

00:09:56.526 --> 00:09:58.797
[Shunsui] It's a squad
of captains only.

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:01.135
-Five of 'em.
-(door rumbling)

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:04.809
But the combined
power of those five

00:10:04.843 --> 00:10:09.519
is greater than that of all the
Thirteen Court Guard Squads.

00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:12.592
(uplifting music)

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.989
(ground rumbling)

00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.160
(flag flying)

00:10:30.193 --> 00:10:33.734
(dramatic music)

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:36.105
Hell, yeah, that's right!

00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:40.146
We're here, drink it
in, we are finally here!

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.654
The one and only Squad
Zero is in the house!

00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:45.958
Long time no see, you rookies!

00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:47.562
How've you been keeping
yourselves, huh?

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:48.730
Have you been eating right,

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:50.433
-getting enough sleep,
-I can't say these guys

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:52.470
are exactly what I
pictured they'd be.

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:53.339
-(hand thudding)
-(Shinji yelling)

00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:55.009
What the hell was that for?

00:10:55.043 --> 00:10:57.815
It's been a while,
hasn't it, Shinji?

00:10:57.849 --> 00:11:00.353
Hiyori isn't with you
today? How rare!

00:11:00.386 --> 00:11:01.355
It's been a while?

00:11:01.388 --> 00:11:03.159
I don't even know you.

00:11:03.192 --> 00:11:04.228
Wait.

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.496
Hiyori?

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:07.334
Have you forgotten who I am?

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:08.302
It's me, Kirio!

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:09.304
Remember?

00:11:09.338 --> 00:11:11.008
M-Miss Kirio?

00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:13.379
Whoa, you've, you've changed.

00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:14.782
You look completely different!

00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:17.387
Oh, Shinji, stop your teasing!

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.157
I haven't changed all that much.

00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:22.097
-(stomach growling)
-Oh, I am starving!

00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:29.311
(chuckles) I bet you're happy
to see me again, Unohana.

00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:30.280
Are ya?

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:32.183
So anyway, I'm curious,
have you been putting

00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:35.156
all those healing techniques
I taught you to good use?

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:36.425
Yes, of course

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:37.728
Ya sure about that?

00:11:37.762 --> 00:11:40.066
'Cause from what I heard,
you guys ended up having

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:42.370
to bury a lot of
your squad members.

00:11:42.404 --> 00:11:45.210
How do you explain that, hm?

00:11:45.243 --> 00:11:46.412
(Retsu sighing)

00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:47.682
Enough of that!

00:11:47.715 --> 00:11:50.220
I know you wanna kiss
and catch up, but save it

00:11:50.253 --> 00:11:52.725
'cause we've got
bigger fish to fry!

00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:54.228
(Tenjiro groaning)

00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:57.668
Well, I see no one in Squad
Zero's changed very much,

00:11:57.702 --> 00:11:59.204
have they, Osho?

00:11:59.238 --> 00:12:03.814
So, what's made you decide to
bless us with your presence?

00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:05.884
Hmm.

00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:08.924
So this is Ichigo Kurosaki, huh?

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:11.863
The Soul King ordered us to come

00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:16.438
and start rebuilding the
Thirteen Court Guard squads.

00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:18.744
And the first order of business

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:21.850
is to take Ichigo
back with us.

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:23.419
You gotta be kidding!

00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:25.524
The great Squad Zero, huh?

00:12:25.557 --> 00:12:27.027
Cooling your heels up in the sky

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.364
while the Seireitei
was being destroyed!

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:31.770
And now you think you can
just come floating down here

00:12:31.803 --> 00:12:32.772
and pick up the pieces?

00:12:32.805 --> 00:12:35.276
What is this, some kind of joke?

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:39.051
[Ichibe] Right, well,
anyway, as I was saying,

00:12:39.084 --> 00:12:40.286
-our orders are to-
-Hey.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.422
Shut up, will ya?

00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:44.127
What kind of move was that?

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:47.434
The only joke
around here is you.

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:49.706
The Thirteen Court Guard Squads.

00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:52.377
Remind me what your job even is.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.383
I know our job's to
protect the Royal Palace.

00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:58.624
I always thought your job
was to protect the Seireitei.

00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:01.596
What kind of Court Guard
goes crying for help

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.602
after failing at the
one job they've got?

00:13:04.636 --> 00:13:06.438
You're not even
worthy of the name.

00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:08.777
-(fist thudding)
-(Tenjiro yelling)

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.346
Hey, watch the hair!

00:13:10.814 --> 00:13:11.883
(Tenjiro thudding)

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.154
I told you to save
all that for later.

00:13:14.187 --> 00:13:17.528
Let's just finish gathering
up what we came here to get.

00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:18.664
[Senjumaru] No need.

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:19.666
Hmm?

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:21.101
I took care of it.

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:23.640
Everything else on the list
of things we were sent to get

00:13:23.674 --> 00:13:25.476
is right here.

00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:28.316
-(dramatic music)
-(all gasping)

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:31.221
That means the only
one remaining is you.

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:35.631
Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:13:35.664 --> 00:13:37.267
Not possible.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.139
The three people you're
holding in those spheres

00:13:40.173 --> 00:13:42.110
are in absolutely no condition

00:13:42.143 --> 00:13:44.147
to leave the
Seireitei right now.

00:13:44.181 --> 00:13:47.053
I cannot allow you to
take them with you.

00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:48.089
Hmm.

00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:51.028
Their condition is the reason
we're taking them with us.

00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:52.263
in the first place.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.336
Hey, you know as well as anyone,

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.273
you haven't got
the healing chops

00:13:57.307 --> 00:13:59.512
to make those three
rookies well again.

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:04.589
You know it's true,
don't you, Retsu?

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:07.695
Besides, you have more
important things than healing

00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:09.398
to be focused on right now.

00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:15.878
So I see you broke into my lab.

00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:17.681
You haven't changed.

00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:20.486
You're just as
disrespectful as ever.

00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:24.529
Well, well, if it isn't
my dear old friend Mayuri.

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:26.065
It's a bit of an exaggeration

00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:28.202
to say that I broke
into your lab.

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:30.641
The fact is, I was
able to walk right in.

00:14:30.674 --> 00:14:33.513
I barely even had
to touch the door.

00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:35.016
Really.

00:14:35.049 --> 00:14:37.688
It seems to me that security
has gotten a lot shabbier

00:14:37.722 --> 00:14:39.391
since I was around.

00:14:39.424 --> 00:14:40.193
(Mayuri scoffing)

00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:41.996
Wait. Back up just a minute!

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.602
Did you guys say you
wanted to take me too?

00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:46.205
My wounds are nothing!

00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:48.610
I'll recover just fine
here in the Seireitei.

00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:49.579
Hmm.

00:14:49.612 --> 00:14:51.248
Yes, we know.

00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:55.289
But we'll be taking you for
an entirely different reason.

00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:56.559
And that is?

00:14:56.593 --> 00:14:58.429
[Kisuke] Hello there, everybody!

00:14:58.462 --> 00:15:00.901
Hey, sorry I didn't
get in touch sooner.

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.905
I bet you were worried
about me, weren't you?

00:15:02.938 --> 00:15:06.546
Well, as you can see,
I'm fit as a fiddle!

00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:07.681
Hello?

00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:10.253
Wow, I was expecting a
little bit more of a welcome.

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:11.689
-I mean-
-What's going on?

00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:13.192
Why did my head crack open?

00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:15.096
I've got light coming
out of my brain!

00:15:15.129 --> 00:15:16.733
-(Kon screaming)
-Ichigo!

00:15:16.766 --> 00:15:18.937
Oh, thank goodness
you're all right!

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.241
Everything is okay
over there, I hope?

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:22.477
Just fine.

00:15:22.511 --> 00:15:23.479
How 'bout yourself?

00:15:23.513 --> 00:15:24.882
Are you doing all right?

00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:26.953
Yeah, I'm okay, don't worry.

00:15:28.523 --> 00:15:29.592
Ichigo!

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:32.497
Oh man, am I glad you're safe.

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:33.633
Right back at ya.

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:36.238
I even can't begin to tell
ya how worried I've been.

00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:37.741
[Kisuke] Yeah, I know, I know.

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:42.450
I wanted to contact you sooner,
but well a lot's happened.

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:44.321
[Grimmjow] Hey, who are
you talking to in there?

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:46.125
-Oh.
-Uh.

00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:47.795
Wait a second, that
sounds a lot like-

00:15:47.828 --> 00:15:49.599
[Grimmjow] Hey! I
know that voice!

00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:50.801
[Kisuke] Orihime!

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:51.803
Chad, help!

00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:53.105
[Grimmjow] Ichigo, you bastard!

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:54.307
-I know you're in there!
-No, no.

00:15:54.341 --> 00:15:55.611
-He isn't in here, honest.
-Kisuke,

00:15:55.644 --> 00:15:56.613
what the hell's he doing there?

00:15:56.646 --> 00:15:57.615
What's goin' on?

00:15:57.648 --> 00:16:01.088
Anyway, as you can see,
we're all perfectly fine

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:02.490
on this end, Ichigo.

00:16:02.525 --> 00:16:06.165
So you just do what you have
to do, don't worry about us.

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:09.304
It's okay to think about
yourself for a change.

00:16:09.337 --> 00:16:12.611
Go wherever your heart
tells you you should go.

00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:15.082
(Grimmjow yelling)

00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:18.088
Oh, and by the way, don't
give him a second thought.

00:16:18.122 --> 00:16:20.761
We've kind of come
to an arrangement.

00:16:20.794 --> 00:16:22.565
Well, see ya later!

00:16:25.537 --> 00:16:28.543
[Chad] Was it smart,
telling him that?

00:16:28.577 --> 00:16:29.712
Telling him what?

00:16:32.818 --> 00:16:34.287
Aah, I'm not worried about it,

00:16:34.321 --> 00:16:36.526
because if Ichigo does what
his heart tells him to do

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:39.164
and nothing else I've
got a pretty good feeling

00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:40.834
that the world and
all of us in it

00:16:40.868 --> 00:16:42.771
will be a lot better
off because of it.

00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:47.013
I mean, come on, you two should
know that better than I do.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:53.994
And believe me, the guy who
knows that better than anyone

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:56.031
is Ichigo himself.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.737
[Ichigo] Hey, Baldy.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.974
Are you talking to me?

00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:03.379
[Ichigo] If I go to this
Royal Palace with you,

00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:06.051
will I be able to fix
my Tensa Zangetsu?

00:17:06.084 --> 00:17:07.721
Nope, that's impossible.

00:17:07.755 --> 00:17:10.493
Your sword can't be fixed.

00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:13.499
However, if you were to
come to the Royal Palace,

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.236
we could re-forge
it into something

00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:17.575
resembling your original sword.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:22.585
-Fine.
-Hm?

00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:25.524
Let's go, then.

00:17:25.557 --> 00:17:27.126
The Royal Palace it is.

00:17:27.928 --> 00:17:29.532
All right.

00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:31.703
Stand by for launch!

00:17:31.736 --> 00:17:32.738
Huh?

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.744
And lift off!

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.656
[Ichigo] Aren't there any
seat belts on this thing?

00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:44.361
[Ganju] There he goes.

00:17:44.394 --> 00:17:47.801
Are you sure it was the
right thing to do, Sis?

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:48.870
Yeah.

00:17:48.904 --> 00:17:51.008
If he doesn't go
now, the Soul Society

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:53.747
is doomed when the
next invasion comes.

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:57.120
It's not like we had a choice.

00:17:58.222 --> 00:18:00.894
We had to let him go
even if that means

00:18:00.928 --> 00:18:02.665
making our Uncle sad.

00:18:05.303 --> 00:18:08.643
Right, everyone back to
Kukaku's Great Training Hall,

00:18:08.677 --> 00:18:09.612
on the double!

00:18:09.645 --> 00:18:11.582
My brother's not going
to train himself.

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:13.954
Don't forget who took
you in off the streets

00:18:13.987 --> 00:18:15.924
of the Rukon District.

00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:19.064
[Kugo] I hate the way she
keeps reminding us of that.

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.433
[Giriko] You and me both.

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:23.105
[Kukaku] Time for you
to step up, Ganju.

00:18:23.138 --> 00:18:24.709
You can complain all you want,

00:18:24.742 --> 00:18:27.180
but I'm throwing you
into the next battle.

00:18:28.082 --> 00:18:29.284
Got it.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.960
(ground rumbling)

00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:36.164
[Ichibe] You can
get out now, Ichigo!

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:39.104
We're here!

00:18:39.137 --> 00:18:41.208
The Royal Palace!

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.825
(gentle music)

00:18:50.727 --> 00:18:51.929
So this is it.

00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:52.931
That's right!

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.034
You're lucky.

00:18:54.067 --> 00:18:55.771
You might not be
aware of this, my boy,

00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:59.612
but Soul Reapers aren't
ordinarily allowed up here.

00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:03.485
But then, there's nothing
really ordinary about you,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.421
is there?

00:19:04.454 --> 00:19:06.458
So this is the place Aizen

00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:08.563
so desperately
wanted to come to.

00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:11.101
Hey, wait a minute!

00:19:11.134 --> 00:19:12.370
Am I missing something?

00:19:12.403 --> 00:19:14.007
I thought you couldn't
get into the Royal Palace

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.644
without the Ouken!

00:19:15.677 --> 00:19:17.715
(chuckles) It's here.

00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:20.119
Our bones are the Ouken.

00:19:20.152 --> 00:19:22.457
That's right, they were
transformed by the power

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.862
of the Soul King when
we were selected by him

00:19:24.895 --> 00:19:26.933
to join Squad Zero.

00:19:26.966 --> 00:19:30.106
You see, there are only
two ways to gain entrance

00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:31.509
to the Royal Palace.

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:35.249
Either we choose to allow you
in or you come in with us.

00:19:36.485 --> 00:19:39.992
Sosuke Aizen was trying
to make an imitation Ouken

00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:40.994
of his own.

00:19:41.028 --> 00:19:42.363
In other words, he was trying

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:46.506
to use his own spiritual
powers to create clones of us.

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:49.645
He wanted to make
himself into a new god.

00:19:49.678 --> 00:19:53.385
By killing the king, as
well as millions of others.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.226
Sosuke Aizen.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.899
He truly is evil personified.

00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:03.873
But know this, Ichigo Kurosaki,

00:20:05.076 --> 00:20:07.313
the Quincies you are now facing

00:20:07.346 --> 00:20:10.687
are an even greater
and more terrible evil.

00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:13.760
(Ichigo grunting)

00:20:13.793 --> 00:20:15.329
All right, ready?

00:20:15.362 --> 00:20:16.999
I'm gonna blast you off now!

00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:18.335
Stand right there!

00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:20.874
Don't move, or you'll die!

00:20:20.907 --> 00:20:23.045
Okay, here goes.

00:20:23.078 --> 00:20:24.782
Wait, hold on a second!

00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:25.717
What is it?

00:20:25.751 --> 00:20:27.086
I don't even know where
the hell I'm headed!

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.023
Am I going to meet
the Soul King?

00:20:29.057 --> 00:20:30.092
Huh?

00:20:30.126 --> 00:20:31.562
Come on, you're not
serious, are ya?

00:20:31.596 --> 00:20:34.067
There's no way a punk
like you is ever gonna

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.102
meet the Soul King.

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:36.204
-What did I say
-Try explaining it

00:20:36.238 --> 00:20:37.473
-about the hair?
-to him properly!

00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:39.377
Now listen closely.

00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:41.582
Right now, we're at
the main entrance.

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:45.524
Over there is the main shrine,
the Reio Greater Palace.

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:47.728
That's where the
Soul King resides.

00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:51.101
And those five disc-like
structures floating around it

00:20:51.134 --> 00:20:53.272
are the Squad Zero Riden.

00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:55.777
Those are our castles.

00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:56.612
You got that?

00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:58.449
You see, there's five of 'em.

00:20:58.482 --> 00:21:01.054
But forget the other
four, it's my Kirinden

00:21:01.087 --> 00:21:02.089
that you're coming to.

00:21:02.123 --> 00:21:04.360
Meaning you and your friends.

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:09.872
(Ichigo sighing)

00:21:09.905 --> 00:21:11.007
[Ichigo] What the hell is this?

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:12.210
[Tenjiro] What's it look like?

00:21:12.243 --> 00:21:14.114
Haven't you ever seen
a hot spring, before?

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.951
[Ichigo] Why are
they underwater?

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:17.386
You're gonna drown them!

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.092
-Look, he's bleeding!
-Calm down.

00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:21.796
I'm soaking them
in the hot spring

00:21:21.829 --> 00:21:24.768
in order to drain out their
damaged Spiritual Pressure

00:21:24.802 --> 00:21:26.104
along with their blood.

00:21:26.138 --> 00:21:27.741
Damaged Spiritual Pressure?

00:21:27.774 --> 00:21:30.947
You see that boiling,
red-hot spring over there?

00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:33.485
[Ichigo] (gasps)
Blood Pond Hell?

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.790
[Tenjiro] Right,
Blood Pond Hell.

00:21:35.824 --> 00:21:40.466
So we're gonna take Byakuya
here, who's all drained out

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:42.136
and toss him in there!

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.105
Hey, what are you doing?

00:21:43.138 --> 00:21:44.575
You're gonna kill the guy.

00:21:44.608 --> 00:21:47.113
Would you please
calm the hell down?

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:49.284
I draw out their blood
in White Bone Hell

00:21:49.317 --> 00:21:52.089
and replenish it
in Blood Pond Hell.

00:21:52.123 --> 00:21:54.327
Repeat the process a few times

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.464
and eventually, every
drop of bad blood

00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:57.768
and Spiritual Pressure
in their bodies

00:21:57.801 --> 00:22:01.007
will be swapped out for
pure, hot, healthy water.

00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:03.045
That's the way I heal 'em.

00:22:03.078 --> 00:22:04.515
I find it a little
hard to believe

00:22:04.548 --> 00:22:05.517
that this thing is gonna-

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.153
Just shut up and start soaking.

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:09.057
For the kind of
injuries you have,

00:22:10.226 --> 00:22:11.696
one night should do it.

00:22:11.729 --> 00:22:15.002
That's all it'll take to make
you twice as good as new.

00:22:15.035 --> 00:22:16.338
(dramatic music)

00:22:19.077 --> 00:22:24.153
("Saihate" by SennaRin)

00:22:24.187 --> 00:22:28.963
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:54.167
[Ichibe] Hmm?

00:23:58.308 --> 00:24:02.951
Ah, so you're awake, Soul King.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.626
(mystical music)

00:24:11.034 --> 00:24:16.612
[Kenpachi] Neither form nor
soul will escape my blade.

00:24:16.646 --> 00:24:19.150
Nothing except you.
