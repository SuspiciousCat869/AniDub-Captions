WEBVTT

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.014
(Ludaas panting)

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:17.684
Now, there's no need to
push yourself, Ludaas.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.119
I'm sure it must be difficult

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.688
to pick yourself
up with that wound.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.123
Therefore, I will permit you

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:26.293
to remain prostrated
in my presence.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.996
[Ludaas] Your majesty
is too kind...

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.032
However, if you're just
going to lie there,

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:35.335
I suppose you don't
need your legs.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.641
Surely you jest, sire!

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:42.176
The idea that I would,

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.845
speak to your majesty
while lying down!

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.447
I, Ludaas Friegen,
would rather die

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:50.817
than be guilty of showing my
sovereign such disrespect!

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.554
(tense music)

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.658
[Yhwach] I see.

00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:01.762
Very well then, you may
proceed with your report.

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:07.734
("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:27.187
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:37.090
-("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.871
He's been gone for a long time.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.372
Who are you talking about?

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:53.841
[Ryunosuke] What do you mean,
"who are you talking about?"

00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:55.709
I'm talking about Ichigo!

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:58.512
Shouldn't we be trying
to find him and help him?

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.546
There's no need.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.482
The enemy's Spiritual
Pressure is long gone

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.885
Besides, I can't imagine
Ichigo needing any help

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.887
against an opponent like that.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.423
We'd just be wasting our
time going after him.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:10.924
Are you sure?

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:11.892
'Cause I'm not.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.560
(Orihime chuckles)

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:16.396
What's so amusing?

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:19.433
Oh, nothing.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:23.136
It's just that you pretend
you don't care about Ichigo,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.641
but I know that you and he
have become such good friends.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:30.677
I, I have no idea what
you're talking about!

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:31.912
Are you teasing me, or what?

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:33.313
[Ichigo] I'm back.

00:03:33.347 --> 00:03:35.849
[Orihime] (chuckles)
Welcome back, Ichigo!

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:36.984
You didn't get hurt, did you?

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:39.586
Nah, I'm all good, no worries.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.888
-(phone ringing)
-Huh?

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:41.889
Oh, uh!

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:43.757
Sorry, that's my Soul Phone.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:46.760
Hello? This is Yuki-

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.863
What is it?

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.231
[Ryunosuke] It's, um,

00:03:51.265 --> 00:03:54.034
they're saying it's a
message for all squads.

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.639
The following is a brief summary
of the current situation.

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:01.708
I'm only going to say this
once, so listen carefully.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.712
57 minutes ago, seven
unidentified intruders

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:07.481
invaded the Squad 1 office.

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:09.483
Five minutes later,
they retreated.

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:13.520
One squad member was killed,
but the Head Captain is safe.

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:15.022
At roughly the same time,

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:16.990
another intruder showed
up near the Kokuryo Gate,

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:19.059
where Squad 1 was
standing guard.

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:22.229
All 116 squad
members were killed

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.132
in the approximately
three-minute battle that ensued.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.703
Lieutenant Sasakibe
was seriously wounded,

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.739
and died in the Squad 1
office shortly thereafter.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.374
(all gasping)

00:04:34.408 --> 00:04:35.175
No way!

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:37.010
But Lieutenant Sasakibe was

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:40.147
one of the longest serving
officers we've ever had!

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.883
How could such a man
be killed in battle?

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:45.018
[Akon] Lastly, we've
been unable to determine

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:48.222
what entry and exit
routes the intruders used.

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.023
However, the Soul
Shield Membrane

00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:51.225
surrounding the Seireitei

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.994
doesn't appear to
have been disturbed.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.495
So we think they must possess

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.764
some kind of method
of transportation

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.233
that can bypass it.

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:07.541
(somber music)

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.400
(Ichigo sighs)

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:36.970
I can't take this,
I need to patrol.

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:48.115
[Nel] Ichigo!

00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:52.553
(Nel crying)

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:53.687
Nel?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.522
[Nel] Charge!

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:58.091
(Ichigo thuds)

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:01.495
Damn it, Nel...

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.198
This is how you say hello to
me again, after all this time?

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:09.570
-Huh?
-Ichigo, it was horrible!

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:11.672
You've got to help us, Ichigo...

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.941
It's Hueco Mundo,

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:16.076
Hueco Mundo is...

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:18.912
In five days?

00:06:18.946 --> 00:06:20.113
[Ludaas] Yes, Your Majesty.

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:22.683
I am confident that will
be more than enough time

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.917
for us and the Soul Society

00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:25.419
to prepare for
the coming battle.

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:26.987
Another prediction.

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.223
Two days ago,

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:31.658
when you went out to scout
the border intensity level,

00:06:31.692 --> 00:06:35.562
you predicted if we let things
continue to progress as is

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:38.165
the Soul Society and
the World of the Living

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:42.035
would soon collapse, due
to an imbalance of souls.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.537
Isn't that right?

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:47.374
So then, Ludaas Friegen,

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:52.513
am I to take it that you stand
before me now as a prophet?

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:54.715
I, I don't, uh...

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.416
What's the problem?

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.018
Answer me.

00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:00.988
I want to know, are you
a prophet or are you not?

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:03.690
Uh, no, I'm not.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:05.325
Then why do you keep predicting

00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:08.028
what will happen in the future?

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:11.932
It's the present I'm
interested in, not the future.

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:14.535
(blood spattering)

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:15.536
Ebern...

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.004
Yes, here!

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:18.872
[Yhwach] Your performance
has been worthy

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:21.909
of neither praise
nor punishment.

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:23.577
Though you did at least manage

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.513
to keep Ichigo Kurosaki at bay.

00:07:26.547 --> 00:07:27.581
Yes! Yes!

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.149
You're right, I did!

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.985
[Yhwach] Your work is done.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.855
You will now become the
first foundation stone

00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:36.890
of the bridge to peace.

00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:39.860
(blood spattering)

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.762
[Quincy] Is that wise?

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.230
Is what wise?

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.899
[Quincy] I thought Arrancar
soldiers were valuable assets

00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:48.869
because they didn't
require combat training.

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:51.004
It matters not.

00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:54.441
We can always find
ourselves another Arrancar.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:04.017
After all, don't forget,
Hueco Mundo's my domain now.

00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:06.653
Yet another of the
many foundation stones

00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:10.991
building towards the
invasion of the Soul Society.

00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:12.693
Hueco Mundo?

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:13.927
-(Nel sobbing)
-Stop crying, Nel!

00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:16.129
What do you mean, Hueco
Mundo was attacked?

00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:18.165
Who attacked it?

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:22.169
-(Ichigo shouting)
-[Pesche] Charge!

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:23.837
(coughing) I hid my presence

00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:25.806
until the very last
moment before striking!

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:26.974
The fact that you
could dodge that

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.209
is very impressive,
Ichigo Kurosaki!

00:08:29.243 --> 00:08:31.678
Oh, but you probably can't
tell who this is, can you?

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:35.516
I shall reveal myself to
you, I am none other than-

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.385
-Pesche, right?
-Ow!

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:41.221
(drums thudding)

00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:21.762
[Yamamoto] Light the fire.

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:25.866
(Yuzu humming)

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.202
Sorry to call you
over so early, guys.

00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:31.305
[Chad] Sounds like that's
the least of our problems.

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:34.908
Is this really true,
about Hueco Mundo?

00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:36.310
[Pesche] Yes, it's true.

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:39.313
After the deaths of Lord
Barragan and Lord Stark,

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:42.049
Lady Halibel restored
order to Hueco Mundo

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.017
as its acting ruler.

00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:46.053
But even she was powerless.

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:53.126
-(dramatic music)
-(lightning crackling)

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:57.731
(wind howling)

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:01.068
(footsteps thudding)

00:10:02.903 --> 00:10:04.338
(Halibel panting)

00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:06.006
(Halibel grunts)

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:07.274
(Nel sobbing)

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:17.217
(lightning crackling)

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.731
[Halibel] Run.

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:33.300
Go!

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.608
[Pesche] (grunts) Let's go!

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:45.412
(suspenseful music)

00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:55.222
Lady Halibel!

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.427
They took Lady Halibel.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.029
We don't know why...

00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:05.165
[Nel] I can't believe
they got her! (sobs)

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:08.035
You don't know who they were
or what they were after?

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:09.636
[Pesche] We have no idea...

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.073
But we do know that they
took several Arrancars, too.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:17.010
And then, while we
were trying to escape,

00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:20.380
they cornered us and
nabbed Dondochakka!

00:11:20.414 --> 00:11:21.381
(Pesche grunts)

00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:22.416
(gasp)

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.219
Ichigo Kurosaki...

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:28.121
Please help us, I beg you!

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:31.592
Ichigo?

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:33.760
You really have to ask?

00:11:33.794 --> 00:11:35.095
We're going, right?

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:37.331
After all we just heard,

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.933
you can't expect me to
turn my back on them.

00:11:39.967 --> 00:11:42.703
[Pesche] Thank you,
Ichigo Kurosaki!

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:44.671
Ichigo!

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:48.609
Sorry, but, I won't be
accompanying you on this one.

00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:50.544
What, why not?

00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:53.313
Well, because I'm a Quincy.

00:11:53.347 --> 00:11:56.383
I can't be helping
Hollows or Arrancars.

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:58.385
I know.

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:03.223
After all, Quincies exist to
destroy Hollows, don't they?

00:12:03.257 --> 00:12:06.493
It's okay, I figured you'd
take a pass on this one.

00:12:06.527 --> 00:12:09.763
I had to offer you the option,
or else you'd get all sulky.

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:11.865
I know how you operate.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.634
-Ichigo
-Yeah?

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:16.003
Be careful.

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:17.471
Don't you worry.

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:20.841
Even without you, I'm
sure we'll manage somehow.

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:23.210
-Listen, this enemy-
-My, my,

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:27.014
this is quite an intriguing
conversation you're having.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.216
Hueco Mundo, huh?

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.251
You need me to arrange a trip?

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:33.620
Hmm?

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.370
Your majesty...

00:12:50.404 --> 00:12:53.140
This medallion that
we gave to Ebern,

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:55.843
there are signs it's been used.

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:56.977
However...

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.212
(Ywach chuckles)

00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:01.882
How did you happen
to be at my place

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:03.684
at just the right time?

00:13:03.717 --> 00:13:04.785
Didn't you know?

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:06.186
I'm always hanging
around your place...

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.021
Just sitting there
outside your window,

00:13:08.055 --> 00:13:09.890
waiting to hear
something interesting.

00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:11.058
(Kisuke chuckles)

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:13.560
But all joking aside,
it's hard not to notice

00:13:13.594 --> 00:13:16.597
two Arrancars coming
down from Hueco Mundo.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.664
Plus, your battle earlier,

00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:20.567
and all the unusual activity
in the Soul Society,

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:23.237
gave me plenty of reasons
to be on my guard.

00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:27.975
I am assuming that
you've noticed it too?

00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:29.877
You get the feeling

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.378
that everything that's
happening right now

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:34.047
is somehow all
interconnect-ed, right?

00:13:34.081 --> 00:13:37.050
Like I said, it's
no joking matter.

00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:40.721
All right, this is our exit.

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:43.757
Come on, come on!

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.058
We don't have all day!

00:13:45.092 --> 00:13:46.293
Get a move on!

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:55.035
Why are we up in the air,
with the enemy right below us?

00:13:55.068 --> 00:13:56.370
Things never go smoothly

00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:57.871
when you're traveling
with Kisuke!

00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.840
[Kisuke] Oh, you
know me too well.

00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:01.742
[Nel] We're falling!

00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:03.744
-Hm?
-Is something wrong?

00:14:03.777 --> 00:14:05.045
Nothing.

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:07.915
For a second, I thought I
heard voices back there.

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:09.049
[Quincy] Not likely.

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:10.551
There's no one back
there but the dead,

00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:13.020
and the rest of them
are here with us.

00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:15.022
You're imagining things.

00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:16.056
You're right.

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:23.230
It looks like they're
moving on, we're okay.

00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:26.333
Those captives, you think
Dondochakka was with them?

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.002
[Pesche] No, I don't sense
his Spiritual Pressure.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:30.904
He must be in a different group.

00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:33.473
I see why they didn't
come looking for us.

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:36.210
They didn't think it was
possible anybody could be here,

00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:39.379
because every Hollow and
Arrancar they left behind

00:14:39.413 --> 00:14:40.414
is dead.

00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:44.751
(tense music)

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:52.693
You don't need to see this, Nel.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.528
What a horrible sight.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.929
It's no good.

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:58.899
I'm not seeing any
signs of life anywhere.

00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:00.334
[Pesche] There wouldn't be,

00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:02.569
because that's how they operate.

00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:04.004
See that?

00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:07.040
That flame is from the
condensed Reishi they use.

00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:09.343
Things that normally
wouldn't burn,

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:14.047
even the rocks and sand of
Hueco Mundo, are consumed by it.

00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:18.018
These were people with powers
we'd never seen before.

00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:20.921
We had no means
of fighting back.

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:23.023
We had no choice but to run.

00:15:23.056 --> 00:15:25.325
What about the ones
they took away?

00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:27.027
[Pesche] They'll probably
be forced to serve

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.495
in their army.

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:31.398
At worst, they'll end
up like the guys here...

00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:33.700
[Ichigo] Okay, then.

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:34.902
Let's go after 'em.

00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:36.136
[Pesche] What, whoa, whoa!

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.006
I told you, Dondochakka
wasn't in that group!

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:40.407
Yeah, so what?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.644
We're gonna save Dondochakka
anyway, so why not try and save

00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:46.046
a few other Arrancars
while we're doing it?

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:49.016
[Pesche] Well, when
you put it that way...

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:49.883
Ah, wait, wait!

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:51.051
Hold on!

00:15:51.084 --> 00:15:52.286
Incredible.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.322
I mean, it's kind of ironic
when you think about it.

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:57.057
Those Arrancars he wants to save

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.561
were his worst enemies not
long ago, weren't they?

00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:01.862
[Pesche] That's so true!

00:16:01.895 --> 00:16:03.497
What did you expect?

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.567
He's not the type of guy
to sit back and do nothing.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.370
But you knew all along
he'd react the way he did.

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:13.073
That's why you came to
him for help, isn't it?

00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:16.043
We should go with him, Chad!

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:17.277
[Chad] Yeah.

00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:23.851
[Pesche] And, and
we're going, too!

00:16:23.884 --> 00:16:25.085
Right.

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:27.054
[Quincy] Straighten
up this line!

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:28.989
[Quincy] Stand with your
backs against the wall!

00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:30.557
[Quincy] Come on, hurry up!

00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:34.528
You know, we don't mind punching
a few more holes in you!

00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:36.230
(tense music)

00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:38.899
[Loly] The one in the
chair must be their leader.

00:16:38.932 --> 00:16:41.034
Hey, are you sure about this?

00:16:41.068 --> 00:16:42.336
Maybe we should
think about it...

00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:44.872
[Loly] If we don't do
something, we're going to die!

00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:46.540
Think about that!

00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:48.542
Attention! Attention!

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:49.910
Quiet, please!

00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:51.979
Now, will you live
or will you die?

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.146
To determine that,

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.982
we will be selecting
Hollows and Arrancars

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.150
by means of a
little competition!

00:16:57.784 --> 00:16:59.686
The rules are as follows!

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.823
Moving from right to left I
will begin stabbing everyone.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.525
So if anyone is
saying to themselves,

00:17:04.558 --> 00:17:06.159
"No! I don't want to die!"

00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:07.861
Or even better, if
you're thinking,

00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:09.429
"Please, let me join you!

00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:11.031
Let me serve you!"

00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:12.399
Then get down on your knees

00:17:12.432 --> 00:17:15.869
as if you were licking our
boots, and beg for mercy!

00:17:15.903 --> 00:17:18.372
You here are already
a select group,

00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:21.675
the chosen few who had the
luck, wits, or strength

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.677
to survive our earlier attack!

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.981
Last chance, now, don't
squander this opportunity.

00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:29.149
So if I say I'll join you,

00:17:29.183 --> 00:17:31.084
that means you'll
spare my life then-

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:32.219
No!

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:34.221
Of course not, don't be silly!

00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:35.889
First you apply to join us,

00:17:35.923 --> 00:17:38.559
then you have to take
an entrance exam!

00:17:38.592 --> 00:17:41.195
That's the whole point of
this selection process,

00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:43.330
to decide who gets
to take the exam!

00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:45.933
Anyone else who wants
to try bending the rules

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:46.934
will end up like this!

00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:47.901
(Arrancar grunts)

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:49.670
-And this!
-(Arrancar grunts)

00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:50.938
-And this!
-(Arrancar grunts)

00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:53.173
So, uh, you think the
captain's really planning

00:17:53.207 --> 00:17:54.975
on bringing any of them back?

00:17:55.008 --> 00:17:56.543
Well obviously not.

00:17:56.577 --> 00:18:00.013
I don't think he gives a
damn about Hueco Mundo.

00:18:00.047 --> 00:18:01.381
Do I make myself clear?

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:06.053
-(chains clattering)
-(blade clanks)

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.855
-Captain!
-Sir!

00:18:07.888 --> 00:18:09.223
Unacceptable.

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:11.859
You both were slow on
your response time.

00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:13.560
Now, that's interesting.

00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:16.997
I thought we'd confiscated
all their weapons.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.065
[Loly] Think again!

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.901
Lord Aizen's aide,
Loly Aiverrne!

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.870
And I am Menoly Mallia!

00:18:22.903 --> 00:18:24.204
[Loly] Did you think
we could be defeated

00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:26.039
by an underling like you?

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:29.510
(Menoly gasps)

00:18:29.543 --> 00:18:32.145
(blow thuds)

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:34.348
[Quilge] Do it.

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.148
-Sir!
-Sir!

00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:36.917
You mean kill them?

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.218
No, no.

00:18:38.252 --> 00:18:39.920
His Majesty ordered us

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.889
to bring him any idiots
we found with guts.

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:43.690
Those two pass the test.

00:18:43.724 --> 00:18:47.060
Punish them, but be
careful not to kill them.

00:18:47.094 --> 00:18:49.162
Aizen's aides, eh?

00:18:49.196 --> 00:18:52.900
That right there proves
Aizen wasn't that great.

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:54.868
I hardly broke a
sweat on those two.

00:18:54.902 --> 00:18:57.204
But then, even Tier Halibel,

00:18:57.237 --> 00:19:00.007
who ruled Hueco Mundo
after the late Aizen,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.909
even she, with all her strength,

00:19:01.942 --> 00:19:03.877
was no match for his majesty,

00:19:03.911 --> 00:19:06.380
so I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

00:19:06.413 --> 00:19:08.182
(Quincy grunts)

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:10.050
Hey, I told you to
be careful not to-

00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:15.022
-(blades slashing)
-(blood spattering)

00:19:15.055 --> 00:19:17.424
May I ask who you people are?

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:19.459
Huh?

00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:22.863
You've got the nerve to talk
trash about Master Halibel,

00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:25.065
and yet you have
no idea who we are?

00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:28.168
I guess it's true that
underlings really are clueless.

00:19:28.202 --> 00:19:29.536
[Cyan] From what we understand,

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.672
it seems you came and
took Master Halibel

00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:33.006
while we were away.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.909
Just 'cause you beat those
so-called aides to Aizen,

00:19:35.943 --> 00:19:37.678
don't get too cocky.

00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:40.113
(rock music)

00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:43.717
(Quilge chuckles)

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.022
(loud thudding)

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:50.190
[Ichigo] What's that?

00:19:50.224 --> 00:19:52.392
Has the fight already
started over there?

00:19:52.426 --> 00:19:54.862
Those Spiritual Pressures
belong to the Tres Bestia!

00:19:54.895 --> 00:19:56.163
Hey, what the hell?

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.065
The three of them work
directly under Lady Halibel

00:19:58.098 --> 00:19:59.733
and they're super
strong and super scary,

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:01.335
and they're always trying
to bump one another off

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.836
like a bunch of
cannibalistic beasts,

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.872
so when I say
scary, I mean scary,

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:06.206
and really the only good thing

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.708
about those three insanely
scary monsters showing up,

00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:10.143
is that now the enemy army
is as good as destroyed!

00:20:10.177 --> 00:20:11.879
Ah, stop it, you idiot,

00:20:11.912 --> 00:20:14.581
I can't see where
the hell I'm going!

00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:15.983
(Emilou sneezes)

00:20:16.016 --> 00:20:17.918
(Quincy grunts)

00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:19.653
(explosion booms)

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:22.856
Hey, Mila Rose, were you
talking behind my back?

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.491
No, you idiot!

00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:27.194
And would you please wipe
that snot off your face!

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:29.997
This is very impressive.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.399
[Cyan] You shouldn't
let your guard down.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.035
May I make a suggestion?

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:37.371
Lay down your arms
and surrender.

00:20:38.739 --> 00:20:40.007
You'd like that.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.409
(blow thuds)

00:20:43.944 --> 00:20:45.979
You're not as
strong as you think!

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.650
If you surrender and swear
allegiance to our banner,

00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:53.187
you'll be given the honor
of fighting for His Majesty,

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.223
alongside your
beloved Tier Halibel.

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.592
Believe me, until
you've experienced

00:20:58.625 --> 00:21:00.861
the joy of serving his majesty,

00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:03.764
you'll never know what
true happiness is!

00:21:06.533 --> 00:21:09.736
[Both] Don't underestimate
us, you four-eyed monkey!

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.004
Oh, my.

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:13.006
That's a definite no, then?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.577
I find that extremely
disappointing.

00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:19.279
[Akon] And that, sir,

00:21:19.313 --> 00:21:22.583
is the full report on the
infiltration by the rebel army.

00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:24.017
[Mayuri] Thank you, Akon.

00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:25.586
You may go.

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:26.620
[Akon] Yes, sir.

00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:33.227
Now then, as to these Ryoka,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.397
whom we are tentatively
referring to as a rebel army,

00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:40.067
they call themselves
the Wandenreich,

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.668
and this invasion of theirs

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:44.771
is clearly connected to the
recent and alarming trend

00:21:44.805 --> 00:21:48.509
of Hollows disappearing from
the World of the Living.

00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:51.144
The loss of such a
large number of Hollows

00:21:51.178 --> 00:21:53.647
has caused a great
imbalance of souls,

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.350
which could ultimately
spell the destruction

00:21:56.383 --> 00:22:00.220
of both the Soul Society
and the World of the Living.

00:22:01.922 --> 00:22:05.559
The power to extinguish souls...

00:22:08.028 --> 00:22:09.930
(Ichigo gasps)

00:22:09.963 --> 00:22:12.933
I'm sure that all of
you astute captains

00:22:12.966 --> 00:22:16.203
have already figured it
out by now, haven't you?

00:22:16.236 --> 00:22:18.438
That this so-called rebel army,

00:22:20.908 --> 00:22:23.610
(dramatic music)

00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:29.283
is in fact an army of Quincies.

00:22:37.024 --> 00:22:42.229
("Saihate" by SennaRin)

00:22:42.262 --> 00:22:47.434
(singing in Japanese)

00:24:10.884 --> 00:24:13.887
[Quilge] "The soldiers
blow their trumpets,

00:24:13.921 --> 00:24:16.790
like stars shooting by the ear.

00:24:16.823 --> 00:24:21.528
The soldiers stomp their feet
like thunder in the air."

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:28.702
