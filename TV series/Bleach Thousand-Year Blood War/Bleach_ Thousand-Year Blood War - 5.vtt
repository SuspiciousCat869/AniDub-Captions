WEBVTT

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.150
Attention, Thirteen
Court Guard Squad!

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:20.120
Help is coming, don't despair!

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.289
Substitute Soul
Reaper, Ichigo Kurosaki

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.024
is on his way here.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.459
(gasping)

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.295
His Bankai, it can't
be stolen from him.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.496
It can't?

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.032
No kidding.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.700
I like the sound of that!

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.135
Ichigo.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.171
Ichigo.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:39.039
That Akon.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:42.009
How dare he summon him
without my permission?

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.346
Once Ichigo gets here,
the tide of battle

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.648
will surely turn in our favor.

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:48.649
[Akon] Hold on.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.450
W-What is it, Third Seat Akon?

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.152
Something's wrong.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:55.489
Ichigo Kurosaki's Spiritual
Pressure in the Garganta.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.125
It's gone.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.459
He's not responding, either.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.496
I need you to find out why.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.532
And, send the Secret Remote
Unit to the Senkaimon exit.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.533
Sir.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.635
(grunts)

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:12.606
Jidanbo?

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.975
What the hell are you doing?

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.746
(distant screaming)

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.749
(chuckling)

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.152
Damn it!

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.486
What the Hell is this thing?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.789
(grunting)

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:32.359
(phone ringing)

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.161
Akon!

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.095
Hey, sorry!

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.030
I've gotten trapped
in some kind of a...

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:42.002
(screaming and crashes)

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.003
What the hell?

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.304
What's going on there, Akon?

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.305
What's happening?

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:46.240
[Hiyosu] Everyone evacuate!

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.041
-[Akon] But Hiyosu!
-[Hiyosu] You too, Akon!

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:49.243
Get out!

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.044
[Rukia] Department of Research
and Development, come in.

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:52.513
What's going on over there?

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:53.347
-(screaming)
-Rukia.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.381
-[Renji] Damn it! All I hear
-Renji

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.750
-are screams and explosions.
-What's happening?

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.419
[Akon] We can't win, there's
no way we can defeat them!

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:04.458
-(distant screaming)
-(somber music)

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.096
(growl)

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:13.800
Everyone, listen to
me. We can't give up.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.769
Stay strong.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.772
Ichigo will come,
I know he will.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.007
(gasps)

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:24.545
(screaming)

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:31.552
("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:49.469
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:55.702 --> 00:04:00.707
-("Scar" by Tatsuya Kitani)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:10.050
(distant thuds)

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.352
Sounds like that fellow's
going on a real rampage

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:13.353
in there.

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.622
But, it won't do him any good.

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:17.491
Because His Majesty
has granted me

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:18.692
the letter "J"!

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.028
Quilge Opie, "The Jail!"

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:23.163
So, rampage all you want.

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:25.732
You will never escape
from that prison.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:28.468
Now, then.

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.773
Before all the power I absorbed
from that monster dissipates.

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:37.010
I suppose I should
eliminate you lot as well.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.047
No, wait!

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.115
(sword slashes)

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:43.116
(choked gargle)

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.151
(gasps)

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:46.787
(body thuds)

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.788
Who...

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.489
Who did that?

00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:51.124
(blade slashes)

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:53.060
[Kisuke] Oh, shit.

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:56.096
(labored breathing)

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:02.135
Damn it, it's no use.

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.639
I can't break free of this
even with the Getsuga-tensho!

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.110
(gasp) Captain!

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.111
Stay back.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.013
I need you to observe the enemy

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:14.281
as we fight.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.184
Try and suss out the
nature of his attack.

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:20.187
If that's the plan, then let
me fight and you observe.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.156
Since my Senbonzakura
has been stolen...

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.459
We can't afford to have
you lose your Bankai

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.627
as well, Renji.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.195
But, Captain...

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:31.632
I'm going to draw
out his abilities.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.034
Just stay there and
keep your eyes open.

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:41.775
Why is that my limbs feel
as if they were freezing up?

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.444
Could it be that
those thorns of light

00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:46.980
are coated in some
kind of poison?

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:50.751
You feel it, don't you?

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:53.287
And, you're wondering
if it's poison.

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:55.055
It isn't.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.023
(gasps)

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:58.292
What you're feeling is
something that you lost

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:02.196
so long ago, you
can't even remember.

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.364
Retrace your memories.

00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:08.268
You became a captain
and you grew strong.

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:11.772
Strong enough to overcome
all your enemies.

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:14.675
No, you haven't
felt this sensation

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:15.609
in a long time.

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:19.179
And yet, it is so
essential to survival.

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:23.050
Do I need to remind
you what it is?

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.485
Fear.

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.289
The Captain afraid?

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:31.091
No way.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:34.061
Those who are
struck by my arrows

00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:38.031
are beset by fear and doubt.

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:40.701
"What will happen if
I reach for my sword?"

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:43.270
"If I draw it from it's sheath?"

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:46.139
"Should I swing it
up, or swing it down?"

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:49.643
"What if I move my
fingers, or shift my gaze?"

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:53.013
"Do I dare breathe in?
Do I dare breathe out?"

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:56.016
"Any choice I make
could prove fatal."

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.420
When every option
seems equally suspect.

00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:04.424
It can drive one mad with
indecision, can't it?

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:05.425
(Byakuya growls)

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:08.161
Thus far, you've been
able to keep yourself

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:12.165
from succumbing to it
by sheer force of will.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.800
Very impressive.

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:15.669
You truly are a threat.

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:17.771
But, only a threat.

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:20.774
Hardly enough to inspire fear.

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.676
You, on the other hand...

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.645
(blade slashes)

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:28.782
Your soul is consumed
by your fear of me.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.350
Ridiculous.

00:07:30.384 --> 00:07:34.655
No battle is ever
fought without fear.

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:38.125
But, I accepted that and
overcame my fear of battle

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:40.794
and by doing so, I
gained the strength

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.663
to keep moving forward.

00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:45.499
And now, I have nothing to fear.

00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:46.533
(crunch)

00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:48.001
(gasp)

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:50.637
(blade slashes)

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.741
Fear can be conquered
with experience.

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:55.642
(coughs)

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:58.145
It's the strongest
and most experienced

00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:01.148
who fall the hardest
for that illusion.

00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:03.150
The fear you mean,

00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:06.486
rational fear, is
easily dealt with.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.057
If you can identify the
cause and remove it.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.459
You remove the fear.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.262
But true fear has no cause.

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.130
It is ever-present.

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:21.468
It has no identifiable
source or measurable limits.

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:24.605
It cannot be controlled,
or suppressed.

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.640
Because it's not an emotion.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.242
It's an instinct

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:30.577
and like an army of insects...

00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:34.615
It crawls over your
body, paralyzing you.

00:08:34.648 --> 00:08:37.518
For no matter how hard we try.

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:41.188
We cannot escape our instincts.

00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:42.689
(shouting)

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:45.492
(blade slashing)

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:48.529
Huh?

00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:49.563
What?

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:53.534
(both gasp)

00:08:54.168 --> 00:08:58.972
(soft music)

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.353
(gasp) My brother?

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.389
(shards shattering)

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.627
(gasps)

00:09:21.328 --> 00:09:26.466
(groaning)

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.102
There is nothing you can do.

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:32.306
We both know you can't
defeat your own Bankai

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:34.441
using just your Shikai.

00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:37.010
(Renji grunts) You
thieving little rat!

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:39.546
You're not worthy of
the captain's Bankai!

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:44.451
Brother!

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:46.620
Is she really going
to turn her back on me

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:48.088
in the middle of a fight?

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.556
That's so insulting.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:54.528
(blood splattering)

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:55.796
(grunting)

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:59.366
(somber music)

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.467
Zabimaru!

00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:07.374
(struggling)

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:16.016
(groaning)

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:20.120
(groans)

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.523
(Byakuya yells)

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:25.092
Stop that.

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:30.464
Stop it or die!

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:32.132
Ban-

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.166
(grunting)

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:36.003
(groaning)

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.176
You fool.

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:45.312
You could have
stolen his Bankai.

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:48.448
Didn't you see he was
about to use it on me?

00:10:48.482 --> 00:10:49.349
He was?

00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:51.151
But, I thought it
was only Soul Reaper

00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:53.020
captains that had Bankai.

00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:54.321
You wouldn't have thought that

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:57.357
if you had bothered to
read His Majesty's Daten.

00:10:57.391 --> 00:10:59.193
(sighs)

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:04.231
(sad music)

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:11.305
[Byakuya] Renji.

00:11:12.372 --> 00:11:13.373
Rukia.

00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:20.981
(sword cracks and breaks)

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:23.450
Forgive me.

00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:26.220
(dramatic music)

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:46.106
(dramatic music)

00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:50.277
(grunts)

00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:51.612
Hmm?

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:57.050
Hey.

00:11:57.084 --> 00:11:59.119
You the guy in charge
of these losers?

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.623
Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:07.761
You were able to kill
three Stern Ritters?

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:12.966
How?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.569
It really wasn't
that complicated.

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:18.605
The first one, the
big guy, was a joke.

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:22.309
His thing was to turn
himself into a giant monkey

00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:24.611
and blast his enemies
with his voice.

00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:25.779
(chuckles)

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:28.415
I split that sucker in two.

00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:32.619
The second guy kept yapping
instead of fighting.

00:12:32.653 --> 00:12:34.755
Really got on my nerves.

00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:39.126
So, I tore his throat out.

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:41.495
The third one was a
little more interesting.

00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:44.131
He transformed himself into me.

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:47.234
I had my hands full at first.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:50.704
'Cause after all, I was
sorta fighting myself.

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:53.540
So, I just became
stronger than my old self.

00:12:53.574 --> 00:12:56.443
After that, it was
a walk in the park.

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:59.780
Now, I understand
why they call you...

00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:00.714
A monster.

00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:04.585
Yeah well, just stand
aside, pretty boy.

00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:06.019
(sword swishes and blood splats)

00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:09.089
You're not the one
I care about.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:12.159
This one here's the
one I came to kill!

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:13.160
Your Majesty!

00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:14.194
(skoffs)

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:16.330
(earth erupting)

00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:22.169
(somber music)

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:26.640
Byakuya.

00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:28.976
Renji.

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:30.711
Rukia.

00:13:37.184 --> 00:13:38.185
Damn it!

00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:41.622
(shouting)

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:45.192
Break, damn you! Break!

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:50.264
I won't let you die.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.166
I won't let any of you die.

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:56.003
I promise you.

00:13:56.803 --> 00:14:00.374
I promise I'll protect you all!

00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:01.542
(alarm blaring)

00:14:01.575 --> 00:14:04.144
We haven't been able to restore
the exit from Hueco Mundo!

00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:05.479
Well, keep trying.

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:06.513
Yes sir!

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:10.017
(grunts)

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:14.087
(laughing)

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:16.590
Man, it must suck to be so weak.

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:19.593
I can't even imagine
how much that must suck.

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:21.795
Tell me, how much does
it suck to be you?

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.463
I really wanna know.

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:29.002
(groans) I'm no match for him.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:31.638
Not that I blame you
for being scared of me.

00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:35.776
'Cause after all, His Majesty
granted me the letter "O."

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:38.111
"O" for "The Overkill."

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:41.048
Doesn't matter if it's friend
or foe, or man or beast.

00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:44.117
The more I kill,
the stronger I get.

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:46.286
I guess I must've killed
at least a hundred

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.222
people already today.

00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:49.356
(groans)

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.259
It was about a hundred the
last time I was here, too.

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:55.662
I remember killing a
lieutenant just like you.

00:14:55.696 --> 00:14:57.664
(gasps)

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.668
So it was you!

00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:04.738
And this is how I did it.

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:07.441
(spear hurling)

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.111
What?

00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:13.013
Wha...?

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.048
Head Captain!

00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:20.754
(laughing)

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:23.090
Is this my lucky day or what?

00:15:23.123 --> 00:15:27.427
Head Captain! Just the one
I came here looking for.

00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:30.297
Now, with your own
lieutenant's Bankai...

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.300
I'm going to put an end to
your long and miserable life.

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:35.469
Bankai!

00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:39.473
(dramatic music)

00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:40.507
(electricity erupts)

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:48.715
(Driscoll chuckling)

00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:53.020
Feel familiar? A real
blast from the past.

00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:54.788
If what I heard's true,
the guy hadn't used

00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:57.491
his Bankai in over
two thousand years.

00:15:57.524 --> 00:16:00.460
But, you get to see it one
more time before you die.

00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:03.030
You really oughta be
thanking me for this.

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:07.000
So, this is Lieutenant
Sasakibe's Bankai?

00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:09.136
I thought Hyorinmaru
was the only Zanpakuto

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:11.138
with the power to
control the weather.

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.340
(yelling)

00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:16.009
(lightning cracks)

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:19.713
[Chojiro] Master Eijisai!

00:16:21.114 --> 00:16:23.050
Pardon me, Master Eijisai.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.787
Back then, I was called Eijisai.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.122
Because of the
scar on my forehead

00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:31.758
shaped like the
Japanese character, "Ei."

00:16:31.792 --> 00:16:34.661
I told you stop calling me that!

00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:36.797
My apologies, forgive me sir.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.100
For some reason, every
time I distinguished myself

00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:42.569
in battle, the name "Eijisai,"
because increasingly

00:16:42.603 --> 00:16:45.072
more famous than my given name.

00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:47.307
I did not like that.

00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:48.442
But, sir.

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:51.078
I am not so brazenly impudent
as to consider myself

00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:53.747
worthy of calling you
by your given name.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.449
What is wrong with you, anyway?

00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:57.251
You're not even
one of my students.

00:16:57.284 --> 00:17:00.120
Yet, day after day, I find
you lurking around here.

00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:02.155
I come here in the hope
that you will allow me

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:03.590
to be your right-hand man.

00:17:03.624 --> 00:17:06.460
Well, you'd have to be a
student of mine to begin with.

00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:08.662
Then, if you rose to
the rank of master.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.731
You might become one
of my right-hand men.

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:13.600
No. If I were your student,
I would only end up

00:17:13.634 --> 00:17:15.035
copying you.

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:16.236
Then, how would I...

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:20.007
Be able to compensate for any
weaknesses you might have?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.608
Watch your tongue, boy.

00:17:21.642 --> 00:17:24.211
[Chojiro] Also, it's not
true that I'm here every day.

00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:27.080
In fact, this is the first
time I've come in a month.

00:17:27.114 --> 00:17:28.282
-Hm?
-And meanwhile,

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:30.384
I've done what you requested.

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:32.786
I have acquired
a Bankai, master.

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:34.154
Really?

00:17:34.188 --> 00:17:36.790
Well then, let us
put it to the test.

00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:39.359
Try out this new Bankai on me.

00:17:43.463 --> 00:17:44.464
(sword slashes)

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.768
Bankai!

00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:49.670
Koko Gonryo Rikyu!

00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:54.041
(electricity crackling)

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:11.024
It was a magnificent Bankai.

00:18:11.058 --> 00:18:13.160
He was not able to
defeat me, of course.

00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:17.464
But, his Bankai did leave
its permanent scar.

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:22.069
Your Bankai is unrefined.

00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:24.638
Yes, I know.

00:18:24.671 --> 00:18:27.007
But, I will spend
the rest of my life

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.776
honing it and perfecting
it for one reason alone.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.979
To better serve you, master.

00:18:32.646 --> 00:18:34.314
He was true to his word.

00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:38.018
After countless years of
relentless, grueling training.

00:18:38.051 --> 00:18:40.454
There wasn't a person
in the Soul Society

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:43.023
who did not know Chojiro's name

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:45.759
and his fame was well deserved.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.794
Once my wound
healed, the new scar

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:50.631
looked like the Japanese
character, "Ju."

00:18:50.664 --> 00:18:54.067
So, everyone started
calling me Jujisai.

00:18:54.101 --> 00:18:56.136
Sir, that scar is
only the result

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.204
of a lucky blow.

00:18:57.237 --> 00:18:59.473
Therefore, to me, you
are still Master Eijisai.

00:18:59.506 --> 00:19:02.242
Everyone, that is,
except Chojiro.

00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:05.345
He stubbornly continued
to call me Eijisai.

00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:16.256
So, for Chojiro's sake.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.260
I took on the new
name of Genryusai.

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:24.264
(lightning explodes)

00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:25.799
Head Captain, sir!

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.100
(laughing)

00:19:27.134 --> 00:19:28.735
What's wrong, old man?

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:30.571
You haven't got the
strength to retaliate

00:19:30.604 --> 00:19:33.073
against your dead
lieutenant's Bankai?

00:19:33.106 --> 00:19:34.741
Or to even say something?

00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:35.976
Huh?

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:39.980
(gasps)

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.149
(chuckles)

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.483
Oh, Chojiro...

00:19:43.517 --> 00:19:44.785
(gasps)

00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:46.787
I feel your frustration.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.290
I can understand your
anger, old friend.

00:19:50.324 --> 00:19:52.259
I share it.

00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:55.329
We both know that
this is not the Bankai

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:58.232
you honed and perfected.

00:19:58.265 --> 00:20:01.134
It's no more than a
pathetic imitation!

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:03.971
(upbeat music)

00:20:04.805 --> 00:20:08.141
Watch your enemy burn.

00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:12.513
Let this act of retribution
be my way of saying...

00:20:15.148 --> 00:20:17.150
Farewell, Chojiro.

00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:26.793
As for the rest
of the rebel army,

00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:29.463
you need not worry
about them, either.

00:20:30.163 --> 00:20:33.033
They shall all die by my hand.

00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:42.142
Boy, is he mad.

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:45.746
The rebel army's in for it now.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.048
I don't think...

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:50.784
I've ever seen the Head
Captain so angry before.

00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:52.119
What do you know?

00:20:52.152 --> 00:20:53.253
But, you're right.

00:20:53.287 --> 00:20:54.488
Huh?

00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:57.024
In all my years, I've
never seen him head

00:20:57.057 --> 00:20:58.792
into the front lines.

00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:02.062
Look at how hard the
Head Captain is fighting.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:05.032
As Squad captain and
lieutenant, the very least

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:06.767
we could do is the same.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.968
You're right, sir.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.143
(screaming)

00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:17.544
On your feet!

00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:19.246
Will we lie here on the ground

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:21.748
while Master Genryusai
stands and fights?

00:21:21.782 --> 00:21:24.618
Or shall we bring glory
to the Court Guard Squad

00:21:24.651 --> 00:21:25.786
by fighting beside him?

00:21:25.819 --> 00:21:27.020
(grunts)

00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:29.323
Sir!

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.492
Whoa, hold on a second, no fair.

00:21:32.526 --> 00:21:35.262
You guys were as good as
dead just a minute ago.

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:37.764
What the heck's going on?

00:21:37.798 --> 00:21:41.001
Looks like we're
both in trouble now.

00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:44.271
Old Man Yama's Spiritual
Pressure is reverberating

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:46.139
throughout the Seireitei.

00:21:46.173 --> 00:21:47.608
Gives me the shivers.

00:21:47.641 --> 00:21:50.010
Feels almost like
he's scolding me.

00:21:50.043 --> 00:21:52.079
Like he's saying, "Shunsui,
I didn't raise you

00:21:52.112 --> 00:21:54.281
to be a quitter."

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:57.417
"Or to lose a fight against
an opponent like that."

00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:05.759
("Saihate" by SennaRin)

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:10.998
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:30.811 --> 00:23:34.081
[Yhwach] You were one
of the special threats.

00:23:34.114 --> 00:23:36.650
Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:23:36.683 --> 00:23:39.620
This is really the
best you can do?

00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:42.422
So feeble.

00:23:42.456 --> 00:23:45.759
It seems that all this time
I've been overestimating

00:23:45.792 --> 00:23:48.262
the Soul Society.

00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:50.130
Now die.

00:23:50.163 --> 00:23:52.466
(fire roars)

00:23:52.499 --> 00:23:57.371
It had been a thousand
years, Yhwach?

00:23:57.404 --> 00:24:00.474
Now I have come to
put an end to you.

00:24:00.507 --> 00:24:01.742
Once and for all.

00:24:03.143 --> 00:24:03.744
(chuckles)

00:24:09.116 --> 00:24:12.553
[Genryusai] The heart burns...

00:24:12.586 --> 00:24:15.455
Even though the rain falls.

00:24:19.493 --> 00:24:24.498
