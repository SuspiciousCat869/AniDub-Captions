Damn, this brings back memories.

seemed to everyone else.

But I knew the real reason.

It was because, in each
instance, you held back.

You suppressed your power.

feel the joy of battle.

And so, little by little,

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:56.445
you unconsciously lowered
yourself to my level.

You suppressed your power,

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.287

shackles and begin

to return again to the
person you once were.

return at least to
what you really are.

of suppressing yourself

so that you could enjoy
battle for eternity

00:09:57.762 --> 00:10:00.534

But of one thing
I am certain now.

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:11.388
I acquired this power
for one purpose only:

00:10:11.422 --> 00:10:12.725
to fight this battle!

That is the rule, as well
as an inevitable fate.

tip of their blade at this foe,

whether to kill their rival
or make them stronger.

(blood dripping)

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:51.903
He is the one.

00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:56.278
This child is the one
worthy of the name Kenpachi.

00:10:56.312 --> 00:10:58.449
(Kenpachi snickering)

00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:00.186
Farewell to you,

00:11:01.656 --> 00:11:03.694
the one man in this world

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:07.835
who brought me true joy.

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:14.682
That was heaven,
Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:18.189
Now our battle is over.

00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:22.497
(metal banging)

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:24.536
[Kenpachi] What
do you mean over?

00:11:24.569 --> 00:11:25.538
(blood splashing)

00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:26.606
Wait.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.175
You're not gonna die.

00:11:29.177 --> 00:11:30.514
No.

00:11:30.548 --> 00:11:31.616
Don't go.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.352
Not yet!

00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:34.789
Don't leave me!

00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:38.630
Please, don't die!

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.033
I'm begging you!

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.674
You can't die!

00:11:45.343 --> 00:11:46.646
(Retsu chuckling)

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.684
[Retsu Voiceover] Such a child.

00:11:48.717 --> 00:11:51.523
What is there for
you to cry about?

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:52.925
I know you think,

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:56.131
now that you've regained your
strength and defeated me,

00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:57.835
you'll go back to
those days when

00:11:57.868 --> 00:12:00.206
all your battles were boring,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.645
when you had no one
else to play with.

00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:03.947
But trust me,

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:07.354
you still have foes worthy
of crossing swords with

00:12:07.387 --> 00:12:11.395
and comrades worthy
of bearing arms with.

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:13.399
And most important of all,

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:15.336
you have a new partner who has

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.040
awakened alongside you.

00:12:19.846 --> 00:12:23.252
Everything I have
ever gained until now,

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:24.789
I relinquish to you.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.666
Now I have nothing
left to give you.

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:32.037
Even the title of Kenpachi,

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.207
which I couldn't
give you back then,

00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:36.813
has finally fallen
from my hands.

00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:40.486
So rejoice, Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:45.096
Rejoice for me, as I pass away.

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:47.935
(Retsu sighing)

00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:50.574
What indescribable bliss it is,

00:12:50.608 --> 00:12:54.147
to die having accomplished
one's purpose.

00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:10.948
[Zanpakuto] Kenpachi.

00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:13.152
Kenpachi of Zaraki.

00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:14.221
Who is that?

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:16.626
Why are you hiding
in the shadows?

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.664
Show yourself!

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:19.799
[Zanpakuto] You hear me.

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:22.437
So my voice has
finally reached you.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.609
(Kenpachi gasping)

00:13:24.642 --> 00:13:26.713
Yes, it's me,

00:13:26.746 --> 00:13:28.215
the one who has
been watching you

00:13:28.249 --> 00:13:31.155
longer and more
closely than anyone.

00:13:34.294 --> 00:13:35.129
All right.

00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.267
Who the hell are
you supposed to be?

00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:39.772
Kenpachi.

00:13:39.806 --> 00:13:42.578
Kenpachi of Zaraki.

00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:46.653
[Zanpakuto] It's nice to
meet you, Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:13:46.686 --> 00:13:47.988
My name is...

00:13:48.824 --> 00:13:52.163
(bright violin music)

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:04.421
(explosion)

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.801
Looks like nobody's here.

00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:11.803
-(Renji yelling)
-(Ichigo yelling)

00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:13.673
(upbeat rock music)

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:14.876
(Renji yelling)

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:16.679
[Ichigo] What is that noise?

00:14:16.713 --> 00:14:17.815
Ayo!

00:14:17.848 --> 00:14:19.986
Put your hands together
and make some noise!

00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:22.157
'Cause the boss is in the house!

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.426
-(Renji growling)
-(Ichigo growling)

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:27.367
I'm the one and only
original Zanpakuto Creator.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.237
Oh-Etsu Nimaiya, y'all!

00:14:29.271 --> 00:14:32.645
S-I-K-U-Y-O-R-O!

00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:34.181
That means like, yo, what's up,

00:14:34.214 --> 00:14:35.651
how ya doin', how's it hangin'?

00:14:35.684 --> 00:14:38.523
Zanpakuto!

00:14:38.557 --> 00:14:39.525
Love it!

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:40.527
(gun firing)

00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:42.197
(glass breaking)

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.434
[Girls] Welcome to the Hoohden!

00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:45.904
(Kon gasping)

00:14:47.173 --> 00:14:48.677
Look how smooth
their chests are!

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:49.679
Where the hell are we?

00:14:49.712 --> 00:14:50.681
[Kon] Paradise!

00:14:50.714 --> 00:14:52.083
We're in paradise!

00:14:52.117 --> 00:14:54.087
-Stay on your guard.
-Hello handsome.

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:55.256
They're probably illusions or

00:14:55.289 --> 00:14:57.360
some kind of
creatures in disguise.

00:14:57.393 --> 00:14:59.231
-(Kon squeaking)
-Shut up, will ya?

00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:01.536
Ayo, welcome, Kurosaki,
welcome, Arbarai,

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:04.141
and welcome to you,
little stuffed animal guy.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:05.677
So what did you
guys think of that

00:15:05.711 --> 00:15:07.380
bangin' opening number of mine?

00:15:07.414 --> 00:15:08.349
Pretty dope, wasn't it?

00:15:08.382 --> 00:15:11.088
So, anyway, let me
introduce myself again.

00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:14.127
I'm the master of this
Hoohden, Oh-Etsu Nimaiya.

00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:17.601
What's up!

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.774
Boom, boom, bappity-bap!

00:15:20.808 --> 00:15:22.210
Yeah!

00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:24.314
Hey, can you deal with this guy?

00:15:24.347 --> 00:15:25.584
It's his vibe.

00:15:25.617 --> 00:15:26.953
It's like really putting me off.

00:15:26.986 --> 00:15:28.122
Are you nuts?

00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:30.293
I don't wanna go
anywhere near his vibe.

00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:33.432
[Oh-Etsu] Something's
not right here.

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:35.637
I can tell you're
not digging this.

00:15:36.506 --> 00:15:37.407
You wanna leave?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.877
-(Ichigo growling)
-(Renji growling)

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.048
-(Ichigo sighing)
-(Renji sighing)

00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:42.050
[Ichigo] No, sir!

00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:43.419
[Renji] Please let us stay, sir!

00:15:43.452 --> 00:15:44.488
(Oh-Etsu sighing)

00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:45.724
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah!

00:15:45.757 --> 00:15:47.160
Wrong!

00:15:47.193 --> 00:15:49.064
Man, you really don't know the
first thing about groveling.

00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:52.337
Let me show you boys how
you grovel around here.

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:54.241
Please, sir!

00:15:54.274 --> 00:15:56.278
[Ichigo] There's no
way I'm doing that!

00:15:56.311 --> 00:15:57.781
Hey, what choice have we got?

00:15:57.815 --> 00:15:59.484
Just do what he says!

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:01.321
Damn it!

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:04.361
-Please, sir!
-Please, sir!

00:16:04.394 --> 00:16:06.633
Oh wee! Nice pose!

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:07.802
Hey, check it out.

00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:09.772
They look like a couple
of complete idiots.

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:11.643
-That bastard!
-That bastard!

00:16:11.676 --> 00:16:12.912
(Oh-Etsu chuckling)

00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:14.314
[Mera] All right,
enough already!

00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:16.519
-(Oh-Etsu yelling)
-Let's get on with it!

00:16:16.553 --> 00:16:17.320
[Oh-Etsu] Mera!

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:19.659
I was just havin' a little fun.

00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:21.328
(Oh-Etsu sighing)

00:16:21.361 --> 00:16:22.531
[Mera] You two.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:23.767
Follow me.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.973
(ominous music)

00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:29.077
This is the real Hoohden.

00:16:30.547 --> 00:16:31.716
You serious?

00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:32.751
[Mera] Go on in.

00:16:33.854 --> 00:16:35.022
I don't wanna go
in that outhouse!

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:36.258
I like the other one better,

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:37.493
the one with the
beautiful women!

00:16:37.528 --> 00:16:39.999
Yeah, I do too, little
stuffed animal dude!

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.134
It's so much better!

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.172
I totally agree, brother!

00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:45.711
-(Ichigo screaming)
-(Renji screaming)

00:16:45.744 --> 00:16:47.046
(thud)

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.783
[Ichigo] This place keeps
getting better and better.

00:16:48.817 --> 00:16:50.821
Hey! What the hell is going on?

00:16:50.854 --> 00:16:52.023
I wonder.

00:16:52.056 --> 00:16:53.793
Did you two happen
to notice something?

00:16:53.827 --> 00:16:55.697
This may come as
a surprise to you,

00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:57.033
but I'm the only living,

00:16:57.066 --> 00:16:59.404
breathing Soul Reaper you've
met since you got here.

00:16:59.437 --> 00:17:00.473
(Ichigo gasping)

00:17:00.507 --> 00:17:02.878
Those lovely ladies
you saw earlier

00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:05.717
were in fact Zanpakuto.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.055
They were what?

00:17:08.088 --> 00:17:09.357
You heard me, chump.

00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:11.863
They were Zanpakuto, every
single last one of 'em.

00:17:11.896 --> 00:17:12.898
Shit.

00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:14.234
You're supposed to
be Soul Reapers.

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:16.706
You can't even tell a
Zanpakuto when you see one?

00:17:16.739 --> 00:17:18.877
You guys are
absolutely pathetic!

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.647
But then, what can
you expect from

00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:22.518
a couple of guys so
careless they'd allow

00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:25.489
something like this to
happen to their Zanpakuto?

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:27.595
Hey, hey! Don't even
think about it!

00:17:27.628 --> 00:17:28.763
(metal breaking)

00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:29.765
-(Ichigo gasping)
-(Renji gasping)

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.235
Look at that.

00:17:31.268 --> 00:17:33.840
Man, it's so easy
to break a Zanpakuto

00:17:33.873 --> 00:17:35.209
when it hasn't
been given all the

00:17:35.243 --> 00:17:36.913
love and respect it deserves.

00:17:36.946 --> 00:17:38.683
Maybe that kind
of neglect is why

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:43.560
you're surrounded by some very
angry Zanpakuto right now.

00:17:43.593 --> 00:17:46.431
Maybe if you two make
it out of there alive,

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:49.371
I'll consider fixing
your Zanpakuto.

00:17:49.404 --> 00:17:50.172
What?

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:51.576
Okay, let's try it again!

00:17:51.609 --> 00:17:54.882
Who's the one and only
original Zanpakuto Creator?

00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:56.018
You got 10 seconds.

00:17:56.051 --> 00:17:57.755
10, nine, eight, seven.

00:17:57.788 --> 00:17:59.759
Ah, to hell with it! Give up?

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:00.861
-(Meru sighing)
-Anyone?

00:18:00.894 --> 00:18:02.932
It's Oh-Etsu Nimaiya!

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:05.737
But I don't create
swords for losers.

00:18:05.771 --> 00:18:06.639
Losers?

00:18:06.673 --> 00:18:09.946
Would you prefer I
called you suckers?

00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:11.214
Forget about him.

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:12.751
There's something down here.

00:18:12.785 --> 00:18:13.653
[Ichigo] I know.

00:18:13.687 --> 00:18:16.091
Ain't nothing to be
afraid of, really.

00:18:16.124 --> 00:18:18.095
You've heard of the
ultimate Zanpakuto

00:18:18.128 --> 00:18:19.765
that can become anything?

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:21.536
The Asauchi?

00:18:22.938 --> 00:18:24.341
They're Asauchi?

00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:27.046
That's right,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.750
those nameless
Zanpakuto that are

00:18:28.783 --> 00:18:30.386
provisionally issued to trainees

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:32.056
during their time at the Academy

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.693
and then officially
re-issued to them

00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:37.935
when they become members of
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

00:18:37.968 --> 00:18:39.972
Every Soul Reaper
eats and sleeps

00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:41.809
with their Asauchi
and trains with it

00:18:41.843 --> 00:18:43.613
relentlessly until finally,

00:18:43.647 --> 00:18:45.784
by imprinting the essence
of their soul on it,

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:49.725
they've created their own
personalized Zanpakuto.

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:52.096
And who makes each
and every one of those

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.967
Asauchi that are so important to

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.336
defending the Soul Society?

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:58.142
Me. That's why they
call me the Blade God.

00:18:58.175 --> 00:18:59.745
That's great, but
while you're yapping,

00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:02.150
you mind telling us why these
things are attacking us?

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.955
Oh, is it really that
important to know why?

00:19:04.989 --> 00:19:06.124
They just are.

00:19:06.158 --> 00:19:08.262
Anyway, I already told you,

00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:09.799
they're very angry with you.

00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:10.967
About what?

00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:13.907
[Oh-Etsu] About the way you
disrespect your Zanpakuto!

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.076
[Ichigo] What do you mean?

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:16.779
It ain't just the way
you swing it around

00:19:16.813 --> 00:19:19.184
and it ain't just the way
you fling it on the ground.

00:19:19.217 --> 00:19:21.789
Nah, see, respect
is like a sword.

00:19:21.823 --> 00:19:24.194
It cuts both ways, if
you know what I mean.

00:19:24.227 --> 00:19:25.831
Them boys won't ever respect you

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:28.803
till you show 'em you
deserve their respect, sucka.

00:19:28.837 --> 00:19:31.141
So now, are you ready to rumble?

00:19:31.174 --> 00:19:32.845
-(Ichigo growling)
-(Renji growling)

00:19:32.878 --> 00:19:35.751
(metal banging)

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.910
("Saihate" by SennaRin)

00:19:48.943 --> 00:19:53.953
(singing in Japanese)

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.617
(thud)

00:21:16.986 --> 00:21:19.592
That's 71 hours and 48 minutes.

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:22.130
Who would've thought
you'd ever last that long?

00:21:22.163 --> 00:21:24.234
I'm actually impressed.

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:27.306
You've passed with
flying colors, Renji.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.144
(Renji growling)

00:21:29.177 --> 00:21:31.816
As for you, you've
failed with a big,

00:21:31.849 --> 00:21:33.653
fat capital F, Ichigo!

00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:36.024
Wait.

00:21:36.057 --> 00:21:37.961
Gimme a chance. Hold on.

00:21:37.995 --> 00:21:39.130
[Oh-Etsu] Nope! That's it!

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:41.034
You failed, you
flunked, you're done,

00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:42.470
the end, toodle-loo!

00:21:42.504 --> 00:21:45.442
But I can still keep going!

00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:47.146
Who said I'm done?

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.985
It's not like there's
a time limit, is there?

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:51.121
There's no time limit,

00:21:51.154 --> 00:21:53.025
but there is an emotional limit.

00:21:53.058 --> 00:21:54.662
I'm not saying you
couldn't go on,

00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:57.968
but you weren't
chosen by an Asauchi.

00:21:58.001 --> 00:21:59.103
It just ain't gonna happen, bro.

00:21:59.137 --> 00:22:00.339
Game over.

00:22:01.542 --> 00:22:03.947
So you give my regards to
everybody is Loserville, 'kay?

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.815
[Ichigo] Wait!

00:22:04.849 --> 00:22:06.284
[Oh-Etsu] Aw, quit
whining, will ya?

00:22:06.318 --> 00:22:07.521
So you've been rejected.

00:22:07.554 --> 00:22:09.190
Big deal! Suck it up.

00:22:09.224 --> 00:22:10.994
Take it like a man!

00:22:11.027 --> 00:22:12.196
Over the last three days,

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.535
Renji's shown that
he's a Soul Reaper,

00:22:14.568 --> 00:22:16.471
while you, Ichigo, are not.

00:22:16.506 --> 00:22:17.975
It is what it is.

00:22:18.008 --> 00:22:19.277
But don't worry.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.049
I've booked you a window
seat on a return flight,

00:22:22.083 --> 00:22:23.352
so pack up.

00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:25.724
It's time for you to go home.

00:22:25.757 --> 00:22:28.530
(Ichigo gasping)

00:22:29.197 --> 00:22:31.001
What?

00:22:31.034 --> 00:22:32.003
[Oh-Etsu] Mera.

00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:33.038
Pull him out of there, will you?

00:22:33.071 --> 00:22:34.040
On it.

00:22:34.073 --> 00:22:36.077
Wait! You're not serious!

00:22:36.111 --> 00:22:37.380
You're joking, right?

00:22:38.181 --> 00:22:40.019
Oh. And one more thing.

00:22:40.052 --> 00:22:42.558
Don't ever come back to
the Soul Society again.

00:22:42.591 --> 00:22:45.396
The Soul Society is the
land of Soul Reapers.

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:48.035
An ordinary human
without a Zanpakuto

00:22:48.068 --> 00:22:50.072
has no right even being here.

00:22:50.105 --> 00:22:51.074
Hey!

00:22:51.107 --> 00:22:52.476
The hell with that!

00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:55.082
You really think I'm gonna walk
away after coming this far?

00:22:55.115 --> 00:22:56.686
Just because you say so?

00:22:56.719 --> 00:22:59.357
If I left now, what
would happen to Zangetsu?

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.527
Far as that goes,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.564
it don't matter whether
you leave or not!

00:23:02.598 --> 00:23:04.735
Zangetsu ain't gonna
get fixed anyway.

00:23:04.768 --> 00:23:06.071
Not ever!

00:23:06.104 --> 00:23:07.340
Not by me, at least.

00:23:07.373 --> 00:23:08.676
(Ichigo growling)

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.212
I know what you're thinking.

00:23:10.246 --> 00:23:11.882
"Yo, but Oh-Etsu Nimaiya,

00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:15.122
you're the one and only
original Zanpakuto Creator!

00:23:15.155 --> 00:23:16.424
You're the Blade God, man!"

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:20.099
I don't create swords
for phony Soul Reapers.

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:21.134
You bastard!

00:23:21.936 --> 00:23:24.642
(Ichigo yelling)

00:23:25.977 --> 00:23:27.079
Peace out, my brother.

00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:28.583
You take care now.

00:23:32.056 --> 00:23:35.530
You're just no damn good
to us as you are, Ichigo.

00:23:35.563 --> 00:23:38.201
There's the fact that
no Asauchi chose you,

00:23:38.235 --> 00:23:40.139
and the fact that
you've fought this long

00:23:40.172 --> 00:23:42.276
without even having an Asauchi,

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.147
and then there's the fact that

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.953
you don't even get
what that means.

00:23:46.986 --> 00:23:49.758
Yo, man, you need
to go back, Ichigo.

00:23:49.792 --> 00:23:51.261
Way, way, back.

00:23:51.294 --> 00:23:52.496
Back to your roots.

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:55.102
You need to find out
where you come from, boy.

00:23:56.104 --> 00:23:57.373
(rain falling)

00:23:57.406 --> 00:23:59.545
(Ichigo gasping)

00:23:59.578 --> 00:24:01.983
Even if finding out means that

00:24:02.016 --> 00:24:04.153
you can never return again.

00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:12.838
[Masaki] "You, without sin,

00:24:12.871 --> 00:24:14.708
are like the sun."
