WEBVTT

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:04.505
[LILI] Thank you for everything.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.518
(LILI conflicted)

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.688
[SOMA] Be sure... to
look after your health.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:22.756
[LILI] Hmm?

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:47.280
(LILI sniffling)

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.619
(HESTIA notice)

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.355
[HESTIA] You okay?

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.160
(happy) Yeah!

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.063
Then let's get going. (beaming)

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.468
[HESTIA] Home, sweet home!

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.838
Oh. Welcome back, Lili!

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.607
(LILI giggle)

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.375
It feels good to be home!

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:21.247
[OPENING SONG, "HELLO to DREAM"]

00:02:49.613 --> 00:02:51.248
[HESTIA] So whatcha guys think?

00:02:51.348 --> 00:02:54.184
[HESTIA] How about we kick
off things with a toast?

00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:56.753
[BELL] Um, a.. toast
about what exactly?

00:02:56.853 --> 00:02:58.722
[LILI] Winning the
War Game, duh?

00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:01.191
[MIKOTO] Or Lady Lili
officially joining us?

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:03.327
[WELF] It's about the
finished renovations, right?

00:03:03.427 --> 00:03:06.296
[HESTIA] Yeah, all of that's
important, however...

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:09.133
Are we not forgetting
something else?

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:10.334
Huh?

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.436
(excited)

00:03:12.536 --> 00:03:14.504
Mm‐hm, mm‐hm.

00:03:14.604 --> 00:03:16.940
(clueless) Huh?

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:19.309
Me?

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.710
Of course!

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.912
Congrats on reaching
level three, Bell!

00:03:23.012 --> 00:03:24.748
[ADVENTURER A] No way!
That was fast!

00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:26.083
[ADVENTURER B] That's awesome!

00:03:26.183 --> 00:03:27.584
[ADVENTURER C] The little
guy's the real deal!

00:03:27.684 --> 00:03:30.887
(applause)

00:03:30.987 --> 00:03:32.656
[WELF] That's our
captain, for ya!

00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:34.424
[BELL] Wha?! Your,
your "Captain"?!

00:03:34.524 --> 00:03:35.992
We all decided on you!

00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:38.895
You were Lady Hestia's very
first recruit, after all.

00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:41.265
That would make you
the most qualified.

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:43.233
Mm‐hm, mm‐hm.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.901
(speechless)

00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:47.371
So, Captain...

00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.040
How about you start off the meal
by doing the toast for us?

00:03:53.543 --> 00:03:55.112
(BELL hesitant)

00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:01.251
[BELL] Um.. (hesitant pause)

00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:03.420
[BELL] I keep thinking
to myself about...

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.991
how lucky and grateful I am
that my friends decided to
join our Familia.

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:11.228
So, here's to the
new Hestia Familia!

00:04:11.328 --> 00:04:12.996
Cheers!

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.169
[WELF] Gotta admit...
this place cleaned up nice.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.805
[LILI] Especially
considering what it looked
like when we got here.

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:25.675
Master Apollo sure had
interesting tastes...

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:33.683
(APOLLO maniacal laughter)

00:04:33.783 --> 00:04:36.220
It was unsettling..
to say the least...

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.289
[LILI] Master Goibniu's Familia
did great with the remodeling.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.526
As to be expected from the
God of Architecture. And...

00:04:42.626 --> 00:04:46.996
He followed all of the
instructions I gave him down
to the very last detail.

00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:48.898
[MIKOTO &amp; LILI] So...
[MIKOTO] That means...

00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:51.568
[WELF] Wait...
Even the stuff we asked for?

00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:55.672
(HESTIA smirk)

00:04:55.772 --> 00:04:56.506
[WELF] Whoa..
(BELL excited gasp)

00:04:56.606 --> 00:04:57.474
(excited)

00:04:57.574 --> 00:05:05.949
(MIKOTO excitement)

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.284
[MIKOTO] I'm in Heaven!

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:09.219
[MIKOTO] It's exactly
as I'd hoped!

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.158
[MIKOTO] Wait, no..
it's even better...!

00:05:14.258 --> 00:05:16.860
[MIKOTO] It has the
traditional wooden tub!

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.230
(MIKOTO squeaky glee)

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:23.233
[MIKOTO] Don't mind if I do!

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.609
(MIKOTO exaggerated bliss)

00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:37.181
(MIKOTO sigh of pleasure)

00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:43.453
[MIKOTO] Master Takemikazuchi...
Everyone... I couldn't resist...

00:05:45.155 --> 00:05:47.324
I hope you can forgive me...

00:05:48.658 --> 00:05:50.026
[WELF] Oh yeah...

00:05:50.127 --> 00:05:53.163
[WELF] This'll do just fine.

00:05:53.263 --> 00:05:56.100
[WELF] Expected no less
from the Goibniu Familia.

00:05:58.668 --> 00:06:02.038
[WELF] They know exactly what
tickles a blacksmith's fancy.

00:06:07.644 --> 00:06:09.213
[WELF] This is it...

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.581
(WELF content sigh)

00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:13.450
[WELF] To new beginnings.

00:06:16.853 --> 00:06:19.656
[HESTIA] Seems like they were
pretty excited about everything.

00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:21.125
[HESTIA] I'm so happy, Bell!

00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:23.093
[BELL] Me too, Goddess!

00:06:23.193 --> 00:06:26.063
[LILI] I know you won a lot of
money in the War Game and all..

00:06:26.163 --> 00:06:27.964
but isn't this going
a bit overboard?

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:30.367
These renovations look like
they weren't too cheap.

00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:32.102
[HESTIA] Think of it this way,
Lili.

00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:34.037
Considering that both
Welf and Mikoto

00:06:34.138 --> 00:06:36.606
so graciously chose
to join my Familia...

00:06:36.706 --> 00:06:39.509
[HESTIA] I needed to make them
feel welcome, ya' know?

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:41.511
[LILI] I get where you're coming
from, but...

00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:45.749
Well I like it. Y'know..
renovations aside, it's
very spacious.

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.685
[LILI] Don't you think the
upkeep alone is going to be
insane?

00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:52.156
[HESTIA] We could always
just hire a live‐in maid
or something?

00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:54.691
[BELL] A maid?
That's a great idea!

00:06:58.762 --> 00:07:00.364
(LILI &amp; HESTIA notice)

00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:01.631
(BELL laughter)

00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.100
(BELL smile)

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.136
(LADIES "Ahh")
[BELL] ("Ahh") (munching)

00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:09.005
(BELL nervous laughter)
(HESTIA &amp; LILI unamused)

00:07:09.106 --> 00:07:10.607
On second thought..
let's not do that.

00:07:10.707 --> 00:07:11.775
Good call.

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.743
Huh? Why the change of heart?

00:07:13.843 --> 00:07:15.245
There's no way I'm
going to let in

00:07:15.345 --> 00:07:17.781
even more competition for
Bell's love under my roof!

00:07:17.881 --> 00:07:21.085
I'll have to come up
with a screening process
for new recruits.

00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:25.755
Speaking of, I'm invoking
my authority as your goddess
to make your room the
farthest from Bell's.

00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:26.990
What?

00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:28.692
[LILI] That's an abuse of power!

00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:30.460
[DAPHNE] We're leaving! Come on!

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.895
[CASSANDRA] I dun' wanna!
(struggling)

00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:33.497
[DAPHNE] Quit whining
and get moving!

00:07:33.597 --> 00:07:36.966
Let me go! You have
to believe me!

00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:38.168
(DAPHNE notice)
(CASSANDRA notice)

00:07:38.268 --> 00:07:39.969
[DAPHNE] Little Rookie?

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.872
Miss Daphne and
Miss Cassandra?

00:07:42.972 --> 00:07:44.274
What are you doing here?

00:07:44.374 --> 00:07:46.410
[DAPHNE] What does it
look like we're doing?

00:07:48.178 --> 00:07:50.314
[BELL] Uh, I'm not sure...

00:07:50.414 --> 00:07:52.449
I...I lost my
pillow! (whining)

00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:53.550
Your what?

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.851
Don't mind us.

00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.953
Apparently, she's managed to
lose her favorite pillow...

00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:59.156
(CASSANDRA whining)
[BELL] Do you have an idea where
you might have left it?

00:07:59.256 --> 00:08:03.460
[CASSANDRA] Um‐well...
I don't remember, but...

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.394
(BELL confused)

00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:06.563
I had a dream I left it here.

00:08:06.663 --> 00:08:09.533
[DAPHNE] Knock it off!
How many times have I told you
to stop it with that nonsense.

00:08:09.633 --> 00:08:12.402
Please! You gotta believe
me, just this once!

00:08:12.502 --> 00:08:14.604
Wait there. I'll
go take a look!

00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:16.073
[CASSANDRA] Huh?

00:08:16.906 --> 00:08:18.775
You said it's here,
didn'tcha?

00:08:20.577 --> 00:08:24.081
[BELL] Got it. It was
wedged behind a pillar.

00:08:25.982 --> 00:08:28.285
[CASSANDRA] Um..
thank you so much...

00:08:28.385 --> 00:08:31.555
[CASSANDRA] He.. believed me...

00:08:31.655 --> 00:08:33.057
(BELL reaction)

00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:35.759
[DAPHNE]
Hmm?

00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:39.896
[DAPHNE] Really?
Are you sure?

00:08:39.996 --> 00:08:41.665
[CASSANDRA] Mmhmm.
(BELL confused)

00:08:41.765 --> 00:08:45.202
We're gonna head out,
but we'll be back soon.

00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:47.971
We have a little business to
take care of here tomorrow.

00:08:48.072 --> 00:08:49.106
[BELL] Tomorrow?

00:08:49.206 --> 00:08:51.508
Wait.. you mean
you don't know?

00:08:52.176 --> 00:08:53.677
(BELL confused)

00:08:55.112 --> 00:08:56.880
[BELL] Why didn't you
tell me, Goddess?!

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.248
(chuckle) So...

00:08:58.348 --> 00:09:00.784
I guess that means you
found out.. eh, Bell?

00:09:00.884 --> 00:09:02.319
Are you shocked?

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:05.922
Of course I am! You never
recruit new members on your own!

00:09:06.022 --> 00:09:10.327
Our Familia's name has
acquired a bit of acclaim ever
since the War Game, ya know?

00:09:10.427 --> 00:09:13.397
Can't let this
opportunity go to waste.

00:09:13.497 --> 00:09:15.099
Don't you think that maybe
you're rushing into this?

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:17.134
I mean, the three
of us just joined.

00:09:17.234 --> 00:09:21.905
Not at all! In fact, now's
the perfect chance for us
to grow and expand!

00:09:22.005 --> 00:09:23.607
(BELL amazed)

00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:27.711
[HESTIA] The Hestia Familia
is going to climb to the top
of Orario!

00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:34.951
[BELL] Th...this is
amazing, Goddess!

00:09:35.052 --> 00:09:37.421
(HESTIA overblown cackle)

00:09:37.521 --> 00:09:40.190
They won't call us a dinky
little Familia much longer!

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.659
[HESTIA] Right, Bell?!

00:09:43.427 --> 00:09:44.494
[BELL &amp; HESTIA] Hooray! Hooray!

00:09:44.594 --> 00:09:46.630
They're in a
chipper mood, huh.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.032
Well can you really blame them,
I mean look at this turnout.

00:09:49.133 --> 00:09:50.800
(CROWD enthusiastic)

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.269
[LILI] It's not just humans.

00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:55.239
[LILI] Elves, dwarves, animal
people.. even Amazons...

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:57.207
[WELF] A lot of 'em
aren't even adventurers.

00:09:57.307 --> 00:09:59.076
[WELF] Don't you think
that's a little odd?

00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:00.344
(smirk)

00:10:00.444 --> 00:10:01.911
They're from
other cities.

00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:02.812
Huh?
Huh?

00:10:02.912 --> 00:10:03.980
Some of these people

00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.282
have traveled a long way...

00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:07.517
just in hopes to join
our lil Familia.

00:10:07.617 --> 00:10:10.987
Kinda crazy how our reputation
spread like wildfire, isn't it?

00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:13.123
[WELF] What? (baffled)

00:10:13.223 --> 00:10:17.427
[WELF] I guess you weren't
joking around when you said
we were getting famous.

00:10:17.527 --> 00:10:18.895
Whatcha doin', Lil' Bit?

00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:20.297
Considering that these people

00:10:20.397 --> 00:10:22.166
could very well become our
allies in the future...

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:25.702
I have to check them out
and make sure they aren't
potentially dangerous.

00:10:25.802 --> 00:10:26.936
Wha? Dangerous?

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:28.672
(flirt) (wink)

00:10:28.772 --> 00:10:33.943
[LILI] (scream) Absolutely not!
That outfit is obscenely lewd!

00:10:34.043 --> 00:10:36.646
Where do you even buy clothes
like that, you harlot?!

00:10:36.746 --> 00:10:38.248
(Hm? Sheepish laugh)

00:10:38.348 --> 00:10:40.584
(CROWD "awwing")
[LILI] (scream) No no no! No way

00:10:40.684 --> 00:10:44.121
[LILI] She'd just distract
us with her adorable,
childlike innocence!

00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:46.790
We've got that
trope covered! Grr!

00:10:48.392 --> 00:10:50.760
[LILI] Nuh‐uh, We're not doing
that, either! Nope! Go away!

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.496
[STRONG GIRL ] Oh?
[LILI] Think of Master Bell!

00:10:52.596 --> 00:10:53.930
We don't know what
might happen to him!

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.765
We can't trust any
of these tramps!

00:10:55.865 --> 00:10:57.067
Oh good grief.

00:10:57.167 --> 00:10:59.035
Dear Gods.. what
shameful behavior...

00:10:59.136 --> 00:11:01.971
[MIKOTO] I've fallen victim to
the temptation of an early bath

00:11:02.072 --> 00:11:03.940
and squandered the morning away!

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.775
[MIKOTO] Where are my clothes?!

00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:07.444
(MIKOTO ack!) (pain)

00:11:09.846 --> 00:11:17.721
(gathering self)
Hmm?

00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:21.758
[MIKOTO] "Do not touch"? Is
this Lady Hestia's handwriting?

00:11:22.526 --> 00:11:24.161
[MIKOTO] Oh?
"Do not open"...?

00:11:24.261 --> 00:11:28.765
[HESTIA] Thank you all
for coming! I am the patron
goddess, Hestia!

00:11:28.865 --> 00:11:30.567
(CROWD amazed)

00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:34.037
[HESTIA] I'd like to start by
expressing my gratitude to each
and every one of you.

00:11:34.138 --> 00:11:40.244
[HESTIA] By choosing my Familia,
it's clear to me that you are
vastly more intelligent than
your average adventurer.

00:11:40.344 --> 00:11:41.845
(CROWD amazed/flattered)

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.782
And what's...
this about?

00:11:45.882 --> 00:11:47.584
Don't have a clue.

00:11:48.185 --> 00:11:49.286
[HESTIA] Now then...

00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:51.621
I'm dying to see
your fighting spirit!

00:11:54.091 --> 00:11:57.361
[HESTIA] Do you want to join us?
In the Hestia Familia?!

00:11:57.461 --> 00:11:59.229
[CROWD] YEAH!
[BELL] Huh?!

00:11:59.329 --> 00:12:03.032
[HESTIA] Is Goddess Hestia..
the very bestia?!

00:12:03.133 --> 00:12:04.368
[CROWD] Yeah!

00:12:04.468 --> 00:12:08.138
[HESTIA] Do you think Bell's..
freakin' cute?!

00:12:08.238 --> 00:12:09.906
[CROWD] Yeah!
[BELL] Uh‐hey now...!

00:12:10.006 --> 00:12:12.809
[HESTIA] Do you love piping
hot Potato Poppers?!

00:12:12.909 --> 00:12:14.444
[CROWD] yeah!

00:12:14.544 --> 00:12:18.082
[HESTIA] And are pigtails..
the cutest hairstyle!?

00:12:18.182 --> 00:12:20.650
[CROWD] yeah!

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.586
Guess I'm already used to
dealing with a strange god.

00:12:22.686 --> 00:12:24.154
[HESTIA] Let's hear it
‐ Fire Bolt!

00:12:24.254 --> 00:12:26.723
[CROWD] Fire bolt!

00:12:26.823 --> 00:12:28.625
(CROWD pumped up)

00:12:28.725 --> 00:12:32.529
[HESTIA] Okay! Let's get
this party started.

00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:36.700
[HESTIA] We'll begin with some
one‐on‐one interviews...

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.302
[MIKOTO] Lady Hestia!
(faceplant)

00:12:38.402 --> 00:12:40.404
Huh?! Wh..what's
the matter?!

00:12:40.504 --> 00:12:43.873
[MIKOTO] I.. I found..
this in a box...!

00:12:43.973 --> 00:12:44.874
(HESTIA shock)

00:12:44.974 --> 00:12:46.476
[WELF &amp; LILI] Huh? Hmm?

00:12:47.244 --> 00:12:48.412
[HESTIA] Gimme that!

00:12:48.512 --> 00:12:50.814
(HESTIA sputtering)

00:12:50.914 --> 00:12:53.383
[MIKOTO] It's a bill for
two hundred million valis!

00:12:53.483 --> 00:12:54.851
[LILI, WELF, BELL] Huh?!

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:58.488
[LILI] Lady Hestia..!
Two hundred million...?

00:12:58.588 --> 00:13:00.290
(HESTIA sputtering)
[ADVENTURER D] What'd she say?!

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.393
[ADVENTURER E] I could buy
a lot of cheese wheels with
that many valis.

00:13:03.493 --> 00:13:04.661
[ADVENTURER A] Who even
spends that much...?

00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:05.995
[ADVENTURER F] You
gotta be kidding me.

00:13:06.096 --> 00:13:07.764
(HESTIA nervous)

00:13:12.469 --> 00:13:13.937
(embarrassment)

00:13:14.037 --> 00:13:15.305
(shock)

00:13:15.405 --> 00:13:16.873
(appalled)

00:13:16.973 --> 00:13:18.975
[HESTIA] Uh‐hey now,
you've got it all wrong!

00:13:19.076 --> 00:13:22.046
I amassed this large debt
for a very good reason!

00:13:22.146 --> 00:13:23.413
[ADVENTURER D] Wait,
so it's true?

00:13:23.513 --> 00:13:24.581
[ADVENTURER E] She
totally admitted it...

00:13:24.681 --> 00:13:26.083
[ADVENTURER F]
I am so outta here.

00:13:26.183 --> 00:13:27.617
[DAPHNE] Uuh.. what's plan "B"?

00:13:27.717 --> 00:13:30.787
Aww... and he's the only
one who believed me.

00:13:30.887 --> 00:13:35.192
Uh.. okay fine, I admit,
two hundred million is a lot...

00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:36.926
But, uh, yeah...

00:13:37.026 --> 00:13:41.365
[HESTIA] Who wants to join
my Familia.... anyway?!

00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:47.971
[WELF] Welp, that
didn't last long.

00:13:48.772 --> 00:13:50.374
(poke)

00:13:51.808 --> 00:13:53.410
Yoo‐hoo!

00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:56.646
I don't..
understand...

00:13:57.381 --> 00:13:59.549
(WELF notice)

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.652
[WELF] That's Lady
Hephaistos' signature.

00:14:02.752 --> 00:14:05.055
Huh? Lady
Hephaistos?

00:14:05.155 --> 00:14:07.191
[WELF] Oh yeah, right here.
Lady Hestia signed it, too.

00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:12.096
[WELF] It definitely looks
official... Yeah, it's real,
all right...

00:14:12.196 --> 00:14:14.030
(BELL inverted scream)

00:14:18.001 --> 00:14:19.903
(WELF point)

00:14:20.003 --> 00:14:22.372
[BELL] That was the price
of the Hestia knife?!

00:14:22.472 --> 00:14:26.510
(silently freaking out)

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.445
[BELL, internal]
A‐all this time...

00:14:28.545 --> 00:14:30.680
[BELL] I've been swinging..
and stabbing..

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.618
and fending off attacks with
two hundred million valis...?!

00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:39.356
(BELL death screech)
[WELF] H‐hey! Bell! BELL!

00:14:39.456 --> 00:14:41.791
[LILI] It's too late!
He's already gone!

00:14:44.294 --> 00:14:46.396
[LILI] What is the
meaning of this?!

00:14:46.496 --> 00:14:51.034
[HESTIA] (nervous laugh) W‐well,
uh... I'm sorry. The truth is, I
forgot all about it myself...

00:14:51.135 --> 00:14:54.171
[LILI] You forgot about two
hundred million valis!

00:14:54.271 --> 00:14:55.905
[HESTIA] I know, but...

00:14:56.005 --> 00:15:00.110
Hephaistos just takes a cut
of my paycheck, so I don't
really notice.

00:15:00.777 --> 00:15:04.814
(HESTIA forced laughter)

00:15:05.382 --> 00:15:06.916
(inhale) Sorry..

00:15:07.016 --> 00:15:08.385
(LILI exasperated)

00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:11.888
[LILI] I'm sure Master
Bell knew you owed
something for his knife.

00:15:11.988 --> 00:15:14.758
However..., you should've
at least told him how much!

00:15:14.858 --> 00:15:17.827
You traumatized him so badly,
he can't even get out of bed!

00:15:17.927 --> 00:15:19.496
(BELL weak moan)

00:15:19.596 --> 00:15:22.832
[MIKOTO] And Master Bell
was so looking forward to
recruiting new members...

00:15:22.932 --> 00:15:24.401
[HESTIA] Mm‐hmm.

00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:26.436
[LILI] Anyway.. do
know how much money

00:15:26.536 --> 00:15:28.638
you have left from what
Master Apollo gave you?

00:15:28.738 --> 00:15:31.475
(sigh) Yeah, that money?
It's all gone.

00:15:31.575 --> 00:15:33.443
[LILI] What?! But
there was so much!
(MIKOTO shock)

00:15:33.543 --> 00:15:37.214
Well, the remodeling
ended up being more
expensive than I thought...

00:15:37.314 --> 00:15:40.184
But at least.. we have a nice
new home to live in now!

00:15:40.284 --> 00:15:41.518
(LILI unamused)

00:15:41.618 --> 00:15:43.053
I guess we've got no choice.

00:15:43.153 --> 00:15:46.290
It sounds like we'll have to
go back down in the Dungeon.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.126
That's right... We'll have
to take on more quests, too...

00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:52.362
Hold on! I was never asking
for your help with it!

00:15:52.462 --> 00:15:56.400
[HESTIA] I'm the one who
took the loan. I'm not going
to force my debt on you.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.801
[HESTIA] I'll pay
it back myself!

00:15:57.901 --> 00:15:59.936
[MIKOTO] Oh yeah? All two
hundred million?

00:16:00.036 --> 00:16:01.738
(HESTIA speechless)

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:03.907
[HESTIA] I can do it!

00:16:04.007 --> 00:16:07.511
The cost of that knife is proof
of my undying love for Bell!

00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:09.646
[HESTIA] I can't let anyone
else pay it back for me!

00:16:09.746 --> 00:16:12.249
Yeah yeah. Calling it "undying
love" won't make it go away.

00:16:12.349 --> 00:16:13.450
[HESTIA] Silence!

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.053
Either way. I've got
it handled, okay?

00:16:16.153 --> 00:16:19.256
The three of you don't
need to worry about it,
so just forget it.

00:16:19.356 --> 00:16:20.357
[HESTIA] End of discussion!

00:16:20.457 --> 00:16:21.758
[MIKOTO] Where are
you.... going?

00:16:21.858 --> 00:16:24.861
[HESTIA] To my room,
okay!? Good night!

00:16:26.096 --> 00:16:27.364
(WELF sigh)

00:16:27.464 --> 00:16:29.366
[WELF] What do you think?

00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:32.736
[LILI] I think she ought to
learn to rely on us a little
more...

00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:40.744
(BELL dazed)

00:16:40.844 --> 00:16:44.248
[WELF] (notice)
Morning, sunshine.

00:16:44.348 --> 00:16:45.249
[BELL] Huh?

00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:47.284
[BELL] Welf? Where am I...?

00:16:47.384 --> 00:16:52.189
How'bout I fill you in later.
Yeah so hey.. you want a bath?

00:16:52.289 --> 00:16:53.690
[BELL] A bath...?

00:16:58.295 --> 00:16:59.763
(HESTIA sigh)

00:17:01.931 --> 00:17:04.168
[HESTIA] I'm the
worst goddess...

00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:06.170
[WELF] Whoa!

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.206
[WELF] It's even fancier
than I imagined! Look, Bell!

00:17:09.306 --> 00:17:11.007
[HESTIA] Hmm? (curious)

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:13.643
[HESTIA] Bell?

00:17:13.743 --> 00:17:14.978
[BELL] You're right..

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.013
[BELL] Miss Mikoto has
a good eye for detail.

00:17:17.114 --> 00:17:20.317
[WELF] Not that I mind,
but I think she might've
overdone it a bit.

00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:22.252
(BELL laughter)
(WELF laughter)

00:17:22.352 --> 00:17:25.489
(BELL awkward) (confused)

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:29.093
[WELF] Y'know what... I'm
noticing that adventure's bod'
you've built up, kid...

00:17:29.193 --> 00:17:30.294
[BELL] Huh?!

00:17:30.394 --> 00:17:32.562
[WELF] You got a lot more
muscle than you used to.

00:17:32.662 --> 00:17:33.930
You really filled out!

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.765
[BELL] Y‐you think so...?
[HESTIA] Huh?!

00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:37.567
[WELF] Yes, I do.
Like here... and here...

00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:39.536
[WELF] Oh, and definitely
this! (poking Bell)
[BELL] H‐hey! (laughing)

00:17:39.636 --> 00:17:40.970
(HESTIA jealousy)

00:17:41.071 --> 00:17:42.839
[BELL] C‐cut it out!
(WELF laughter / horsing around)

00:17:42.939 --> 00:17:44.741
[WELF] How much do
you bench, bro?
[BELL] Hey! That tickles!

00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:46.410
[MIKOTO] Oh? Uh, Lady Hestia?

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.678
[HESTIA] Huh?!
[LILI] What are you
doing over there?

00:17:48.778 --> 00:17:50.314
[HESTIA] Shhhh! Be quiet!

00:17:50.414 --> 00:17:54.818
[HESTIA] I'm spying.. It's how a
lover shows their true feelings!

00:17:55.285 --> 00:17:56.786
(BELL sigh)

00:17:59.756 --> 00:18:01.525
[WELF] You look like you're
feeling a lot better.

00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:03.593
[BELL] Huh?

00:18:03.693 --> 00:18:05.195
You collapsing
had us worried.

00:18:05.295 --> 00:18:09.366
[BELL] Oh..
[WELF] It's not worth it to
stress out.. okay?

00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:10.500
(BELL smile)

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.136
[BELL] Hey Welf.. Thanks a lot..

00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:14.904
for joining us in
the Hestia Familia.

00:18:15.004 --> 00:18:17.407
[WELF] Hmm? Where did that come
from?

00:18:17.507 --> 00:18:23.613
[BELL] I mean.. I just want to
make sure I thank you properly.
And Lili... and Miss Mikoto,
too.

00:18:23.713 --> 00:18:30.187
[BELL] I... I'm really happy.
Getting to live together and
share a home with everyone.

00:18:30.287 --> 00:18:37.261
[BELL] It's kind of strange,
isn't it? When we first met, I
would've never dreamed things
would end up this way.

00:18:37.361 --> 00:18:40.464
[WELF] No kiddin'. I never
would've guessed it, either.

00:18:40.564 --> 00:18:43.333
(LILI &amp; HESTIA impact) (pain)

00:18:43.433 --> 00:18:44.834
(MIKOTO sigh)

00:18:44.934 --> 00:18:46.803
[BELL] Same with Miss Mikoto...
(MIKOTO hm)

00:18:46.903 --> 00:18:49.973
[BELL] We first met her when
she dumped all those monsters
on us in the Dungeon.

00:18:50.074 --> 00:18:52.242
[WELF](laugh) Oh
yeah, that's right.

00:18:52.342 --> 00:18:55.079
[BELL] However.. she's saved me
so many times since then.

00:18:55.179 --> 00:19:02.119
[BELL] She went so far as to
leave her own Familia behind
just so she could help me out in
the War Game.

00:19:02.219 --> 00:19:04.621
I don't know how I can
ever repay her.

00:19:04.721 --> 00:19:06.823
[WELF] Yeah..
[LILI] Oh?

00:19:06.923 --> 00:19:08.625
[BELL] Then there's Lili...
[LILI] Huh?!

00:19:08.725 --> 00:19:12.362
[BELL] I was a complete stranger
to her, and yet she taught me so
much.

00:19:12.462 --> 00:19:16.466
[BELL] I owe it all to Lili
that I was able to become a
real adventurer.

00:19:18.868 --> 00:19:21.071
[BELL] She's always by
my side no matter what.

00:19:21.171 --> 00:19:23.407
[BELL] She was my very first
friend.

00:19:24.508 --> 00:19:26.243
[LILI] (touched) Master Bell...

00:19:26.343 --> 00:19:27.177
(HESTIA excited)

00:19:27.277 --> 00:19:28.745
[BELL] And of course, my
goddess...

00:19:28.845 --> 00:19:30.414
(HESTIA excited!)

00:19:30.514 --> 00:19:33.250
[BELL] She's the one who found
me in the first place.

00:19:34.851 --> 00:19:36.120
(BELL smile)

00:19:37.221 --> 00:19:41.158
[BELL] She's the one who gave me
a place to belong.

00:19:41.258 --> 00:19:46.196
[BELL] Ever since I first came
to Orario, she's always taken
care of me.

00:19:46.296 --> 00:19:48.565
[BELL] She always says
she's a bad goddess...

00:19:48.665 --> 00:19:54.271
[BELL] But to me, she's the best
one ever and the most important
person in my life.

00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:02.612
[BELL] It's like everyone is
always doing such nice things
for me...

00:20:02.712 --> 00:20:04.481
[BELL] I feel kind
of bad about it...

00:20:04.581 --> 00:20:06.350
[WELF] You shouldn't.
[BELL] Huh?

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.853
[WELF] I know it might seem to
you like we're always helping
you out but..

00:20:09.953 --> 00:20:12.356
you do the same
thing for us, Bell.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.725
Looking out for each other is
what a Familia is all about.

00:20:15.825 --> 00:20:17.294
(HESTIA touched/crying)
(LILI &amp; MIKOTO touched)

00:20:17.394 --> 00:20:23.833
[HESTIA] I didn't know! Oh Bell!
(cry) MY, BELL! (cry)

00:20:24.568 --> 00:20:29.773
[HESTIA] Bell!

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.809
[BELL] Goddess Hestia?

00:20:33.443 --> 00:20:34.944
[HESTIA] Bell!

00:20:35.044 --> 00:20:36.113
[LILI] Lady Hestia!

00:20:36.213 --> 00:20:37.581
[BELL] Goddess, what are you‐?!

00:20:37.681 --> 00:20:39.983
I'm so incredibly lucky...

00:20:40.084 --> 00:20:42.752
to have someone like you, Bell!

00:20:42.852 --> 00:20:44.154
[HESTIA] Huh?!
[BELL] Huh?!

00:20:44.254 --> 00:20:46.523
[HESTIA] Hey wait!
You two! (struggling)

00:20:46.623 --> 00:20:48.192
[MIKOTO] Lady Hestia!
(struggling continues under)

00:20:48.292 --> 00:20:49.926
[LILI] Lady Hestia! What on
earth are you thinking?!

00:20:50.026 --> 00:20:51.795
[HESTIA] Let me go!
Let me be with my darling Bell!

00:20:51.895 --> 00:20:56.900
Ah! No! Just leave us alone!

00:20:58.702 --> 00:21:01.105
[HESTIA] I thought I could just
pretend everything was okay.

00:21:01.205 --> 00:21:03.440
[HESTIA] But I won't
pretend anymore.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.676
[HESTIA] I'm going to pay the
money back, no matter how long
it takes.

00:21:06.776 --> 00:21:10.814
[HESTIA] I'd like everyone's
support. So I'm going to ask for
your help.

00:21:10.914 --> 00:21:17.621
[HESTIA] I'm an awful goddess..
And I know I've accumulated a
mountain of debt.

00:21:17.721 --> 00:21:20.924
(smile) But can you
stick with me?

00:21:21.658 --> 00:21:22.659
(MIKOTO &amp; LILI nod)

00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:26.363
(BELL &amp; WELF agree nod) (laugh)

00:21:26.463 --> 00:21:27.831
(HESTIA quick giggle)

00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:31.368
[BELL] To the Hestia
Familia.. and whatever
adventures awaits us!

00:21:31.468 --> 00:21:33.537
[BELL, WELF, HESTIA,
LILI, MIKOTO] Cheers!

00:21:33.637 --> 00:21:37.841
[HESTIA] (glug, glug) (phew!)
I was kind of hoping for wine
instead of water...

00:21:37.941 --> 00:21:40.377
(doorbell buzzing)
[MIKOTO] Coming! One moment!
[LILI] No, it's too
expensive! From here on out,

00:21:40.477 --> 00:21:42.512
[MIKOTO] Can I help you? (shock)
[LILI] I'll be the one in charge
of our budget!

00:21:42.612 --> 00:21:44.914
[MIKOTO] Lady Chigusa!? Uhm...
You're just in time.

00:21:45.014 --> 00:21:47.016
[MIKOTO] We were about to
sit down to dinner, so if
you'd like to jo‐

00:21:47.117 --> 00:21:48.285
[CHIGUSA] Mikoto...

00:21:48.385 --> 00:21:49.453
[MIKOTO] Hmm?

00:21:59.329 --> 00:22:14.944
[MIKOTO] No... no way...
(thoughtful breath)

00:22:15.044 --> 00:22:21.985
[CLOSING SONG,
"Sasayaka na Shukusai"]

00:23:46.503 --> 00:23:49.406
[HESTIA] Next time:
"Ishtar Familia."
