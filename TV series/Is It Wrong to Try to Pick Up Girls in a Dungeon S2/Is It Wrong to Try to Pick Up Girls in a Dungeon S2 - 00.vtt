WEBVTT

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:11.377
(OPENING SONG, "Hey World")

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:15.115
[HESTIA, voiceover] Hey, Bell!
"Danmachi 2" is finally here!

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.183
[BELL, voiceover] Yep.
That's right, Goddess!

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:18.652
[BELL] I'm excited to see
what kinds of new friends

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.021
and adventures are
waiting for me this time!

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.155
(HESTIA giggles)

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.825
[HESTIA] That's
so like you, Bell.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.426
But before you get
to adventuring,

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:29.129
we have something very important
we have to take care of.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.631
Don'tcha think?

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:31.865
[BELL] Huh? What's that?

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.499
[HESTIA] There are
some people out there

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.403
who don't really know our story.
It's our job to fill them in!

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:42.142
The dramatic tale of
our journey together...
It's a tale of love!

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.910
[BELL] A‐a tale of love?!

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.849
[HESTIA] Yes. It is a
fateful encounter, a
farewell, and a reunion...

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.555
Our bodies held close under
the moonlight, whispering
sweet nothings to each other...

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:55.656
Until finally...!

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:56.957
[BELL] H‐h‐hold on, Goddess!

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.025
I don't remember anything
quite like that...

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.661
[HESTIA] But we ought to get
everyone up to speed

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.063
on all the stuff we've been
through, don't you think?

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.132
[BELL] Okay, yeah...
I guess you're right.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.134
I would also like everyone
to know our story.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.838
I want to tell them about
how me and my goddess got
to where we are now!

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.140
(HESTIA giggles)

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.443
[HESTIA] Alright!
Then let's get going!

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:23.049
Let the glorious reminiscing
about the story of
our unwavering love begin!

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.618
(BELL groans)

00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:38.905
[BELL, voiceover] We live in
the Labyrinth City of Orario.

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:43.375
In addition to the
Dungeon, the city is home to
countless gods and adventurers.

00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:45.612
It's the most famous
city in the world.

00:01:45.712 --> 00:01:50.116
[HESTIA, voiceover] "Gods"
and "adventurers" might be
a little much to throw at
them right away.

00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:55.387
This stuff could be confusing
for some people, so allow me
to explain in detail.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.063
Us gods and goddesses can
give our children living in
the lower world a special type
of power called a blessing.

00:02:04.163 --> 00:02:06.933
[BELL] That's when you
etch a status onto
someone's back, right?

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:08.000
[HESTIA] Uh‐huh.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.401
[BELL] Once they have that,

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:11.638
they can become an adventurer
and fight monsters.

00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:14.741
[HESTIA] Yup! And then, the god
who gave the blessing

00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:18.077
and the adventurer who received
it form a "Familia."

00:02:18.177 --> 00:02:21.147
[HESTIA] Just like me
and Bell! Awww..

00:02:21.247 --> 00:02:24.183
[BELL] Big Familias have
a ton of adventurers amongst
their ranks,

00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:28.154
[BELL] but our Familia has
always been just the two of us.
Isn't that right?

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:30.757
[HESTIA] And there's nothing
wrong with that!

00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:35.161
[HESTIA] The Hestia Familia
is a Familia born from mine
and Bell's love.

00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:38.330
[HESTIA] It's the two of
us against the world for
the rest of eternity!

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.032
[HESTIA] Isn't that
right, Bell?!

00:02:40.132 --> 00:02:41.834
[BELL] Oh, u‐um...

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:44.470
We still have some other
stuff we need to cover...

00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:46.839
[HESTIA] Huh?! Why
won't you answer me?!

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.976
Bell! I'm waiting...

00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:51.978
[BELL] U‐uh... Oh, right!

00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:54.346
We still have to tell them
about the Dungeon, don't we?

00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:56.816
[HESTIA] Hm? Yeah, I guess so.

00:02:56.916 --> 00:03:00.787
[HESTIA] The Dungeon is an
underground labyrinth where
monsters are born.

00:03:00.887 --> 00:03:03.389
[HESTIA] Sure, it's incredibly
dangerous down there,

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.594
[HESTIA] but it's
practically crawling with
opportunities for people to make
money and get famous.

00:03:07.694 --> 00:03:12.064
[BELL] That's why people from
all around the world who want
to become adventurers flock
to the city.

00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:15.702
[HESTIA] And you were one of
those people weren't you, Bell?

00:03:15.802 --> 00:03:19.271
[BELL] Actually, I wasn't after
money or anything like that...

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:23.375
I've always admired heroes
like the ones you read about
in storybooks.

00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:26.445
My grandpa also said something
that stuck with me...

00:03:26.546 --> 00:03:31.584
[BELL'S GRANDPA, voiceover]
A promising young adventurer
like you needs to find love
in a dungeon.

00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:39.291
Once you rescue a young
maiden from a big, ugly,
terrifying beast... you'll
be in her good graces.

00:03:39.391 --> 00:03:42.895
And that is what
adventuring is all about.

00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:46.766
[BELL, voiceover] At first,
I wasn't sure something like
that could really happen.

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:47.634
[BELL] But...

00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:50.436
(primal roar)

00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:52.104
(BELL freaking out)

00:03:52.204 --> 00:03:53.305
(winding up)

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:54.707
(BELL scream)

00:03:54.807 --> 00:03:55.675
(punching)

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:56.776
(pained roar)

00:03:56.876 --> 00:03:58.077
(BELL freaking out)

00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:00.880
(MINOTAUR mad) (attack)

00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:06.052
(pain, roaring) (attacking)

00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:07.119
(freak out)

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.020
(MINOTAUR dying)

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.421
(BELL shocked)

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.124
(dying breath)

00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:14.026
(shocked)

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:16.328
(roaring)

00:04:16.428 --> 00:04:18.397
(speechless)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.134
[AIS] You there.

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:23.536
[BELL] Huh?

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:25.037
[AIS] Are you all right?

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:28.608
(head tilt)

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:30.710
[BELL, voiceover] The girl who
saved me back then...

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.212
Her name is Miss
Ais Wallenstein.

00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:39.251
She's part of the largest
Familia in the city, the Loki
Familia. And she's a lvl. 5.

00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:41.721
She's also nicknamed
the Sword Princess.

00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:45.792
She's strong and cool,
and I'm going to catch
up to her one day!

00:04:45.892 --> 00:04:47.594
(HESTIA super annoyed)

00:04:47.694 --> 00:04:49.662
[BELL] Huh? What's
the matter, Goddess?

00:04:49.762 --> 00:04:51.297
[HESTIA, voiceover]
What's the big deal?!

00:04:51.397 --> 00:04:53.399
You get way too excited
talking about

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:55.568
that dumb
Wallen‐whaters‐whatever!

00:04:55.668 --> 00:04:57.637
I swear, you're just so...!

00:04:57.737 --> 00:05:01.407
[BELL] Uh, u‐um... Do
you mind if I continue
with the story, Goddess?

00:05:01.508 --> 00:05:03.876
[HESTIA] Ugh. Fine.

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:04.877
(mass panic)

00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:06.045
[MAN] Run!

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:07.113
(SILVERBACK roar)

00:05:07.213 --> 00:05:07.880
(BELL gasp)

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.248
(gasp) Bell?!

00:05:09.348 --> 00:05:11.283
[BELL, voiceover] The
Monsterphilia incident...

00:05:11.383 --> 00:05:12.519
It was scary, wasn't it?

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:14.120
[HESTIA, voiceover] Yeah...

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.354
I still can't
believe a monster

00:05:15.454 --> 00:05:17.657
showed up in the
middle of Orario.

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:20.960
We were in so much trouble
when it started chasing me!

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.994
But...!

00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:22.929
(roar)

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:24.230
[HESTIA] There you go.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.866
(heavy breathing)

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:29.068
(roar)

00:05:29.168 --> 00:05:31.037
(scared)

00:05:32.672 --> 00:05:33.906
[HESTIA] It's okay, Bell.

00:05:34.006 --> 00:05:34.907
Huh?

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:40.980
It's like I said before.
I've given you the key
to victory.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.082
(sigh) Alright.

00:05:44.183 --> 00:05:45.752
You believe in me right?

00:05:45.852 --> 00:05:46.619
Yeah!

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:50.189
[HESTIA] Then get out there!

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.427
[HESTIA, voiceover] Here he
comes, here he comes! Jump,
Bell! Go, my darling Bell!

00:05:55.528 --> 00:05:57.830
(BELL embarrassed laughter)

00:05:59.231 --> 00:06:00.032
(snarl)

00:06:00.132 --> 00:06:01.668
(fighting)

00:06:01.768 --> 00:06:03.970
(angry)

00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:15.715
Yahhh!

00:06:17.116 --> 00:06:20.452
(gurgling pain)

00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:21.754
(HESTIA thrilled)

00:06:21.854 --> 00:06:23.956
[HESTIA, voiceover]
That was so cool!

00:06:24.056 --> 00:06:27.594
Okay, let's watch it again,
Bell! One more time, from when
you took off running!

00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:30.630
[BELL, voiceover] C‐come on,
please cut it out, Goddess!

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.201
Besides, the only reason
I won that fight was because
of the knife you gave me.

00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:37.003
(HESTIA coy laughter)

00:06:37.103 --> 00:06:39.672
[HESTIA, voiceover] It makes me
happy to hear you say that.

00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:44.410
[BELL, voiceover] Speaking of
which, how'd you get Hephaistos
to make you that knife?

00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:49.348
I would've expected a weapon
crafted by the Goddess of the
Forge herself to be really
expensive.

00:06:49.448 --> 00:06:53.052
[HESTIA, voiceover] Huh?
O‐oh... About that...

00:06:53.152 --> 00:06:54.854
W‐well...Um...

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:02.529
I guess you could say it was
my godly negotiation skills...

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:05.898
(HESTIA nervous laughter)

00:07:05.998 --> 00:07:09.636
[BELL, voiceover] Really?
I still don't get it, but
that sounds amazing!

00:07:09.736 --> 00:07:13.405
[HESTIA, voiceover]
Y‐yeah... totally amazing.

00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:16.342
So amazing that my legs
were falling asleep...

00:07:16.442 --> 00:07:17.610
[BELL, voiceover]
What do you mean?

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.145
[HESTIA, voiceover]
Oh? That reminds me,

00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:22.348
I wonder how much I still have
left to pay on the loan...

00:07:22.448 --> 00:07:24.150
I'd forgotten until just now...

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.319
[BELL, voiceover] G‐Goddess?
You seem kind of down all of
a sudden...

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.691
[HESTIA, voiceover] Oh, um...
Remind me, what happened after
that again?

00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:33.560
[EINA] Seriously!? Floor 7!?

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.697
But it was only just the
other day you almost got
yourself killed on level 5!

00:07:37.797 --> 00:07:39.866
What in the world makes you
think you're ready for 7!?

00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:41.868
[EINA] How insane can
you possibly be!?

00:07:41.968 --> 00:07:44.537
[BELL, voiceover] I wanted
to go exploring further down
in the Dungeon,

00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:47.473
but I got yelled at by my
Guild advisor, Miss Eina.

00:07:47.574 --> 00:07:49.108
She said I had to form a party.

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:52.211
[HESTIA, voiceover] And she
had a very valid point, too.

00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:56.616
Up until then, you'd only
ever gone into the Dungeon
all by yourself.

00:07:56.716 --> 00:08:00.486
[BELL, voiceover] I'd always
wished I had some friends to go
exploring with in the Dungeon...

00:08:00.587 --> 00:08:03.222
And then, that's when I
happened to meet Lili.

00:08:04.323 --> 00:08:07.594
[LILI] Mister! Hey Mister!
You with the white hair!

00:08:07.694 --> 00:08:09.529
A very good day to you, sir!

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:12.398
Sorry to bother you but would
you happen to be in the market
for a supporter?

00:08:12.498 --> 00:08:17.336
[BELL, voiceover] Liliruca Arde:
a member of the Soma Familia and
a level 1.

00:08:17.436 --> 00:08:20.773
That was the first time
we'd really talked.
It takes me back...

00:08:20.873 --> 00:08:24.043
(HESTIA exaggerated irritation)

00:08:24.143 --> 00:08:27.814
[HESTIA, voiceover] Stay away,
you annoying supporter!
(annoyed)

00:08:27.914 --> 00:08:29.248
[BELL, voiceover]
"Stay away"...?

00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:31.017
[HESTIA, voiceover]
Oh, come on! It's been obvious

00:08:31.117 --> 00:08:33.485
from the very beginning
what she's really after!

00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:36.823
She's so sneaky, you can't trust
her as far as you can throw her!

00:08:36.923 --> 00:08:39.125
[BELL, voiceover] G‐Goddess!
That's a little harsh...

00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:42.228
[HESTIA, voiceover] (pouty)
Harsh? I don't think so.

00:08:42.328 --> 00:08:46.498
Jeez... I mean, she ended up
stealing the knife I gave you,
didn't she?!

00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:49.235
You know what you call
that? She's a thief!

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:50.269
(BELL realization)

00:08:50.369 --> 00:08:51.871
[BELL, voiceover] W‐well...

00:08:51.971 --> 00:08:55.174
Lili had a lot going on around
the time she and I first met...

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:57.510
(scared)

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.612
[GARNEAU] Oo,
that for me!?

00:08:59.712 --> 00:09:02.248
Ah, so then.

00:09:02.348 --> 00:09:04.083
I see ya got
more than usual!

00:09:04.183 --> 00:09:08.387
Well, sorry, it still
ain't quite enough though,
is it? (laughs)

00:09:08.487 --> 00:09:13.660
[GARNEAU] You're lucky, a twerp
like you wouldn't have a chance
to join the Soma Familia.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.828
You know who you have
to thank, doncha?!

00:09:15.928 --> 00:09:18.998
[LILI] (pain)It's.. it's all
because of the adventurers...

00:09:19.098 --> 00:09:24.537
[BELL, voiceover] Lili had been
pushed around by adventurers for
so long that she came to despise
them.

00:09:24.637 --> 00:09:28.941
In order to guarantee her
freedom, she needed all the
money she could get her hands
on.

00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:33.780
[HESTIA, voiceover] Yeah, I
know. She had it rough, blah
blah blah.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.617
And you're the one who ended up
having to go and save her.

00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:44.691
[LILI, internal] I was so
lonely... I just wanted to
be needed by someone.

00:09:46.258 --> 00:09:48.394
But it's over now...

00:09:48.494 --> 00:09:50.897
I'm finally going to die.

00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:54.166
After a lifetime
of helplessness...

00:09:54.266 --> 00:10:00.139
Weakness... Worthlessness...
and loneliness.

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:06.546
It's all coming to an end...
Finally... I'm going to die.

00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:07.680
[BELL] Lili...

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.916
[LILI] I'm going to die?!

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.284
[BELL] Fire bolt!

00:10:19.258 --> 00:10:24.531
Master Bell... How did
you.. get back here?

00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:27.399
I'm glad I made it in time.

00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:28.334
[LILI] Why?

00:10:28.434 --> 00:10:29.569
Huh?

00:10:29.669 --> 00:10:31.170
I want to know why!

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.505
Why did you come back and save
me when you know good and well

00:10:33.606 --> 00:10:35.575
you should've left me
to die, Master Bell!

00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:37.276
Huh? What?

00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:41.147
[BELL] Actually,
it's cause it was you.

00:10:41.247 --> 00:10:42.515
(LILI gasp)

00:10:42.615 --> 00:10:46.553
Really. That's why
I wanted to do it.

00:10:46.653 --> 00:10:49.221
I only did it because
it was you, Lili.

00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:52.424
(LILI crying)

00:10:52.525 --> 00:10:57.296
[BELL] I didn't want to lose
you. That's all there is to it.

00:10:57.396 --> 00:10:58.665
[BELL] You're reason enough.

00:10:58.765 --> 00:11:01.100
(LILI gasp, crying)

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.805
Lili.. if you're ever in
trouble. Just tell me.

00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:10.209
I never told you this, and I
probably already should have..

00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:12.211
[BELL] But I will always
be here for you.

00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:16.649
(sobbing)

00:11:16.749 --> 00:11:17.984
(surprised)

00:11:18.084 --> 00:11:21.521
(crying)

00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:23.089
[BELL] It's okay.

00:11:24.624 --> 00:11:28.995
[BELL, voiceover] Even now,
I can't imagine not having
Lili in our party.

00:11:29.862 --> 00:11:32.064
[BELL] She's so important to me.

00:11:34.567 --> 00:11:38.337
Nobody's ever taught you how
to truly fight.. have they?

00:11:38.437 --> 00:11:39.872
No...

00:11:43.576 --> 00:11:44.877
[AIS] Well..

00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:47.647
Then what would you say
to letting me teach you?

00:11:47.747 --> 00:11:49.115
(shock)

00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:51.851
(HESTIA exaggerated gasp)

00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:54.420
[HESTIA, voiceover] Well,
if it isn't that dumb
Wallen‐whaters‐whatever!

00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:56.889
[BELL, voiceover] Come on.
Please don't be like that.

00:11:56.989 --> 00:11:59.959
Miss Ais put a lot of time
and effort into training me.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.728
[HESTIA, voiceover] Well...

00:12:01.828 --> 00:12:03.162
I suppose I must admit

00:12:03.262 --> 00:12:06.065
she did play a role in
helping you get stronger.

00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:10.069
And the truth is, if she hadn't
agreed to train you back then...

00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:11.571
[BELL, voiceover] That's right.

00:12:11.671 --> 00:12:14.941
That monster probably would
have gotten the best of me.

00:12:15.908 --> 00:12:17.744
(nervous turn)

00:12:21.247 --> 00:12:27.053
[BELL, voiceover] A minotaur...
Never in a million years would
I have expected one to appear
on that floor.

00:12:27.153 --> 00:12:28.855
And the fact that I had
to fight it like that...

00:12:28.955 --> 00:12:32.291
[HESTIA, voiceover]
Even looking back on it
now, it's totally insane.

00:12:32.391 --> 00:12:34.126
You were only a level 1...

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:38.397
If you think about it, there's
no way you should've been able
to win against that thing.

00:12:38.497 --> 00:12:39.298
[AIS] Are you all right?

00:12:39.398 --> 00:12:40.432
(gasp)

00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:41.433
[AIS] You did very well..

00:12:41.534 --> 00:12:43.102
but I'll save you now.

00:12:43.202 --> 00:12:45.605
[HESTIA, voiceover]
Only, she didn't have
to save you this time.

00:12:45.705 --> 00:12:46.505
(AIS gasp)

00:12:46.606 --> 00:12:49.308
[BELL] I won't do it..

00:12:49.408 --> 00:12:53.145
I will not let Ais Wallenstein
rescue me anymore!

00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:55.147
Never again!

00:12:55.247 --> 00:12:59.051
[BELL, voiceover] Right. That
was my very first adventure.

00:12:59.986 --> 00:13:01.420
(BELL charging in)

00:13:01.521 --> 00:13:05.091
(fighting)

00:13:18.605 --> 00:13:21.207
[HESTIA, voiceover]
There are different levels
amongst adventurers.

00:13:21.307 --> 00:13:25.144
Changes in an adventurer's
status don't have an effect
on their level.

00:13:25.244 --> 00:13:28.781
The only way for them to
raise their level is through
adventures.

00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:29.716
[BELL] Exactly.

00:13:29.816 --> 00:13:32.418
(charging in)

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:33.485
Bell, no!

00:13:33.586 --> 00:13:34.521
He'll be fine.

00:13:34.621 --> 00:13:37.189
(fighting continues)

00:13:47.534 --> 00:13:49.335
[BELL] Fire Bolt.

00:13:49.435 --> 00:13:52.371
(pain roar)

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.479
What? You want some more?

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.781
[BELL] Fire Bolt!

00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:03.983
(pain)

00:14:04.083 --> 00:14:05.384
(grunts)
(gasps)

00:14:05.484 --> 00:14:06.686
(uneasy)

00:14:06.786 --> 00:14:10.289
Fire bolt!

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:12.424
(roaring)

00:14:23.636 --> 00:14:25.304
[LILI]
Master Bell...

00:14:26.806 --> 00:14:30.577
[HESTIA, voiceover] That
adventure definitely made
you a lot stronger.

00:14:30.677 --> 00:14:33.680
You make me so proud, Bell.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.183
[BELL, voiceover]
Thank you, Goddess.

00:14:37.283 --> 00:14:39.886
[HESTIA, voiceover]
And that's how you managed
to rank up so quickly.

00:14:39.986 --> 00:14:44.356
You became a level two
adventurer: the Little
Rookie, Bell Cranel.

00:14:44.456 --> 00:14:46.158
(BELL shy laugh)

00:14:46.258 --> 00:14:48.795
[BELL, voiceover] I still get
a little embarrassed when you
introduce me like that.

00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:53.032
[HESTIA, voiceover] The higher
your level, the further down
into the Dungeon you can
venture.

00:14:53.132 --> 00:14:57.369
But in order to do that, you've
got to have a few more friends
you can always count on.

00:14:57.469 --> 00:15:02.542
[BELL, voiceover] Right around
the time I was thinking about
expanding our party, I met Welf.

00:15:02.642 --> 00:15:03.510
(snort)

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.244
(laughter)
(confused)

00:15:05.344 --> 00:15:08.147
(cracking up)

00:15:08.581 --> 00:15:10.249
(confused)

00:15:10.349 --> 00:15:15.822
[WELF] Shop till ya' drop, kid!
Armor by Welf Crozzo.

00:15:15.922 --> 00:15:20.960
[HESTIA, voiceover] Welf Crozzo:
A blacksmith of the Hephaistos
Familia, and a level one.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.262
You had admired his work for
quite a while, hadn't you?

00:15:23.362 --> 00:15:28.367
[BELL, voiceover] Yes! So I was
really happy he agreed to make
special arrangements for me.

00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:31.337
And not only that,
he joined our party!

00:15:31.437 --> 00:15:33.505
[HESTIA, voiceover] Good
thing you met him, huh?

00:15:33.606 --> 00:15:38.044
I was also pretty glad your new
party member wasn't a girl. It
was such a relief!

00:15:38.144 --> 00:15:39.846
[BELL, voiceover] Is that
what you cared about...?

00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:41.914
(BELL awkward laugh)

00:15:42.014 --> 00:15:45.952
[BELL, voiceover] Well... with
Welf joining us, that brought
our party to three people.

00:15:46.052 --> 00:15:48.087
We decided to forge on ahead
into the middle floors.

00:15:48.187 --> 00:15:51.524
[HESTIA, voiceover] And that's
where the dungeon gets much more
challenging.

00:15:51.624 --> 00:15:54.193
The monsters are very
different and a lot stronger

00:15:54.293 --> 00:15:56.428
than anything you had
encountered on the upper floors.

00:15:56.529 --> 00:15:59.465
[BELL, voiceover] Right..
We prepared ourselves as
best we could

00:15:59.566 --> 00:16:03.469
and planned to attack
everything head on. But...

00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:05.538
[LILI] There's more?

00:16:06.205 --> 00:16:07.874
That's not all either..

00:16:07.974 --> 00:16:09.375
(gasp)

00:16:11.611 --> 00:16:13.880
[BELL] (sigh)
Looks like we're surrounded.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.951
[WELF] Why do the monsters on
these middle floors always catch
up to us so fast?

00:16:19.051 --> 00:16:21.387
[LILI] Yeah. That's just
how it works down here.

00:16:21.487 --> 00:16:26.559
[BELL, voiceover] It didn't
matter how much we'd tried to
prepare, or how many people we
had in our party.

00:16:26.659 --> 00:16:29.629
None of it made a difference,
and the Dungeon didn't care.

00:16:29.729 --> 00:16:32.932
[HESTIA, voiceover] That, and
there was also the accident.

00:16:33.032 --> 00:16:35.301
No use worrying about it now...

00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:38.470
Though at the time, when
you guys didn't come back..

00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:41.641
I was totally out of my
mind worrying about you.

00:16:41.741 --> 00:16:43.142
[BELL, voiceover] I'm sorry...

00:16:43.242 --> 00:16:45.111
But you really surprised me.

00:16:45.211 --> 00:16:47.379
I didn't think you'd come
to rescue me yourself.

00:16:47.479 --> 00:16:48.447
(HESTIA giggle)

00:16:48.548 --> 00:16:50.883
[HESTIA, voiceover]
Well of course I did!

00:16:50.983 --> 00:16:55.387
If it's for you, Bell, come hell
or high water or the Dungeon...

00:16:55.487 --> 00:16:59.191
I'll spring to your side
no matter where you are!

00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:01.060
(BELL awkward laughter)
(HESTIA giggling)

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.362
[BELL, voiceover] But
seriously, I was so happy.

00:17:03.462 --> 00:17:09.802
And it wasn't just you. Miss
Mikoto and her party, Master
Hermes, and even Miss Ryu came
to help.

00:17:09.902 --> 00:17:13.540
[HESTIA, voiceover] It was all
because everyone was so
concerned about you.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.409
Though to be honest, the whole
thing was pretty dangerous, huh?

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.346
[BELL, voiceover] Well... Yes.

00:17:24.884 --> 00:17:27.587
(waking up)

00:17:27.687 --> 00:17:28.487
(gasp)

00:17:28.588 --> 00:17:29.722
Welf! L‐Lili!

00:17:29.822 --> 00:17:31.023
(pain)

00:17:31.123 --> 00:17:31.958
[AIS] Are you all right?

00:17:32.058 --> 00:17:33.159
Hm?

00:17:34.126 --> 00:17:36.495
[BELL] Wha...? Wha...?

00:17:36.596 --> 00:17:37.797
[BELL] What?!

00:17:37.897 --> 00:17:39.431
[HESTIA, voiceover]
Whoa whoa wait!

00:17:39.532 --> 00:17:42.569
What's that stupid
Wallen‐whaters‐who'sit
doing here again?!

00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:45.872
[BELL, voiceover] I‐I‐I'm
sorry! I really am sorry!

00:17:45.972 --> 00:17:51.177
I‐I mean... We somehow
managed to escape to the
safe zone on the 18th Floor.

00:17:51.277 --> 00:17:56.048
That's when we ran into the Loki
Familia on their way back from
an expedition, and they ended up
saving us...

00:17:56.148 --> 00:17:58.017
[HESTIA, voiceover]
I know, but still!

00:17:58.117 --> 00:18:00.019
[HESTIA] Hmph!
(BELL awkward laugh)

00:18:00.119 --> 00:18:01.521
[BELL, voiceover] Uh, but...

00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:03.990
I was really caught off guard
when I saw the 18th Floor.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.391
[HESTIA, voiceover] Ahh?

00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:08.060
The Labyrinth Paradise:
Under Resort.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.231
I guess most anyone would be
surprised to see a town smack in
the middle of the Dungeon.

00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:15.635
[BELL, voiceover] I'll never
forget that amazing view
for the rest of my life.

00:18:15.735 --> 00:18:16.936
(HESTIA giggling)

00:18:17.036 --> 00:18:20.072
[HESTIA, voiceover] That's
a very "Bell" thing to say...

00:18:20.172 --> 00:18:22.408
Huh? Hold on just a second...

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:24.243
[BELL, voiceover]
Is something wrong?

00:18:24.343 --> 00:18:26.345
[HESTIA, voiceover] When you
say an "amazing view"

00:18:26.445 --> 00:18:27.880
that you won't forget...

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.852
You had better not be talking
about that one incident...

00:18:32.952 --> 00:18:34.521
[BELL, hesitant] "Incident"...?

00:18:35.187 --> 00:18:36.723
Listen to me kid.

00:18:36.823 --> 00:18:40.226
Spying on chicks is how a man
expresses his feelings. Duh.

00:18:40.326 --> 00:18:42.161
(falling scream)

00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:43.129
(LADIES scream)

00:18:43.229 --> 00:18:44.797
Oops.

00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:47.366
(coughing)

00:18:47.466 --> 00:18:49.602
[TIONA] Hey! It's Mr. Argonaut!

00:18:49.702 --> 00:18:52.572
Did you want to come
take a bath with us too?

00:18:52.672 --> 00:18:55.374
Wow and here I was
thinking you were all
sweet and innocent.

00:18:55.474 --> 00:19:01.614
[BELL] N‐n‐no! Granted, it was
definitely an amazing view I'll
never, ever forget, but...

00:19:01.714 --> 00:19:03.215
[BELL, voiceover] Wait,
that's not the point!

00:19:03.315 --> 00:19:06.052
[HESTIA] (sigh) I was
shocked by your behavior.

00:19:06.152 --> 00:19:07.754
What on Earth were you thinking?

00:19:07.854 --> 00:19:10.022
[BELL, voiceover] This is all
a misunderstanding, Goddess!

00:19:10.122 --> 00:19:11.891
I swear I wasn't
trying to peep...!

00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:14.026
[HESTIA, voiceover] I guess
I can't be too mad...

00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:17.129
And I bet Hermes was the one
who talked you into it, anyway.

00:19:17.229 --> 00:19:19.966
(BELL hesitation)
(sheepish laughter)

00:19:20.066 --> 00:19:21.467
(embarrassed gasp)

00:19:21.568 --> 00:19:22.234
I...

00:19:22.334 --> 00:19:24.637
I'm sorry!

00:19:25.404 --> 00:19:27.173
(embarrassed yell)

00:19:27.574 --> 00:19:28.741
(gasps)

00:19:35.181 --> 00:19:36.883
[ASFI] What is this?

00:19:36.983 --> 00:19:40.186
[HERMES] The dungeon wants
to express it's revulsion.

00:19:40.286 --> 00:19:43.523
So it's chosen to
trap us all inside.

00:19:44.757 --> 00:19:49.562
(roar)

00:19:53.165 --> 00:19:57.503
(heavy breathing)

00:19:57.604 --> 00:19:58.437
(yell)

00:19:58.538 --> 00:20:00.372
[HERMES] Just as I thought..

00:20:00.472 --> 00:20:01.874
it's the floor boss.

00:20:01.974 --> 00:20:05.111
[BELL, voiceover] The black
Floor Boss that showed up...

00:20:05.211 --> 00:20:07.446
I still can't wrap
my head around it.

00:20:07.547 --> 00:20:10.617
That was the first time I'd ever
seen such a terrifying monster.

00:20:10.717 --> 00:20:16.022
[HESTIA, voiceover] It wasn't
just you, Bell. No matter how
you spin it, that thing was
irregular.

00:20:16.122 --> 00:20:20.259
It wasn't the sort of monster
you'd normally come across while
exploring the Dungeon.

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:26.332
[BELL, voiceover] We had so many
adventurers... and yet no one
able to put a scratch on it...

00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:32.905
[HESTIA, voiceover] Even so, not
a single one of them ran away.

00:20:35.507 --> 00:20:39.946
[HESTIA, voiceover] Every
adventurer on that battlefield
joined together to fight.

00:20:45.351 --> 00:20:50.590
[HESTIA, voiceover] They didn't
give in. They all rose to face a
fearsome enemy.

00:20:56.462 --> 00:20:58.631
[HESTIA, voiceover]
Including you, Bell.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:10.843
[BELL'S GRANDPA] Let your
feelings burn like fire.
Cry out with all your desire!

00:21:10.943 --> 00:21:15.615
[HESTIA, voiceover] The skill
that had manifested itself in
you, "Argonaut"...

00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:18.951
The potential to turn the
tide in any situation...

00:21:19.051 --> 00:21:24.624
The ticket to a child achieving
his dream of wanting so badly to
become a hero...

00:21:37.537 --> 00:21:44.343
[HESTIA, voiceover] A measly
little skill that holds its
own when used against an
overwhelmingly powerful enemy.

00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:46.646
In other words...

00:21:47.313 --> 00:21:48.480
(roaring)

00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:50.617
[HESTIA, voiceover]
A Hero's Shot!

00:21:58.891 --> 00:22:02.895
(dying yell)

00:22:08.568 --> 00:22:12.839
(CROWD cheering)

00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:16.809
[LILI] Master Bell! You
actually defeated Goliath!

00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:22.114
[CLOSING SONG,
"Right Light Rise"]

00:22:22.214 --> 00:22:23.850
[HESTIA, voiceover] Oh, man!

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.053
Looking back on everything,
we really went through a lot,
didn't we?

00:22:27.153 --> 00:22:32.158
[BELL, voiceover] We did.
I'll never forget a single
moment of it.

00:22:32.258 --> 00:22:33.693
Speaking of which, Goddess...

00:22:33.793 --> 00:22:36.262
Which part of our journey stands
out in your mind the most?

00:22:36.362 --> 00:22:38.230
[HESTIA, voiceover] Hm? Me?

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:44.804
Well it'd have to be... the time
you confessed your love to me.
It was so sweet.

00:22:44.904 --> 00:22:45.504
[BELL] What?!

00:22:45.605 --> 00:22:46.606
[HESTIA] You told me,

00:22:46.706 --> 00:22:48.274
"I love you, Goddess."

00:22:48.374 --> 00:22:50.643
Then you pressed your
body up against mine...

00:22:50.743 --> 00:22:54.446
Holding tight, you pinned
me to the bed and then you...!

00:22:54.547 --> 00:22:57.349
[BELL] No, no, no! Nothing
like that ever happened!

00:22:57.449 --> 00:23:01.153
[HESTIA] Well jeez,
don't get all mad, Bell.

00:23:01.253 --> 00:23:05.424
Maybe we'll finally get
to see something like that
happen in "Danmachi 2"!

00:23:05.525 --> 00:23:08.595
(HESTIA devious laughter)

00:23:08.695 --> 00:23:10.630
[BELL] I really don't
think we will...

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:16.569
Uh, still... Looking back on
everything made me even more
excited for the future.

00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:18.437
What kind of adventures
are waiting for us?

00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:20.640
What kinds of people
will we get to meet?

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.208
[HESTIA] Yup, same here.

00:23:22.308 --> 00:23:25.311
And I'm also looking forward
to seeing everyone out there

00:23:25.411 --> 00:23:27.346
joining us in our
adventures again.

00:23:27.446 --> 00:23:28.615
[BELL] Yeah!

00:23:28.715 --> 00:23:30.850
Oh, it's about time
I head to the Dungeon.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.752
I'm meeting up
with Welf and Lili.

00:23:32.852 --> 00:23:36.523
[HESTIA] Oh really?
Then you better get going, Bell!

00:23:36.623 --> 00:23:39.125
And of course,
you be careful, okay.

00:23:39.225 --> 00:23:41.728
[BELL] Right! I'm off, Goddess!

00:23:47.366 --> 00:23:49.869
[HESTIA] Next time: "Party."
