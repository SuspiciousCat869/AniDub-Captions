WEBVTT

00:00:02.503 --> 00:00:06.773
[HESTIA] So you stayed overnight
in the red light district, huh?!

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:08.909
[BELL] Y‐yeah.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.176
[MIKOTO] Lady Hestia!

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.945
[MIKOTO] I told you,
this is all my fault!

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.146
Master Bell wasn't‐

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.748
[HESTIA] I don't wanna
hear it, Mikoto.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:15.749
(MIKOTO hesitant)

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.651
Now be honest with me, Bell.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:22.155
Did you get all the fun
outta your system while
you were there?

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.890
[BELL] What do you mean uh...?

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.826
Uh? No! I would never!

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.160
Well I can't help but wonder

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.795
what exactly you were
doing all night long...

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.766
[HESTIA] Mind explaining why
you had this on you? Hmmm?

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.100
(BELL mortified)

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.536
Now let's do each
other a favor...

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:37.771
and pretend we never
saw one other here.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:38.939
[HERMES] Sound agreeable?

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.607
(BELL hesitation)

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.810
I‐I promise I didn't do
anything questionable...

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.680
(HESTIA annoyed)

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.482
[MIKOTO] Lady Hestia...

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.384
(HESTIA big sigh)

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:55.255
Our children can't
lie in the presence of a god.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.758
Bell must be telling the truth.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.225
(BELL sigh of relief)

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.995
[HESTIA] However..! I will
not excuse you going there!

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:05.999
[HESTIA] The fact that you even
stepped foot in that sort of
place is totally unforgivable!

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.934
[BELL] Like I said,
I wasn't there on my‐!

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:09.503
[HESTIA] I have no choice
but to punish you!

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:11.738
[HESTIA] Go make yourself
useful around the neighborhood!

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.240
O.. kay..

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:22.448
(BELL sigh)

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.251
[BELL] I really
disappointed Lady Hestia.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.020
[GIRL A] Mr. Hero,
please save me!

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.121
(BELL notice)
(GIRL A whimpering)

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.089
[BOY A] Back, foul beast!

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.256
Release the princess!

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.092
(BOY B monster roar)
(GIRL A scream)

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.094
(BELL smile)

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.699
Why would anyone want to rescue
a woman as disgraceful as I?

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.770
(internal) I wish I could
have said something to make
her feel better...

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:52.278
[OPENING SONG, "HELLO to DREAM"]

00:03:24.896 --> 00:03:26.998
[MIKOTO] Master Bell!

00:03:27.098 --> 00:03:28.400
Looks like you could
use a hand.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.570
Huh? But this.. is
my punishment though.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.141
[WELF] As I recall,
we were right there with
ya'. We're just as guilty.

00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:37.543
[LILI] We have to take
responsibility, too.

00:03:37.643 --> 00:03:41.313
Although I am pretty curious
as to what kept you there
all night long.

00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:42.881
(BELL nervous laugh)

00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:49.655
My selfish behavior
caused all the trouble.
My apologies, Master Bell.

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:51.590
[BELL] Don't worry
about it, Miss Mikoto.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.194
[BELL] So why'd you go
to the Pleasure Quarter
in the first place?

00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:58.464
[MIKOTO] I was searching for
someone, specifically a Renard.

00:03:58.564 --> 00:04:01.200
I had heard she was somewhere
within the district.

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:04.035
[BELL] Renard...?

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:06.872
[MIKOTO] Sadly.. I
never did find her...

00:04:06.972 --> 00:04:09.641
By any chance, is her
name Miss Haruhime?

00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:13.445
(gasp) Who told you that?! Do
you know something about her?!

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:17.249
Huh? Well, the.. truth is..

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.951
[MIKOTO] I see...

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.087
[MIKOTO] I didn't want
to believe the rumor,

00:04:22.188 --> 00:04:25.524
but I guess she really was
working in the brothels.

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:28.594
Someone as innocent as her...

00:04:28.694 --> 00:04:30.162
[BELL] Miss Mikoto...

00:04:30.962 --> 00:04:31.963
[BELL] What if..

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.232
[LILI] Don't you dare even
think

00:04:33.332 --> 00:04:35.201
about going back to
try and save her.

00:04:35.301 --> 00:04:37.569
(BELL, MIKOTO &amp; WELF Hm?)
[BELL] Lili..

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.239
We just barely made it through
that whole War Game thing.

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:42.374
Are you already picking
another fight?

00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:45.377
I hope you realize what
a huge burden you'd be
putting on Lady Hestia.

00:04:45.477 --> 00:04:47.846
(BELL worried)
(WELF sigh) (smirk)

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:51.883
C'mon, Lil Bit. You
don't always have to
be the wet blanket.

00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:55.154
[LILI] (embarrassed) I..
I'm just trying to help!

00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:59.325
As a member of your Familia..
I gotta agree with Lil Bit here.

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:02.661
[WELF] We can't go putting
ourselves at risk.
(BELL sigh)

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:06.165
[MIKOTO] I would agree Bell,
don't worry about it, okay?

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:08.567
Please just try to forget
about this whole thing.

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:12.504
[HERMES] I'm begging you, Mia!
Just one message to Lady Freya!

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:15.574
[MIA] You think you can just
show up outta the blue and
bark orders at me?

00:05:15.674 --> 00:05:17.543
[MIA] Whatever it is,
you can tell her yourself.

00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:20.312
[HERMES] I'm genuinely afraid
for my life this time!

00:05:20.412 --> 00:05:24.115
[HERMES] Plus Bell will be
in hot water himself if we
don't do something!

00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:26.885
[MIA] Wait how's the kid
mixed up in this mess?

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:30.956
Listen, Mia it's not
good.. Ishtar has her
sights set on him!

00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:33.559
Huh?! Why the hell's she
coming outta the woodwork?!

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.130
This one was out of my
hands! It wasn't my fault!
I swear! (blubbering)

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.634
What do you mean when you
say Bell is in "hot water".
What have you done?

00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:44.436
[HERMES] (startled!) Syr?!

00:05:44.536 --> 00:05:47.839
Also, how does Lady Ishtar even
know about him to begin with?

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:51.543
[SYR] I don't suppose you
took him to a house of ill
repute, did you?

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:54.713
O‐of course not! I
swear to the gods!

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:58.917
You wouldn't lie would you?
Imagine what would happen if
we found out otherwise.

00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:03.522
[HERMES] S‐Syr! Good little
girls don't go around
threatening gods, you know!

00:06:03.622 --> 00:06:05.824
(MIA ugh) (groan)

00:06:05.924 --> 00:06:07.859
(CROWD murmur)

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:08.727
[EINA] Bell?

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.162
(BELL notice)

00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:11.430
[BELL] Miss Eina.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.631
(EINA smile)

00:06:12.731 --> 00:06:15.000
[EINA] So let me guess...
Something on your mind?

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.435
(BELL surprised)

00:06:16.535 --> 00:06:18.737
Please, I can read
your face like a book.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.940
I don't think I have to say it,
but I AM your advisor.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.842
[EINA] You can tell me anything.

00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:25.511
[BELL] (considers) Right!

00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.747
[EINA] You spent the
night in a bordello?!

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.749
It...was out of my hands...

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.586
Well.. I suppose you are
a typical boy after all...

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:38.690
So I can see how you might
get curious about that
sort of thing...

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.426
[EINA] But... but I...!

00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:44.230
[EINA] I can't condone it!
Don't ever go there again,
do you hear me?!

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.365
(BELL startled)
[BELL] Pl.. Please forgive me!

00:06:48.134 --> 00:06:51.770
[EINA] So, you wanted to know
about... the Ishtar Familia,
is that correct?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.904
[BELL] Yes.

00:06:53.004 --> 00:06:54.373
[EINA] They're a
top‐class Familia

00:06:54.473 --> 00:06:56.742
in terms of both their track
record in the Dungeon

00:06:56.842 --> 00:06:59.345
and their business exploits.

00:06:59.445 --> 00:07:01.147
And a fair share
of their combatants

00:07:01.247 --> 00:07:03.014
are at level three or higher.

00:07:03.114 --> 00:07:05.684
[EINA] Phryne Jamil
is their captain..

00:07:05.784 --> 00:07:08.387
and a first‐class
adventurer at level five.

00:07:08.487 --> 00:07:09.255
(BELL gasp)

00:07:09.355 --> 00:07:10.789
[BELL] Miss Phryne...

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.424
[EINA] And from what I heard,

00:07:12.524 --> 00:07:15.227
even Miss Wallenstein was nearly
defeated by their captain once.

00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:18.096
[BELL] What?! Miss Ais?!

00:07:18.197 --> 00:07:19.798
[EINA] Although that
was several years ago.

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:23.569
I believe, Miss Jamil was
a higher level than Miss
Ais back then.

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:25.437
That makes more sense...

00:07:25.537 --> 00:07:31.410
Say.. do you know anything about
an Amazon.. named Aisha or a
Renard named Miss Haruhime?

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:37.216
[EINA] Everyone knows Aisha
Belka. She's a level three,
but she's supposedly close
to ranking up.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.551
[EINA] As for the Renard...

00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:42.788
[EINA] Hmmm... I'm not
seeing her on the list..

00:07:42.888 --> 00:07:45.757
[EINA] She could be a
low‐ranking non‐combatant...

00:07:45.857 --> 00:07:47.092
Why is it you want to know?

00:07:47.193 --> 00:07:49.261
No.. reason..

00:07:51.563 --> 00:07:57.403
Hey, listen, Bell...
Look I shouldn't really
be telling you about
this, however...

00:07:57.503 --> 00:07:58.704
Yeah..?

00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:00.339
Around five years ago..

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:03.742
several Familias.. they made
some serious accusations.

00:08:03.842 --> 00:08:05.877
Against the Ishtar Familia.

00:08:05.977 --> 00:08:09.748
Their power was allegedly far
beyond that which had been
officially reported to the
Guild.

00:08:09.848 --> 00:08:12.918
[BELL] They were lying about
how strong they are? But why?

00:08:13.018 --> 00:08:17.889
[EINA] Yes. The Guild
investigated the claims
but found no evidence to
support them.

00:08:19.057 --> 00:08:22.994
[EINA] However, that
wasn't the end of it.

00:08:23.094 --> 00:08:28.600
[EINA] Ishtar countersued,
levying a harsh penalty against
all the Familias involved.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.337
Many of them ended up stripped
of their authority...

00:08:31.437 --> 00:08:33.539
and then ultimately
they were dissolved.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:34.873
(BELL gasp)

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:36.342
Beyond that..

00:08:36.442 --> 00:08:38.510
Ishtar demanded
compensation
from the Guild.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.481
She claimed confidential
info was leaked during
the investigation. Lies.

00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:45.116
[BELL] She took money
from the Guild...?

00:08:45.217 --> 00:08:46.518
(EINA affirmative)

00:08:46.618 --> 00:08:49.020
This placed us in a rather
precarious position..

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.159
and we've been unable to
intervene in the red‐light
district ever since.

00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:54.593
(BELL gasp)

00:08:54.693 --> 00:08:56.828
[EINA] Bell... The
Ishtar Familia is

00:08:56.928 --> 00:08:59.765
much stronger and more
fearsome than they appear.

00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:03.402
[EINA] If I were you,
I'd avoid them at all costs.

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.839
[BELL] It's just
like Lili said...

00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:11.543
(internal) If I get mixed up
with the Ishtar Familia more
than I already have..

00:09:11.643 --> 00:09:14.880
I'm going to cause trouble
for Goddess Hestia and
everyone else...

00:09:21.887 --> 00:09:23.455
[BELL] Hero stories...

[HERO'S VOICE] Thou art

00:09:37.002 --> 00:09:41.773
[BELL] "The hero falls prey to a
prostitute, nearly resulting in
his downfall."

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:46.545
[BELL] "Then, he casts her
aside, restoring his honor
once more."

00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:52.318
Besides, to a hero.. prostitutes
are harbingers of ruin.

00:09:52.418 --> 00:09:55.521
[BELL] A prostitute could never
stand at a hero's side...

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.328
Oh Grandpa...
What should I do...?

00:10:06.298 --> 00:10:08.099
[PROSTITUTE A] Ooh..hey there...

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.236
[PROSTITUTE B] We won't bite
you.

00:10:11.203 --> 00:10:13.139
[AISHA] Haruhime.

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:14.406
[AISHA] Haruhime.

00:10:14.506 --> 00:10:15.941
(HARUHIME snaps out of it)

00:10:17.143 --> 00:10:18.277
[HARUHIME] Yes, Aisha...

00:10:18.377 --> 00:10:21.012
Something wrong?
You look out of it.

00:10:21.112 --> 00:10:24.816
No.. you caught me
daydreaming is all.

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:28.254
[HARUHIME] A dream that
will never come to pass...

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.725
I came across a merchant
selling those on the street.

00:10:33.825 --> 00:10:37.129
[AISHA] He said it's a type
of candy from the Far East.

00:10:37.229 --> 00:10:39.898
(HARUHIME gasp) (smile)

00:10:39.998 --> 00:10:45.571
I'm truly grateful for
your kindness. Thank you.

00:10:46.305 --> 00:10:47.539
(AISHA annoyed)

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:50.041
No need to thank me for
something so trivial.

00:10:50.142 --> 00:10:51.410
[HARUHIME] Oh...

00:10:54.146 --> 00:10:55.781
[MIKOTO] Hey Haruhime!

00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:56.882
(HARUHIME notice)

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.219
Over here!
It's me, Mikoto!

00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:01.820
(HARUHIME quiet freak‐out)

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.722
[MIKOTO] Don't you remember who
I am?! We were friends...

00:11:03.822 --> 00:11:07.226
[MIKOTO] We ran around the
fields back in the Far East!

00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:08.960
[MIKOTO] Quickly, come with me!

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.698
[HARUHIME] Sorry... I
don't think I know you.

00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:13.732
(MIKOTO gasp)

00:11:13.832 --> 00:11:16.001
[HARUHIME] I'm afraid
you're mistaken.

00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:19.405
Now if you will excuse me.

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:21.340
[MIKOTO] No don't go!

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.409
[MIKOTO] Lady Haruhime!

00:11:31.217 --> 00:11:33.051
[BELL] What?! You saw
Miss Haruhime?!

00:11:33.152 --> 00:11:37.489
[MIKOTO] I did. However,
she wouldn't acknowledge me.

00:11:38.357 --> 00:11:39.858
She claimed she didn't know me.

00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:40.959
I don't believe that.

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:42.428
(BELL concerned)

00:11:42.528 --> 00:11:44.596
[BELL] Miss.. Mikoto.. ?

00:11:44.696 --> 00:11:49.501
So, what kind of person was
she back when you were younger?

00:11:49.601 --> 00:11:52.138
Lady Haruhime is
the sole reason...

00:11:52.238 --> 00:11:56.041
That I received a blessing
to join a Familia. I owe her
everything.

00:11:56.142 --> 00:11:59.211
[MIKOTO] Lady Chigusa, Master
Ouka and I were brought up

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:05.016
at a shrine in the Far East by
Master Takemikazuchi. As well as
the other gods who lived there.

00:12:05.116 --> 00:12:10.088
[MIKOTO] We lived in poverty,
but it was warm and loving
nonetheless.

00:12:11.557 --> 00:12:15.827
[MIKOTO] Lady Haruhime's
mansion sat at the foot
of a nearby mountain.

00:12:15.927 --> 00:12:20.999
[MIKOTO] She was born into a
family of nobles and had rarely
set foot in the outside world..

00:12:22.434 --> 00:12:26.472
[MIKOTO] but at some point, she
must've heard about the shrine.

00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:32.244
[YOUNG HARUHIME] Father.. I
couldn't possibly eat all of
this myself.

00:12:32.344 --> 00:12:36.282
[YOUNG HARUHIME] Can we please..
take it to the gods at the
shrine and share it with them?

00:12:36.382 --> 00:12:41.453
[MIKOTO] That was the first
time in her life she had asked
anything of her father.

00:12:42.921 --> 00:12:45.857
[MIKOTO] We at the shrine became
rather acquainted with Lady
Haruhime.

00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:49.495
[MIKOTO] And yet, Master
Takemikazuchi couldn't bring
himself

00:12:49.595 --> 00:12:54.766
to ignore this lonely,
sweet, little girl locked
away inside her mansion.

00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:57.803
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] Go on...
Why don't you bring her
outside to play!

00:12:57.903 --> 00:12:58.937
(BELL chuckle)

00:12:59.037 --> 00:13:01.440
That sounds just
like him, honestly.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.644
Admittedly.. I also felt
compelled to become a hero.

00:13:06.678 --> 00:13:09.248
I wanted to try and
erase the girl's pain,

00:13:09.348 --> 00:13:11.750
who kindly saved us
with her generosity.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.820
[BELL] So that's when you
received your blessing then,
huh?

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.222
[MIKOTO] Yes.

00:13:16.322 --> 00:13:19.458
After acquiring my status, Lady
Chigusa, Master Ouka and I,

00:13:19.558 --> 00:13:21.827
we headed to the mansion.

00:13:23.362 --> 00:13:26.298
[MIKOTO] We would slip past the
guards and bring Lady Haruhime

00:13:26.398 --> 00:13:29.935
out to the mountain
almost every single day.

00:13:30.035 --> 00:13:32.138
[MIKOTO] Eventually,
the guards caught on.

00:13:32.238 --> 00:13:35.407
We had to get a lot
more creative if we
wanted to outrun them.

00:13:35.507 --> 00:13:37.943
(YOUNG HARUHIME giggle) (trip)

00:13:38.043 --> 00:13:40.579
[YOUNG MIKOTO] (concerned) Lady
Haruhime!

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.682
[YOUNG MIKOTO] Lady Haruhime,
are you alright?!

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:49.288
You're so amazing! You're
just like the heroes I
always read about!

00:13:49.388 --> 00:13:50.556
(YOUNG MIKOTO thrilled)

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.894
I was so proud.. I felt as
though I had returned the favor.

00:13:55.994 --> 00:13:58.997
Just making her smile
meant the world to me.

00:13:59.097 --> 00:14:00.666
(BELL touched)

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.601
[MIKOTO] Not long after,

00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:04.336
we left the Far East behind..

00:14:04.436 --> 00:14:05.771
and traveled to Orario.

00:14:05.871 --> 00:14:07.573
[MIKOTO] Our plan
was to earn money,

00:14:07.673 --> 00:14:09.541
and send it back
home to the shrine.

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:13.512
[MIKOTO] But while we were
away, we heard rumors...

00:14:13.612 --> 00:14:18.817
[MIKOTO] Someone very cruel
had betrayed Lady Haruhime
and sold her into slavery.

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.619
(BELL shock)

00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:25.724
[MIKOTO] If she's out there
suffering, I want to do
everything I can to help her...

00:14:27.726 --> 00:14:29.027
(BELL determined)

00:14:31.763 --> 00:14:32.964
[BELL] Let's do it.

00:14:33.064 --> 00:14:34.600
[MIKOTO] Huh?

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.668
[BELL] Um, I mean... It'll be
like what you and the others

00:14:36.768 --> 00:14:40.038
did for her.. you
know, back then.

00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:43.309
Yes, but... we're not children
sneaking out of a mansion...

00:14:43.409 --> 00:14:44.810
Much more is at stake.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.513
(BELL conflicted) (notice)

00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:52.351
[BELL] Huh? Master Hermes?

00:14:52.451 --> 00:14:53.652
(HERMES startled)

00:14:53.752 --> 00:14:56.955
[HERMES] H‐hey there,
Bell and Mikoto!

00:14:57.055 --> 00:14:58.790
[BELL] What were you
doing back there?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.226
[HERMES] Huh? Oh,
uh... You know

00:15:00.326 --> 00:15:02.494
I just wanted to make sure
you were safe is all!

00:15:02.594 --> 00:15:04.296
(clueless) [BELL] "Safe?"

00:15:04.396 --> 00:15:07.266
[HERMES] (stammering)
I mean... I just wanted
to check up on you!

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:09.501
[HERMES] Glad to
see you're okay!

00:15:09.601 --> 00:15:11.170
[HERMES] Bye!

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.438
[BELL] Wait! Master Hermes!

00:15:12.538 --> 00:15:15.040
[HERMES] (startled) What is it?

00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:18.610
[BELL] Do you know much
about the situation in
the red‐light district?

00:15:19.778 --> 00:15:21.280
(HERMES intrigued)

00:15:23.114 --> 00:15:26.785
[HERMES] I see. Your friend was
bought by the Ishtar Familia...

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.854
[HERMES] I have to
agree with Lili.

00:15:28.954 --> 00:15:31.823
I cannot advise trying to break
her out of there is a good idea.

00:15:32.758 --> 00:15:34.426
It would certainly
start a fight.

00:15:34.526 --> 00:15:36.595
(BELL &amp; MIKOTO discouraged)

00:15:37.763 --> 00:15:38.964
[HERMES] However...

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:40.699
[HERMES] If she's a prostitute,

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:42.234
that's a totally
different story.

00:15:42.334 --> 00:15:43.735
(BELL &amp; MIKOTO curious)

00:15:43.835 --> 00:15:46.272
[HERMES] Prostitutes can be
bought out of the industry.

00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:47.506
[BELL] Really...?

00:15:47.606 --> 00:15:49.040
[HERMES] It's not
unheard of for clients

00:15:49.141 --> 00:15:52.278
to buy them their freedom..
for a hefty price of course.

00:15:52.378 --> 00:15:54.846
[HERMES] In fact, it's happened
several times in the past.

00:15:54.946 --> 00:16:00.352
[MIKOTO] Okay but... even if
it's possible... Is the Ishtar
Familia really going to just let
her leave?

00:16:00.452 --> 00:16:06.725
[HERMES] Well.. That all
depends on her role. If she is
one of their skilled fighters,
things might get a little dicey.

00:16:06.825 --> 00:16:11.763
[BELL] That's.. not the case!
I believe she is a low‐ranking
non‐combatant!

00:16:11.863 --> 00:16:13.365
Well there you go.

00:16:13.465 --> 00:16:17.136
Ishtar may not be perfect, but
she is still a Goddess of Love.

00:16:17.236 --> 00:16:18.704
She should let her go.

00:16:18.804 --> 00:16:21.607
[HERMES] As long as you pay
her accordingly, that is.

00:16:21.707 --> 00:16:23.942
[MIKOTO] So then... how much
exactly?

00:16:24.042 --> 00:16:26.378
[HERMES] It would depend
on her value of course,

00:16:26.478 --> 00:16:29.815
but I've heard estimates around
two or three million.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.551
That should be easy!

00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:34.820
We should be able to
earn that in no time!

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.790
[HERMES] If you two don't mind..
it might be helpful for me to
know the girl's name.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.027
[HERMES] That way, I can put
some feelers out to see what
Ishtar thinks about it.

00:16:42.128 --> 00:16:45.864
[MIKOTO] (gasp) Haruhime!
Her name is Sanjouno Haruhime!

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.900
[MIKOTO] The same age as me..
and she's a Renard!

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.470
[HERMES] (concerned) Yeah?

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.104
[MIKOTO] Yes!

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:55.641
(HERMES troubled)

00:16:56.542 --> 00:16:57.876
[BELL] Master Hermes...?

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:00.379
[HERMES] As a courier,
it's frowned upon to disclose

00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:03.282
the identity of a client or
the nature of a parcel...

00:17:03.382 --> 00:17:06.818
[HERMES] But I've got a soft
spot for you two, so...

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:08.887
[HERMES] I'll say it.

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.590
The day that I ran into
you in the Pleasure Quarter..

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:16.728
I was actually on my way
to deliver an important
package to Ishtar.

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.530
It held what's called
a "Killing Stone."

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.499
[BELL] That sounds dangerous..

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.334
(door opens)
(HERMES notice)

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.104
That's about all I
can reveal for now.

00:17:26.205 --> 00:17:31.143
I'm off. Catch you later,
Bell.. Mikoto..

00:17:31.243 --> 00:17:33.845
So what do you suppose..
a "Killing Stone" is?

00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:36.047
I've never heard
of it before...

00:17:36.148 --> 00:17:39.385
[BELL] But at least now we know
how to rescue Miss Haruhime!

00:17:39.485 --> 00:17:40.752
[MIKOTO] Right!

00:17:49.595 --> 00:17:51.430
(ISHTAR exhale)

00:17:52.698 --> 00:17:54.500
[ISHTAR] You must retrieve
the Little Rookie.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.001
[LENA] Huh?

00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:59.805
It appears Freya is infatuated
with young Bell Cranel.

00:17:59.905 --> 00:18:02.674
Yet for some reason,
she hasn't made a move.

00:18:02.774 --> 00:18:06.578
I will take him before
she has the chance.

00:18:06.678 --> 00:18:09.815
[ISHTAR] I can only imagine
the look on that hag's face...

00:18:09.915 --> 00:18:13.118
when she learns that I've
taken her little prize away.

00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:16.455
(laughter)
[SAMIRA] That is so
tacky, Lady Ishtar.

00:18:16.555 --> 00:18:18.824
[LENA] Right?

00:18:18.924 --> 00:18:20.559
[ISHTAR] I won't
tolerate any snacking

00:18:20.659 --> 00:18:22.494
once you've caught him.

00:18:22.594 --> 00:18:24.363
[ISHTAR] That means you, Phryne.

00:18:24.463 --> 00:18:27.399
You have a tendency to ruin
every man you get your hands on.

00:18:27.499 --> 00:18:28.600
Oh come on...

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.203
What a rude thing to imply!

00:18:31.303 --> 00:18:36.442
Not my fault men fall
madly in love with all this
succulent meat. (giggles)

00:18:36.542 --> 00:18:37.676
(ISHTAR exhale)

00:18:37.776 --> 00:18:39.545
[ISHTAR] Nevertheless..
I get him first.

00:18:39.645 --> 00:18:42.448
[ISHTAR] I'll give him to you
once I'm completely finished
with him.

00:18:42.548 --> 00:18:43.882
Then you may feast.

00:18:43.982 --> 00:18:45.817
[PHRYNE] Oh... very well.

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:47.886
[ISHTAR] When the full
moon finally arrives...

00:18:47.986 --> 00:18:50.589
[ISHTAR] we complete
the Killing Stone ritual.

00:18:50.689 --> 00:18:51.690
(AISHA concerned)

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.625
And as soon as we're finished..

00:18:53.725 --> 00:18:55.794
we wage war against Freya.

00:18:55.894 --> 00:19:01.533
Knowing we have her precious
boy. She'll be unable to sit
idly by and be forced to engage.

00:19:01.633 --> 00:19:03.101
(ISHTAR laughter)

00:19:03.202 --> 00:19:07.573
[PHRYNE] And? How should we
capture the juicy little rabbit?

00:19:07.673 --> 00:19:12.077
[ISHTAR] I leave that to you..
But do it away from prying eyes.

00:19:12.178 --> 00:19:16.448
[ISHTAR] The Freya Familia
cannot know of our plan.

00:19:16.548 --> 00:19:19.951
[PHRYNE] You know what that
means.. Just one choice girls...

00:19:20.051 --> 00:19:22.921
(PHRYNE toad laughter)

00:19:31.863 --> 00:19:33.265
[WELF] Whoa, whoa!

00:19:33.365 --> 00:19:35.801
You just one‐shot'ed
those Liger Fangs.

00:19:35.901 --> 00:19:38.036
You brought your "A"
game. Impressive.

00:19:38.137 --> 00:19:40.339
Let's not get too
comfortable though.

00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:44.610
The Pantry is just up ahead,
and it's going to be full of
hungry monsters.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.877
We need to be cautious‐

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:49.148
Onward, everyone!
Let's get moving!

00:19:49.248 --> 00:19:52.251
[LILI] Lady Mikoto!
We need to be careful!

00:19:55.587 --> 00:19:58.924
[BELL] Thanks for coming along.
We appreciate it, Welf.

00:19:59.024 --> 00:20:00.959
[WELF] Sorry I said some
harsh stuff the other day.

00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:04.463
I know.. when your mind's
made up, it's made up...

00:20:04.563 --> 00:20:06.598
So I might as well help
you see it through.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.501
(LILI frustrated)

00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:10.969
Just 'cuz he's on board,

00:20:11.069 --> 00:20:12.971
doesn't mean I agree with what
you're doing, you know!

00:20:13.071 --> 00:20:15.106
[BELL] Yeah.. I'm well aware.

00:20:15.207 --> 00:20:16.875
[LILI] To be honest though...

00:20:16.975 --> 00:20:18.344
I don't exactly mind
all the money

00:20:18.444 --> 00:20:20.446
we've been making in
the Dungeon as of late.

00:20:20.546 --> 00:20:21.880
(WELF chuckle)

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.182
Oh.. by the way..

00:20:23.282 --> 00:20:24.816
You ever figure
anything out about

00:20:24.916 --> 00:20:27.186
that item Master Hermes
was talking about?

00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:28.820
Oh... no.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.890
[HESTIA] A "Killing
Stone", huh...? Hmm.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.294
I can't say I've
ever heard of it.

00:20:35.394 --> 00:20:38.197
(internal) I wonder if it has
something to do with Miss
Haruhime...

00:20:38.297 --> 00:20:42.834
Master Bell.. we're nearly at
the Pantry. Stay on guard, okay?

00:20:42.934 --> 00:20:45.337
[BELL] Oh, right.

00:20:45.437 --> 00:20:47.038
(internal) For now, I've got
to focus on

00:20:47.139 --> 00:20:49.241
defeating monsters
and making money.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:57.449
If you want to hunt someone
unnoticed, there's no better
place than the Dungeon.

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:59.618
(PHRYNE toad laughter)

00:21:00.752 --> 00:21:01.820
[AISHA] It's almost time.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.322
Do it.

00:21:11.397 --> 00:21:13.064
(fighting)

00:21:17.636 --> 00:21:18.970
Are you kidding me?!

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.973
[WELF] This is ridiculous
even for a Pantry!

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:25.076
[LILI] Careful or
we'll get separated!

00:21:25.177 --> 00:21:27.613
[LILI] Move closer
together, everyone!

00:21:27.713 --> 00:21:28.547
(LIGER roar)

00:21:28.647 --> 00:21:29.915
[BELL] Fire B‐

00:21:30.015 --> 00:21:31.617
(startled)

00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:37.356
[BELL] Huh? Miss
Aisha? What the..?

00:21:39.925 --> 00:21:44.396
[AISHA] If you're angry,
you'll have to take it up
with an.. erratic goddess!

00:21:44.496 --> 00:21:46.165
(fighting)

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:49.768
[AISHA] Otherwise...
[BELL, internal] She's fast...!

00:21:49.868 --> 00:21:54.105
[AISHA] You only have yourself
to blame for attracting her
attention!

00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:57.976
[BELL, internal]
And she's strong...!

00:21:58.076 --> 00:22:00.579
[BELL, internal] Is she really
a level three like me?!

00:22:04.916 --> 00:22:08.119
[BELL] (wincing in pain)
This is bad...!

00:22:12.858 --> 00:22:14.960
(AISHA smug laugh)

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:22.000
[CLOSING SONG,
"Sasayaka na Shukusai"]

00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:49.155
[HESTIA] Next time:
"A Fleeting Dream."
