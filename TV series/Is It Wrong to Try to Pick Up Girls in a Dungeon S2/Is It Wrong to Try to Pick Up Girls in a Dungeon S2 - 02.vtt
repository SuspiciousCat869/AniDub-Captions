WEBVTT

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:02.903
As head of the Apollo Familia,

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.606
I challenge you to a War Game!

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.709
(CROWD cheers)

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.243
[MAN A] Finally! A War Game!

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.445
[MAN B] Apollo doesn't
mess around, does he?!

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:14.615
[WOMAN A] I can't
wait to see who wins!

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.917
And if we win this clash..

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.986
[APOLLO] Then Bell Cranel
will belong to us!

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.287
[HESTIA] HUH!?

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:24.257
Do those terms sound
agreeable, Hestia?

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:27.293
I'm going to take your sweet
child all for myself!

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:30.697
Grrr... That was your goal all
along, wasn't it you creep?!

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.766
What an awful implication.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.870
Please, dear Hestia.. I thought
you knew me better than that,
given our carnal past.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.039
That's a friggin' lie and
you know it!

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.441
I've shot down every pathetic
advance you ever made.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.145
Y'know, I am done entertaining
this nonsense.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.048
[HESTIA] I don't have to
agree to a War Game!

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.149
[APOLLO] Oh...?

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.484
I think you may
regret that.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.688
I really doubt it!
Now, let's go, Bell!

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.757
[BELL] Huh? Uh, sure.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.363
(HYACINTH smirks)

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:09.235
[OPENING SONG, "HELLO to DREAM"]

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:41.875
(BELL sigh)

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:43.244
So is a War Game..

00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:45.679
basically a battle between
two opposing Familias?

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:50.551
Yeah, and once the rules
have been decided, it turns
into an all‐out war.

00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:54.155
The winner gets to take
literally anything from
the loser.

00:02:54.255 --> 00:02:58.024
Members, goods, money...
pretty much whatever they want.

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:03.297
[HESTIA] Damn him! He such a
bully! He knows full well that
you're the only family I have!

00:03:03.397 --> 00:03:04.631
(BELL sighs)

00:03:04.731 --> 00:03:07.834
Anyway, I'm going to the Dungeon
with Welf and Lili today..

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:09.903
I'll head straight on
home afterwards.

00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:15.409
[HESTIA] Okay, then I'll take
off early from work. Let's have
a nice, relaxing night.

00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:18.512
(gasp)

00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:25.286
(BELL gasps)

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:26.987
(HESTIA startled)

00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:29.890
(CROWD gawking)

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.726
[ANYA] What's with the racket
so early in the meowrning?

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.595
(gasp) That's..

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:35.929
[ANYA] Huh?

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.300
Smells like
gunpowder out here.

00:03:40.201 --> 00:03:42.936
(concerned) A feud
between... Familias.

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:45.539
Seems like it, huh?
Wouldn't surprise me...

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.575
if Mr. White Hair is involved
somehow. (muffled protests)

00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:53.247
[CHLOE] (irritated) Anya,
shut your meowth! That is
just a rude thing to say.
(SYR concerned)

00:03:58.352 --> 00:04:00.287
[BELL] A‐are you
alright.. Goddess?!

00:04:00.387 --> 00:04:01.222
[HESTIA] Uh‐yeah!

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:03.190
[HESTIA] That
smarmy bastard...

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.392
He's totally trying
to force our hand!

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:07.228
Wait a sec..
is he...?

00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:09.596
We're being ambushed by
the Apollo Familia.

00:04:09.696 --> 00:04:13.267
Stop it you jerks!
How dare you destroy our
sweet little love nest...!

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:15.369
[BELL] Huh?
[HESTIA] Here they come, Bell!

00:04:27.948 --> 00:04:29.216
Tsk!

00:04:29.316 --> 00:04:32.186
They were able to take
cover in the smoke.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.857
I can't believe they
would attack us in the
middle of the city!

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:39.926
[HESTIA] Whoa!

00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:46.333
(BELL panting)

00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:49.303
(HESTIA scared)

00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:52.038
(tense) Bell..! We should head
straight towards the Guild!

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.341
They can't lay a
finger on us there!

00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:56.343
[BELL] Right!

00:04:58.612 --> 00:05:01.115
[HESTIA] Wha‐?! A dead end?!

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:02.883
Hold on real
tight.. okay?!

00:05:02.983 --> 00:05:04.451
[HESTIA] Huh?

00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:07.188
(HESTIA loud scream)

00:05:09.556 --> 00:05:11.492
[DAPHNE] You ought to quit
while you're ahead.

00:05:11.592 --> 00:05:12.359
[BELL] Huh?

00:05:14.228 --> 00:05:15.529
[DAPHNE] Remember these words...

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.998
When Master Apollo takes a
liking to someone,

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:23.137
he'll stop at nothing to get
his hands on them. That's how
Cassandra and I ended up here.

00:05:23.237 --> 00:05:29.276
[DAPHNE] City after city,
country after country... He'll
follow you everywhere you go,
until you give up.

00:05:29.376 --> 00:05:35.782
My little Be‐ll...!
(delighted laugh) (kissy face)

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:36.950
(HESTIA creeped out)

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.519
(BELL nervous)

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:39.786
Just surrender.

00:05:39.886 --> 00:05:41.188
I wouldn't want to injury you,

00:05:41.288 --> 00:05:43.624
if you're going to join
our Familia anyway.

00:05:45.726 --> 00:05:47.261
[BELL] I will not.

00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:51.432
[DAPHNE] Yeah, I
figured as much.

00:05:51.532 --> 00:05:53.033
Fine.. so be it!

00:05:57.838 --> 00:05:59.440
Fire Bolt!

00:06:10.384 --> 00:06:12.553
[DAPHNE] He's fast,
I'll give him that.

00:06:12.653 --> 00:06:16.457
But he's not going to
get away. This is such
a waste of our time.

00:06:16.557 --> 00:06:18.359
Hey, Daphne...

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:20.127
I really don't think
provoking

00:06:20.227 --> 00:06:23.230
that boy is that
great of an idea.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.800
Why's that? You have another
one of your bad dreams?

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.034
[CASSANDRA] Mmhm.

00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:30.437
I saw a wounded rabbit running..

00:06:30.537 --> 00:06:33.574
then it jumped over the moon,
only to swallow up the sun...

00:06:33.674 --> 00:06:37.178
If things, keep going the way
they are, I'm afraid something
terrible will happen...

00:06:37.278 --> 00:06:42.883
Yeah, yeah... Enough dream
journal crap. Let's move or
we'll lose him.

00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:47.588
Aww! You should take
me more seriously about
these things.

00:06:49.823 --> 00:06:52.126
(adventurer chatter)

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:56.730
He's sure taking his time.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.434
Yeah.. It's unusual for
Master Bell to be this late.

00:07:00.534 --> 00:07:03.670
So it's not just me who's
getting a bad feeling.

00:07:05.206 --> 00:07:06.607
[ADVENTURER] Hey, did you hear?!

00:07:06.707 --> 00:07:08.442
[ADVENTURER] The Apollo
Familia just started

00:07:08.542 --> 00:07:10.444
throwing down in the
middle of the city!

00:07:10.544 --> 00:07:12.613
Sounds like, they're
after Hestia's Familia.

00:07:12.713 --> 00:07:15.649
Apparently they're all ganging
up on that Little Rookie guy!

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:16.750
(WELF concerned)
(LILI gasp)

00:07:19.753 --> 00:07:22.156
What was that?
they're attacking him?

00:07:22.256 --> 00:07:27.694
Yes! It seems like the
whole Apollo Familia is out
there trying to hunt down
Mr. Argonaut.

00:07:27.794 --> 00:07:29.863
[TIONA] It's causing
a huge mess!

00:07:29.963 --> 00:07:33.500
(AIS soft concerned)
[FINN] Don't go getting
any ideas, Ais.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.138
This isn't the same situation as
what happened on the 18th Floor.

00:07:37.238 --> 00:07:41.808
We don't want to look like
we're siding with any
Familia. You understand?

00:07:41.908 --> 00:07:45.412
Hmm, I do.

00:07:48.182 --> 00:07:50.817
(HESTIA panting)

00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:55.189
Sorry I'm so slow.
I know I'm weighing
you down, Bell.

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:56.823
[BELL] It's not your
fault, Goddess!

00:07:56.923 --> 00:07:57.691
Huh?

00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:59.793
(heavy pursuit)

00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:02.763
[HESTIA, internal]
That emblem...!

00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:06.133
[HESTIA] Bell? Wah!

00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:07.368
[SOMA FAM A] C'mon!

00:08:07.468 --> 00:08:10.504
(fighting)

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.248
That Hyacinth guy...

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:23.617
(HYACINTH smirk)

00:08:24.518 --> 00:08:28.622
(fighting)

00:08:29.256 --> 00:08:30.891
[HESTIA] (gasp) Careful!

00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:32.126
(gasp)

00:08:34.728 --> 00:08:39.400
I must commend you on your
efforts of getting this far,
Young Bell Cranel.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.705
Now rejoice, for I will be your
next opponent, Little Rookie.

00:08:46.873 --> 00:08:48.209
(HESTIA concern)

00:08:50.577 --> 00:08:52.146
(evil giggle)

00:08:57.118 --> 00:08:59.720
Fight Bell.. Fight Bell.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.692
[HESTIA] Bell!

00:09:10.497 --> 00:09:12.199
[EINA] We have to stop
them immediately!

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:15.436
Send the Apollo Familia
an official warning!

00:09:15.536 --> 00:09:18.239
"Acts of warfare within the
city limits are prohibited!"

00:09:18.339 --> 00:09:20.073
It makes no difference.

00:09:20.174 --> 00:09:23.177
I'm certain that they've already
considered the penalties of
their actions.

00:09:23.277 --> 00:09:29.183
[EINA] Come on! They're
trying to wipe out the Hestia
Familia, even as we speak!

00:09:29.283 --> 00:09:30.817
I'm afraid our hands are tied...

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:33.787
At the end of the day, there's
only so much we can do.

00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:35.856
But Bell..

00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:39.693
(BELL heavy breathing/pained)

00:09:44.965 --> 00:09:49.836
Although I absolutely despise
you for stealing away Master
Apollo's love and affection.

00:09:49.936 --> 00:09:55.609
I must obey his noble command.
I shall be the one to recruit
you into our Familia.

00:10:00.314 --> 00:10:01.748
Too slow.

00:10:02.616 --> 00:10:05.386
Do you always make
such a racket?!

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:11.192
No! Get up, Bell!

00:10:11.292 --> 00:10:13.894
(BELL shudder in pain)

00:10:18.999 --> 00:10:20.401
(BELL convulse, pain)

00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:23.204
Still conscious,
are we bunny?

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.775
What a disgusting pitiful face.

00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:32.979
I'll never understand
what Master Apollo sees in
a vile insect like you.

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:35.282
(BELL pained)

00:10:35.382 --> 00:10:38.452
I have devoted my entire
body and soul to him.

00:10:38.552 --> 00:10:42.389
[HYACINTH] I should be the
only one to receive his grace.

00:10:44.525 --> 00:10:46.660
Since we're going to
patch you up later..

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.864
I don't see the harm in taking
off an arm or one of your legs.

00:10:50.964 --> 00:10:52.266
(HESTIA gasps)

00:10:54.101 --> 00:10:56.002
(BELL groans)

00:10:57.438 --> 00:10:59.540
No. Please.

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:03.710
(HYACINTH notice)

00:11:06.447 --> 00:11:09.716
This is exactly why I hate
high‐class adventurers...

00:11:13.087 --> 00:11:15.289
[NAAZA] Bell.. run.

00:11:17.891 --> 00:11:19.793
Great. A sniper.

00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:26.600
(HESTIA struggling)

00:11:30.404 --> 00:11:32.973
[HYACINTH] No matter.
He won't get very far.

00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:39.146
[HESTIA] (out of breath) Bell,
are you alright? Stay with me!

00:11:39.246 --> 00:11:41.982
[BELL] I'm really..
sorry.. My Goddess.

00:11:52.126 --> 00:11:55.596
[BELL] (pain) If this keeps up..

00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:01.402
[OUKA] Looks like you guys are
having some fun down there.

00:12:01.502 --> 00:12:03.770
[LISSOS] Hmm?

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.506
[OUKA] Hope you don't
mind us joining in.

00:12:05.606 --> 00:12:07.241
(BELL pain / surprised)

00:12:07.341 --> 00:12:10.944
[LISSOS] Fools. You dare defy
the will of the Apollo Familia?

00:12:11.044 --> 00:12:14.648
[MIKOTO] We'd be cowards
to abandon our friends in
their time of need!

00:12:14.748 --> 00:12:16.016
[OUKA] Attack!

00:12:16.117 --> 00:12:18.051
(fighting)

00:12:26.093 --> 00:12:26.893
[LILI] Master Bell!

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:27.861
(BELL &amp; HESTIA gasp)

00:12:27.961 --> 00:12:29.796
[WELF] You alright, Bell?!

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:31.465
[BELL] Lili.. Welf..

00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:34.868
[HESTIA] Miach?! What
are YOU doing here?!

00:12:38.305 --> 00:12:43.377
I heard all the commotion.
So I ran to Takemikazuchi's
place to get you some backup.

00:12:43.477 --> 00:12:45.246
I'm glad we made it in time.

00:12:45.346 --> 00:12:47.481
Oh, Miach...
You have my gratitude.

00:12:47.581 --> 00:12:49.750
I can't thank you enough.

00:12:51.518 --> 00:12:53.053
Master Bell!

00:12:53.154 --> 00:12:54.255
[LILI] Let's get out of here.

00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:55.622
Huh?

00:12:57.224 --> 00:12:59.960
They've got
this under control.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.961
[ADVENTURER] I found 'em!

00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:02.062
It's the Little Rookie guy!

00:13:02.163 --> 00:13:03.430
(rowdy mob)
(BELL gasps)

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.966
There's no time to
waste. Now, go!

00:13:08.202 --> 00:13:10.171
[MIKOTO] Master Bell!

00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:11.972
Everyone!
Thank you!

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.481
[HESTIA] Bell.. we somehow
got turned around in all
of the chaos back there.

00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:22.216
[HESTIA] We have to
head north! (running)

00:13:22.316 --> 00:13:23.950
[BELL] (panting) O‐okay!

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.851
(WELF gasp)

00:13:24.951 --> 00:13:27.454
(intimidating energy)

00:13:27.554 --> 00:13:29.623
[WELF] Leave these scrubs to us!

00:13:29.723 --> 00:13:32.693
[LILI] You need to get
to the Guild immediately!

00:13:32.793 --> 00:13:35.162
We'll be right behind you
once we're finished here!

00:13:35.262 --> 00:13:36.463
[BELL] But Lili...

00:13:36.563 --> 00:13:37.931
[WELF] Go! We got this!

00:13:38.031 --> 00:13:40.601
[HESTIA] Thanks!
We're counting on you!

00:13:41.402 --> 00:13:42.769
[WELF] Lil Bit.. Cover me!

00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:44.705
[LILI] Yeah, sure thing. But..

00:13:44.805 --> 00:13:47.674
are you sure you can
handle these chumps
without Master Bell here?

00:13:47.774 --> 00:13:50.644
[WELF] Yeeup! Piece
of pie, small fry.

00:13:52.313 --> 00:13:54.215
Not too shabby,
doncha think?

00:13:54.315 --> 00:13:56.217
(LILI gasp)

00:13:56.317 --> 00:13:57.751
What tha, you gotta
pay attention!

00:13:57.851 --> 00:14:00.821
[LILI] Same to you! (jumps)

00:14:00.921 --> 00:14:04.158
[LILI] Don't get distracted
by worrying about me!

00:14:09.163 --> 00:14:10.797
(frustrated)

00:14:13.434 --> 00:14:14.835
(MAN A &amp; B pain)

00:14:16.603 --> 00:14:19.039
[ZANIS] I finally
found you.. Arde.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.142
(LILI gasp) (terrified)

00:14:23.344 --> 00:14:25.479
[LILI] M‐Master Zanis...

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.415
I'm glad to see you're
in good health.

00:14:28.515 --> 00:14:31.518
I'd heard through the
grapevine you were deceased.

00:14:31.618 --> 00:14:33.520
(LILI terrified)

00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:41.628
Little Bit! What's the hold
up?! Where's my cover?!

00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:45.966
[WELF] Lil Bit?! (block)

00:14:46.066 --> 00:14:49.670
[LILI] Master Welf, I'm going
home to the Soma Familia.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:54.040
[LILI] Please let Master Bell
know that I won't be causing
trouble for him any longer.

00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:55.776
What in the hell?!

00:14:55.876 --> 00:14:59.580
[WELF] Hey, Lil Bit!
Where are you going?! Hey!

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.483
Damn.. what's going on?!

00:15:05.286 --> 00:15:06.520
[WELF] That emblem...

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.022
[GRUNT D] Where'd
he go?! Find him!

00:15:09.123 --> 00:15:10.491
[GRUNT A] Right!

00:15:13.026 --> 00:15:15.562
Are you doing okay?
Can you stand?

00:15:16.263 --> 00:15:18.064
Yeah.. I'm pretty sure.

00:15:18.165 --> 00:15:19.833
(HESTIA smile)

00:15:22.169 --> 00:15:23.704
(BELL confused)

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.342
We've still
got a ways to go...

00:15:28.442 --> 00:15:30.944
Can you push
yourself a bit more?

00:15:31.044 --> 00:15:32.613
(BELL worried)

00:15:34.181 --> 00:15:35.782
(HESTIA sympathetic)

00:15:35.882 --> 00:15:39.019
[HYACINTH] Oh, Bell
Cranel..! Listen up!
(BELL &amp; HESTIA surprised)

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.624
[HYACINTH] No matter where
you try to hide, we're going
to track you down!

00:15:43.724 --> 00:15:47.027
[HYACINTH] You're only
delaying the inevitable outcome!

00:15:47.128 --> 00:15:49.930
Whether it's here or
deep down in the Dungeon!

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.701
We'll find you. Your
days of peace and quiet
has come to an end!

00:15:55.536 --> 00:15:57.571
I can't hide.

00:15:57.671 --> 00:15:59.039
(HESTIA pained)

00:16:01.342 --> 00:16:02.876
Hey Bell. Listen.

00:16:02.976 --> 00:16:05.779
[HESTIA] From the way things are
headed, we won't have a future.

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:11.285
[HESTIA] We've got two options:
Either we fight a losing battle
we can't possibly win...

00:16:12.052 --> 00:16:15.789
[HESTIA] ...or we leave Orario.

00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:20.026
I'm honestly fine with
going anywhere.. all that
matters is being with you.

00:16:20.127 --> 00:16:25.732
I'll gladly run away with you
until they finally decide to
give up and leave you alone.

00:16:25.832 --> 00:16:29.370
You'd run away...
with me?

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.071
(HESTIA smile)

00:16:35.742 --> 00:16:39.079
[HESTIA] Bell.. I wanna
know if you love me.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.182
[BELL] Huh?

00:16:41.282 --> 00:16:42.949
This is really important.

00:16:43.049 --> 00:16:48.054
If you can tell me that
you love me then I will
do whatever it takes.

00:16:48.155 --> 00:16:52.058
[HESTIA] If you say it and you
mean it.. I will do anything!

00:16:52.859 --> 00:16:54.328
Even if I have to fight!

00:16:54.428 --> 00:16:55.562
(BELL surprised)

00:16:55.662 --> 00:16:58.132
I love you more than
you'll ever realize.

00:16:58.232 --> 00:17:00.267
You've no clue how
dear you are to me.

00:17:00.367 --> 00:17:05.606
[HESTIA] And I never want to
leave your side. .. I don't want
to give you up.

00:17:05.706 --> 00:17:08.242
Goddess.. Hestia.

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.181
[HESTIA] Bell.. I just
need to know how you feel
about me though.

00:17:14.948 --> 00:17:17.284
(BELL loss of words) (ponder)

00:17:18.585 --> 00:17:20.454
(BELL nervous)

00:17:20.554 --> 00:17:22.423
I hold you in high regard!

00:17:22.523 --> 00:17:25.592
You know that's
not what I mean!

00:17:25.692 --> 00:17:27.161
(HESTIA pout)

00:17:32.065 --> 00:17:34.135
[APOLLO GRUNT E]
There he is! Down there!

00:17:34.668 --> 00:17:35.702
Wha‐?!

00:17:35.802 --> 00:17:37.871
(gasp) Let's move
it... Goddess!

00:17:40.441 --> 00:17:44.111
They've got some nerve!
We were about to have a moment!

00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:46.280
[HESTIA] I've had
it! Officially!

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.150
[HESTIA] Bell, go southwest!
Forget the Guild! Go that way!

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.918
[BELL] Wh‐what?! But
wait, isn't that...?

00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:01.228
The Apollo Familia's
...base of operations?

00:18:01.328 --> 00:18:05.899
[HESTIA] I know Apollo's
in there! Open the gates
right this instant!

00:18:28.289 --> 00:18:34.095
Hey, Hestia. To what do I owe
the pleasure of such an
unforeseen visitation?

00:18:34.195 --> 00:18:35.362
(HESTIA unamused)

00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:38.499
Hey Prum.. Let me
borrow your glove.
(LUAN startled)

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:39.400
[LUAN] Uh..?

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.302
[LUAN] Sure.. h‐here..

00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:43.770
(HESTIA throw)

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:44.705
(APOLLO speechless)

00:18:44.805 --> 00:18:46.640
(BELL shock)

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.442
(LUAN disbelief)

00:18:50.577 --> 00:18:55.149
Bring it on, punk! If you
want this stupid War Game
so bad, then let's do it!

00:18:55.882 --> 00:18:57.050
(APOLLO orgasmic quick giggle)

00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:59.853
It appears both parties
are in agreement.

00:18:59.953 --> 00:19:03.357
Ladies and gentlemen,
the War Game is on!

00:19:04.391 --> 00:19:05.759
Oh, hell yeah!

00:19:05.859 --> 00:19:08.095
We gotta put in a War Game
request with the Guild!

00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:10.931
Call an emergency Denatus
to order at once!

00:19:11.031 --> 00:19:12.666
It's finally
happening!

00:19:12.766 --> 00:19:14.668
Yes, it has been
way too long!

00:19:14.768 --> 00:19:19.106
[APOLLO] To ensure fairness, our
brethren shall bear witness to
the rules set forth.

00:19:19.206 --> 00:19:22.343
I'll be in touch with
the details before long.

00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:30.684
[WELF] (panting) Bell!
Lady Hestia! (running)

00:19:30.784 --> 00:19:32.786
[BELL] Huh? Welf!
Are you alright?!

00:19:32.886 --> 00:19:35.289
[WELF] (catching breath) Yeah..
But... some bad news..

00:19:35.389 --> 00:19:38.559
I.. I'm Sorry; The Soma
Familia took Lili.

00:19:38.659 --> 00:19:39.793
[BELL] They what?!

00:19:39.893 --> 00:19:41.128
(HESTIA gasp)

00:19:43.397 --> 00:19:44.665
(BELL anger) (run)

00:19:44.765 --> 00:19:45.532
Hold it!

00:19:45.632 --> 00:19:47.101
(BELL startled)

00:19:47.201 --> 00:19:50.537
I think.. it would best for you
to focus on your job, Bell.

00:19:50.637 --> 00:19:53.073
We'll handle saving your
supporter.

00:19:53.174 --> 00:19:55.776
Wait what?.. Focus on my...?

00:19:55.876 --> 00:19:57.878
(BELL realization)

00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:04.385
[HESTIA] I'll figure out a way
to buy you some time before the
War Game starts.

00:20:04.485 --> 00:20:07.554
[HESTIA] In the meantime,
you have to get as strong
as you can.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.226
[HESTIA] That's our one and only
chance at winning this thing.

00:20:13.994 --> 00:20:15.562
[HESTIA] Get stronger.. Bell.

00:20:15.662 --> 00:20:18.765
Stronger than everyone
and everything. that's
what it'll take.

00:20:18.865 --> 00:20:23.904
[HESTIA] I know you can do it.
No! Bell.. you're the only one
who can do it!

00:20:24.004 --> 00:20:26.307
(BELL gasp) (determined)

00:20:26.407 --> 00:20:28.475
[BELL] Right. I'm on it!

00:20:30.111 --> 00:20:32.113
[BELL] You don't understand!
Please! I'm begging you!

00:20:32.213 --> 00:20:36.183
[BELL] There's something I have
to ask her! Please let me see
Miss Ais Wallenstein!

00:20:36.283 --> 00:20:37.951
Are you outta
your damn mind?!

00:20:38.051 --> 00:20:39.586
We already know
why you're here!

00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:42.156
You want to ask her
if she'll fight with
you in the War Game.

00:20:42.256 --> 00:20:44.191
Just how shameless
can you be?

00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:46.327
That's not it at all! I promise!

00:20:46.427 --> 00:20:48.262
[TIONE] What's with
all the yelling?

00:20:49.363 --> 00:20:50.397
[BELL] Miss Tione!

00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:54.535
(TIONE annoyed)

00:20:54.635 --> 00:20:55.869
(BELL strangled)

00:20:55.969 --> 00:20:58.105
You better get the hell
out of my sight.

00:20:58.205 --> 00:21:01.908
There's absolutely no excuse
for such disgraceful behavior.

00:21:02.943 --> 00:21:04.478
[BELL] Huh?

00:21:07.748 --> 00:21:09.150
[TIONE] Hmph!

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:19.826
(BELL gasp)

00:21:19.926 --> 00:21:22.596
Yoo‐hoo...,
Mr. Argonaut!

00:21:22.696 --> 00:21:24.498
[BELL] Miss Ais, Miss Tiona!

00:21:24.598 --> 00:21:27.968
You got lucky. Miss Ais
spotted you when you
were on your way here.

00:21:28.068 --> 00:21:32.439
That's when she had the
great idea to have Tione
pretend to throw you out.

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:36.076
We couldn't exactly just
walk out the front door
with you, ya know?

00:21:36.643 --> 00:21:38.112
Oh, I see...

00:21:38.212 --> 00:21:40.381
I heard about the War
Game... I'm sorry.
