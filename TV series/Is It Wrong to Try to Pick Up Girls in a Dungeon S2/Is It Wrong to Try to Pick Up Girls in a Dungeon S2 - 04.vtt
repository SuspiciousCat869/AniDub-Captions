WEBVTT

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.121
(LILI sigh, notice)

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:24.390
[LILI] He's here!
Master Bell is back!

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.642
It's good to be home.
My Goddess.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:44.110
Welcome back. You ready?

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.415
Let's do this! It's time
for our War Game!

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:55.288
[OPENING SONG, "HELLO to DREAM"]

00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:29.384
Now you be extra careful
out there, okay Bell?

00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:31.152
I will, I promise.

00:02:31.253 --> 00:02:32.487
Hup!

00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:36.524
Please tell everyone
else the same, too!

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:39.961
And let them know I'll be
waiting patiently for your
triumphant return!

00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:43.298
[BELL] I'll be back
soon! Just hang tight!

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:52.740
Hey! Aren't you that
Little Rookie fellah?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.908
Uh, yeah!

00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:55.176
Thought so.
We're all rootin'

00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:56.911
for you in the
War Game, kid.

00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:57.779
Yeah, good luck!

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:58.646
Give 'em hell!

00:02:58.746 --> 00:02:59.814
(flattered)

00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:01.383
Thank you so much
for your support.

00:03:01.483 --> 00:03:02.517
[SYR] Mr. Bell!

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:04.486
[BELL] Oh! Miss Syr!

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:05.787
Don't hurt yourself!

00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:06.588
Take this!

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:07.955
Huh?

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:11.192
(SYR struggling &amp; panting)

00:03:11.293 --> 00:03:15.763
It's a good luck charm an
adventurer at work gave me,
it's supposed to protect you...
(trip)

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:17.399
Miss Syr!

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:20.802
(catching breath)

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:22.504
Do your best out there!

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:25.307
I'll have a lunch waiting for
you just like I always do!

00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:26.574
Thanks!

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:34.782
[BELL, internal] We'll win.

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:39.221
(internal) We'll win and
come back home safely...
No matter what.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.270
(scoffs) Shutting ourselves
away and waiting for the enemy
to strike... makes for such a
dull game.

00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:59.173
[CASSANDRA] Daphne... The
castle will surely fall.

00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:05.480
Cassandra, are you afraid we'll
lose? I hope this isn't about
another one of your dreams.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.681
(CASSANDRA discouraged)

00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:08.149
Never fear...

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.552
If the commander survives
for just three days, we win.

00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:13.521
Or if we defeat the enemy's
commander before that, we win.

00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:16.724
[DAPHNE] Trust me, there's
no way we could lose in
this situation.

00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:20.995
[CASSANDRA] Please... believe me
just this once, Daphne. Please.

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.163
[DAPHNE] That should
be the last of it!

00:04:22.264 --> 00:04:23.531
[DAPHNE] Close the gate!

00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:27.369
We'll lose... If anything
gets beyond the wall.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.905
[LUAN] Hey, wait!
Hold on a second!

00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:36.778
(LUAN scrambling) (panting)

00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:38.880
[LUAN] Why didn't
you hold the gate?!

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.348
[ADVENTURER A] Oh, hey there,
Luan!

00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:42.517
[ADVENTURER A] You're so
puny, I didn't even see you!

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:43.918
Huh‐what'd you say?!

00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:46.888
Perfect timing, come
help us move this stuff.

00:04:46.988 --> 00:04:48.590
(LUAN annoyed)

00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:54.996
[LUAN] Okay how come.. I'm the
only one pulling this thing...?

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:56.531
Shut yer trap.
Just do it.

00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:58.500
[CASSANDRA] (dread) I fear,
it's too late...

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.069
The Trojans have led
the horse inside.

00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:06.474
(excited chatter)
[IBRI] Good morning, Orario!

00:05:06.574 --> 00:05:09.911
[IBRI] The much anticipated day
of the War Game is finally here!

00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:16.284
I, Ibri Archer, will be
your host for the big event.
You may also know me as
"Fire Inferno Flame."

00:05:16.384 --> 00:05:18.220
[IBRI] It's a pleasure
to be here, folks!

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.089
And providing commentary for
us today is Master Ganesha!

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:23.991
[IBRI] Master Ganesha,
what are your thoughts?

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:25.827
I am Ganesha!

00:05:25.927 --> 00:05:27.094
[IBRI] Insightful!

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.936
[LOKI] Oh wow, it's getting
pretty lively down there!

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:38.673
[HEPHAISTOS] Look I know a War
Game is one of the many ways the
city generates its revenue.

00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:42.109
But there's honestly no
need to make such a
spectacle of our children.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.347
Well.. it is what it
is, know what I'm
sayin? Huh?

00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:46.248
Hm?

00:05:46.348 --> 00:05:48.383
[LOKI] Well, looky who's here.

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:50.785
[APOLLO] Hestia.

00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:52.220
Hmm?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.822
Have you and Bell Cranel
said your goodbyes yet?

00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:59.661
Once I've triumphed in
this War Game, and taken
him as my own child...

00:05:59.761 --> 00:06:04.699
you'll never set foot in Orario‐
no, the lower world, ever again.

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.534
[HESTIA] Hmph!

00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:09.637
[ASFI] It's almost time, Master
Hermes.

00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:13.107
(excited war game chatter)
[HERMES] Right.
Let's get started.

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:17.212
Uranus! Permission
to use our powers?

00:06:17.312 --> 00:06:18.780
[URANUS] Granted.

00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:29.123
[ADVENTURER E] 30,000
on the Apollo Familia!

00:06:29.224 --> 00:06:30.825
[ADVENTURER D] 50,000 for me!

00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:34.696
You know how it works, you
don't get jack if you all
bet on Apollo!

00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:37.399
[BOOKIE] Oh?
[MORD] 100,000 on
the Hestia Familia!

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:39.601
You insane, Mord!?
You wanna rethink that?

00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:43.170
(laugh) I don't mind
takin' his money!

00:06:44.038 --> 00:06:45.673
You just wait...

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:51.246
(SYR worried)

00:06:52.247 --> 00:06:54.316
[TIONA] Ais! It's starting!

00:06:59.153 --> 00:07:00.655
(AIS uneasy)

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:04.259
[IBRI] At last.. we are but
mere moments away from noon!

00:07:04.359 --> 00:07:06.694
[IBRI] Let the War Game begin!

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:13.034
[ARCHER A] It's about to get
started.

00:07:13.134 --> 00:07:15.303
[ARCHER B] It's gonna be three
long days..

00:07:15.403 --> 00:07:18.373
I doubt we need to
worry about...huh?

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:21.309
[ARCHER B] What's that?

00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:32.387
Well, here we go.

00:07:32.487 --> 00:07:34.856
Looks like there's only
one of 'em! Let's do it!

00:07:38.293 --> 00:07:40.528
[IBRI] An attack
right off the bat!

00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:48.303
[IBRI] Could those be a
pair of.. magic swords?!

00:07:48.403 --> 00:07:51.138
[APOLLO] I see..
A decent strategy.

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:56.478
However, we number well over
one hundred members.. and you
have what? a measly five?

00:07:56.578 --> 00:07:59.747
I wonder if your children
can overcome those odds...

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.520
[RYU] Crozzo magic swords...

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.790
[RYU] Never thought I'd
see the day when I'd
need to use these...

00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:16.798
[RYU] Come on out! Face me!

00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:20.635
[LISSOS] Dammit. What the
hell's going on out there?

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:24.339
[LUAN] Magic swords! We're
getting hit with magic swords!
[LISSOS] What?!

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:26.641
[LUAN] I have new orders
from Hyacinth!

00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:30.177
He wants 50 of you to
go out there and take
that guy down! Now.

00:08:30.278 --> 00:08:32.113
[LISSOS] Fifty?!
That's half our army!

00:08:32.214 --> 00:08:35.683
[LUAN] Any less than that
and you're gonna get blown
up by those crazy swords!

00:08:35.783 --> 00:08:40.388
It's just one guy! You
can finish him off and
come right back, alright!

00:08:40.488 --> 00:08:43.124
(startled shriek)
Just get going, hurry!

00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:45.993
(irritated)
Fine... Let's move!

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:51.966
(fighting)

00:09:08.082 --> 00:09:09.351
[GRUNT A] Look!
Her swords are gone!

00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:11.786
[GRUNT B] Now's
our chance! Get her!

00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:14.155
(LISSOS realization)

00:09:14.256 --> 00:09:15.923
[LISSOS] An elf...!

00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:28.670
Oh God of Strength and
Bringer of Destruction,
I do humbly beseech you:

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.038
Please grant me guidance
from the heavens...

00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:36.244
The enemy is now invading!
And it looks like she's headed
straight for Hyacinth!

00:09:36.344 --> 00:09:39.414
Someone, stop her! Anyone!

00:09:41.383 --> 00:09:46.454
[LISSOS] Traitor! Using
the accursed magic swords
that burned our homeland
to the ground.

00:09:46.554 --> 00:09:49.657
[LISSOS] You
are a disgrace!

00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:52.059
[RYU] Unfortunately, there's
something more important to me

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:53.995
than holding a grudge
held by my kin.

00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:56.998
[RYU] If protecting my friends
makes me a disgrace...

00:09:57.098 --> 00:10:00.001
then I suppose I'll just
have to live with that!

00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:02.069
(defeated)

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.744
So strong...!

00:10:09.844 --> 00:10:10.578
Do not waver...

00:10:10.678 --> 00:10:12.414
Now let's go
cut her down!

00:10:15.116 --> 00:10:17.819
Descend from the heavens,
and take hold of the earth!

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:19.687
(intimidating)

00:10:20.755 --> 00:10:22.990
(fighting)

00:10:29.364 --> 00:10:31.065
Conquest of the Gods!

00:10:31.165 --> 00:10:34.101
[MIKOTO] Futsu no Mitama!

00:10:39.274 --> 00:10:45.947
(struggling with gravity)

00:10:47.682 --> 00:10:52.019
For now... you'll be
staying here with me.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.656
[IBRI] That looks like
some sort of gravity magic!

00:10:54.756 --> 00:10:57.892
[IBRI] Incredible! The invader
has pinned them down!

00:10:57.992 --> 00:11:01.929
[IBRI] Her timing suggests a
suicide attack. What do you
think, Master Ganesha?

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:03.365
[GANESHA] I am Ganesha!

00:11:03.465 --> 00:11:06.000
[IBRI] Wow. You are simply
a wealth of information!

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.436
Stand fast, Mikoto.

00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:10.372
(GODS impressed)

00:11:10.472 --> 00:11:13.208
[GOD A] She used to be
Take's child! Incredible!

00:11:13.308 --> 00:11:16.878
[GOD B] What was that masked
adventurer's name? Lion or
something?

00:11:16.978 --> 00:11:18.680
(annoyed)

00:11:19.414 --> 00:11:20.882
(tense)

00:11:21.649 --> 00:11:23.150
Way too fast...

00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:24.586
What's too fast?

00:11:24.686 --> 00:11:26.621
Apollo Familia's
responses..

00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:30.692
Countering Ryu's magic
swords and quickly dealing
with Mikoto...

00:11:30.792 --> 00:11:32.627
It just seems a bit dubious.

00:11:32.727 --> 00:11:37.265
Hm? Do you think someone's
feeding them intel?

00:11:37.365 --> 00:11:39.467
[HERMES] Information
is a weapon in battle.

00:11:39.567 --> 00:11:43.971
[HERMES] And the earlier
one obtains it, the more
potent of a weapon it becomes.

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:50.512
[HERMES] However... If a bit
of poison slips through the
cracks.. it won't be very
long before it spreads.

00:11:50.612 --> 00:11:56.484
[HERMES] All it takes is
one drop for everything
to come crashing down.

00:11:58.386 --> 00:11:59.521
(gasp)

00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:02.457
[APOLLO] Luan?!
What is he doing?!

00:12:03.425 --> 00:12:04.792
(smile)

00:12:10.332 --> 00:12:13.235
[WELF] Yo! Nice disguise.

00:12:13.335 --> 00:12:16.571
Thanks for all your
hard work, Lili.

00:12:17.305 --> 00:12:18.640
Please, you go on ahead.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.576
I'm going to stir up

A betrayal!

it all the way to the tower!

Wait, they had magic
swords. Why didn't they
just use them to charge the
