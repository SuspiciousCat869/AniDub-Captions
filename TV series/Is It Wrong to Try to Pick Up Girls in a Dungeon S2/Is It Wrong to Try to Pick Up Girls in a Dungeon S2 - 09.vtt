such a disgrace...

[AISHA] I suppose
it's war, then.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.218
[AISHA] We'll take out
your Familia, too!

Saving Miss Haruhime means going
to war with the Ishtar Familia.

She knew I wouldn't risk it...

[HARUHIME] I'm sorry, I just
feel so incredibly lucky.

Yeah I'm sorry, we're
closed for the day.

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:49.403
I had a hunch they'd pull
a stunt like this.

Yep! Looks like they wanna
do this the hard way.

Any luck?

00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:58.311
Unfortunately no, all
entrances are blocked off.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:03.451
And not just from the outside.
They've also made it impossible
to escape from within.

Their intentions are
pretty clear then.

00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:08.689
It's safe to say, they
don't plan on letting
anyone go without a fight.

You're one to talk.

We're only in this mess
because you disobeyed
Lady Ishtar's orders.

Don't give me
that crap!

00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:28.108
It's that ugly tramp's fault!

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.610

[SAMIRA] I have a suggestion.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:38.185
Why don't we just catch
the Little Rookie and

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:40.721
deliver him to Lady Ishtar
after the ritual?

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:43.857
It's not like we are allowed to
have any fun with him, anyway.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.694
[SAMIRA] We might as well let

[MIKOTO] Sounds like
they're further away.

[MIKOTO] I'll go scout it out.

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:09.850
[HARUHIME] I don't deserve to be
rescued since there's not much

[BELL] I refuse to ... believe

It can't be right! All the

I'm sorry.

[MIKOTO] (gasp)
But, Master Bell..

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:03.003
If you do that, then the
Ishtar Familia will surely

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:05.939
wage war with us! How on Earth
are you planning on takin‐

I'm sure our whole Familia..
will be understanding.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:17.985
We'll take Miss Haruhime and
we'll all run away together.

00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:22.456
And someday, when we're
stronger, we'll come
back to Orario.

[LENA] We can't find the Little
Rookie anywhere.

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:08.636
[LENA] I think he must've
somehow gotten out of the
red‐light district.

Oh no he'll come.

the face of a man...

But he is an adventurer.

After I have located Lady
Haruhime... I will shoot
one of these flares off.

event I fail...

out where they're
holding the ritual...

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.673
Was I not crystal clear, Phryne?

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:16.377
What I said, was "stand down".

00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:18.512
[ISHTAR] Now, make your way
to the Killing Stone Ritual.

00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:22.816
[ISHTAR] We will be
successful this time.
Failure is not an option.

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:27.388
(giving up/following orders)

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:30.891
[ISHTAR] Bold of you to return
to this place, child of Hestia.

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:34.962
Is there someone here for
whom you still have feelings?

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.801
[ISHTAR] (giggle) That's a
rather amusing expression.

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:46.139
I may be doing this to
spite that loathsome Freya..
but at least I get a prize.

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:49.910
Please tell me one
thing... So why does..

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.980
Why does Miss Haruhime
have to be sacrificed?

00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:55.749
(ISHTAR laugh)

00:11:55.849 --> 00:12:00.488
You have the audacity to talk
about another woman in my
presence? How foolish.

00:12:00.588 --> 00:12:02.690
Answer my question!

00:12:03.657 --> 00:12:05.258
(ISHTAR exhale)

00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:09.029
[ISHTAR] We require her for
the unique power she holds.

00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:10.698
(BELL gasp)

00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:12.365
[BELL] For the Level Boost...?

00:12:12.466 --> 00:12:16.036
[ISHTAR] Exactly. If we use her
Sorcery to rank up our Familia,

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:20.641
we'll easily crush Freya
and her children! It's
really that simple, boy.

00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:25.979
[ISHTAR] I will finally drag
that damned meddlesome woman
down from her tower!

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:26.780
(BELL gasp)

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.115
[BELL] You mean Lady Freya?!

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:30.250
[ISHTAR] Everything about her
disgusts me.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.620
[ISHTAR] I despise the
way men toss me aside and

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.057
flock to her like she's the most
beautiful creature to walk the
face of this planet.

00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:41.128
How exactly is that revolting
pig more alluring than I am?!

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:44.698
It's like those stupid sons
of bitches under a blindness
spell or something!

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:46.867
But why sacrifice her?

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:50.671
And why force her
into prostitution?

00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:54.341
I don't get you. What do you
have against prostitutes?

00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:59.447
Sharing a bed and abandoning
oneself to pleasure is one of
the most sacred of acts.

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:05.218
[ISHTAR] Women keep the peace in
this world by satiating the
animalistic desires of men.

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:07.455
Here in the lower world..

00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:10.791
the mingling of the sexes brings
forth new life and connections.

00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:12.493
It's a glorious thing really.

00:13:12.593 --> 00:13:16.096
[ISHTAR] Having sex with many
partners is anything but wrong.

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:20.501
[BELL] Yeah well even if that is
true, can't you see that Miss
Haruhime is suffering here!?

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:24.905
(sigh) Enough already.. I do
not intend to argue with you.

00:13:25.573 --> 00:13:27.274
(BELL pain) (anger)

00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:29.142
Tammuz here, is a level 4.

00:13:29.242 --> 00:13:32.880
Your scrawny bird arms
are no match for him.

00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:39.887
(BELL panic)

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:44.625
What a little prude. Just what
has Hestia been teaching you..?

00:13:44.725 --> 00:13:47.461
Oh, I forgot. She's a
virgin goddess.

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:49.963
(struggle) Why'd you
take off your‐!

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:54.902
[ISHTAR] Little rabbit, I'm
going to charm you..

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:57.070
Ready for a real woman?

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.872
(ISHTAR slurp)

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.914
[OTTARL] Lady Freya.

00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:09.817
[OTTARL] I've received word from
Allen and the others...

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:13.921
[FREYA] Make the preparations.
I'll be tagging along.

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:23.731
(BELL pain)
[TAMMUZ] Come on,
open your eyes!

00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:25.165
[BELL] N‐n‐no I won't do it!

00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:27.067
[BELL] Would you please
put on some clothes!

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:28.869
What is the matter
with this kid?

00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:32.305
He should have fallen
under my spell by now...

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:33.741
(ISHTAR annoyed)

00:14:33.841 --> 00:14:35.543
Strip him down at once!

00:14:35.643 --> 00:14:36.844
[TAMMUZ] Y‐yes, ma'am!

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.884
(ISHTAR gasp)

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:46.219
[ISHTAR] Is that...
"Realis Phrase"?!

00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:48.321
[ISHTAR] He "Grows stronger
with his emotions"!

00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:52.526
That's.. impossible..!
So this brat is immune to
the charms of a goddess?!

00:14:53.561 --> 00:14:54.628
(anger)

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:56.597
What the hell's wrong with you?!

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:59.467
I'm really sorry!
Please forgive me!

00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:02.135
Tammuz! Do not let him escape!

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.404
Right!

00:15:05.973 --> 00:15:08.542
Damn you, insolent child!

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:24.792
(GUARD A screams)

00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:25.526
(GUARD B, HARUHIME gasp)

00:15:25.626 --> 00:15:26.494
(B pain)

00:15:30.798 --> 00:15:32.232
Miss Mikoto... Where'd you...?

00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:35.436
We have to get out
of here.. follow me!

00:15:35.536 --> 00:15:37.671
Why did you bother
coming here?

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:42.410
Attempting to help me will
only bring the wrath of the
Ishtar Familia down upon you.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.079
But, even so.. Master
Bell has declared he's
going to rescue you!

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:49.783
That's only because
he is kind hearted.

00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:54.388
You're wrong! He's not doing
this just because he takes
pity on you or feels guilty!

00:15:54.488 --> 00:15:59.893
Lady Mikoto... Please
I.. I've had enough...

00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:01.729
You don't... Need
to worry about me.

00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:04.632
[MIKOTO] Nonsense! Why do
you insist on giving up?!

00:16:04.732 --> 00:16:08.936
[MIKOTO] If you ask for help,
Master Bell will never abandon
you under any circumstances!

00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:10.838
[MIKOTO] That's not the
type of man he is‐!

00:16:10.938 --> 00:16:13.240
You wouldn't understand,
Miss Mikoto!

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:13.941
(MIKOTO confused)

00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:15.809
I'm just a prostitute!

00:16:15.909 --> 00:16:19.380
I give my body to people I don't
even care about, and then I take
their money!

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.849
[HARUHIME] Could you ever
forgive yourself for that?!

00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:24.418
I... I could never
just ask him for help!

00:16:24.518 --> 00:16:28.489
I can't beg him to let
me stay by his side
with this tainted body!

00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:31.692
All while knowing that I'd
be putting him in danger?!

00:16:31.792 --> 00:16:34.895
I can't do it! I... just can't!

00:16:35.963 --> 00:16:37.064
ell, that's...

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:39.400
[LENA] I spy a little rat!

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:43.471
(MIKOTO pain)

00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:45.639
[HARUHIME] (gasp) Miss Mikoto!

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.976
Oh no, did somebody fall down?

00:16:49.076 --> 00:16:50.978
[MIKOTO] Not yet!

00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:53.647
(startled)

00:16:53.747 --> 00:16:54.848
She failed?!

00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:56.917
But Miss Mikoto...

00:16:57.284 --> 00:16:58.318
No way!

00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:07.160
[MIKOTO] This is not.. over...!

00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:19.673
(PHRYNE toad laughter)

00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:22.075
(AISHA uneasy)

00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:26.580
Alright, now let's
start the ritual.
The Killing Stone.

00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:48.235
It's finally time...

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:51.405
...to end the
Freya Familia.

00:18:01.882 --> 00:18:03.150
(HARUHIME confused)

00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:05.252
(fighting)

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.055
[MIKOTO] Lady Haruhime!

00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:10.458
(laugh) You came
here all alone?!

00:18:10.558 --> 00:18:14.495
Lucky you, Haruhime! Your
valiant hero has arrived.

00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:16.530
Mikoto.. why?

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.065
You must leave this place!

00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:22.202
No matter how many times you
send me away.. I will return!

00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:23.871
[MIKOTO] I'm going to save you!

00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:26.874
Wow, you sound like
a real badass.

00:18:26.974 --> 00:18:27.875
[SAMIRA] Here.

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:30.511
[SHARAY] Oh, right!

00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:33.714
Hey, Phryne. Is it okay if you
let me deal with this one?

00:18:33.814 --> 00:18:34.982
[PHRYNE] Huh?

00:18:35.082 --> 00:18:36.484
[SAMIRA] Come on, you
guys had all the fun

00:18:36.584 --> 00:18:39.219
while I was stuck with
preparations! Have a heart.

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:41.855
Oh fine, do whatever you like.

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.157
[SAMIRA] Well, you
heard her. She's mine.

00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:47.194
[SAMIRA] Ya know, Lady Ishtar
might even let you have

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:49.663
the Renard if you somehow
manage to beat all of us.

00:18:49.763 --> 00:18:50.731
(MIKOTO surprised)

00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:51.999
(PROSTITUTES cheering, chanting)

00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:54.134
[AMAZONESS J] Show her
what's up, Samira!

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:59.707
No, wait! Please don't fight
her, Miss Samira! She has
nothing to do with any of this!

00:18:59.807 --> 00:19:01.341
Ya' ready?

00:19:01.442 --> 00:19:04.344
(fighting)

00:19:08.682 --> 00:19:10.651
Aw, come on! Is that all
you got?! (rapid punching)

00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:14.522
[MIKOTO, internal] She's
strong...! She's got the
power of a level three...

00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:27.401
You gotta be kidding me the
rabbit escaped? What in the
hell is Lady Ishtar doing?!

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:30.971
Yoo‐hoo! Come out come out
wherever you are boy!

00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:36.710
[PHRYNE] And you better come
quick! Your friend doesn't look
like she's doing so good.

00:19:40.914 --> 00:19:42.282
[MIKOTO] Not yet!

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:45.953
[MIKOTO] Master Bell...!
Don't come out yet!

00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:50.924
Oh? And what exactly
are you gonna do? Look,
you're out of time.

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.225
(MIKOTO gasp)

00:19:56.764 --> 00:19:58.632
(HARUHIME trembling)

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:03.336
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] Listen
carefully, Mikoto. Ninjas
are devious.

00:20:03.437 --> 00:20:05.606
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] Deceit
is not in your nature...

00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:08.075
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] However, a ninja
is loyal to their comrades.

00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:10.844
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] Should a
situation involve someone
you care for..

00:20:10.944 --> 00:20:13.714
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] I believe a girl
as kind and honest as yourself

00:20:13.814 --> 00:20:17.184
can become one of the greatest
warriors in our time.

00:20:17.284 --> 00:20:20.187
[MIKOTO] Exceed the enemy's
expectations...

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:23.156
[SAMIRA] Let's stop wasting time
and end th‐! (oof)

00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:25.693
Exceed expectations...
"God of Strength".

00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:30.263
Really? Now you're using
magic? I just said you're
out of time, silly girl!

00:20:30.363 --> 00:20:31.699
(SAMIRA hitting MIKOTO)

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.768
[MIKOTO] Th‐the bringer of...
(gasp) (pain)

00:20:34.868 --> 00:20:36.837
O‐of Destruction...! (pain)

00:20:36.937 --> 00:20:39.373
[SAMIRA] I watched you use this
spell during the War Game!
[MIKOTO] I humbly beseech you!

00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:42.042
[SAMIRA] It takes way too
long for you to cast, idiot!
[MIKOTO] Grant me guidance...

00:20:42.142 --> 00:20:45.078
[SAMIRA] You're gonna lose
anyway, so just give up!
[MIKOTO] ...from the heavens!

00:20:45.178 --> 00:20:48.549
[SAMIRA] What are.. you doing?

00:20:48.649 --> 00:20:50.684
[MIKOTO] Bless this
trifling body...

00:20:50.784 --> 00:20:52.853
[SAMIRA] No friggin' way...
[MIKOTO] with the overwhelming
might of the divine!

00:20:52.953 --> 00:20:55.856
[SAMIRA] Get away from me!
Stop it! Let go! Damn you,
you wretched girl!

00:20:55.956 --> 00:20:58.859
(SAMIRA rapid punching)
[MIKOTO] (pain) Exceed the
enemy's expectations...

00:20:58.959 --> 00:21:00.394
[MIKOTO] A ninja's greatest
skill...
