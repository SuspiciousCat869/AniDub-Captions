WEBVTT

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:04.638
[FEMALE] I'm begging you! Let me
have some of Master Soma's wine!

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:07.508
Just a sip! Please,
one sip is all I need!

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.676
[MALE] Please! We
can't live without it!

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.245
[GUARD] There's no wine
for you! I said get lost!

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.048
[ZANIS] Master Soma, it's Zanis.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.957
[ZANIS] The missing Liliruca
Arde has finally returned to us.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:27.528
[ZANIS] She has seen the error
of her ways and will devote
herself to the Familia‐

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:32.365
Master! I beg you!
Please allow me to
leave the Familia!

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.737
Master Soma!

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.204
[ZANIS] Honestly...!
(LILI gasps)

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.974
I assumed you were
smarter than that.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.145
Listen here... If you wish
to leave, you must provide
compensation.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.447
It's that simple.

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.049
Compensation?

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.619
Oh yes... It is only proper
to repay Master Soma

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.822
for the generosity he has
shown you over the years.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:59.593
I believe around ten million
valis would be appropriate.

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:00.994
Ten million?!

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.029
There's no way I
can get that much!

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.365
[ZANIS] Is that
fair, Master Soma?

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.001
I leave it all to you.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.370
(LILI disbelief)

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.242
[OPENING SONG, "HELLO to DREAM"]

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.218
[ZANIS]
You're a pathetic fool, Arde.

00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:52.655
[ZANIS] Our god only concerns
himself with his wine.

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:56.225
You can beg and plead all
you want, but he'll never
listen to you.

00:02:56.325 --> 00:03:01.731
[ZANIS] Besides, leaving the
Familia goes against our little
agreement, does it not?

00:03:02.598 --> 00:03:04.967
[ZANIS] I finally
found you, Arde.

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:07.503
(LILI gasp) (terrified)

00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:09.572
[LILI] Master Zanis...

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:11.607
I'm glad to see you're
in good health.

00:03:11.707 --> 00:03:14.610
I'd heard through the
grapevine you were deceased.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.145
(LILI terrified)

00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:19.715
[LILI] Why?! Why are you working
with the Apollo Familia?!

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:22.385
Aside from the fact that
they sought our help,

00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:25.521
we have a very good reason
for joining this skirmish.

00:03:26.088 --> 00:03:27.890
[LILI] Which is...?

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.493
[ZANIS] To take you back.. Arde.

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:31.727
(LILI gasp)

00:03:31.827 --> 00:03:34.564
[ZANIS] You are an invaluable
member of our Familia.

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:37.933
[ZANIS] We can't stand idly by
while another steals you.

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:40.102
[ZANIS] We are well
within our rights!

00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:43.005
[LILI] You're doing this...
because of me?

00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:45.140
(LILI startled)
[ZANIS] Do not fret, Arde.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.379
[ZANIS] You were deceived,
threatened, and abused by
the Hestia Familia.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.581
We will take care of them.

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:55.818
[LILI] Please... stop this.

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:57.820
I'll do anything

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.255
if you just leave Master
Bell and the others alone!

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:06.295
And I will.. even go back to
Master Soma! So please, no more!

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:07.630
[ZANIS] Our men
have pulled back,

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.332
so we held up our
end of the bargain.

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:14.269
[ZANIS] It'd be wise to return
the favor and serve the Familia.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.272
And what exactly is it
that you want me to do?

00:04:17.373 --> 00:04:21.276
We know you possess a peculiar
sort of transformation magic.

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:23.312
(gasp) How'd
you know that?

00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:25.648
[ZANIS] Master Soma informed me.

00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:29.352
[ZANIS] He may only care about
wine, but he still listens to
his second‐in‐command.

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:31.053
(LILI slight anger)

00:04:31.153 --> 00:04:32.788
I'm going to work you
into the ground,

00:04:32.888 --> 00:04:35.791
both for myself and for
the benefit of our Familia.

00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:37.627
(evil laughter)

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:39.028
(LILI anger)

00:04:39.128 --> 00:04:41.130
[ZANIS] Don't you go anywhere.

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:43.766
[CHANDRA] Hmph.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.935
[WOMAN A] It's almost time!

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:47.937
It won't be long
now, I can't wait.

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:49.204
[CHLOE] The War
Game's coming up.

00:04:49.304 --> 00:04:50.773
I wonder how
that'll play out.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:53.108
Everyone seems to think that
Lady Hestia isn't gonna

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:55.077
show up to the meeting
with the other gods.

00:04:55.177 --> 00:04:59.382
Meow that you mention it,
I haven't seen Mr. White
Hair around recently.

00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:02.552
You don't think they're
planning to skip town, do you?

00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:04.720
[SYR] Mr. Bell won't run away.
[ANYA &amp; CHLOE] Oh?

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.757
No, not him. He would never.

00:05:09.224 --> 00:05:11.894
[ANYA] Yeah.. You're
probably right. Mmhm.

00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:14.630
Well we'll be
rooting for him.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.933
(SYR concern)

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:21.404
[HESTIA] I finally got a
lead on where they're
keeping Miss Supporter.

00:05:21.504 --> 00:05:24.574
She's at one of Soma's
storehouses near the canal.

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:27.342
[HESTIA] They have a
wine shipment scheduled
to go out tomorrow.

00:05:27.443 --> 00:05:31.947
[HESTIA] We're going to wait
for security to die down at
night and then make our move.

00:05:33.048 --> 00:05:34.283
I understand...

00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:36.886
but Lady Hestia, may I
ask one quick question?

00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:38.688
[HESTIA] What is it, Ouka?

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:42.925
I would have to assume... your
top priority is winning the War
Game, yes?

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:48.931
[OUKA] I just feel rescuing
Liliruca Arde will do nothing to
help you defeat your enemies.

00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:53.803
Are you sure... it's in your
best interest to be worrying
about her right now?

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:56.572
Hey you, watch it.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.943
[HESTIA] Without her, Bell
won't stand a chance.

00:06:01.043 --> 00:06:01.677
(NAAZA reaction)

00:06:01.777 --> 00:06:04.313
(fighting)

00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:09.352
[HESTIA] He's out there right
now, desperately trying to get
stronger for the War Game.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.921
And knowing Bell, if we
don't save his Supporter,

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.358
then there's no way he'll be
able to focus on the fight
that's ahead of him.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.027
[HESTIA] He knows the
weakness of being alone...

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:20.896
[HESTIA] and the strength that
comes from having friends.

00:06:20.996 --> 00:06:26.001
[HESTIA] Besides, I promised.
I told him to let me worry about
getting her back.

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:30.506
And as a goddess, I can't
go back on my word.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.009
[HESTIA] All of
this is connected.

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:36.011
If I can rescue Liliruca.

00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:38.414
Bell will, in turn,
grow stronger.

00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:40.483
[HESTIA] And I could
use all your help.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:41.951
I got your back, lil lady.

00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:44.654
[MIKOTO] I'm in.
[OUKA] Let's do it!
We're with you!

00:06:44.754 --> 00:06:45.788
(HESTIA satisfied)

00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:47.089
(APOLLO frustrated!)

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:48.724
Is Hestia toying with me?!

00:06:48.824 --> 00:06:51.494
Don't tell me she's
postponing again?!

00:06:51.594 --> 00:06:54.263
She fell ill.
It's out of our control.

00:06:54.364 --> 00:06:56.466
Apparently she's been
fighting a severe fever

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:58.968
ever since the day you sent
your children after her.

00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:00.603
She's totally fakin' it.

00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:02.838
The lyin' lil' shrimp's just
waiting to make a break for it

00:07:02.938 --> 00:07:04.139
in the middle of the night!

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:05.841
(GODS laughter)

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.244
I have had just about
enough of this charade.

00:07:09.344 --> 00:07:13.949
I suppose the Guild will have no
choice but to declare the war a
forfeit at this point.

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:15.618
(GODS disappointed)

00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:16.218
(doors open)

00:07:16.318 --> 00:07:17.152
(GODS notice)

00:07:17.252 --> 00:07:20.289
Hey! I'm sorry I'm late.

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:25.528
[APOLLO] I want to make one
thing perfectly clear.

00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:30.232
If we win, we get Bell. No
wigglings, loop‐holes or vetos.

00:07:30.332 --> 00:07:32.167
And if we win
the War Game?

00:07:32.267 --> 00:07:34.437
I will do whatever
you desire.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.507
Hey Scribe... Make sure
you got that all down.

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:40.743
Now you're gonna have to decide
how you two will duke it out.

00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:43.278
And you better not pick
something too boring.

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:44.880
(GODS agreement)

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.717
Considering that Bell
is my only child...

00:07:47.817 --> 00:07:50.753
What about a one‐on‐one
battle between two delegates?

00:07:50.853 --> 00:07:55.458
(scoffs) Your lack of
members is a result of
your lethargic nature.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.127
Asking me to accommodate
that would be unfair.

00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:59.462
(annoyed)

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.063
[APOLLO] Perhaps we should
gain perspective

00:08:01.163 --> 00:08:02.798
by hearing the
opinions of others.

00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:07.470
How about if we collect
some suggestions and
draw one at random?

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:12.141
And you're sure about
leaving this up to me...?

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.711
I trust you'll be neutral.
Go ahead, have at it.

00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:17.813
I'm counting on
you, Hermes!

00:08:17.913 --> 00:08:19.815
Yikes, oh boy.

00:08:28.157 --> 00:08:29.359
(shock)

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:31.594
It's... a castle siege...

00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:32.261
Huh!?

00:08:32.362 --> 00:08:33.696
(laughter)

00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:36.632
Wonderful! Well,
then that settles it.

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:39.001
I won't humor any
arguments, Hestia.

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:40.069
(HESTIA angry)

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.537
Out of all those choices,

00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:43.373
why'd it have to be that one?

00:08:43.473 --> 00:08:44.874
Yeah no kidding.

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.443
He just had to choose a battle
where numbers matter most.

00:08:47.543 --> 00:08:51.514
Defending a castle
singlehandedly would
be next to impossible.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.384
As such, you may take
the offensive, Hestia.

00:08:54.484 --> 00:08:56.118
(HESTIA exaggerated
irritation)

00:08:57.553 --> 00:08:59.989
May I.. make a suggestion?

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:03.426
[HERMES] Now, I realize I don't
exactly have room to talk...

00:09:03.526 --> 00:09:05.661
[HERMES] but this whole thing
seems a bit one‐sided...

00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:09.164
Would you be willing to allow
Hestia some outside assistance?

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:13.035
Denied! Foreign help
for the warring
Familias is forbidden.

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:16.071
Violating the rules
would be both an insult and
affront to‐ (interrupted)

00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.040
[FREYA] Are you afraid, Apollo?

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.442
(irritated)

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:21.243
The idea of a few extra bodies

00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:23.278
appears to have shaken
your confidence.

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:28.017
Is the trust in your own
children's abilities really that
temperamental, dear? (hmph)

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:29.819
[GOD A] Yeah, what she said!

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.554
[GOD B] Lady Freya has a point!

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.188
(GODS various agreement)
[HESTIA] Freya...

00:09:33.288 --> 00:09:35.358
[GODS, chanting] Give her help!
Give her help! Give her help!

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:37.226
(appalled) Hey, do not mock me!

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:40.530
[APOLLO] Okay fine. I will
graciously allow it.
[HERMES] Whew!

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.365
However, only one helper!

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:45.968
And that individual must belong
to a Familia outside of Orario!

00:09:46.068 --> 00:09:49.204
[APOLLO] How doth you
favor them apples?

00:09:50.806 --> 00:09:51.874
Trivial.

00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:53.075
Very.

00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:55.110
He's so petty.

00:09:56.979 --> 00:09:59.181
[HESTIA] We're clearly
at a disadvantage...

00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:00.983
but considering the
whole situation,

00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:03.686
I'm really grateful Bell's
getting at least a little
bit of help.

00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:05.521
Do you know who you're
going to ask yet?

00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:09.592
Finding an experienced
adventurer outside of
Orario will be tough.

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.026
I have one idea.

00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:14.096
And I'll have to leave the
negotiations to Hermes.

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:20.603
[HESTIA] We'll worry about
that later though...

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:23.939
First we have to focusing on
rescuing Miss Supporter!

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.885
How are you feeling
today, Arde?

00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:38.788
I'm miserable.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.056
I need you to
absolutely swear to me

00:10:41.156 --> 00:10:44.360
you called your dogs off of
Master Bell and everyone else.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.596
Yes, I wouldn't lie.

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:49.264
More importantly, I've come
up with our next sting.

00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:53.469
We're going to use that
transformation magic of
yours to bring in some cash.

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:55.605
That's what this is all about?

00:10:55.705 --> 00:10:58.374
You mean you singled me out
just to make a quick buck?

00:10:58.474 --> 00:11:01.644
And sent people to hurt
Master Bell and Lady
Hestia and my friends...

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:02.945
[ZANIS] What's so
wrong with that?!

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:05.481
[ZANIS] I want Master Soma's
special wine!

00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.850
[ZANIS] Money and women
and the finest cuisine...

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.387
I want all the pleasures this
miserable world has to offer!

00:11:11.487 --> 00:11:13.689
(LILI startled)

00:11:13.789 --> 00:11:16.325
You don't know how much
I love this Familia!

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:21.364
I can commit crimes all day
long and our benevolent god
doesn't give a flying shit!

00:11:21.464 --> 00:11:23.366
I do whatever I want!

00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:25.968
It is the perfect setup!

00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:28.237
Your mask is slipping.

00:11:28.337 --> 00:11:29.605
Whoopsie.

00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:31.941
Regardless, you will cooperate.

00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:34.510
We'll go to the Dungeon tomorrow
morning, bright and early.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.412
(bells in the distance)
[ZANIS] Uh... hm?

00:11:36.512 --> 00:11:38.047
[ZANIS] What's that?
(LILI gasp)

00:11:39.649 --> 00:11:41.551
Seems a pack of rats snuck in.

00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:44.019
And it looks like they
got a young goddess with 'em.

00:11:44.119 --> 00:11:45.254
(LILI gasp)

00:11:45.355 --> 00:11:48.090
I see. We'll just have to
exterminate the vermin.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.893
[LILI] Wait! But what
about your promise?!

00:11:50.993 --> 00:11:53.663
You said you wouldn't hurt
Lady Hestia and the others!

00:11:53.763 --> 00:11:56.866
But they're here to attack
us, Arde. I have no choice.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:12:00.002
If you hurt them.
I will never help you!

00:12:00.102 --> 00:12:04.306
(LILI fear)
[ZANIS] Oh? Then perhaps
I'll force some wine down
your throat.

00:12:04.407 --> 00:12:05.908
(LILI gasp)

00:12:06.008 --> 00:12:08.978
[ZANIS] You'll soon become a
slave to your desire for more...

00:12:09.078 --> 00:12:13.115
(LILI drunken bliss)
[ZANIS] You remember it,
don't you? That bliss...

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:17.219
(pain/wincing)

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:20.856
Very well then. Keep
an eye on her, Chandra.

00:12:23.693 --> 00:12:24.494
(CHANDRA annoyed sigh)

00:12:24.594 --> 00:12:26.128
Smug bastard.

00:12:26.228 --> 00:12:28.063
(LILI angry)

00:12:28.163 --> 00:12:29.732
[LILI, internal] I've got
to find a way out of here

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.901
so I can help Lady Hestia
and the others escape.

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:33.302
(keys clattering on the floor)

00:12:33.403 --> 00:12:34.303
(LILI notice)

00:12:36.706 --> 00:12:37.773
But why...?

00:12:37.873 --> 00:12:40.142
I don't much care
for that prick.

00:12:40.242 --> 00:12:46.015
I ain't gonna say nothin'.
Do whatever you like.
(takes a swig)

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.854
(LILI panting)

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:57.927
(gasp)

00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.128
(fighting)

00:13:05.334 --> 00:13:07.570
(fighting)

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.507
[LILI] Master Welf...
And even Lady Mikoto...!

00:13:11.607 --> 00:13:12.775
Please go home!

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.344
Master Welf! Everybody!

00:13:15.445 --> 00:13:17.380
Hey! Liliruca! You okay?!

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.551
Please don't worry about me!
You have to get out of here
right now!

00:13:21.651 --> 00:13:26.255
[HESTIA] Not gonna happen!
We're not leaving this place
without you!

00:13:26.789 --> 00:13:28.558
Just go...

00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:30.560
I didn't want to cause
any more trouble...

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.028
I didn't want you to
get caught up in all this.

00:13:33.128 --> 00:13:35.765
You should just leave me here.

00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:39.168
[HESTIA] You don't get it!
Bell needs you!
(LILI gasp)

00:13:39.268 --> 00:13:42.037
Has there ever been one
time when he's given up
on you, Lili?!

00:13:42.137 --> 00:13:47.577
[HESTIA] Did you really think
he wouldn't be worried if you
disappeared all of a sudden?!
He cares about you!

00:13:47.677 --> 00:13:49.078
[LILI] But this..

00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:51.146
[LILI] This is all my
fault that Master Bell and

00:13:51.246 --> 00:13:53.516
all of you are having
to deal with this mess!

00:13:53.616 --> 00:13:59.188
And none of that stuff matters
now! We are about to fight a War
Game with the Apollo Familia!

00:13:59.288 --> 00:14:00.590
(LILI shock)

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.124
(fighting)

00:14:02.224 --> 00:14:04.527
[HESTIA] As we speak, Bell is
training his butt off,

00:14:04.627 --> 00:14:06.862
doing whatever it
takes to get stronger!

00:14:06.962 --> 00:14:08.898
[HESTIA] I am telling you...

00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:12.768
it's because he believes you're
going to come back home that
he's able to push himself!

00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:15.270
[HESTIA] Bell is
waiting for you!

00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:16.572
(LILI choked up)

00:14:16.672 --> 00:14:17.940
[HESTIA] It's not just that.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.975
Everyone else is pushing
themselves just as hard!

00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:25.114
Help us! Do it for Bell! He
needs you now more than ever!

00:14:25.214 --> 00:14:26.549
(LILI choked up)

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:28.384
(running/whimper)

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:32.321
(internal) Lady Hestia...
and Master Bell...

00:14:32.422 --> 00:14:34.256
I just don't understand!

00:14:34.357 --> 00:14:39.762
What does she mean? He "needs"
me?! I don't deserve it... I'm
worthless...!

00:14:39.862 --> 00:14:41.997
[LILI, internal] Why would she
say he needs me?!

00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:45.167
Of all people, why
does she insist on me?!

00:14:45.267 --> 00:14:46.936
(internal) Wh‐why?!

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.338
(LILI panting)

00:14:54.844 --> 00:14:59.582
Master..! I humbly ask for you
to please put a stop to the
fighting in the courtyard at
once!

00:14:59.682 --> 00:15:05.788
Find it within your heart to
spare them! Lady Hestia and
the others don't deserve this!
Please!

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:08.991
I am begging you, Master Soma!

00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:11.326
I don't care what happens
to me as a result.

00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:15.297
[LILI] Just spare Lady
Hestia... and my friends!

00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:16.932
(gasp)

00:15:17.032 --> 00:15:20.536
[SOMA] What merit is there in
the words of a child

00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:24.339
so easily consumed
by a lust for wine?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.676
(LILI whimper)

00:15:26.776 --> 00:15:28.177
(LILI gasp)

00:15:28.277 --> 00:15:31.581
I‐is that... is that
your wine? (gasp)

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:36.886
If you can drink this and
still make the same request..
I'll hear you out.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.424
(LILI heavy breathing)

00:15:46.596 --> 00:15:49.732
[LILI, internal] I have
to drink it... I have to...!

00:15:49.832 --> 00:15:51.901
[LILI, internal]
For Master Bell...!

00:15:52.001 --> 00:15:58.207
(LILI determined) (gulping)
(catches breath)

00:16:03.112 --> 00:16:06.115
(LILI drunken bliss)

00:16:23.933 --> 00:16:26.569
(LILI content)

00:16:28.804 --> 00:16:30.105
(gasp)

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.346
[LILI] P....please...

00:16:37.447 --> 00:16:38.514
[SOMA] Hmm?

00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:41.283
Stop the bloodshed!

00:16:41.384 --> 00:16:42.885
Please, Master Soma!

00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:46.556
I want to help the people
fighting down there!

00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:50.125
What the hell are you
doing here, Arde?!

00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:52.127
[LILI] I know deep down inside..

00:16:52.227 --> 00:16:56.832
[LILI] This is the moment I
was born for! This is my path!
(crying)

00:16:56.932 --> 00:17:01.170
Every single mistake I've
ever made in my life has
led me to this day!

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.273
This time, I have to be the
one to help my friends!

00:17:04.374 --> 00:17:07.209
[LILI] Please stop the fighting!

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:09.779
You mustn't listen to her
drivel, Master Soma!

00:17:09.879 --> 00:17:12.548
We're under attack by enemy
forces, this is no time‐
(surprised)

00:17:12.648 --> 00:17:14.249
[SOMA] Hush, Zanis.

00:17:23.893 --> 00:17:24.894
(surprised)

00:17:24.994 --> 00:17:26.295
(surprised)

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:31.333
Stop fighting... at once.

00:17:31.434 --> 00:17:35.337
(surprised)

00:17:36.071 --> 00:17:37.373
[ZANIS] Wait what...?

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:41.511
He actually.. gave
orders...? (anger)

00:17:41.611 --> 00:17:43.646
[ZANIS] Then I'll enjoy
killing you instead!

00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:44.614
[LILI] Huh?

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.951
Gah!

00:17:49.051 --> 00:17:50.653
(WELF charging)

00:17:52.922 --> 00:17:56.325
(comedic faint)

00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:01.464
[WELF] (satisfied) Vacation's
over, Lil' Bit. Pack up.

00:18:04.867 --> 00:18:06.436
(LILI happy)

00:18:10.473 --> 00:18:13.943
Master. Thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

00:18:14.043 --> 00:18:17.513
Will you please... hear
me out, one last time?

00:18:30.325 --> 00:18:32.728
[LILI] I want to thank you, Lady
Hestia.

00:18:32.828 --> 00:18:37.500
If it's okay with you,
I'm gonna run ahead so
I can properly thank
Miss Mikoto and the others.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.503
Sure.. I'll join you
guys in a minute.

00:18:41.604 --> 00:18:42.405
(HESTIA smile)

00:18:42.505 --> 00:18:44.507
[SOMA] Hestia..
(HESTIA notice)

00:18:44.607 --> 00:18:49.579
[SOMA] Did I.. really bestow
my blessing upon that child?

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:51.313
[HESTIA] Yes.. you did.

00:18:51.414 --> 00:18:54.183
[HESTIA] While you were wrapped
up in that leisurely hobby of
yours,

00:18:54.283 --> 00:18:56.619
she was alone and in pain.

00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:00.556
[HESTIA] You put that little
girl through hell, and now she's
stronger because of it.

00:19:00.656 --> 00:19:04.527
[HESTIA] You might take a
long, hard look at what
that says about you.

00:19:05.528 --> 00:19:08.998
[HESTIA] Thank you all
so much for your help!

00:19:09.098 --> 00:19:12.134
Don't forget... the real
battle is just ahead.

00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:14.036
Right. I'll do my best to help,

00:19:14.136 --> 00:19:18.608
but we're still nowhere near
the Apollo Familia in terms of
strength or numbers.

00:19:19.942 --> 00:19:21.577
I'll see ya' around!

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:26.682
Let's call it
a night. Yeah?

00:19:28.684 --> 00:19:31.687
We should head out..
uh right, Master?

00:19:31.787 --> 00:19:33.756
Oh, right.

00:19:45.067 --> 00:19:50.072
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] I really do want
to help Hestia.. but I'm not
exactly sure what I can do.

00:19:50.172 --> 00:19:51.741
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
There must be some way...

00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:53.643
(thinking hard)

00:19:53.743 --> 00:19:56.746
[MIKOTO] I have a request,
Master Takemikazuchi.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.848
Hmm?

00:19:58.948 --> 00:19:59.982
Please sir.

00:20:00.082 --> 00:20:01.784
May I join the Hestia Familia?

00:20:01.884 --> 00:20:02.885
To help Master Bell?

00:20:02.985 --> 00:20:04.720
(surprised)

00:20:06.856 --> 00:20:10.159
[HEPHAISTOS] So you're telling
me you want to convert to the
Hestia Familia?

00:20:10.259 --> 00:20:13.763
And you think that I'll just
allow such a selfish request
on your behalf?

00:20:13.863 --> 00:20:19.301
Honestly, the goddess I know and
love, would be furious with me..
if I didn't give this a try.

00:20:19.402 --> 00:20:23.439
[HEPHAISTOS] What happened to
wanting to create a weapon more
powerful than magic swords?

00:20:23.539 --> 00:20:25.841
Well, as long that
passion's inside me.

00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:30.746
I can forge weapons
anywhere. Know who I
learned that from? You...

00:20:30.846 --> 00:20:32.114
(HEPHAISTOS sigh)

00:20:32.214 --> 00:20:33.816
One last question:

00:20:33.916 --> 00:20:37.587
Why are you so bent on doing
this? I need to know.

00:20:38.287 --> 00:20:39.555
For my friends.

00:20:40.923 --> 00:20:42.091
(HEPHAISTOS sigh)

00:20:42.191 --> 00:20:44.059
[HERMES] Pretty please... Ryu!

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:48.364
[HERMES] You are the only member
who meets all the criteria that
Apollo set forth!

00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:51.967
I promise to make sure no one
finds out who you are! Please!

00:20:52.067 --> 00:20:55.304
Come on, do it for
me. Please Ryu!

00:20:55.405 --> 00:20:58.741
I don't think Mama Mia's gonna
be too happy about this.

00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:03.212
(sparring)

00:21:12.988 --> 00:21:14.490
[BELL] There!

00:21:16.058 --> 00:21:19.729
(BELL pained / heavy breathing)

00:21:23.433 --> 00:21:26.135
[AIS] You rushed in.

00:21:26.235 --> 00:21:29.238
[AIS] Monsters and people
fight very differently.

00:21:29.338 --> 00:21:32.007
[AIS] Monsters will
attack relentlessly.
[TIONA] Mm‐hm.

00:21:32.107 --> 00:21:35.244
People observe their
opponent and wait for
a chance to strike.

00:21:35.344 --> 00:21:40.383
And whenever they see an
opening... their movements
will become easy to predict.

00:21:40.483 --> 00:21:42.151
[AIS] Much like
yours were just now.

00:21:42.251 --> 00:21:44.019
(BELL react, disappointed)

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:46.422
[AIS] I learned
something a long time ago.

00:21:46.522 --> 00:21:52.027
Landing the final blow, is a
step away from one's own demise.

00:21:52.127 --> 00:21:53.496
[AIS] Your best chance
is to catch them

00:21:53.596 --> 00:21:55.798
the moment they think
they've bested you.

00:21:55.898 --> 00:21:57.433
[AIS] Don't forget that.

00:21:57.533 --> 00:21:59.669
[BELL] Right! Thank you!

00:22:01.003 --> 00:22:03.506
[FREYA] I had been toying with
the idea of eliminating Apollo

00:22:03.606 --> 00:22:07.377
if he kept up with his pompous
foolishness, but...

00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:09.679
[FREYA] I'll refrain.

00:22:09.779 --> 00:22:11.113
I'd be a drab deity

00:22:11.213 --> 00:22:15.485
if I weren't a bit interested in
seeing how this all plays out...

00:22:15.585 --> 00:22:22.291
[CLOSING SONG,
"Sasayaka na Shukusai"]

00:23:46.709 --> 00:23:49.379
[HESTIA] Next time: "War Game."
