00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.019
[ARES] Onwards! The time is
now, my valiant soldiers!

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.691
[ARES] Let the indomitable
Kingdom of Rakia strike fear
into the hearts of Orario's
adventurers!

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:28.595
(SOLDIERS rally &amp; cheer)

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.880
[MESSENGER 1] Sir, the First,
Second, and Third Cavalry have
all been destroyed!

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.684
[MESSENGER 2] (panicked panting)
They've also wiped out twelve
infantry units! They're all
gone!

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:54.454
[MESSENGER 2] Literally
everyone on the battlefield
has been obliterated!

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:55.421
(MARIUS groan)

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.559
[ARES] What the hell? Seriously?

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.628
[ARES] Why?!

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.566
[AISHA] Take care of yourself.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:10.303
Miss Aisha, thank you
for everything. I am
indebted to you.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.438
If you hadn't done what you did
who knows what would have happ‐

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.541
Please, Haruhime.
Don't get sappy.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.778
I was only following
my impulsive nature.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.114
What are your
plans now?

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.716
[AISHA] Excellent question.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:25.886
[AISHA] The Kingdom of Rakia has
set up camp outside the city.

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:27.453
[AISHA] I might
pay them a visit.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.623
[HARUHIME] The Kingdom of
Rakia...?

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:30.824
[WELF] The Ares Familia.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.793
[WELF] Their monstrous army
is launching an attack

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.061
on Orario as we speak...

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.197
[WELF] Luckily, they're
all sizzle, no steak.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:39.766
[WELF] They might number
in the thousands...

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:43.036
but ordinary soldiers are no
match for seasoned adventurers.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:47.340
[HESTIA] What a pain in the
butt. Ares is totally stuck
in the Dark Ages.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.809
[BELL] So... we're under attack?

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.411
[AISHA] Well, doesn't matter
whether they win or lose..

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:55.181
[AISHA] As long as there
are men, my girls and I
have a job to do.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.218
Don't tell me it
still bothers you.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.520
You do realize that you‐ Oh?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.322
[LENA] Aisha! We
should get going soon!

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:04.558
[AISHA] I know.
Give me a moment.

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:11.164
[AISHA] Anyway, Haruhime, you're
free now. Live your life however
you see fit. Okay, Darling?

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.834
[HARUHIME] I will.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:17.037
And it better not get back to me
that you're treating her poorly,
Cranel.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:21.007
[BELL] Huh?!
[AISHA] If anything happens
to my little Renard, your ass
will be mine.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:22.809
(HESTIA stewing)
[BELL] R‐right!

(AISHA giggle)

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.780
Ta‐ta!

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.619
So, how did it go?

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.621
I wanna hear how she took
it when you told her

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.723
she never actually accomplished
her nightly duties.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.459
Right? The poor little
thing would always faint

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.461
before the main event.
You told her didn't you?

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:45.398
Eh, why bother. I don't see the
point in bringing it up now.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:50.771
[AISHA] It seems they've already
moved past all that... whether
she's done something or not.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:57.310
[OPENING SONG, "HELLO to DREAM"]

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:28.636
[HERMES] Oh very good! Sounds
like it all worked out then.

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:33.308
[HERMES] And Haruhime has
joined the Hestia Familia?

00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:35.175
[HERMES] Mm. I'm
relieved to hear that.

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:37.312
[BELL] Well, we have you to
thank, Master Hermes.

00:04:37.412 --> 00:04:40.448
I really appreciate you telling
me about the Killing Stone.

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:44.184
Don't thank me. I'm just
a guy with a big mouth.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.822
You're the one who saved the
damsel in distress.

00:04:47.922 --> 00:04:49.357
Great job, hero.

00:04:49.457 --> 00:04:54.695
I just reacted. I wanted to
help her in any way possible.

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:57.965
So tell me... Are you familiar
with the Three Great Quests?

00:04:58.065 --> 00:04:58.833
[BELL] The what...?

00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:00.335
[HERMES] Heh. Right.

00:05:00.435 --> 00:05:02.870
Basically the world's been
waiting for a legendary hero.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.172
Pretty similar to
how Haruhime was.

00:05:05.273 --> 00:05:10.611
Long has the world watched,
looking towards Orario to
fulfill its deepest desire.

00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:12.179
Hence "Three Great Quests".

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.482
They call for the extermination
of three ancient monsters

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:16.617
that emerged from
the Dungeon long ago.

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:21.055
[HERMES] Behemoth, the King
of the Land. Leviathan,
the Lord of the Sea.

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:26.160
[HERMES] Now, these two
monsters already lay slain
at the hands of the strongest
Familias in existence.

00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:28.996
[BELL] Are you referring
to Miss Ais and the others?

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:31.832
[BELL] The Loki Familia
and the Freya Familia?

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:33.568
[HERMES] Nope, not them.

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:36.170
[HERMES] Who I'm talking about
are the Zeus and Hera Familias.

00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:39.674
[HERMES] They were formerly
hailed as the most powerful
in the history of Orario.

00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:43.177
[HERMES] They combined their
strength in order to challenge
the third monster.

00:05:43.278 --> 00:05:45.680
However.. they were wiped out.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.584
(BELL shock)
[HERMES] The third monster is
called "The Black Dragon."

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:51.886
Wait, do you mean... the
one‐eyed beast from

00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:56.257
Dungeon Oratoria? I think
I might know what you are
talking about.

00:05:56.357 --> 00:06:00.194
[BELL] It's the darkest shade
of black anyone's ever seen.

00:06:00.295 --> 00:06:02.162
[BELL] And its wings are
the absence of light.

00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:07.268
[BELL] It's a walking
nightmare... A living legend...
A herald of death...

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:13.274
It isn't a fairy tale.
The Black Dragon is lurking
somewhere and is a real threat.

00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:16.043
[HERMES] The Three Great Quests
have yet to be completed...

00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:17.978
(BELL serious)

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:20.248
[HERMES] And the
world wants a hero.

00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:22.883
And remember Bell...

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:26.887
This responsibility falls
on the shoulders of Orario's
adventurers.

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:28.222
[BELL] Right.

00:06:28.323 --> 00:06:30.291
[ARES] How is this possible...?!

00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:34.228
I demand to know how they could
trounce my army like it's
absolutely nothing!

00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:36.030
[MARIUS] Oh that's easy.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.634
[MARIUS] We severely
underestimated how strong
Orario's adventurers are.

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:43.271
They're wiping the floor
with us. At this rate they'll
take us all prisoner.

00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:45.573
[MARIUS] Let's just
pack it up and go home.

00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:48.909
We honestly had no
business starting a war
in the first place.

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:50.210
(ARES frustrated)

00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:52.347
[ARES] Cease your foolishness.

00:06:52.447 --> 00:06:54.249
Such impudence is inexcusable!

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.852
[ARES] Your father, Martinus,
has never had a problem
following my orders!

00:06:57.952 --> 00:07:00.788
[MARIUS] There's a reason
why they call my father the
King of the Pushovers,

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:03.724
it's because he indulges
your idiotic blathering!

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.827
[ARES] Hm? (nervous)
You dare speak to a
god that way, Marius?!

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.264
[MARIUS] I'm just calling it
like I see it, numbskull!

00:07:09.364 --> 00:07:14.602
[ARES] I'm not a numbskull!
Only a numbskull would call
a numbskull a numbskull.
You numbskull.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.909
(HARUHIME "whew" sigh)

00:07:23.444 --> 00:07:24.779
[BELL] I'm back, Miss Haruhime.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.748
[HARUHIME] Hello! Welcome
home, Master Bell.

00:07:27.848 --> 00:07:32.587
[BELL] Woah, doing laundry for
six must be tough! Let me give
you a hand with that.

00:07:32.687 --> 00:07:34.422
[HARUHIME] Y‐you mustn't,
Master Bell!

00:07:34.522 --> 00:07:36.156
It's fine. I'm happy
to help out.

00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:38.293
[HARUHIME] No, that's not what
I'm referring to.

00:07:38.393 --> 00:07:39.694
Don't worry about it.

00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:40.928
No wait stop!

00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:43.431
[BELL] Eek!

00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:46.601
[HESTIA] Oh, sorry, am I
interrupting something?

00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:49.270
What exactly are the two of
you smiling about down there?

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.805
[HARUHIME] Lady Hestia?!
[BELL] G‐Goddess!

00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:53.541
(BELL nervous)

00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:55.310
[HESTIA] I've made a decision.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.878
From now on, physical contact
with the opposite sex

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.415
is strictly prohibited
within my Familia. Got it?

00:08:00.515 --> 00:08:02.283
[BELL] Huh?
[HARUHIME] Wait, what?

00:08:02.917 --> 00:08:04.018
[HESTIA] Am I clear?

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:06.186
[BELL &amp; HARUHIME] (fear) Y‐yes..

00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:08.389
(HARUHIME nervous)

00:08:10.725 --> 00:08:12.427
[HESTIA] That includes
your dumb tail!

00:08:12.527 --> 00:08:14.895
[HARUHIME] (startled)
I‐I'm sorry!

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.431
[LILI] This is abuse of power!

00:08:16.531 --> 00:08:18.699
[LILI] Not letting us have any
physical contact is going

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:21.436
to have a negative effect on
our activities in the Dungeon!

00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:23.070
[HESTIA] Sounds like
a personal problem!

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.806
You're a smart cookie though,
I bet you'll figure it out!

00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.242
It'll be impossible!

00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:29.944
I assume the same rule
applies to you too, right?

00:08:30.044 --> 00:08:32.880
So there will be no
more touching Master
Bell from now on.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.782
I'm the goddess of this Familia!

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:38.052
If I can't touch him, then
how in the hell am I supposed
to update his status?!

00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:40.455
[LILI] Sounds like
a personal problem!
What the hell
caused all this?

00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:42.590
[LILI] You're a smart
cookie, blah, blah, blah.
I'm sorry to say this
is all my fault...

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.925
Stop being such a stupid head!

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.294
I'm a stupid head?!

00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:48.763
[HESTIA LILI] (anger) Hmph!

00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:52.967
Fine! In the event touching
is necessary... no flirting
is allowed!

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:57.972
Indecent behavior comes from
a lewd mind... So any obscene
conduct is unacceptable!

00:08:58.072 --> 00:09:00.341
[LILI] The only obscene thing
here is your outfit!

00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:02.243
Don't speak to a virgin
goddess that way!

00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:07.382
One question. If we can't
associate with the opposite
sex... then, uh...

00:09:07.482 --> 00:09:10.084
[MIKOTO] Does that...
apply to gods as well?

00:09:10.184 --> 00:09:11.519
[HESTIA] Hm?

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:13.721
[WELF] Actually... I was
wondering the same thing...

00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:18.793
I'm kinda... uh, good friends
with Lady Hephaistos, so, uh...

00:09:18.893 --> 00:09:19.494
[BELL] Oh?

00:09:19.594 --> 00:09:21.462
(HESTIA evil giggle)

00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:23.264
That's totally fine!

00:09:23.364 --> 00:09:26.567
I wholeheartedly welcome
feelings of love between
gods and their children!

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:28.969
[HESTIA] It's a dream of mine
to see our romance blossom,

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:33.641
just as it did between Spirits
and our children before we
descended from Heaven!

00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:36.977
How do you feel
about it, Bell?

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:37.978
[BELL] Wait, what?

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.146
Are you kidding me?!

00:09:39.247 --> 00:09:40.748
I see through your shenanigans.

00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:42.950
Holding gods to a different
standard is unfair!

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.084
(HESTIA pained)

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:45.453
Fine, then! Do
whatever you want...

00:09:45.553 --> 00:09:47.555
I really couldn't care less!

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.959
So, Bell... hypothetically...

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:56.331
Let's say there's this beautiful
goddess, and one day she admits
her feelings for you...

00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:57.898
[HESTIA] How would you reply?

00:09:57.998 --> 00:09:59.500
(LILI nervous)

00:10:01.369 --> 00:10:03.137
Oh... I'd turn her down.

00:10:03.238 --> 00:10:07.308
(HESTIA mortified) (wilting)

00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:09.244
It'd never happen anyway.

00:10:09.344 --> 00:10:11.612
Besides, even if a
goddess did ask me out...

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:13.348
I couldn't imagine dating one.

00:10:13.448 --> 00:10:15.215
[BELL] It'd be way
too intimidating.

00:10:15.316 --> 00:10:16.684
(HESTIA defeated)

00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:19.754
[LILI] Uh‐Lady Hestia...?
[HESTIA] Bell, you...

00:10:19.854 --> 00:10:26.627
[HESTIA] Big Jerk!
[BELL] Huh?

00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:29.997
[WELF] Think we'll
see her again?

00:10:30.097 --> 00:10:32.700
I have a feeling she won't
be back for a while.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.634
(BELL gasp)

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:35.836
[BELL] Goddess!
Why did she...?!

00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:37.772
[WELF] You kind of
had that coming, Bell.

00:10:37.872 --> 00:10:40.775
[BELL] Huh?!
[MIKOTO] You did word
it a little harshly.

00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:44.912
[BELL] But... the gods are Gods!
We're supposed to respect them!

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.048
(uncomfortable) So then...

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:51.519
does that same exact logic
apply... if you're talking

00:10:51.619 --> 00:10:54.922
about the relationship between
adventurers and supporters?

00:10:55.022 --> 00:10:56.391
[BELL] Huh?

00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:58.526
If you refused to give someone
a chance just because

00:10:58.626 --> 00:11:01.362
they came from a different
background than you...

00:11:01.462 --> 00:11:05.966
[LILI] ...don't you think
that would probably hurt
their feelings pretty badly?

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.846
[BELL] I'm going to
go look for her!

00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:22.517
Do you think
he actually gets it?

00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:33.594
[AMAZONESS A] C'mon sweetie,
get on your feet! You look
so sad down there.
[AMAZONESS B] We came all the

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:35.263
This saber is
a product of Orario!

00:11:35.363 --> 00:11:38.866
Act now for a 20% discount!
First come, first serve, boys!

00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:41.101
[SALESMAN] Watch how it slices
through a tomato with ease!

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.337
(SOLDIERS impressed)

00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:43.638
If you're not feeling well,

00:11:43.738 --> 00:11:45.740
you should use this medicine
made in Orario!

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.343
For just a small fee,
you'll feel good as new.

00:11:48.443 --> 00:11:49.644
(SOLDIERS defeated / pain)

00:11:49.744 --> 00:11:52.513
[AISHA] Tsk... Not a
decent one among them...

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:55.182
I should've expected as much
from a bunch of grunts...

00:11:55.283 --> 00:12:00.321
[SAMIRA] Aisha! Some fresh meat
just rolled in over that way.
Let's take advantage!

00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:03.391
Huh? Great... be right there!

00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:04.825
I've made a decision!

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:06.361
[ARES] Given the circumstances,

00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:08.195
I shall journey
to Orario myself!

00:12:08.296 --> 00:12:10.598
[MARIUS] What? You plan on
sightseeing or something?

00:12:10.698 --> 00:12:12.333
Don't be an idiot!

00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:13.768
In order to turn the tide...

00:12:13.868 --> 00:12:16.103
I'm planning on abducting
one of their local Gods!

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:18.673
[ARES] I'll kidnap them...
No, I'll "god‐nap" them!

00:12:18.773 --> 00:12:21.609
And then, I'll force those
Orario nitwits to surrender!

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:22.543
(MARIUS in disbelief)

00:12:22.643 --> 00:12:24.245
Oh my freakin' me!

00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:25.980
My new plan is foolproof!

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.181
[MARIUS] Are you crazy?!

00:12:27.282 --> 00:12:29.417
How exactly do you plan
on sneaking into Orario?!

00:12:29.517 --> 00:12:33.053
[ARES] Make haste, Marius!
Assemble a group of our
finest men!

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:36.891
[ARES] Today, we abduct a god,
whomever it may be!

00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:39.727
You haven't even decided
which god you're going for?!

00:12:39.827 --> 00:12:43.264
How big of a hot‐headed
dumbass can you be?!

00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:45.533
[MARIUS] Come back!

00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:47.635
[BOSS] Sorry, honey,
we're fresh out.

00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:49.237
Goddess...

00:12:56.444 --> 00:12:58.613
[BELL] Where could
she have gone...?

00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:02.116
[MIACH] Is that you, Bell?

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:03.484
(BELL notice)

00:13:03.584 --> 00:13:04.619
Hey there. Been a while.

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:07.021
Master Miach..
Lady Hephaistos...

00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:09.957
Hey, uh... have either of
you seen my goddess lately?

00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:12.793
Hestia, huh? Hmm...

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:15.896
I'm sorry, Bell...
I'm afraid I haven't
seen her around.

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:17.698
Yeah I haven't
seen her either.

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:23.137
No worries... Well, thank you
anyway... I should get going.

00:13:23.238 --> 00:13:27.074
[MIACH] Bell, we don't
mind lending an ear if
you aren't in a hurry.

00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:28.042
[BELL] Huh?

00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:30.445
Let me guess; you
got into a fight.

00:13:30.545 --> 00:13:32.046
I can see it on your face.

00:13:32.146 --> 00:13:33.914
(BELL hesitation)

00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:41.622
[BELL] I'm not really sure
how it escalated so quickly.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.592
[BELL] So, uh... Can I
ask you something...

00:13:44.692 --> 00:13:46.627
Has a god or a
goddess ever, y'know...

00:13:46.727 --> 00:13:49.464
fallen in love with someone
from the lower world?

00:13:49.564 --> 00:13:52.667
Would that even...
even be possible?

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:54.469
(HEPHAISTOS surprised)

00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:55.970
Of course... Yeah
I'm sure of it.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.273
[BELL] Really?
[MIACH] Honestly speaking...

00:13:58.373 --> 00:14:01.576
we sometimes find ourselves
quite drawn to you children.

00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:02.777
It's true.

00:14:02.877 --> 00:14:05.212
[HEPHAISTOS] Fondness,
a passing fancy,

00:14:05.313 --> 00:14:06.881
motherly or fatherly love...

00:14:06.981 --> 00:14:08.583
[HEPHAISTOS] Our love
takes on many forms,

00:14:08.683 --> 00:14:11.352
but there's no denying
that we have a soft spot
for our children.

00:14:11.452 --> 00:14:15.155
Sometimes.. there may be
feelings of romantic interest.

00:14:15.256 --> 00:14:16.257
(sniff)

00:14:16.357 --> 00:14:17.392
(BELL surprised)

00:14:17.492 --> 00:14:19.527
Um, but, we're
talking about gods

00:14:19.627 --> 00:14:20.895
being with people here!

00:14:20.995 --> 00:14:22.997
We're completely different
from each other.

00:14:23.097 --> 00:14:26.534
Who we are... Our
backgrounds... And even...

00:14:26.634 --> 00:14:28.903
[BELL] How long we live...

00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:34.108
What is it exactly that
you're afraid of, Bell?

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:35.276
(BELL gasp)

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:36.877
Y'see.. in our eyes,

00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:39.314
that love lasts a mere moment.

00:14:39.414 --> 00:14:40.881
From our children's
perspective...

00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:44.485
that same love lasts
their entire life.

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:46.487
[HEPHAISTOS] If you find
yourself being pursued
by a goddess,

00:14:46.587 --> 00:14:48.523
make sure you give
her a proper answer.

00:14:48.623 --> 00:14:54.629
Even if there's someone
else out there you have
feelings for... Got it?

00:14:54.729 --> 00:14:56.997
We aren't suggesting that
you should be intimidated

00:14:57.097 --> 00:15:00.501
by a deity, just speak
honestly and openly.

00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:02.237
That's all you
really have to do.

00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:04.439
[MIACH] I'm sure there are
many gods out there who

00:15:04.539 --> 00:15:07.708
would understand and
accept your answer.

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:11.045
So... please don't run
away... from a god's love.

00:15:11.145 --> 00:15:14.415
[MIACH] Turn them down
gracefully or take them
up on the offer.

00:15:14.515 --> 00:15:16.717
Just... don't be afraid.

00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:19.720
(HESTIA inhale)

00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:22.290
[HESTIA] Bell, you big jerk!

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:26.193
[HESTIA] You spineless,
pig‐headed, stubborn little
hare brain doofus!

00:15:26.294 --> 00:15:30.331
[HESTIA] Why does he
respect us gods so much
in the first place?!

00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:33.133
On one hand, I'm happy that
he thinks so highly of me...

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.536
but he doesn't have to
be so uptight about it!

00:15:35.636 --> 00:15:36.771
[BOSS] Hestia!
[HESTIA] Hmm?

00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:38.038
[BOSS] Perfect timing!

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:40.174
[HESTIA] Potato Popper
Boss Lady!

00:15:40.275 --> 00:15:43.611
[HESTIA] Okay... So why
exactly do I have to be put on

00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:47.382
digging duty for the Potato
Poppers? Can't you see I'm
of slight stature?

00:15:47.482 --> 00:15:50.851
I'm very busy! You know I
can't keep customers waiting!

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:53.521
I won't be able to keep up with
demand with just the one sack.

00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:57.492
[BOSS] I'm going to need another
big bag for the cart over on
Main Street.

00:15:57.592 --> 00:15:58.993
(HESTIA annoyed sigh)
[BOSS] Alright, I'll
leave you to it!

00:15:59.093 --> 00:16:00.361
[HESTIA] Huh?! But Boss‐!

00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:01.462
[BOSS] Thank you!

00:16:01.562 --> 00:16:03.498
Dangit... I'm a god, you know!

00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:09.003
Hmph. Doesn't she realize I
can't just leave Orario whenever
I feel like it...?

00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:13.207
(thundering)
[HESTIA] Great, it looks like
it's about to rain...

00:16:14.108 --> 00:16:15.476
But I suppose
it'd be pretty hard

00:16:15.576 --> 00:16:18.479
to make Potato Poppers without
the main ingredient...

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:22.483
[GANESHA] Hey, hold it!

00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:23.384
(HESTIA startled)

00:16:23.484 --> 00:16:25.052
Hmm...? Wait, Hestia?

00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:26.487
Ganesha!

00:16:31.326 --> 00:16:34.562
Whatcha say, Marius?! Isn't
this a splendid disguise?!

00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:39.233
Keep your voice down! Besides,
It's not much of a disguise!
All you did was put on a cloak!

00:16:39.334 --> 00:16:41.902
Anyway... what exactly
is your plan now?

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.004
[ARES] It's quite simple really:

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:46.574
We locate a suitable target
inside the city walls,

00:16:46.674 --> 00:16:48.776
seize them, and bring
them back with us!

00:16:48.876 --> 00:16:50.511
[MARIUS] That's all
you came up with?!

00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:53.814
[MARIUS] Just how
stupid are you?!

00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:55.383
[HESTIA] Thanks a
lot, Ganesha...

00:16:55.483 --> 00:16:57.685
I really appreciate you letting
me sneak through the gate.

00:16:57.785 --> 00:17:02.122
Of course... Potato Poppers
enrich our city and the
lives of its citizens!

00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:08.095
Let no man nor noble god...
deny you permission to gather
potatoes for the greater good!

00:17:08.463 --> 00:17:09.464
I am...

00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:13.301
...Ganesha! (agh)

00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:16.571
I can't believe I have
to go deliver potatoes.

00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:18.739
[ARES] Hmm?
[HESTIA] Huh?

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:19.874
[ARES] Hestia?

00:17:19.974 --> 00:17:21.442
[HESTIA] Ares?

00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:23.344
(ARES wild laughter)

00:17:24.712 --> 00:17:27.348
(HESTIA screaming)

00:17:27.448 --> 00:17:28.649
Gotcha!

00:17:28.749 --> 00:17:29.884
(ARES proud laughter)

00:17:29.984 --> 00:17:31.419
[ARES] Did you see that,
Marius?!

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:33.888
I've captured a god without
ever setting foot in Orario!

00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:36.391
[ARES] Now you can see the
genius behind my plan!

00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:37.525
[MARIUS] You're a jackass.

00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:38.393
[ARES] Alright, let's go.

00:17:38.493 --> 00:17:39.527
[MARIUS] Huh? Wait!

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.198
(GANESHA confused)

00:17:47.101 --> 00:17:51.239
[BELL] Thanks so much to you
both... I appreciate you taking
the time to talk to me.

00:17:51.339 --> 00:17:54.242
[MIACH] I hope what we said
helps you, if only a little.

00:17:54.342 --> 00:17:57.512
Yes, it helps...
Although, honestly...

00:17:57.612 --> 00:18:00.147
[BELL] I'm still not quite
sure what I should do.

00:18:00.248 --> 00:18:03.518
You can start by finding
Hestia. You should patch
things up first.

00:18:03.618 --> 00:18:05.052
[BELL] Right!

00:18:09.324 --> 00:18:12.593
I wonder if maybe she's headed
back to the mansion already.

00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:14.295
(BELL notice)

00:18:16.631 --> 00:18:17.432
[BELL] Miss Ais!

00:18:17.532 --> 00:18:18.966
(AIS notice)

00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:21.201
[AIS] Come with us.

00:18:21.302 --> 00:18:22.237
[BELL] Huh?

00:18:23.003 --> 00:18:24.672
[LOKI] That shrimp, I swear...

00:18:24.772 --> 00:18:26.607
Always such a pain in my ass...

00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:27.742
[AIS] Loki! Finn!

00:18:27.842 --> 00:18:28.876
(LOKI FINN notice)

00:18:30.278 --> 00:18:32.613
[BELL] (catch breath) Hey!
Is it true that my Goddess...

00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:33.914
she was kidnapped?!

00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:36.016
Yeah... unfortunately
it's true.

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:40.288
It's all thanks to a certain
masked idiot, lettin'
her waltz out the gate!

00:18:40.388 --> 00:18:41.689
I am Ganesha...!

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:44.692
I don't wanna hear another
word outta you, ya moron!

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:46.427
I am Ganesh‐! (kicked)

00:18:46.527 --> 00:18:48.463
[LOKI] Shut your face!

00:18:48.563 --> 00:18:50.298
No.. my Hestia..

00:18:50.398 --> 00:18:52.132
Finn.. Any word
from the party?

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.902
[FINN] Not yet. The enemy
forces have split off

00:18:55.002 --> 00:18:57.071
into several groups moving
in different directions.

00:18:57.171 --> 00:19:01.676
And that means... we don't know
who to follow since we don't
know who has the little runt.

00:19:01.776 --> 00:19:05.280
Plus, we gotta chase 'em through
the mountains, so we better
hurry or we'll lose 'em.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.548
[FINN] I'm a bit
embarrassed to admit it,

00:19:07.648 --> 00:19:11.286
[FINN] but they're likely more
familiar with the terrain
outside of Orario than we are.

00:19:11.386 --> 00:19:12.753
(BELL discouraged)

00:19:12.853 --> 00:19:14.555
[AIS] I'm going out there.
[BELL] Huh?

00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:16.023
[LOKI] Hold up, Aisy‐poo!

00:19:16.123 --> 00:19:17.191
You don't have ta
go outta your way for

00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:18.526
the annoying little half‐pint!

00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:21.596
[AIS] But... someone
has to chase after her.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.464
Very well, Ais...

00:19:23.564 --> 00:19:25.533
We'll leave it to you.

00:19:25.633 --> 00:19:27.067
I... I'm going too!

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:30.104
Come on... Were you even
listening to me, Bell?

00:19:30.204 --> 00:19:33.408
Ais told us she's got
this. You're just gonna
get her the way.

00:19:33.508 --> 00:19:34.875
(BELL shock)

00:19:34.975 --> 00:19:36.411
But she's my goddess!

00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:40.981
She's my responsibility!
So please... let me go too!

00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:45.052
[LOKI] (annoyed) Fine, whatever.

00:19:45.152 --> 00:19:47.488
But... if we chase
the target blindly,

00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:49.324
the culprits might escape.

00:19:49.424 --> 00:19:53.294
If we could just narrow
down which one of their groups
has Lady Hestia...

00:19:53.394 --> 00:19:55.696
[HERMES] I think I may
be of assistance!

00:19:55.796 --> 00:19:57.865
[BELL] Huh? Master Hermes!

00:19:57.965 --> 00:20:00.200
You just need to know
where Hestia is, right?

00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:01.902
Can you help with that?

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:05.940
Sure... I've got...
"Persius," Asfi at my side!

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.608
(embarrassment)

00:20:10.378 --> 00:20:14.214
(BELL panting)

00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:23.291
[BELL, internal] Goddess...
Please be okay!

00:20:27.928 --> 00:20:29.029
[BELL] Miss Ais...?

00:20:29.129 --> 00:20:30.097
[AIS] Hurry.

00:20:30.197 --> 00:20:32.300
[BELL] R‐right!

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.302
You dummy! Let me
down right now!

00:20:34.402 --> 00:20:37.071
You have another think
coming if you think
you'll get away with this!

00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:39.106
(quick laugh) I already
have you bimbo!

00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:41.141
[ARES] You may be
an annoying pipsqueak,

00:20:41.242 --> 00:20:43.878
but you're essential
to our god‐napping plan!

00:20:43.978 --> 00:20:46.481
[HESTIA] Oh! Who are you
calling a pipsqueak?!

00:20:46.581 --> 00:20:49.016
(MARIUS confused)

00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:51.919
[SOLDIER] It‐it's
the Sword Princess!

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:53.254
(SOLDIERS alert, confusion)

00:20:55.423 --> 00:20:57.458
[HESTIA] Ooh it's
Wallen‐whats‐her‐face!

00:20:57.558 --> 00:21:02.363
[MARIUS] (react) Since
when has Orario been
able master the sky?!

00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:07.034
This rests in your hands,
Sword Princess.

00:21:07.802 --> 00:21:09.570
[ARES] (frustrated) Very well!

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.473
One measly adventurer
isn't enough to stop me!
(HESTIA nervous) (screams)

00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:15.643
I am Ares, patron god of
the Kingdom of Rakia!

00:21:15.743 --> 00:21:20.080
I am the God of War...
Bear witness to my sword!

00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:21.882
(ARES shock)

00:21:21.982 --> 00:21:22.817
(HESTIA struggling)

00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:24.585
(screams) Uh, not bad!

00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:27.522
Do you even know what
the hell you're doing?

00:21:27.622 --> 00:21:28.556
(AIS tense)

00:21:29.123 --> 00:21:30.491
Sword Princess!

00:21:31.926 --> 00:21:33.227
(ASFI caught)

00:21:33.328 --> 00:21:35.763
[MARIUS] Archers,
take aim at that woman!

00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:39.500
[MARIUS] If we capture her,
Orario's adventurers won't
be able to follow us!

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.770
Hey, Marius! Don't give orders
like you're in charge!

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.305
(HESTIA struggling) (surprised)
[ARES] I am the god here!

00:21:44.405 --> 00:21:46.206
Give it a rest!
I'm telling you

00:21:46.307 --> 00:21:48.343
we need to use this chance
and make our retreat!

00:21:48.443 --> 00:21:50.245
[MARIUS] You thick‐headed
donkey!

00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:52.079
[BELL] Goddess!

00:21:52.179 --> 00:21:53.248
[HESTIA] You came, Bell!

00:21:53.348 --> 00:21:56.451
(HESTIA trip) (losing balance)

00:21:56.551 --> 00:21:57.318
[HESTIA] Bell!

00:21:57.418 --> 00:21:58.586
No‐!

00:22:01.822 --> 00:22:03.658
(BELL grabbing hold)

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:04.892
(AIS effort)

00:22:04.992 --> 00:22:05.960
(SOLDIERS confused)

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.396
[ASFI] Princess! Bell Cranel!

00:22:14.969 --> 00:22:21.709
[CLOSING SONG,
"Sasayaka na Shukusai"]

00:23:45.726 --> 00:23:48.829
[HESTIA] Next time:
"A Song of Love."
