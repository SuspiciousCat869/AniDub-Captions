WEBVTT

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.646
[ISHTAR] Come, ladies.
The night is young.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:16.149
[ISHTAR] Let's not keep the
clientele waiting.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.220
[ISHTAR] Show those men
the time of their lives!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.856
[ISHTAR] Let your desires
collide!

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:28.161
[ISHTAR] Waste no time, girls!
Lose yourselves in the throes of
savage passion!

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:38.271
[OPENING SONG, "HELLO to DREAM"]

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:11.150
[MIKOTO] (yawning)
I uh think I'm going to
turn in early for the night!

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.453
[BELL &amp; LILI] Okay! Good Night!

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:28.267
[WELF] Alright..
let's follow her.

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:30.670
[LILI] It's been a long times
since we've tailed someone.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.105
[BELL] This.. feels kinda wrong.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.142
[LILI] I had a feeling
she was up to something!

00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:37.910
Looks like I was right.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.414
She's a terrible liar, just like
a certain someone we know.

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:43.049
(BELL guilty)

00:02:43.683 --> 00:02:45.351
Oh! Isn't that..

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.192
I knew Chigusa was
involved somehow, too.

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:55.495
Where are they headed?

00:02:57.397 --> 00:02:59.632
[WELF] No freakin' way! Here!?

00:02:59.732 --> 00:03:05.071
(PROSTITUTES having
a flirty good time)

00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:10.410
(MIKOTO uncomfortable)

00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:13.112
[BELL] Uuh, hey Welf...

00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:16.182
Are we really where I think
we are...? Ah, I'm scared.

00:03:16.282 --> 00:03:19.652
Yeah. Smack dab in the middle
of the Pleasure Quarter.

00:03:19.752 --> 00:03:21.688
(BELL hard gulp)

00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:23.523
Well, I can't blame 'em.

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:27.159
If they're having a secret
rendezvous, it makes sense
they wouldn't tell us.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.128
But why'd they come
all the way out here?

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:32.064
Those two are obviously out of
their element and stick out like
two sore thumbs...

00:03:32.164 --> 00:03:36.268
[WELF] We should probably get
going. We don't want to lose
them in the crowd.

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:37.504
(MIKOTO horrified)

00:03:37.604 --> 00:03:38.471
[BELL] R‐right.

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:39.305
(LILI sigh)

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:40.773
[LILI] I had always hoped that

00:03:40.873 --> 00:03:43.610
Master Bell would never set
foot in a place like this.

00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:46.713
[PROSTITUTE A] Hey. baby!
Let's have some fun!

00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:48.180
[WELF] I'll say this.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.582
This place hasn't changed much.

00:03:49.682 --> 00:03:51.884
I remember the sights
as well as the smell.

00:03:51.984 --> 00:03:54.086
So you've actually
been here before?!

00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:56.923
(BELL in daze)
[WELF] Just once, when the
crowd I used to run around
with dragged me with them.

00:03:57.023 --> 00:03:59.592
[WELF] It wasn't really
my scene, so I hightailed
it outta here.

00:03:59.692 --> 00:04:02.328
[PROSTITUTE C] Hey pretty boy.
I like your white hair! You
like what you see?

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.331
(BELL startled) (taken aback)
[LILI] We're good, thank you!

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:08.568
[WELF] Seriously, where on earth
do they think they're going?

00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:09.569
(WELF notice)

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.338
[WELF] Oh crap! Hurry! (sprint)
(LILI sprint)

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.140
(BELL sputtering)
(PROSTITUTE C giggling)

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.442
[PROSTITUTE D] You know
what that means!

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:17.810
It's Happy Hour,
you little heathens!

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.011
(DUDES excited for happy hour)

00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:21.448
[BELL] Huh?! Wait a sec! Let go!

00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:24.383
[BELL] Help me out Welf! Lili!

00:04:27.587 --> 00:04:28.888
(MIKOTO big sigh of relief)

00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:31.290
[CHIGUSA] Oh, you guys
really saved us back there,

00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.225
I swear we cannot
thank you enough.

00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:35.895
[MIKOTO] If you don't mind me
asking, what brings you to this
part of town?

00:04:35.995 --> 00:04:38.598
We had a hunch something
fishy was going on with you...

00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:40.967
so we took it upon
ourselves to follow you.

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:45.872
Remember, we're a Familia
now so we don't keep secrets.
We're in this together.

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:48.207
I‐I'm sorry.

00:04:48.307 --> 00:04:50.076
Um‐please don't be
upset with Miss Mikoto!

00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:52.278
Besides, I suggested
we come here.

00:04:52.378 --> 00:04:55.247
Do you mind telling us
what this is all about?

00:04:56.182 --> 00:04:57.349
[MIKOTO] The truth is...

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.251
[MIKOTO] Lady Chigusa
received word that

00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:01.320
an old friend of ours from
the Far East is

00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:04.090
working somewhere within
this red‐light district.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.893
Now when you use this word,
"working"... you saying
what I think you're saying?

00:05:06.993 --> 00:05:12.432
[MIKOTO] Yeah...
[CHIGUSA] She was once a very
dear friend of ours; we all used
to play together as children.

00:05:12.532 --> 00:05:16.769
[CHIGUSA] However she vanished
one day and has been missing for
quite a long time now.

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:20.072
[MIKOTO] Unlike the two of
us, she's a direct descendant
of noble blood.

00:05:20.172 --> 00:05:23.843
[MIKOTO] I couldn't believe it.
That someone like her would
affiliate herself with a place
like this.

00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:30.550
[MIKOTO] so I wanted to come
here and see her with my own
eyes before discussing the
matter with the rest of you.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.119
[WELF] Quite the fall
from grace.. huh?

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:34.887
I get why you're concerned...

00:05:34.987 --> 00:05:38.458
but it wasn't very smart of
you to just rush in here
without a plan.

00:05:38.558 --> 00:05:40.059
[MIKOTO] Again. I'm so sorry.

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.094
[LILI] Anyway, we should
get out of here.

00:05:42.194 --> 00:05:45.331
We can help you gather
information. And find your
friend's whereabouts.

00:05:45.432 --> 00:05:47.099
[WELF] Little Bit.. do you
know where Bell went?

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.302
(concerned)
[MIKOTO] Wait, are you saying
Master Bell came with you?

00:05:50.403 --> 00:05:51.237
(LILI realization)
(WELF realization)

00:05:51.337 --> 00:05:53.473
(LILI panic)

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:56.375
(PROSTITUTE A interested smirk)

00:05:56.476 --> 00:05:59.011
(PROSTITUTE B giggle)

00:05:59.111 --> 00:06:00.179
(BELL dodging women/
freaking out)

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:01.648
(BELL gasp)

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:05.351
[BELL] I‐I totally lost them!

00:06:06.318 --> 00:06:08.354
[BELL] Wh‐which way
should I go...?

00:06:09.088 --> 00:06:10.490
(BELL nervous)

00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:14.026
(BELL nervous)

00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:19.466
(BELL uneasy)

00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.309
(BELL notice)

00:06:38.685 --> 00:06:42.088
[BELL] A demi‐human with fox
ears...? A Renard...?

00:06:42.188 --> 00:06:44.190
[HERMES] Oh? That you, Bell?
[BELL] Huh?

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.825
[BELL] M‐Master Hermes!

00:06:45.925 --> 00:06:48.695
[HERMES] Well... Surprised to
see you in a place like this.

00:06:48.795 --> 00:06:51.498
(BELL startled)
[HERMES] Suppose you're about
that age though, huh?

00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:53.466
You out here to
see a special lady?

00:06:53.566 --> 00:06:58.438
Uh N‐no.. that's not why I'm
here... What are you doing
here, Master Hermes?

00:06:58.538 --> 00:07:01.373
[HERMES] Hey, now! It's rude
to pry about personal affairs.

00:07:01.474 --> 00:07:05.912
Now let's do each other
a favor... and pretend we
never saw one other here.

00:07:06.012 --> 00:07:07.079
Sound agreeable?

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:08.781
Uh, yeah.. sure.

00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:11.984
I know. To validate our pact
between sensible men...

00:07:12.084 --> 00:07:13.620
[HERMES] I got something for ya.

00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:16.255
What is this stuff?

00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:17.757
[HERMES] An aphrodisiac.

00:07:17.857 --> 00:07:18.958
(BELL spit take)

00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:20.359
[HERMES] See you later, Bell!

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.929
Here's hoping we both have
an exciting night! Ow!

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:24.230
[BELL] W‐wait a minute!

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.898
(BELL sputtering/panicking)

00:07:25.998 --> 00:07:29.736
[BELL] I really don't need this
though! Please take it back!

00:07:29.836 --> 00:07:31.404
(startled)

00:07:31.504 --> 00:07:33.640
I'm so sorry!
Are you all right?

00:07:38.377 --> 00:07:39.979
You're new around
here, aren'tcha?

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:44.917
[AISHA] Ooh? You seem
a little wound up. (laughs)

00:07:45.017 --> 00:07:48.087
You can call me Aisha.
And you are...?

00:07:48.187 --> 00:07:49.856
(BELL stunned)

00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:54.694
So, how about you buy
me for the night?

00:07:55.828 --> 00:07:57.697
[BELL] U‐uh, no thank you!
I'm not here for...

00:07:57.797 --> 00:08:00.266
[BELL, internal] Huh?!
Why can't I move...?!

00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:03.736
(saultry giggle) Oh don't
bother fighting it.

00:08:03.836 --> 00:08:05.505
(BELL struggling) (smothered)

00:08:05.605 --> 00:08:06.806
[LENA] Who you got there, Aisha?

00:08:06.906 --> 00:08:08.675
[ELIZA] Your client
for the evening?

00:08:08.775 --> 00:08:10.877
[AISHA] I just ran into him.

00:08:10.977 --> 00:08:13.245
[AISHA] He's got an innocent
face, don't you think?

00:08:13.345 --> 00:08:15.114
[LEESHA] Oh my gosh,
he's adorable!

00:08:15.214 --> 00:08:19.218
[AMAZONESS A] So cute. First
time in the Pleasure Quarter,
sweetie?

00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:22.622
Oh? Hey, um, Aisha..?

00:08:22.722 --> 00:08:26.459
Doesn't this yummy snack look
like the Little Rookie?

00:08:27.627 --> 00:08:29.261
[ELIZA] You mean like
the one from the War Game?

00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:32.331
[LEESHA] I think you're
right! He has the white
hair and red eyes!

00:08:32.432 --> 00:08:36.368
You telling me this kid's
the record holder for
quickest rank‐up in history!?

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:40.940
(BELL smooshed)
[AISHA] Well, lucky me, I'm the
one who found him! Step back,
this one's mine.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.341
Awww!

00:08:42.442 --> 00:08:43.810
You have the wrong idea..!

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.012
I got separated from my
friends in my Familia

00:08:46.112 --> 00:08:48.080
and was trying to find them...

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.381
[BELL] P‐please let me go!

00:08:49.482 --> 00:08:51.150
Yeah that's real sad..

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.420
but do you want to explain this?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.588
Lookie! Top‐notch stuff here.

00:08:55.688 --> 00:08:57.557
[BELL] Whaddya mean 'top notch'?

00:08:57.657 --> 00:08:59.392
[AISHA] Alright,
you're coming with us.

00:08:59.492 --> 00:09:02.762
(BELL struggling)
[LENA] Please allow us to
show you to our humble home!

00:09:02.862 --> 00:09:04.263
[BELL] No, it's not like that!

00:09:04.363 --> 00:09:06.499
[BELL] I can't tell you the
reason why I have that junk,

00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:09.802
but you've got it all wrong!

00:09:10.903 --> 00:09:12.672
[BELL] I'm begging you!
Please let me go!

00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:14.574
[BELL] I'm not here for
anything like that!

00:09:14.674 --> 00:09:16.709
[AMAZONESS A] You just don't
know when to quit, do you?

00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:19.111
[ELIZA] I'm calling dibs
after Aisha's done with him!

00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:21.247
[LEESHA] What are you talking
about? I get him next!

00:09:21.347 --> 00:09:25.184
[ISHTAR] Aisha. Is that human
your catch for the night?

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:27.420
[AISHA] Lady Ishtar...

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.988
(BELL confused)

00:09:29.088 --> 00:09:31.123
Please don't look at
Lady Ishtar's face!

00:09:31.223 --> 00:09:34.260
(BELL tackled)
[LEESHA] Come on! Please don't
take this one from us!

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.564
It's not fair when they fall
under your spell. Please!

00:09:37.664 --> 00:09:40.533
(smirk) I have a client
to attend to this evening...

00:09:40.633 --> 00:09:43.870
I have no time to fool
around with a little boy.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:49.576
[BELL, internal] That's Lady
Ishtar...? Huh? Then this is...

00:09:49.676 --> 00:09:53.112
[BELL] The Ishtar Familia's
home.

00:09:53.212 --> 00:09:54.847
[EINA] Yeah the Ishtar Familia

00:09:54.947 --> 00:09:57.750
is among some of the most
influential Familias in
all of Orario.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.687
And well there are several
reasons for that, however.

00:10:00.787 --> 00:10:04.356
I don't think you really
need to know the reason why!

00:10:04.457 --> 00:10:07.494
[BELL] Ahh.. I understand now.

00:10:07.594 --> 00:10:09.228
[BELL, internal] Why is
this happening to me?!

00:10:09.328 --> 00:10:12.064
[AISHA] What do you not
understand about me
getting him first?

00:10:12.164 --> 00:10:15.968
[AMAZONESS A] That's no fair!
[ELIZA] Oh! Hey! Someone help
me get Lena off of him!

00:10:16.068 --> 00:10:17.236
(BELL scream)

00:10:21.207 --> 00:10:23.510
(BELL nervous)

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.078
Sadly, all of our
rooms are occupied.

00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:28.347
You can wait here until
one of them opens up.

00:10:28.448 --> 00:10:32.419
Though personally, I don't
mind if we get started right
here, my little bunny.

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:37.557
[BELL](scared) A‐aren't you
worried? I‐I'm from a different
Familia after all and ...

00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:40.727
[BELL] Um uh, letting a strange
adventurer into your home might
not be a very good‐ (scared)

00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:44.196
[AISHA] Please. We do this kinda
thing every single night.

00:10:44.296 --> 00:10:47.467
(BELL fear)
[LENA] Come on, don't you know
anything about us Amazons?

00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:53.339
[LENA] We like to capture
our men and devour them
whole. (blow)
(BELL terror)

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:59.278
[LEESHA] You're not leaving
until tomorrow morning. Maybe
even the day after, if you're
lucky.

00:10:59.378 --> 00:11:01.981
[AMAZONESS A] We're going to
suck the life right out of you.

00:11:02.081 --> 00:11:04.216
[AMAZONESS A] Wear you down
until you can't take it anymore!

00:11:04.316 --> 00:11:06.819
(AMAZONESS A, LENA, ELIZA,
LEESHA &amp; AISHA evil laughter)

00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:10.156
[PHRYNE] I think I
smell some fresh meat!

00:11:10.256 --> 00:11:11.257
(AISHA annoyed)

00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:17.630
(PHRYNE creepy laugh)

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.432
And what do you want, Phryne?!

00:11:19.532 --> 00:11:20.900
[PHRYNE] Where are your manners,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.935
you know that's no way to speak

00:11:23.035 --> 00:11:26.639
to the captain of your
Familia... Aisha dear.

00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:29.676
[PHRYNE] I saw it,
you know. The War Game.

00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:36.015
[PHRYNE] The idea of playing
with the Little Rookie sounds
mighty fine to me.

00:11:36.115 --> 00:11:37.016
(BELL gasp)

00:11:37.116 --> 00:11:39.486
[PHRYNE] And you're
just my type.

00:11:39.586 --> 00:11:43.289
[AISHA] Oh I don't think so.
We caught him, so this one
belongs to us!

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:50.062
[PHRYNE] You know I've grown
so tired of all the undeserving
men nowadays? Let me have a
teeny tiny nibble.

00:11:50.162 --> 00:11:55.435
[AMAZONESS A] Oh hell no!
Do you have any idea how many
times you've "had a bite" and
practically destroyed them?!

00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:59.906
[PHRYNE] Well, it's not my fault
I'm the only one who can truly
satisfy.

00:12:00.006 --> 00:12:02.775
[PHRYNE] Perhaps my
beauty is just too much.

00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:08.681
[PHRYNE] While I know
Lady Ishtar has some
redeeming qualities,
she can't match all this.

00:12:08.781 --> 00:12:10.850
[BELL, internal] She's gonna
eat me... (BELL hard gulp)

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.285
What a load of bullshit! Men
are avoiding us like the plague,

00:12:13.385 --> 00:12:16.889
we have to drag them back
here, it's all thanks to
you, you lumpy cockroach.

00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:18.858
[PHRYNE] Don't you sass me!

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:23.396
[PHRYNE] A bunch of ugly tramps
like you are just jealous of my
bewitching allure.

00:12:23.496 --> 00:12:26.766
You should try looking in
a mirror.. you bloated toad.

00:12:26.866 --> 00:12:29.569
You're getting on
my last nerve, kid.

00:12:29.669 --> 00:12:33.606
[PHRYNE] How about we settle
this like real Amazons once and
for all?

00:12:33.706 --> 00:12:35.675
[AISHA] Bring it on,
you giant freak!

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:38.010
[LENA] Oh?

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:41.681
(BELL verge of tears)

00:12:42.248 --> 00:12:43.282
(screaming)

00:12:43.382 --> 00:12:45.284
[PHRYNE] The first one
to catch him, gets him!

00:12:45.384 --> 00:12:48.421
[BELL, internal] I gotta
run! Run! Run, run!

00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:49.956
[BELL, internal]
I can't get caught!

00:12:50.056 --> 00:12:53.526
[BELL] Because if I do...
my life as I know it is over!

00:12:53.626 --> 00:12:59.065
(BELL panting / running)

00:12:59.165 --> 00:13:04.070
[BELL] My hopes, my
dreams, my aspirations...
smashed to pieces!

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.906
[BELL] The end...
of Bell Cranel!

00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:08.374
(BELL running scared)

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:10.276
[PROSTITUTE F] What? The Little
Rookie's on the run?!

00:13:10.376 --> 00:13:13.279
[PROSTITUTE G] They say we'll
get a hefty reward if we catch
him!

00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:16.082
[BELL] It's not
just their home...

00:13:16.182 --> 00:13:20.352
The Ishtar Familia has
control over the entire
red‐light district.

00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:23.923
[BELL] If I don't
get out of here,

00:13:24.023 --> 00:13:26.459
they're bound to catch me!
Where's the exit? Where?!

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:27.994
[AMAZONESS B] There he is!

00:13:28.728 --> 00:13:30.329
(BELL startled)

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:34.000
(BELL panting) (huh?)

00:13:43.976 --> 00:13:45.912
[AMAZONESS C] He went in here!
(BELL gasp)

00:13:46.012 --> 00:13:48.347
[AMAZONESS D] After him!
He can't get too far!

00:13:50.182 --> 00:13:54.220
(BELL panting)

00:13:54.854 --> 00:13:56.523
(BELL sigh) (notice)

00:13:56.623 --> 00:14:00.092
(running outside)

00:14:00.192 --> 00:14:03.496
(sigh) (notice)

00:14:12.004 --> 00:14:14.941
[HARUHIME] I've been
awaiting you, My Lord.

00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:18.277
[BELL] Huh..? What?

00:14:18.377 --> 00:14:20.813
[HARUHIME] I will be attending
to you this evening.

00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:24.417
[HARUHIME] My name is Haruhime.

00:14:25.618 --> 00:14:27.319
(BELL nervous)

00:14:29.789 --> 00:14:31.724
[HARUHIME] Please..
come, right this way.

00:14:31.824 --> 00:14:34.794
(BELL sputtering)

00:14:34.894 --> 00:14:35.795
[BELL] Wait‐!

00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:37.163
(BELL gasp)

00:14:37.263 --> 00:14:39.432
[BELL] Uhhh.. No,
I'm not here to‐! (fall)

00:14:39.532 --> 00:14:40.900
(HARUHIME small gasp)

00:14:45.772 --> 00:14:49.709
[HARUHIME] (soft gasp) Is.. is
this your first.. your first
time in a brothel?

00:14:49.809 --> 00:14:51.110
[BELL] Yeah‐!

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.281
Understood. Then please
allow me to take the lead.

00:14:56.182 --> 00:14:59.118
[BELL] No..! That..
won't.. be.. uh..

00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:02.188
[HARUHIME] It's going to
be alright, My Lord.

00:15:02.288 --> 00:15:07.293
I'll tell you what...
Just...leave everything
to me, okay?

00:15:07.394 --> 00:15:09.962
(BELL sputtering)

00:15:10.062 --> 00:15:13.365
[HARUHIME] Please, just try
your best to relax, My Lord.

00:15:15.334 --> 00:15:16.403
[HARUHIME] Wha...

00:15:16.503 --> 00:15:18.638
[BELL] "Wha"...?

00:15:18.738 --> 00:15:22.409
[HARUHIME] What a lovely...
collarbone...

00:15:26.112 --> 00:15:29.716
[BELL] U‐um... Hello?

00:15:29.816 --> 00:15:31.217
(down for the count)

00:15:31.317 --> 00:15:33.085
[BELL] Huh?! Huh?!

00:15:34.754 --> 00:15:36.255
[HARUHIME] My‐my
sincerest apologies!

00:15:36.355 --> 00:15:37.990
[HARUHIME] I mistook
you for a client

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.926
and forced you to witness
shameful behavior...

00:15:40.026 --> 00:15:45.965
Hey, don't apologize...
I'm the one who came
barging in after‐all.

00:15:46.065 --> 00:15:47.934
I suppose I owe you a
proper introduction.

00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:49.235
I'm Haruhime.

00:15:49.335 --> 00:15:52.472
[BELL] (awkward)
I'm, uh, Bell Cranel.

00:15:52.572 --> 00:15:55.508
Nice to meet you
Master Cranel.

00:15:56.342 --> 00:15:58.077
I hope you don't mind me asking,

00:15:58.177 --> 00:16:00.713
but if you aren't a client,
what are you doing here?

00:16:00.813 --> 00:16:03.650
[BELL] Oh, well, it's because...

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.584
[HARUHIME] Hmm?

00:16:05.184 --> 00:16:06.719
[HARUHIME] Oh, I see.

00:16:06.819 --> 00:16:09.055
Sounds like you were being
chased by Miss Aisha and the
others.

00:16:09.155 --> 00:16:11.424
I was, you know
who she is?

00:16:11.524 --> 00:16:15.662
[HARUHIME] Of course. Honestly,
she has always been very good to
me.

00:16:15.762 --> 00:16:17.096
[BELL] Is that so...?

00:16:17.196 --> 00:16:18.765
[HARUHIME] I can see how
it would be difficult

00:16:18.865 --> 00:16:21.734
for someone who's never
been here before to find
their way out.

00:16:21.834 --> 00:16:26.372
[HARUHIME] Once the sun comes
up, I would be more than happy
to show you the way to the exit.

00:16:26.473 --> 00:16:27.774
[BELL] A‐are you sure?

00:16:27.874 --> 00:16:31.478
Yes... We may never meet
again after tonight...

00:16:31.578 --> 00:16:38.217
But I would like to help you
out in whatever way I can,
Master Cranel. (warm smile)

00:16:38.317 --> 00:16:40.620
[HARUHIME] Seeing as how we
have some free time...
[BELL] Huh?

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.657
[HARUHIME] ...would you perhaps
mind if we talked until it's
time for you to head back home?

00:16:44.757 --> 00:16:46.225
[BELL] Uh, sure thing.

00:16:47.894 --> 00:16:52.231
[HARUHIME] So then, Master
Cranel... Did you come to Orario
to become an adventurer?

00:16:52.331 --> 00:16:57.804
I did. I.. kinda had this
dream. Plus, I was
completely broke too.

00:16:57.904 --> 00:16:59.539
[HARUHIME] How interesting.

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:03.610
As for me.. I ended up
in this area from a
place called the Far East.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.244
[BELL] The Far East?

00:17:05.344 --> 00:17:06.312
That's right.

00:17:06.413 --> 00:17:08.515
It's a land blessed
with natural beauty

00:17:08.615 --> 00:17:10.483
and four lovely seasons.

00:17:10.583 --> 00:17:14.487
However.. I was sadly
disowned by my family when
I was only 11 years old.

00:17:14.587 --> 00:17:20.292
Your parents disowned you?
I can't imagine what kind of
people who would do such a
thing to their child.

00:17:20.393 --> 00:17:24.163
[HARUHIME] I incurred my
father's wrath. There was
nothing I could do.

00:17:25.264 --> 00:17:27.767
[HARUHIME] So many things have
happened since then.

00:17:27.867 --> 00:17:32.739
And I finally wound up
here. I was sold off to
the Ishtar Familia.

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:34.006
(BELL sad)

00:17:34.106 --> 00:17:35.475
[HARUHIME] Oh but.. in truth..

00:17:35.575 --> 00:17:37.977
I had always longed
to see this city.

00:17:38.077 --> 00:17:43.015
Theater productions based
on the stories about Orario
are quite common back in
the Far East.

00:17:43.115 --> 00:17:45.084
Like "Dungeon Oratoria".
Those're good.

00:17:45.184 --> 00:17:47.820
That's right! There's also this
one I like about the knight

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.923
who traversed a labyrinth on his
quest for the holy grail.

00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:53.192
Yeah that's... "The
Adventures of Garrard"!

00:17:53.292 --> 00:17:55.194
The one where the queen was
suffering from an illness,

00:17:55.294 --> 00:17:57.163
so he searched for
the grail to cure her!

00:17:57.263 --> 00:17:59.131
Oh wow, you
know of it!

00:17:59.231 --> 00:18:02.902
What about the one where
a sorcerer rescues a genie
sealed away inside a lamp?

00:18:03.002 --> 00:18:04.537
"The Sorcerer Aladdin"!

00:18:04.637 --> 00:18:05.672
Yes! That's it!

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:06.873
Miss Haruhime...

00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:08.541
Do you like stories
about heroes?

00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:11.343
I do! I love them!

00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:19.118
[HERMES] Delivered as promised.

00:18:19.218 --> 00:18:23.055
I'm sure you're well aware,
but you are not to speak
a word of this to anyone.

00:18:23.155 --> 00:18:27.760
Come on, I know better
than that. I do not intend
to betray your trust.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.030
Although.. I'm curious to
know what you need it for.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.298
[ISHTAR] You looked inside?

00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:36.002
I didn't mean to, it
just sort of happened.

00:18:36.102 --> 00:18:38.971
[ISHTAR] I'm going to
show the world something
very interesting.

00:18:39.071 --> 00:18:45.011
[ISHTAR] That woman acts
like she's queen, but she'll
be groveling at my feet soon
enough.

00:18:45.912 --> 00:18:47.947
[HERMES] You goddesses
sure are scary.

00:18:48.047 --> 00:18:53.653
[ISHTAR] Hermes. Do you have
any information that would be
worth my while?

00:18:53.753 --> 00:18:55.187
[ISHTAR] Her weakness, perhaps?

00:18:55.287 --> 00:18:57.724
If I did, I'd have
told you already.

00:18:57.824 --> 00:19:02.094
You and I both know
it's impossible to lie
to a Goddess of Beau‐

00:19:02.629 --> 00:19:04.831
Huh?

00:19:04.931 --> 00:19:08.267
[BELL] "Dillard the Wanderer"
and "The Legend of St. Giorgio."

00:19:08.367 --> 00:19:11.070
[BELL] You sure do read a lot
of stories, Miss Haruhime.

00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:14.106
You're rather
impressive yourself.

00:19:14.206 --> 00:19:16.943
You probably know
as many as I do!

00:19:17.043 --> 00:19:18.911
I only know the
ones about heroes.

00:19:19.011 --> 00:19:23.716
It seems like you know a whole
lot more than I do, honestly.

00:19:23.816 --> 00:19:27.887
I must say, my favorite
story of them all is
actually about a hero.

00:19:27.987 --> 00:19:30.122
It's been passed down
for generations.

00:19:30.222 --> 00:19:36.128
A brave warrior saves a
girl from being attacked
by an evil demon.. despite
his small stature...

00:19:36.228 --> 00:19:38.531
That's "The Inch‐High
Guy," right?

00:19:40.066 --> 00:19:42.101
I want a hero to
take me by the hand,

00:19:42.201 --> 00:19:46.873
and lead me away to a better
place. I want to be just like
the girl in that story.

00:19:46.973 --> 00:19:51.811
But I know, it's nothing more
than a selfish, empty dream.

00:19:51.911 --> 00:19:55.582
I don't deserve to be
rescued since there's
not much value in me.

00:19:55.682 --> 00:19:58.150
[BELL] No, that's
not true! (hesitant)

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.020
A true hero would never leave
someone like you behind!

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.789
Of course you're worthy
of a life...!

00:20:02.889 --> 00:20:06.192
You are very kind..
Master Cranel.

00:20:06.292 --> 00:20:13.866
I appreciate it but I'm not
a tragic princess nor a saint
who's fallen victim to false
accusations.

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:16.736
I'm just a prostitute.

00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:17.870
(BELL taken aback)

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.572
I'm still inexperienced,

00:20:19.672 --> 00:20:23.075
but I share my bed and
have given my body to
plenty of gentlemen.

00:20:23.175 --> 00:20:27.647
[HARUHIME] I didn't get a chance
to wait for someone who would
sweep me off my feet...

00:20:27.747 --> 00:20:30.783
[HARUHIME] Rather, I've made
a living by selling myself.

00:20:30.883 --> 00:20:35.655
[HARUHIME] Why would
anyone want to rescue a
woman as disgraceful as I?

00:20:41.093 --> 00:20:45.398
[HARUHIME] Besides, to a
hero.. prostitutes are
harbingers of ruin.

00:20:45.498 --> 00:20:52.405
Ever since I resigned myself
to this fate, I've had no right
to enjoy those beautiful stories
anymore.

00:20:54.407 --> 00:20:57.610
[HARUHIME] I'm not allowed
to hold onto those dreams.

00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:01.914
After all.. I'm
just a prostitute.

00:21:05.418 --> 00:21:07.587
[HARUHIME] I suppose
we should get going.

00:21:07.687 --> 00:21:11.057
I had a wonderful time
speaking with you tonight.

00:21:11.157 --> 00:21:13.259
Thank you very much.

00:21:15.127 --> 00:21:18.598
[HARUHIME] If you follow
this road, you'll run into
Daedalus Street.

00:21:18.698 --> 00:21:21.701
[HARUHIME] Miss Aisha shouldn't
be able to find you all the way
out here.

00:21:21.801 --> 00:21:23.903
Go on.. quickly.

00:21:30.276 --> 00:21:32.344
(BELL dissatisfied) (anger)

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:34.514
[AISHA] What are you doing?

00:21:34.614 --> 00:21:35.915
[HARUHIME] Oh?

00:21:36.783 --> 00:21:39.185
[AISHA] You'll catch
a cold. Go home.

00:21:39.786 --> 00:21:44.223
[HARUHIME] Right!

00:21:45.357 --> 00:21:48.461
(HERMES sobbing)

00:21:51.398 --> 00:21:53.132
[ISHTAR] So Bell Cranel, huh?

00:21:53.232 --> 00:21:58.638
I don't get what's in that
woman's head. Why does she
want a brat like him?

00:21:58.738 --> 00:22:02.842
Okay, then... I'll just steal
him out from under her.

00:22:15.387 --> 00:22:22.328
[CLOSING SONG,
"Sasayaka na Shukusai"]

00:23:47.013 --> 00:23:49.416
[HESTIA] Next time: "Renard."
