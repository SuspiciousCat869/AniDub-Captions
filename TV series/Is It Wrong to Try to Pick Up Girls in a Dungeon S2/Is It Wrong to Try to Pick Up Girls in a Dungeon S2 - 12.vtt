(HESTIA coming to)

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.551
[BELL] Goddess? Are you awake?

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.586
Oh?

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.287
[HESTIA] Bell...?

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.023
So how are you feeling?

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.758
Are you in any pain?

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.793
[HESTIA] No...

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.929
I don't think that I'm hurt.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.532
But I still feel
a bit lightheaded.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:32.633
(BELL concern)

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.702
I think you've still
have a fever.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.370
[BELL] Have some water.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.574
Um... Hey Bell...
where are we?

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:44.177
A village in the
mountains. And this is
the home of their chief.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.982
[BELL] Miss Ais came to
our rescue after we got
washed down the river.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.784
(HESTIA gulping)

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:55.055
[HESTIA] (refreshing gasp) So,
where's Wallen‐whats‐her‐name?

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.857
Scoping out the area
around the village.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:59.760
She thinks Master Ares
and his men might still
be close by.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.566
(sigh) I'm so sorry Bell...
It's all my fault that
everyone got dragged into
this...

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.499

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:09.035
[HESTIA] (notice) Huh?

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.805
[KAAM] Please pardon the
interruption, my friend.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:12.739
How is she faring?

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.174
Oh, Mr. Kaam!

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.876
Hestia woke up
just a minute ago.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.043
(relieved)

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.745
I'm delighted to hear that.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:19.946
(KAAM gasp)

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.982
I appreciate your help...

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.150
I'm truly grateful.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.553
It was...
no trouble.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.420
Oh?

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:28.955
I don't mean to be a bother,

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.024
but I'd like to rest
here a while longer.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.826
[HESTIA] ...if that's okay.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.327
Of course it's fine...

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:37.130
Please do not hesitate to make
yourself at home, Goddess.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.802
My daughter Rina here.. will be
more than happy to assist you
should you need anything.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:42.969
(RINA warm smile)

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.805
[HESTIA] Thank you so much.

[OPENING SONG, "HELLO to DREAM"]

00:03:22.717 --> 00:03:23.818
[BELL] Welcome back!

00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:25.586
[AIS] How is Lady Hestia?

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:29.390
[BELL] She was awake for a
while, but she fell back asleep.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.159
[BELL] So... How'd it go?

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.062
[AIS] There was no sign of the
Rakian soldiers or Miss Asfi...

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:38.766
[AIS] I was only able to
find traces of a battle.

00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:40.901
Do you think they retreated?

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:42.036
I don't know...

00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:43.504
But I do think it would be wise

00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:45.039
to lay low for the time being.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.975
Uh...we should stay here
then... for a bit longer!

00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:49.477
(BELL embarrassed)

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:50.945

(KAAM wheezing)

00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:07.828
Thank you, I'm alright.

00:04:07.928 --> 00:04:08.929
(RINA worried)

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:10.365
[KAAM] I am quite fortunate

00:04:10.465 --> 00:04:13.334
to have such a thoughtful
daughter looking after me.

00:04:14.302 --> 00:04:17.205
Now... don't worry;
go get some rest.

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:21.108
Tomorrow you will have a very
full day... with the goddess.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.444

need to apologize.

nice, isn't it?

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:54.108
Yeah. The villagers are so
friendly and welcoming.

for some tea?

Thank you very much.

[RINA] We're holding a festival
this evening to pray for a
bountiful harvest.

Oh, thank you!

Hey Bell.. I bet they could
use another hand with the
preparations.

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:27.375
But your condition...
Shouldn't I stay here?

00:05:27.475 --> 00:05:29.344
They've taken such
good care of us.

00:05:29.444 --> 00:05:32.813
If we didn't repay them...
it would bring shame on
our Familia.

00:05:32.913 --> 00:05:34.282
I'm counting on you.

[BELL] G‐good morning!

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:48.796
So what do you think?
Everyone said it suits me,
but I'm not real sure.

00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:51.366
U‐uh, no! It looks
great on you.

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:53.534
(small smile) Are you
headed somewhere?

help out like this.

She's every man's dream!

Are all the girls in
Orario that gorgeous?

00:06:15.856 --> 00:06:20.195
Oh... um... we
have some variety.

00:06:20.295 --> 00:06:21.129
[VILLAGER A] There.

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.497
That'll do it...

00:06:22.597 --> 00:06:23.731
I'll come get you

00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:25.133
if we happen to need
anything else.

00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:27.502
Sure! Just let me know.

(BELL notice)

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:36.511
[BELL] What is this...?

00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:39.980
[VILLAGER B] It's a scale that
once belonged to the mighty
Black Dragon.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.283
"Black Dragon"...?

00:06:42.383 --> 00:06:44.385
[HERMES] It isn't a fairy tale.

00:06:44.485 --> 00:06:47.855
The Black Dragon is lurking
somewhere and is a real threat.

00:06:47.955 --> 00:06:51.326
[HERMES] The Three Great Quests
have yet to be completed...

00:06:52.993 --> 00:06:55.196
It's a scale from the
Black Dragon...?

00:06:55.296 --> 00:06:56.531
That's right.

00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:57.998
A long time ago when

00:06:58.098 --> 00:06:59.967
the Black Dragon was
driven out of Orario

00:07:00.067 --> 00:07:01.602
by the legendary hero,

00:07:01.702 --> 00:07:04.872
a few damaged scales
fell to our village
as it fled north.

00:07:04.972 --> 00:07:10.411
[VILLAGER B] There are both big
and little ones.. We have around
ten in total.

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.047
[VILLAGER A] And it's all
thanks to these scales

00:07:13.148 --> 00:07:14.415
that we have protection.

00:07:14.515 --> 00:07:16.317
With these, monsters really
keep their distance.

00:07:16.417 --> 00:07:18.786
What do you mean by that?

00:07:18.886 --> 00:07:19.987
Being that they
are the scales

00:07:20.087 --> 00:07:21.656
of the mighty
Black Dragon...

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:23.824
Ordinary monsters won't
come anywhere near them.

00:07:23.924 --> 00:07:28.996
They let us live in peace
as long as we show gratitude.
It's just our way.

00:07:29.096 --> 00:07:33.801
[VILLAGER A] I know, worshiping
a monster seems pretty weird.
But hey, it works.

00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:37.538
[VILLAGER B] You see, we
can't really rely on the
gods or the adventurers.

00:07:37.638 --> 00:07:40.141
We have no one out
there to protect us.

00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:42.042
We put our faith
in these scales.

00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:44.445
[BELL, internal] The one‐eyed
dragon of legend...

00:07:44.545 --> 00:07:48.816
The dragon that has the
potential to destroy the
world... protects them?

00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:53.188
You know, if somethin'
ever happened to the
mighty Black Dragon...

00:07:53.288 --> 00:07:57.225
I have no idea what we would do.

00:07:57.325 --> 00:07:59.760
It is why we must
pay our respects.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.165
[BELL] Miss Ais...?

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:14.242
[BELL] I guess they think
it's sort of a god.

00:08:15.109 --> 00:08:16.844
[AIS] That thing is not a god.

00:08:16.944 --> 00:08:18.646
[BELL] Huh? (concerned)

00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:25.753
Let's go.

00:08:25.853 --> 00:08:27.488
O‐kay!

00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:35.930
[BELL] Goddess,
I'm back from the‐

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:40.235
[BELL] Uh? Huh... Mr. Kaam?
Is there something the matter?

00:08:40.335 --> 00:08:42.036
[KAAM] Oh... Mr. Bell....

00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:47.842
What... great timing...
Could you spare an old
man a moment of your time?

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:50.445
[KAAM] Let me ask you.

00:08:50.545 --> 00:08:52.313
Would you say you
love your goddess

00:08:52.413 --> 00:08:54.149
from the very bottom
of your heart?

00:08:54.249 --> 00:08:55.883
Yes, of course.

00:08:55.983 --> 00:08:59.620
She's the one who took
me in when I had nowhere
else to go.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.356
(KAAM pleased)

00:09:01.956 --> 00:09:02.957
Mr. Bell...

00:09:03.057 --> 00:09:04.259
Take a look at this emblem,

00:09:04.359 --> 00:09:06.161
are you familiar
with this symbol?

00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:10.131
I think... it's an emblem
for one of the Familias,
is that correct?

00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:15.803
Yes... A very long time ago.
I was once a member of
a goddess's Familia.

00:09:15.903 --> 00:09:21.276
(BELL intrigued)
[KAAM] I loved her dearly and
was blessed because she returned
the very same sentiment.

00:09:21.376 --> 00:09:25.646
She was everything. We vowed
our love to one another.

00:09:25.746 --> 00:09:30.585
[KAAM] However in the end,
I wasn't able to protect her.

00:09:30.685 --> 00:09:31.219
[BELL] Huh?

00:09:31.319 --> 00:09:33.188

(YOUNG KAAM screaming)

00:09:51.339 --> 00:09:59.780
[KAAM] I was spared. I
managed to escape with my
life... while she was sent
back to Heaven... forever.

00:10:01.482 --> 00:10:04.352
[KAAM] Many times, I considered
following after her...

00:10:04.452 --> 00:10:08.289
[KAAM] But I couldn't squander
the life for which she had
sacrificed her own...

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:11.159
I came to this village
and have been here since...

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:15.896
I never... could bring
myself to take a wife
of my own after that.

00:10:15.996 --> 00:10:17.765
But... what
about Rina?

00:10:17.865 --> 00:10:19.099
She's adopted.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.101
All of the children
with no living relatives

00:10:21.202 --> 00:10:22.970
have been put in my charge.

00:10:23.804 --> 00:10:25.206
Rina's a sweet girl...

00:10:25.306 --> 00:10:27.342
she takes care of me now.

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:29.310
However...

00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:31.379
(BELL concerned)

00:10:31.479 --> 00:10:32.480
(KAAM coughing)

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.449
Mr. Kaam! Are you
feeling okay?!

00:10:34.549 --> 00:10:36.251
Should I get Miss Rina?!

00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:38.586
There's no need to...
be concerned...

00:10:38.686 --> 00:10:43.558
I know this frail body of
mine... better than any...
better than any.

00:10:44.459 --> 00:10:47.462
[KAAM] Mr. Bell...
Take care of her...

00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:50.731
[KAAM] Please be sure to
cherish your goddess...

00:10:50.831 --> 00:10:53.334
(KAAM coughing)

00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:54.769
Mr. Kaam...

00:10:54.869 --> 00:10:56.904
[KAAM] Remember
what I've told you,

00:10:57.004 --> 00:11:00.208
if only as the foolish
words of a dying man.

00:11:00.308 --> 00:11:01.209
[KAAM] But please...

00:11:01.309 --> 00:11:02.543
[KAAM] You mustn't end up

00:11:02.643 --> 00:11:05.846
with the same regrets...
as I carry.

00:11:13.488 --> 00:11:15.623
(HESTIA stretching)

00:11:15.723 --> 00:11:18.559
That's good; I don't
feel dizzy anymore.

00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:21.396
Although Bell has been pretty
sweet to me this whole time.

00:11:21.496 --> 00:11:23.864
Maybe I'll play sick
a little longer...

00:11:23.964 --> 00:11:25.833
(door knock)
[HESTIA] Huh?

00:11:26.534 --> 00:11:28.303
(weakly) C‐come in...

00:11:28.403 --> 00:11:29.270
[AIS] Hestia.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.906
Wallen‐whatser‐nuisance?!

00:11:32.006 --> 00:11:32.740
(HESTIA annoyed)

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.741
What do you want?

00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:35.943
[AIS] I brought you
something to eat.

00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:37.778
[HESTIA] Why? Where's Bell?

00:11:38.513 --> 00:11:39.947
He told me he needed to speak

00:11:40.047 --> 00:11:41.249
with the village chief.

00:11:41.349 --> 00:11:42.750
(HESTIA begrudging)

00:11:43.418 --> 00:11:45.019
Oh yeah... uh...

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.523
I guess I never actually
properly thanked you for
saving us.

00:11:49.524 --> 00:11:52.026
So thanks a lot for what
you did back there.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.328
It's fine.

00:11:53.428 --> 00:11:56.063
Ahem! So...
By the way.

00:11:56.164 --> 00:11:59.800
What exactly are your
feelings on my precious
Bell then?

00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:01.336
[AIS] My feelings?

00:12:01.436 --> 00:12:02.837
Oh, come on, you know!

00:12:02.937 --> 00:12:06.106
What sort of impression do
you get when you look at him?

00:12:06.207 --> 00:12:07.242
(AIS thinking)

00:12:07.342 --> 00:12:08.743
(HESTIA anticipation)

00:12:09.109 --> 00:12:10.278
Oh!

00:12:10.378 --> 00:12:11.912
A rabbit...?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.815
(surprised) (happy)

00:12:14.915 --> 00:12:17.652
[HESTIA] I had faith in
you this whole time!
(AIS confused)

00:12:17.752 --> 00:12:20.087
Just make sure you don't get
too friendly with him, okay?

00:12:20.188 --> 00:12:24.359
Rabbits can get carried
away pretty easily, you
know! (giggle)

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:26.561
[AIS] I think I... understand?

00:12:26.661 --> 00:12:30.165
(HESTIA sing‐songy giggling)

00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:34.869
(festival times)

00:12:34.969 --> 00:12:36.537
(BELL &amp; HESTIA excited)

00:12:42.577 --> 00:12:44.679
[HESTIA] Don't you
just love festivals?

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:47.448
Goddess, I take it you're
feeling better now?

00:12:47.548 --> 00:12:49.217
I'm feeling much better!

00:12:49.317 --> 00:12:51.452
Besides, today's
your big festival.

00:12:51.552 --> 00:12:53.754
I'm rested and ready
for a good time!

00:12:53.854 --> 00:12:55.523
(CROWD cheering)

00:12:55.623 --> 00:12:56.891
(HESTIA giggle)

00:12:56.991 --> 00:13:00.395
Alright! Now that our
special guest is here...

00:13:00.495 --> 00:13:02.397
let's start the harvest dance!

00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:04.532
(CROWD woo‐hoo!)

00:13:05.966 --> 00:13:07.902
[HESTIA] So, what
is a harvest dance?

00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:11.372
Well I... I wouldn't
exactly call it a
tradition..

00:13:11.472 --> 00:13:16.010
But when a single fella
invites a lady to dance,
it's like admitting his
feelings.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.114
[VILLAGER B] And! If the
young lady accepts, they
become a couple!

00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:23.451
Yeah? A couple, you say?

00:13:25.052 --> 00:13:28.423
We would be honored if
you were to join the
festivities with us!

00:13:28.523 --> 00:13:29.924
Wait, what? You mean me?

00:13:30.024 --> 00:13:33.261
Oh, good idea! If we have
a goddess dancing with us,

00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:35.396
we'll have a bountiful
harvest for sure!

00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:36.531
[VILLAGERS] Come and join us!

00:13:36.631 --> 00:13:37.532
[VILLAGERS] Yes! Come and dance!

00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:38.266
(VILLAGERS] Join the party!

00:13:38.366 --> 00:13:39.300
I shouldn't.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.436
Okay, okay. Fine, I'll dance.

00:13:41.536 --> 00:13:43.304
Is she a Goddess
of the Harvest?

00:13:43.404 --> 00:13:44.572
I don't think so.

00:13:44.672 --> 00:13:45.873
I'm pretty sure she's
more like a...

00:13:45.973 --> 00:13:47.808
[HESTIA] Well, Bell...
[BELL] Hmm?

00:13:47.908 --> 00:13:49.577
It looks like it's
my time to shine!

00:13:49.677 --> 00:13:52.247
I'm going to go and perform my
divine duties as a goddess!

00:13:52.347 --> 00:13:54.215
And just so you know...

00:13:54.315 --> 00:13:55.883
If you asked me to dance...

00:13:55.983 --> 00:13:58.619
I'd consider forgetting
about your little incident
the other day.

00:13:58.719 --> 00:13:59.887
[BELL] What incident?

00:13:59.987 --> 00:14:02.423
You know. Like, when I
ran from the mansion

00:14:02.523 --> 00:14:04.859
calling you a big jerk...
That whole thing!

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:07.362
[HESTIA] So, Bell..
hypothetically..

00:14:07.462 --> 00:14:11.766
Let's say there's this beautiful
goddess, and one day she admits
her feelings for you...

00:14:11.866 --> 00:14:13.501
[HESTIA] How would you reply?

00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:14.802
(BELL surprised)

00:14:14.902 --> 00:14:17.838
[KAAM] Mr. Bell...
Take care of her...

00:14:17.938 --> 00:14:20.975
[KAAM] Please be sure to
cherish your goddess...

00:14:22.443 --> 00:14:23.911
(BELL serious)

00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:26.714
[BELL] Alright,
Goddess. Let's dance.

00:14:26.814 --> 00:14:29.617
Only if you're willing to
do it the right way, Bell!

00:14:29.717 --> 00:14:31.085
And I know you're capable

00:14:31.186 --> 00:14:33.188
because I saw you with
Wallen‐whatser‐sleezy

00:14:33.288 --> 00:14:34.355
here at Apollo's banquet!

00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:35.656
[BELL] Eek!
[AIS] Hm?

00:14:35.756 --> 00:14:37.292
[VILLAGER A] C'mon, bud!

00:14:37.392 --> 00:14:38.793
You gotta get out
there and dance!

00:14:38.893 --> 00:14:41.929
[VILLAGER B] You
can do it. Go! Go!

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:43.063
(BELL consider)

00:14:44.432 --> 00:14:48.403
Will... will you please have
this dance with me... Goddess?

00:14:48.503 --> 00:14:51.772
[HESTIA] (giggle) Sure.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.983
[BELL, internal] It goes without
saying that I adore my goddess.

00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:06.221
She's the most important
person in my life.

00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:09.290
(CROWD cheering)

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.791
[BELL, internal] But...

00:15:22.303 --> 00:15:23.671
(BELL smile)

00:15:27.308 --> 00:15:31.746
[BELL, internal] How much
longer will she and I get
to be together...?

00:15:32.713 --> 00:15:34.149
...don't be afraid.

00:15:34.249 --> 00:15:39.287
[KAAM] You mustn't end up with
the same regrets as I carry.

00:15:40.255 --> 00:15:42.390
(RINA panting)

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.791
(BELL notice)

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:47.495
[VILLAGER A] Rina?!
What's wrong?!

00:15:47.595 --> 00:15:48.429
The chief...

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:49.364
My father...!

00:15:49.464 --> 00:15:50.898
(BELL gasp)

00:15:54.802 --> 00:15:56.337
[BELL] Mr. Kaam...

00:15:57.738 --> 00:15:59.674
[RINA] Father.. I've brought her
here.

00:15:59.774 --> 00:16:06.481
[KAAM] Ahh, Goddess Hestia...
Thank you for coming to see me,
one last time.

00:16:06.581 --> 00:16:08.216
[HESTIA] Don't be silly, Kaam.

00:16:08.316 --> 00:16:12.153
[HESTIA] You opened your
home to us. It's the very
least I can do.

00:16:12.253 --> 00:16:14.655
(KAAM happy but weak)

00:16:14.755 --> 00:16:20.761
When I first laid these tired
eyes on you... you reminded me
of my dear Lady Brigid.

00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:22.963
Did you just say "Brigid"?

00:16:23.063 --> 00:16:27.067
The goddess with blonde
hair and dark red eyes?
You mean that Brigid?

00:16:27.768 --> 00:16:29.737
You know... of Lady Brigid?

00:16:29.837 --> 00:16:33.141
Of course! Brigid was
one of my best friends!

00:16:33.241 --> 00:16:37.712
We hung out all the
time back in Heaven...
We fought a lot, too.

00:16:37.812 --> 00:16:40.581
I'm happy... to hear that.

00:16:40.681 --> 00:16:43.451
[KAAM] She was a gentle soul.

00:16:43.551 --> 00:16:50.090
She got along with everyone
she met, and yet she fell
in love with a man like me.

00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:53.861
Are you serious?! Oh
Kaam, please don't
let her fool you!

00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:55.330
Brigid was a feisty one!

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.165
She would always tease
me and call me names

00:16:57.265 --> 00:16:59.567
every time she was on the
losing side of an argument.

00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:03.704
I bet she was just
trying to make herself
look good in front of you!

00:17:03.804 --> 00:17:05.273
(KAAM weak laugh)

00:17:05.373 --> 00:17:07.608
Is that... how it was?

00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:12.280
I suppose... I never
saw that side.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.615
(RINA holding back sobs)

00:17:14.715 --> 00:17:16.651
[KAAM] Goddess,
please tell me...

00:17:16.751 --> 00:17:24.225
When I make my journey to
Heaven... will I get to...
see her again?

00:17:24.325 --> 00:17:30.398
[HESTIA] I'm sure she'll
manage to track you down.
She's stubborn like that.

00:17:30.498 --> 00:17:37.172
[KAAM] Honestly... I fear
that... I won't see her...
ever again... I'm afraid.

00:17:37.272 --> 00:17:40.040
(CROWD crying)

00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:47.982
[KAAM] Lady Brigid,
please forgive me...

00:17:48.082 --> 00:17:50.485
[KAAM] I wasn't able
to protect you...

00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:51.819
I'm sorry...

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:53.053
[HESTIA] Thank you... Kaam...

00:17:53.154 --> 00:17:57.091
Thank you for loving
me so deeply.

00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:10.438
[BRIGID] I will always love
you... now and forever.

00:18:11.472 --> 00:18:13.274
[KAAM] My love... my love...

00:18:13.374 --> 00:18:21.616
My Lady Brigid! Me, too... I
love you... now and.. for...

00:18:21.716 --> 00:18:23.284
(dying breath)

00:18:23.918 --> 00:18:25.720
(CROWD sobbing)

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.356
(BELL choked up)

00:18:29.056 --> 00:18:30.057
(cry)

00:18:30.591 --> 00:18:38.866
(CROWD crying)

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.683
[HESTIA] Oh, there you are.

00:18:55.783 --> 00:18:58.453
[BELL] Hey Goddess...
Do you think that...

00:18:58.553 --> 00:19:01.522
Mr. Kaam's back
with Lady Brigid?

00:19:01.622 --> 00:19:03.524
[HESTIA] Honestly,
it'd be difficult...

00:19:03.624 --> 00:19:07.695
When souls journey back to
Heaven.. they return to a
blank canvas state.

00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:12.167
They forget pretty much
everything... and then they're
born again in the lower world.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.101
(BELL sigh)

00:19:15.703 --> 00:19:17.305
[HESTIA] It'd be less
painful for us gods

00:19:17.405 --> 00:19:20.675
and you children if we didn't
swear our love to one another...

00:19:20.775 --> 00:19:22.910
Isn't that what
you're wondering?

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:27.882
[BELL] We humans pass on
before you, sooner or later...

00:19:30.251 --> 00:19:35.089
[HESTIA] Bell... You know
the pain of being left
behind, don't you?

00:19:38.593 --> 00:19:40.461
[BELL] Back when
my grandpa died...

00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:45.566
it felt like no amount of tears
could ever ease the sadness.

00:19:48.002 --> 00:19:53.874
One day my life will end...
And on that day, I'll be forced
to forget everything...

00:19:53.974 --> 00:19:57.245
[BELL] But gods,
they live on forever.

00:19:58.413 --> 00:20:01.282
I can't imagine bearing
that pain for eternity...

00:20:01.382 --> 00:20:04.385
You'll drive yourself mad if
you think about it too much...

00:20:04.485 --> 00:20:08.589
I believe that we
should just... (sigh)

00:20:10.591 --> 00:20:11.726
[HESTIA] Listen, Bell.

00:20:11.826 --> 00:20:13.428
Us gods and you
children might not

00:20:13.528 --> 00:20:16.197
always get to live in
this world at the same time.

00:20:16.297 --> 00:20:20.301
[HESTIA] But... I promise
I will always be by your side.

00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:22.137
(BELL gasp)

00:20:22.237 --> 00:20:23.771
[HESTIA] No matter
how old you get.

00:20:23.871 --> 00:20:28.843
Even as an old man,
I'll always be with you.

00:20:28.943 --> 00:20:30.845
[HESTIA] I'm never
going to let you go!

00:20:31.446 --> 00:20:33.981
Goddess... Hestia..

00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:35.383
And don't you worry.

00:20:35.483 --> 00:20:37.752
Even if we were
separated by the grave,

00:20:37.852 --> 00:20:39.954
I know for a fact we
would find one another.

00:20:40.054 --> 00:20:45.092
Cause y'know what... it
could take hundreds.. or
tens of thousands of years.

00:20:45.193 --> 00:20:50.265
I know I will find you again...
Even if you're reborn as someone
totally different.

00:20:50.365 --> 00:20:51.499
(BELL choked up)

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:53.168
And then I'll ask you..

00:20:53.268 --> 00:20:57.538
"Won't you join me... and be
a part of my Familia, please?"

00:20:57.638 --> 00:21:01.442
(BELL touched) (crying)

00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:04.245
It doesn't matter whether it's
the Lower World or Heaven...

00:21:04.345 --> 00:21:07.482
It'll be just like
with Brigid and Mr. Kaam.

00:21:07.582 --> 00:21:09.750
I will always find a
way to meet you again.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.455
So don't worry, Bell...
Living forever will leave me
with a lot of time on my hands.

00:21:14.555 --> 00:21:20.461
[HESTIA] So, please...
Don't be afraid. Don't
be afraid of loving us.

00:21:21.028 --> 00:21:22.530
[BELL] Goddess...

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.199
[BELL] I want to...

00:21:24.299 --> 00:21:29.270
I... I want to... stay
with you... forever okay.

00:21:30.371 --> 00:21:33.508
[HESTIA] We'll always be
together, Bell... Promise.

00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:58.499
[HESTIA] Well then! Shall we?

00:21:58.599 --> 00:21:59.767
[BELL] Yeah!

00:21:59.867 --> 00:22:02.370
[CLOSING SONG,
"Sasayaka na Shukusai"]

00:22:03.271 --> 00:22:05.940
[HESTIA] This was
such a nice place...

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.975
I hope we can visit
again sometime.

00:22:08.075 --> 00:22:09.777
If you go,
I'll come with you.

00:22:09.877 --> 00:22:10.945
[BELL] Wha‐ Are you sure?

00:22:11.045 --> 00:22:12.947
(HESTIA anger)
Of course.

00:22:13.047 --> 00:22:14.615
What are the two of
you making plans for?!

00:22:14.715 --> 00:22:16.016
You have your own Familia!

00:22:16.117 --> 00:22:17.618
Go with them Wallen‐whatser
hoozit! (annoyed)

00:22:17.718 --> 00:22:20.188
Please, it's fine.
Calm down, Goddess.

00:22:20.288 --> 00:22:22.056
(pouting) Shut up! This
is between us women!

00:22:22.157 --> 00:22:23.124
(BELL defeated)

00:22:23.224 --> 00:22:24.525
[HESTIA] Are you even listening,

00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:25.826
Wallen‐always‐in‐the‐way.

00:22:25.926 --> 00:22:26.627
[BELL] Goddess...

00:22:26.727 --> 00:22:28.062
[HESTIA] Hello?

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:46.874
(confused gasp)

00:23:46.974 --> 00:23:50.311
[WIENE] What is... where, am I?
