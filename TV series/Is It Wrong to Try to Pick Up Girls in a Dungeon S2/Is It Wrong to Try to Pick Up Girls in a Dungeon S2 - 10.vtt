[ISHTAR] She wouldn't dare...!

Wouldn't you prefer
that I accompany
you... Lady Freya?

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.515
Please.. You need
not worry about me.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:53.086
[FREYA] Now, I expect you all
to carry out your duties.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.921
She and I are going
to have a talk...

You've done it this

What makes you think we

00:03:33.368 --> 00:03:37.439
We can still use her if we

Oh.. I know! I'll let you
have your way with me.

00:12:15.523 --> 00:12:18.025
Isn't a filthy night

[PHRYNE] You can do whatever you
want to me! Whatever you want!

Come on, all this
can be yours baby!

I can satisfy you even
more than a goddess!

You ugly wretch... That's
blasphemy against our goddess...

why are you all here?

00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:04.406
What gave you the impression
we would just abandon you two?

I admit, you did cause us some
worry when we found you though.
You were unresponsive.

00:13:08.743 --> 00:13:09.911
And Master Bell?

00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:11.979
We've been looking for
him this whole time,

but no luck.

00:13:12.914 --> 00:13:15.350
We have no idea where he is...

Oh!

What adorable children
you have, Ishtar.

00:15:12.033 --> 00:15:15.002
(taken aback) You‐you
charmed my own children?!

00:15:15.637 --> 00:15:16.704
[ISHTAR] Please wait.

00:15:16.804 --> 00:15:19.173
I never meant anything
by it, Freya.

00:15:19.274 --> 00:15:23.878
I had absolutely no idea the boy
meant that much to you! It was
an honest mistake. (frightened

00:15:23.978 --> 00:15:27.081
That's cute dear. It's been
fun watching your charade

I can no longer tolerate
it. It's over.

(ISHTAR speechless)
[FREYA] You see, I'm
going to make him mine.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.026
[FREYA] So any woman who lays
a hand on him must be punished.

00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:42.597
[FREYA] I'm going to..
destroy you.

[ISHTAR] (fear) Agh...

[HERMES] Oh, say it isn't so!

00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:49.337
[HERMES] It pains my heart...

00:15:49.437 --> 00:15:53.207
[HERMES] To think it was I
who spilled the beans about
Bell to Lady Ishtar!

00:15:53.308 --> 00:15:57.111
[HERMES] And now... it
has all come to this!

About how much of this
went according to your
plan, Master Hermes?

00:16:04.018 --> 00:16:07.522
Oh I merely lit the
fuse. That was all.

00:16:07.622 --> 00:16:11.259
To be perfectly honest, I never
thought it would get this bad.

00:16:11.359 --> 00:16:15.630
[HERMES] Ishtar's jealousy
runs much deeper than I
could've possibly imagined.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.668
[HERMES] Also, Lady Freya's
love for Bell far exceeded
my expectations.

00:16:20.768 --> 00:16:25.540
[HERMES] Perhaps most shocking
was Bell. He was the biggest
surprise.
