00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.545
(BELL focused)

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.683
(fighting)

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:18.719
(BELL concerned)

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.755
(focused)

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.225
Lady Mikoto, behind you!

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.700
Fire ..Bolt!

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.641
[WELF] I figured we'd run into
some trouble. Good thing we had
help.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.644
For sure. Thanks for the
backup, Miss Mikoto.

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:47.047
Anytime. I'm the one who asked
to tag along in the first place.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.448
The least I could
do was assist you.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.984
Seriously, You've been
such a huge help.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.787
Agreed. We're really
making some good time

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.222
cruising through with an
extra person on the team.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:59.993
[LILI] Right? When it was just
us three, I was worried that
we wouldn't make it.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.428
It's good to have you
around this time.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:03.797
I'm sorry, Bell.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.600
Our behavior forced you
into a dangerous situation

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.201
and I deeply regret it.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.904
Please don't even worry
about it, Miss Mikoto.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.506
It's water under
the bridge.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.274
[MIKOTO] I hope I can find a
way to make it up to your party.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.042
[WELF] Bah, you're fine.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.178
[BELL, internal] The
middle floors, huh?
[LILI] Just don't do it again.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.881
[BELL] This is no time
to let down our guard...
[MIKOTO] Oh no, I would never.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:25.986
[BELL, internal] but it seems
like we're starting to get the
hang of things.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.289
[BELL, internal] From here
on out, I'm going to keep
pushing forward.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.258
And then, I'll be
one step closer...

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.566
[BELL, internal] I'm going
to catch up to her...!

00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:50.675
[BELL, LILI, WELF] Cheers!

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:54.278
(refreshing gasp)

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:56.080
Congratulations on
your rank up, Welf!

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.416
Thanks, buddy.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:58.817
[LILI] Lvl. 2, huh?

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:00.084
Ya know, since you're one of

00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:02.320
the Hephaistos Familia's
best blacksmiths..

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:04.989
everything you make is
going to be worth a lot
more from now on.

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:08.126
Well... I'm just relieved this
means there's less of a chance

00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:10.862
I'll tarnish Hephaistos'
good name. Ya know?

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:12.096
But sadly..

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:13.398
This is probably
the end of

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:16.000
our charming little
party as we know it.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.903
The whole reason you
joined us on our journey
in the first place..

00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:22.507
was so you could rank up
and acquire some new
smithing abilities, right?

00:02:22.607 --> 00:02:25.243
I guess now that you've
done that this is it.

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:26.811
(WELF amused smirk)

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.414
[WELF] Quit looking at me with
those sad puppy dog eyes.

00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:33.217
Ha! You think I would just
ditch you guys because I
got what I wanted?

00:02:33.317 --> 00:02:34.419
(surprised)

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.588
Count on it, kid... (chomp)

00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:37.556
I'm stayin'!

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.357
(BELL &amp; LILI happy)

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:42.961
[WELF] Although it's too bad
Mikoto didn't come with us
tonight.

00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:45.063
[WELF] We're not exactly
strangers anymore.

00:02:45.163 --> 00:02:47.799
Well, she did mention
that she had a previous
engagement. (chomp)

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.001
Don't you think that's maybe
she's just being polite?

00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:52.404
Since she is from a different
familia, after all.

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:55.440
[WELF] But the three of
us are all from different
familias, too...

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.309
[BELL] (quick laugh) Now that
you mention it, I guess we are.

00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:03.848
Hey, Master Bell!
Have you gotten any
closer to ranking up yet?

00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:08.853
[BELL] (chewing) My ability
level rose quite a bit after we
got back from the 18th Floor.

00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:10.489
[WELF] Are you kidding me?

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.558
I finally caught up to
you, and you're already
almost a lvl. 3?

00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:14.926
That's just not fair!

00:03:15.026 --> 00:03:17.328
[LILI] Come on,
what'd you expect?

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:18.863
[WELF] Tch. You,
don't talk so much.

00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:21.199
[LUAN] What's all this
talk about a lvl. 3?

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.200
[WELF] Huh?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.468
I don't give a fat squat

00:03:23.568 --> 00:03:25.103
how fast you say you've
gotten that high.

00:03:25.203 --> 00:03:28.840
The fact of the matter
is, you're nothing but
a big damn liar.

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:31.376
[LUAN] You're a scared little
bunny boy,

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:34.913
running away from monsters and
using your friends to rank up!

00:03:35.013 --> 00:03:37.682
And now you've piggy‐backed
your way to almost level three?

00:03:37.782 --> 00:03:42.454
If I were that pathetic, I'd be
too embarrassed to show my face
in public! (taunting laugh)

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:43.788
[WELF] And here we go..

00:03:43.888 --> 00:03:46.791
Just ignore the little
twerp, Master Bell.

00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:48.326
[BELL] Uh.. (agreeing nod)

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:52.196
Oh, look! These must be his
absent‐minded, misfit buddies.

00:03:52.296 --> 00:03:54.132
[LUAN] A blacksmith who
can't sell his crap.

00:03:54.232 --> 00:03:56.134
[LUAN] and a pint‐sized
supporter brat.

00:03:56.234 --> 00:04:00.138
[LUAN] I guess they're a fitting
bunch for the "Phony Rookie"!
(laugh)

00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:01.906
(APOLLO FAM laughter)

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.308
Of course he would pal
around with the rejects.

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.212
I mean, what else would
you expect from a weakling
and a puny familia?

00:04:08.312 --> 00:04:09.681
What a sad freaking joke.

00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:11.516
[LUAN] They obviously have no
dignity...

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:13.317
Just look at their leader:

00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:17.255
a no‐name goddess who's only
redeeming quality is her giant
floppy boobs!

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:18.657
(BELL struggling to stay calm)

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:20.091
You take that back!

00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:22.494
[LUAN] Eek!
[LILI] Please calm down,
Master Bell...

00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:26.030
(nervous laugh) Oh whatever.
You're only mad because you
know it's true!

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.371
Come on, just admit it! It must
be humiliating having to serve
that bimbo runt of a goddess!

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.472
(BELL anger)

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:34.939
(gasp)

00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:38.410
[WELF] Oops, dropped my beer.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.578
(APOLLO FAM angry)

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:40.812
[APOLLO FAM] What are you doing?

00:04:40.912 --> 00:04:44.048
Jeez, typical bar‐dwelling
adventurers...

00:04:44.148 --> 00:04:46.217
(fighting)

00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.289
[WELF] Gimme somebody.

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:53.291
[WELF] Little punk!

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:57.295
[WELF] Anybody wants some more?!

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:58.763
[HYACINTH] I'll play along.

00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:00.098
(WELF surprised)

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:06.037
(WELF surprised)

00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:08.306
[BELL] You okay?

00:05:14.546 --> 00:05:15.914
Master Bell!

00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:19.117
Don't tell me that's all
you've got, Little Rookie.

00:05:19.217 --> 00:05:21.019
And I was just getting started.

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:24.556
[MAN A] Is he.. from the Apollo
Familia?

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:28.860
[MAN B] That would be
"Phoebus Apollo,"
he's known as Hyacinth?!

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.562
[MAN C] I've heard he's a level
3..

00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:33.765
[HYACINTH] The punishment for
hurting my friends is severe.

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:37.235
Accept the consequences of
your poorly chosen actions!

00:05:37.335 --> 00:05:38.470
(BELL can't breathe)

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.271
(HYACINTH enjoying this)

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:41.205
"Huh?"

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:46.244
[BETE] I didn't want to do
this... But you're ruining
my good mood.

00:05:46.344 --> 00:05:49.848
(CROWD tense)

00:05:49.948 --> 00:05:54.085
Now you can either shut up.
Or get the hell out.

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.688
(BELL impact) (pain)

00:05:56.788 --> 00:06:00.124
I'm afraid I've lost interest.
We're leaving.

00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:06.197
(BELL pain)

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.334
Yeah, you handled that
real well, Rookie.

00:06:10.435 --> 00:06:11.836
Tch, little dumbass...

00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:15.273
Master Bell! Please
tell me you're okay!

00:06:15.974 --> 00:06:17.542
[WELF] What was his problem?

00:06:17.642 --> 00:06:19.277
That was totally nuts.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.848
[HESTIA] You did an amazing
job, Bell! (happy)

00:06:23.948 --> 00:06:27.652
I kinda didn't expect you
to come back in such rough
shape though. (playful laugh)

00:06:27.752 --> 00:06:30.955
[HESTIA] What a naughty boy you
are. I'm not sure if I should be
proud or concerned...

00:06:31.055 --> 00:06:34.626
You hear that Master Bell?
You've been acting all
sorts of reckless lately!

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:36.895
And it's all Master
Welf's bad influence!

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:41.533
Hey, don't try to pin this on
me, Lil' Bit. And can you be a
little more gentle with me?

00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:42.567
[LILI] No, I cannot!

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:44.002
Regardless.

00:06:44.102 --> 00:06:46.137
You should be more careful about
the fights you pick.

00:06:46.237 --> 00:06:48.407
Just look at all these
bumps and bruises.

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:50.375
(BELL pain) (heavy exhale)

00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:54.779
Yes, but.. Those guys were
jerks. They said some awful
things about you, Goddess.

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.015
[BELL] When I heard them
disrespect you, I lost it.

00:06:57.115 --> 00:07:01.019
It actually makes me very happy
to know that you're ready to
jump to my defense.

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:06.858
But.. I don't like the idea
of you putting yourself in
danger.. So just be careful.

00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:08.593
But Goddess..

00:07:10.261 --> 00:07:13.064
Do your best to laugh it
off if it happens again.

00:07:13.164 --> 00:07:15.033
Just promise me, next time..

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:19.270
You'll think to yourself "My
goddess wouldn't give them a
second thought." Alright?

00:07:20.038 --> 00:07:21.806
(sigh) Okay..

00:07:21.906 --> 00:07:24.809
I'll do better if
it happens again.

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:26.445
[BELL] I'm sorry.. Goddess...

00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:30.214
Anyway.. I can't help but wonder
what was up with those guys?

00:07:30.314 --> 00:07:33.151
It makes me worry that
they might try to retaliate.

00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:35.887
Did you catch what
familia they were from?

00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:38.557
It was the Apollo Familia.

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:40.324
What did you say...?

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:45.464
[EINA] You got in a fight
with the Apollo Familia?

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.867
That's right... Goddess
Hestia was disappointed..

00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:50.769
(EINA sigh)

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:53.705
Then I suppose there's no need
for me to scold you any further.

00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:58.677
But I should remind you, that as
your advisor, this is not the
sort of thing I like to hear.

00:07:58.777 --> 00:08:00.445
I'm sorry, Miss Eina.

00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:03.382
(smile) Well, what's
done is in the past
for now.

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.684
Just be careful
from now on, okay?

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:08.152
We don't want to cause
tension between familias,

00:08:08.252 --> 00:08:10.254
or else the city could
turn into a battlefield.

00:08:10.354 --> 00:08:12.424
[BELL] Eh, yeah... You're right.

00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:15.059
So are you're heading
for the 13th Floor then?

00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:17.396
Yeah, I think we should be
able to handle it from here.

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:20.465
Very well. You do your
best out there, okay?

00:08:20.565 --> 00:08:22.333
[BELL] I will!

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:24.302
[DAPHNE] You're Bell
Cranel, correct?

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:25.537
(BELL curious)

00:08:25.637 --> 00:08:28.206
[BELL] Yes, that's me.

00:08:28.306 --> 00:08:31.275
[DAPHNE] Here. Pass this along
to your goddess then.

00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:34.278
(BELL surprised)

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.316
[DAPHNE] I'm Daphne.
And this is Cassandra.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:41.653
As you can probably assume,
we're from the Apollo Familia.

00:08:41.753 --> 00:08:46.691
And that.. is a formal
invitation from Master
Apollo himself.

00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:48.226
Not that...

00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:51.029
We actually care whether you
come to the banquet or not.

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:52.263
[DAPHNE] Shh.
[CASSANDRA] Ow.

00:08:52.363 --> 00:08:55.333
[DAPHNE] We've done
our job. Let's go.

00:08:58.803 --> 00:09:00.505
[DAPHNE] You have my sympathies.

00:09:00.605 --> 00:09:02.474
(BELL confused)

00:09:03.975 --> 00:09:05.410
[HESTIA] Hmm...

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.912
Well it isn't that just
a friggin' coincidence

00:09:08.012 --> 00:09:10.749
that they decided to invite
us now of all times...

00:09:10.849 --> 00:09:14.118
Man, I had a feeling they
weren't going to just let it
go...

00:09:14.218 --> 00:09:17.055
So, is this an invitation
to the banquet of the gods?

00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:19.624
Exactly. And it looks like
things are going to be

00:09:19.724 --> 00:09:22.494
a little more interesting
this time around...

00:09:22.594 --> 00:09:25.897
[HESTIA] Apollo and I didn't
exactly get along back in
Heaven, either...

00:09:25.997 --> 00:09:27.031
[HESTIA] Anyway!

00:09:27.131 --> 00:09:28.232
I've got a plan!

00:09:28.332 --> 00:09:30.034
We'll enlist Miach and Take.

00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:32.671
Then we can all go together!
How does that sound, Bell?

00:09:32.771 --> 00:09:34.906
[BELL] Huh? Go together...?

00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:36.575
(HESTIA devious giggle)

00:09:49.287 --> 00:09:51.390
(BELL sigh) (fidgeting)

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.158
[HESTIA] You look
so handsome, Bell!
[BELL] Huh?

00:09:54.258 --> 00:09:57.128
[HESTIA] There's no need to
be nervous. You'll be fine.

00:09:57.228 --> 00:09:59.363
[BELL] I hope so...

00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.566
Oh, Apollo.

00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:03.001
You're a real cunning devil,

00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:04.736
making us bring one of
our children along...

00:10:04.836 --> 00:10:07.839
[HESTIA] I guess even he
can have a good idea every
now and then!

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:10.442
[MIACH] You have my
gratitude, Hestia.
(HESTIA notice)

00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:14.312
Our clothing and our ride...
You really did take care
of everything for us.

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:17.215
Oh please... I'd do
anything for Naaza.

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:19.117
A girl should pamper
herself now and then.

00:10:19.217 --> 00:10:22.587
You have my deepest
gratitude, Lady Hestia.

00:10:22.687 --> 00:10:26.625
Well, I think Takemikazuchi
should be here any minute now.

00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:27.992
Shall we head inside?

00:10:28.092 --> 00:10:29.260
[BELL] Uh. S‐sure!

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.963
(fancy party chatter)

00:10:32.063 --> 00:10:37.235
Oh Hey! Hestia and Miach!
How wonderful, you brought
Bell and Naaza with you!

00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:40.071
I see that you're as obnoxious
and loud as ever, Hermes...

00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:42.073
Though I'm surprised to see
you and Take together.

00:10:42.173 --> 00:10:45.109
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] To be honest,
I'd rather be pretty much
anywhere else...

00:10:45.209 --> 00:10:46.344
(TAKEMIKAZUCHI grumble)

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:48.547
Now, that's not very
nice, Takemikazuchi!

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:51.182
We worked together during the
mission to rescue Bell and his
party.

00:10:51.282 --> 00:10:53.317
Come on, I thought we were
better friends than that!

00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:55.920
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
Get off me, Hermes.
[HERMES] Oh, my.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.191
Mikoto looks just lovely this
evening, and you two are
certainly dressed to impress...

00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:02.494
But may I advert your
eyes to this feast!

00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:05.163
[HERMES] My dear Asfi cleans
up nicely, doesn't she?

00:11:05.263 --> 00:11:10.502
Um, please don't try to
embarrass me, Master Hermes.
Or I might have to punch you.

00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:13.104
You're cute when you're
bashful, you know that?

00:11:13.204 --> 00:11:15.574
(ASFI flustered)

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:19.944
[APOLLO] Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining me today!

00:11:20.044 --> 00:11:22.514
Oh.. our host has made
his big entrance...

00:11:25.016 --> 00:11:28.319
So that guy is... Master Apollo?

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.822
That's right,
it would appear so.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:37.462
(BELL gasp) (concern)

00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:45.236
[APOLLO] I want to make this
event more interesting and shake
things up a little. I hope
everything is to your liking.

00:11:45.336 --> 00:11:47.271
[APOLLO] The act of dressing up
our precious children

00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:52.844
and showing them off at our
banquet is such an indulgent
treat, is it not?

00:11:52.944 --> 00:11:54.145
[GOD A] Well said, Apollo!

00:11:54.245 --> 00:11:55.947
[GOD B] Hear, hear!

00:11:56.047 --> 00:12:00.251
It fills me with great joy,
to see my brethren and their
children.

00:12:00.351 --> 00:12:02.654
Quite a splendid night, indeed.

00:12:02.754 --> 00:12:07.025
You know, I feel I will make
many new friends this evening.

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.861
I consider myself
truly blessed...

00:12:09.961 --> 00:12:11.663
(BELL gasp)

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:13.698
[APOLLO] Come now,
the night is young!

00:12:13.798 --> 00:12:16.468
Please enjoy yourselves
to your hearts' content!

00:12:16.568 --> 00:12:19.638
(CROWD cheer)
(dies down to party chatter)

00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:26.210
(HESTIA aggressively eating)

00:12:28.146 --> 00:12:30.081
[HERMES] Looking to
chat with Apollo?

00:12:30.181 --> 00:12:31.115
(BELL surprised)

00:12:31.215 --> 00:12:32.350
Not quite..

00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:34.118
I was just thinking
Goddess Hestia and I

00:12:34.218 --> 00:12:35.720
ought to at least
say hello though...

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.589
Apollo and I go way back to when
all of us gods

00:12:37.689 --> 00:12:40.358
used to live in Heaven.
He's a real firecracker.

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:44.295
Plus he never seems to
run out of stories about
his love life...

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:45.764
Isn't that right, Hestia?

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:48.032
(angry munching)
Yeah, well that'd I know!?

00:12:48.132 --> 00:12:49.300
(HERMES soft chuckle)

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:52.170
He's also known
for being..

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.337
[HERMES] Quite ruthless..

00:12:53.438 --> 00:12:56.140
Huh? Wait, can you
elaborate on that?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.809
(CROWD in awe)
(BELL notice)

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:01.312
[HERMES] Oh, it appears another
celebrity has arrived.

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:03.014
[BELL] Wait, who is that...?

00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:04.649
Surely you must
have heard of her.

00:13:04.749 --> 00:13:06.885
Patron goddess, of Freya
Familia...

00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:08.987
That my friend, is Lady Freya.

00:13:09.087 --> 00:13:10.522
[BELL] Lady Freya...

00:13:10.622 --> 00:13:13.191
[HESTIA] Don't you dare
look at her, Bell!

00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:17.261
[BELL] G‐G‐Goddess...! What
the...?! (struggling)
[HESTIA] If you stare at a
goddess of beauty for too

00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:20.298
(struggling noises)

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.700
(HESTIA &amp; BELL notice)

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.640
[FREYA] Well if it isn't
Hestia. It's been a while.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.510
Miach, Takemikazuchi.
I hope you've all been well.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.945
Hmph, we're great!
Now you can move along.

00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:35.313
H‐hello...

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:38.049
You look as divine as
always, Lady Freya.

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:39.217
(MIKOTO &amp; NAAZA anger)

00:13:39.317 --> 00:13:40.719
(TAKEMIKAZUCHI &amp; MIACH pain)

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:42.387
(FREYA smug)

00:13:43.287 --> 00:13:44.989
(BELL nervous)

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:48.460
I wonder if I'll get to
see something spectacular
this evening...

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.961
[HESTIA] Hey! I don't think so!

00:13:50.061 --> 00:13:52.130
And what the hell are you
getting all flustered for?!

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.034
A goddess like her won't
hesitate to gobble up any man
she can get her hands on!

00:13:56.134 --> 00:13:59.571
Don't you realize, she'd
chew you up and spit you
out in an instant, Bell?!

00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:01.205
[BELL] I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:14:01.305 --> 00:14:03.508
I apologize for any
unintentional offense

00:14:03.608 --> 00:14:08.046
I may have caused you darling,
Hestia. Please excuse me.

00:14:08.146 --> 00:14:09.681
[LOKI] There you are,
little imp!

00:14:09.781 --> 00:14:11.015
(HESTIA annoyed)

00:14:11.115 --> 00:14:13.184
[BELL] Miss Ais...

00:14:13.284 --> 00:14:15.019
And when exactly did
you show up, huh?!

00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:17.556
I guess you're just too
boring for anyone to notice
your presence!

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:21.493
Oh, shut yer trap! If you
wanna complain to someone, do it
to that little hussy, Freya!

00:14:21.593 --> 00:14:25.296
She's the diva who stole
the spotlight from me and
my sweet little Aisypoo!

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:27.499
[HESTIA] Oh sure, blame all
your short comings on her!

00:14:27.599 --> 00:14:30.835
[HESTIA] Are you dressed like a
man to avoid the embarrassment
of your nonexistent boobs?!

00:14:30.935 --> 00:14:34.906
[LOKI] You wish! I dressed like
this tonight 'cause it's about
my darling Ais!

00:14:35.006 --> 00:14:37.308
[LOKI] A mouthy twerp like
you would never understand!

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:38.877
(AIS uneasy)
(LOKI notice)

00:14:38.977 --> 00:14:42.180
Huh? So I see you brought
your little puppy along.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.452
You know... Honestly, he
isn't much to look at. Not
like my gorgeous Aisypoo! ?

00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:49.120
(BELL eek!) (comedic faint)

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.189
(HESTIA nervous)(offended)

00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:54.826
My Bell is way more
adorable that your dumb
Wallen‐whaters‐whatever!

00:14:54.926 --> 00:14:56.595
He's like a cute and
cuddly little bunny!

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.530
[LOKI] Cuddly? Please.
Don't make me laugh!

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.232
[LOKI] My Ais is a million
times cuter and cooler

00:15:01.332 --> 00:15:03.435
and more capable! She's on
a whole 'nother level!

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:05.136
[HESTIA] I don't think so!
(LOKI frustrated grunt)

00:15:05.236 --> 00:15:06.571
I swear, just about
the only thing

00:15:06.671 --> 00:15:08.873
she's ever been good for
is killin' the damn mood!

00:15:08.973 --> 00:15:10.308
[LOKI] Let's go, Ais!

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:13.244
Took the words right outta' my
mouth! Let's go, Bell.

00:15:13.344 --> 00:15:14.879
(HESTIA &amp; LOKI hmph!)

00:15:18.182 --> 00:15:23.955
[BELL, internal] I see it now...
The rift between familias...

00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:27.726
[BELL, internal] I guess
this is just the way things
normally are...

00:15:31.329 --> 00:15:33.031
Hmm...

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.941
I don't think I really fit
in here... I feel so out of
my element.

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:44.509
(BELL notice)

00:15:47.178 --> 00:15:48.547
That looks like..

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:51.683
[BELL] Huh?

00:15:53.051 --> 00:15:54.619
(tense)

00:16:03.628 --> 00:16:05.397
Oh, there you are, Bell.

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:06.665
[BELL] Master Hermes...

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.266
What are you
doing out here?

00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:10.969
Don't tell me a spicy
cutie caught your eye?

00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:13.738
Uh, no.. That's not why.

00:16:15.306 --> 00:16:16.875
(BELL curious)

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:20.745
Well, since we're both here...
Mind if we have a quick
lil' chat?

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.417
So tell me Bell, just why did
you become an adventurer?

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:29.821
Oh, um. Because my
grandfather told me as a kid,

00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:35.594
[BELL] that "Orario is filled to
the brim with women and riches,
beyond our wildest dreams."

00:16:37.028 --> 00:16:39.197
He also told me to "find
a beautiful goddess,

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:42.934
and join her familia" and
then to "pledge my life
to her." That's about it.

00:16:43.034 --> 00:16:46.771
[HERMES] (laughs) Oh my
gods, you mean, he told
you that as a child?

00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:47.872
(BELL laugh)

00:16:47.972 --> 00:16:50.274
He also told me, when
the time comes...

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.377
"to go out there and be a hero."

00:16:52.477 --> 00:16:57.449
[HERMES] (quick laugh) Well...
Your grandfather sounds like a
real hoot if you ask me.

00:17:03.087 --> 00:17:05.490
So anyway, are you going
to ask anyone to dance?

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:11.830
Huh? No! Absolutely not!
Besides, I don't even know the
first thing about dancing.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.265
Come on, you don't want to
disappoint your grandfather.

00:17:14.365 --> 00:17:18.236
Some of the world's most
beautiful women are here,
not everyone is this fortunate.

00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:21.172
Now's your perfect chance
to make a move, kid.

00:17:21.272 --> 00:17:22.707
Um... Yeah, but...

00:17:22.807 --> 00:17:24.676
Well, if you won't
do it yourself,

00:17:24.776 --> 00:17:27.245
then I suppose I'll have
to give you a little push.

00:17:27.345 --> 00:17:30.582
Huh? (panic)

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.951
[HERMES] If it isn't the
lovely Sword Princess!

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:37.221
May I, the humble and unassuming
god, Hermes, please have the
honor of this dance?

00:17:37.321 --> 00:17:38.790
Huh?

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:40.425
(AIS glance)

00:17:40.525 --> 00:17:42.561
Shut your face! Quiet!

00:17:44.028 --> 00:17:46.197
[HERMES] Oh no, how terrible!
(AIS surprised)

00:17:46.297 --> 00:17:49.167
I've suddenly remembered
a matter I must attend to!

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:53.972
What a wretched man I am,
abandoning a lady after
inviting her to dance...

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:56.274
May I request your
cooperation Bell?!

00:17:56.375 --> 00:18:00.144
Please kindly come and
dance with the Sword
Princess in my stead!

00:18:00.912 --> 00:18:02.280
Huh?

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.048
[BELL] Huh?!

00:18:04.148 --> 00:18:08.553
I'll leave you to it.
Don't do anything I wouldn't
do, Rookie. M'kay...

00:18:08.653 --> 00:18:10.389
(nervous)
[BELL] Wait? Wha?

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:11.556
Master Hermes?!

00:18:11.656 --> 00:18:13.892
(HERMES smirk)
(BELL stunned)

00:18:20.264 --> 00:18:22.567
(BELL stammering)

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:25.169
(clears throat)

00:18:25.269 --> 00:18:29.207
May I please have the pleasure
of this next dance, m'lady?

00:18:30.475 --> 00:18:32.010
[NAAZA] Why, of course.

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.147
(MIACH &amp; NAAZA smirk)

00:18:36.247 --> 00:18:38.016
[BELL] It's Master Miach...

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.788
Uh.. Do you...

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.895
May I please, have this
dance with you? Please?

00:18:52.296 --> 00:18:53.732
I'd love to.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:02.240
(BELL nervous)

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:03.975
(AIS notice)

00:19:04.075 --> 00:19:05.877
(even more nervous)

00:19:06.277 --> 00:19:07.779
Um...!

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:10.281
(BELL clumsy)

00:19:17.188 --> 00:19:18.322
(BELL nervous)

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:21.726
Just calm down.
Don't stare at the floor.

00:19:21.826 --> 00:19:24.328
And lift your head up.

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:25.964
Master Bell. Don't worry.

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:29.668
Everything will be fine...
just avoid stepping on her feet.

00:19:31.302 --> 00:19:34.105
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] You're an
adventurer, aren't you?
Look her in the eye.

00:19:34.205 --> 00:19:38.042
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] You don't
have to be an expert. It's
all about "give and take."

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.788
[LOKI] (angry scream!) You're
killin' me, Ais! Whaddya think
you're doin', dancin' with that
little freak?!

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:53.858
Bell! Get away from that
damn Wallen‐whaters‐whatser
floozy right this instant!

00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:58.630
(HESTIA &amp; LOKI angry)
[ASFI] Oh, Master Hermes. I
have a feeling you're going
to regret this later...

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.433
Heh.. I've already
accepted my fate...

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:06.471
Say, Ottarl.. Do you think it
might be possible to lead a herd
of minotaurs in here?

00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:09.307
I don't think so,
Lady Freya.

00:20:12.076 --> 00:20:15.213
I've never danced with
anyone... before...

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.683
Is that the truth...?

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:20.919
[AIS] Mmhmm.

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:24.022
[AIS] I think I like
it. Thank you.

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.896
[APOLLO] Esteemed guests!

00:20:31.996 --> 00:20:33.798
How are we all enjoying
the banquet?

00:20:33.898 --> 00:20:37.201
(CROWD soft murmur)

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:47.111
(APOLLO creepy laugh)

00:20:47.211 --> 00:20:48.480
(BELL nervous!)

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.481
[HESTIA] Bell!

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:51.115
Salutations, Hestia.

00:20:51.215 --> 00:20:55.620
I heard a rather nasty rumor our
children had a bit of a run‐in.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.189
Uh.. Y‐yeah..
I suppose they did.

00:20:58.289 --> 00:21:02.026
One of mine suffered
serious injuries at the
hands of your child.

00:21:02.126 --> 00:21:04.362
And I'd like to request
some compensation.

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:09.167
Wha?! What are you talking
about?! I'll have you know, Bell
was in pretty bad shape as well!

00:21:09.267 --> 00:21:11.069
He's not the only
party responsible.

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:14.773
Can you still make such a
claim, when you see this?!

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:18.042
It hurts! Ow, ow! The pain!

00:21:18.142 --> 00:21:19.478
(CROWD shocked murmur)
(BELL gasp)

00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:21.713
Jeez, Bell.. did you
really do that...?

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:23.448
[BELL] No! I didn't!
I swear, Goddess!

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:26.851
As I'm told your child was the
one who started the altercation.

00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:30.288
There were witnesses. You can't
talk your way out of this.

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:31.456
(cocky smirk)

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.924
He's backed her
into a corner...

00:21:33.024 --> 00:21:34.258
(MIACH quiet agreement)

00:21:34.358 --> 00:21:35.527
(HESTIA annoyed)

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:36.961
Bah, what a joke!

00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:38.663
I won't just stand here
and be insulted!

00:21:38.763 --> 00:21:39.898
We're leaving, Bell!

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:41.099
Oh?

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.635
You intend to ignore your
child's wrongdoings...

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:44.803
dear Hestia?

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:46.370
(HESTIA annoyed)

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:47.639
(creepy smirk)

00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:49.340
You've left me no choice!

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:53.945
As head of the Apollo Familia,
I challenge you to a War Game!

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.048
(CROWD cheering)

00:21:57.148 --> 00:21:58.917
[MAN A] Finally! A War Game!

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:01.019
[MAN B] Apollo doesn't
mess around, does he?!

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:02.721
[WOMAN A] I can't
wait to see who wins!

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:05.123
And if we win this clash..

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:08.292
[APOLLO] Then Bell Cranel
will belong to us!

00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:09.628
Huh!?

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:12.464
(pleasurable slurp)

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:14.799
(gasp)

00:22:14.899 --> 00:22:20.472
[CLOSING SONG, "HELLO to DREAM"]

00:23:46.157 --> 00:23:48.226
[HESTIA] Next time: "Apollo."
