If they find out that you
helped me escape won't they‐

Stone ritual"...?

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:48.288

It's fine, please
don't be concerned.

Miss Mikoto and I have a plan!

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:21.154
And our entire Familia's
on board too!

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:24.924
[BELL] It might take us just a
little bit longer to earn enough
money though...

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:30.563
[BELL] Miss Mikoto and I..
really want to help you!

[BELL] Miss Haruhime...?

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:40.673
I'm sorry.. I just feel
so incredibly lucky.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.277
To think that you and Mikoto

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:47.547
would go through such
trouble for me...

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:52.718
By just hearing your
kind words.. I no longer
have any regrets.

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:53.953
Huh?

00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:57.490
[HARUHIME] Let's go..
Master Cranel.

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:17.777
[ALLEN] What a complete
waste of my time..

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:20.513
Damn that rabbit...

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:34.360
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] I see...

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.563
So you're going up against
the Ishtar Familia?

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:39.064
[LILI] We think so.

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:41.701
The last place we saw
Lady Mikoto and Master Bell..

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:44.970
we spotted several Amazons
fleeing from the area..

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.308
[LILI] We even recognized a few
from the red‐light district.

00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:53.513
Yeah but.. what would be their
motive..? And why would they
kidnap those two...?

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:55.215
(TAKEMIKAZUCHI ponder)

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:56.482
[CHIGUSA] Um. It may..

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:58.884
...have to do
with Haruhime.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:01.221
Perhaps they caught word of
their plan to free her...

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:03.356
maybe they're trying
to stop them?

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:04.824
[LILI] I dunno...

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:07.727
I can't imagine a Familia of
their size would go so far

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:10.496
to protect a low‐ranking
member like Haruhime.

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:16.302
Agreed... Renards may be a
rare breed, but I doubt
they care much about her.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.105
[OUKA] Assuming it has
nothing to do with Haruhime,

00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:21.474
why would the Ishtar
Familia do this?

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:26.279
That reminds me... Bell
did say something about
Ishtar recently...

00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:27.780
[CHIGUSA] Huh?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.482
[HESTIA] Yeah. I think he
mentioned something about

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:32.418
Hermes delivering a
special item to Ishtar...?

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.720
[LILI] Yeah. That's
right, he did.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.556
What'd he call
it again?

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:38.090
[HESTIA] A "something"
stone, or whatever?

00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:41.227
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] (shock)
Was it... a "Killing Stone"?

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:43.263
[HESTIA] Oh yeah! That's
the one! (startled)

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:47.833
Are you sure?! Are you positive
he called it a "Killing Stone"?!

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.535
[HESTIA] Yeah... I am.

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:52.538
(TAKEMIKAZUCHI disturbed gasp)

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:58.844
[CHIGUSA] So um.. what's
a "Killing Stone"?

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.681
(TAKEMIKAZUCHI conflicted)

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:10.022
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] Okay
listen. A Killing Stone
is an illegal magic item.
It takes a Renard's soul.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:14.360
Their soul...?
For what purpose?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.528
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
To put it simply..

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.263
By possessing the stone..

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:21.667
the user can wield "Sorcery"..
a powerful type of Renard magic.

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:26.572
It lets anyone control magic?
So, it's basically a tool?

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:28.007
(TAKEMIKAZUCHI affirmation)

00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:29.909
Similar to magic swords.

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:33.946
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] Not quite.
You might say it's even worse.

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:35.781
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] Only a fragment
of a Killing Stone

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.417
is needed to utilize
its full effect.

00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:38.751
Just a piece of it?

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:41.754
Yes. Even if it were
shattered to pieces..

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:45.425
just one sliver.. would be
enough to wield Sorcery.

00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:46.492
(gasp)

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:47.760
(OUKA &amp; CHIGUSA gasp)

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.195
(HESTIA gasp)

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.598
Which is why.. the stone
is smashed to pieces

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:54.767
as soon as a soul...
is sealed within.

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:58.104
Wait hold on a minute!
D'you say "Smashed"?

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:01.040
[CHIGUSA] Then what happens
to the soul that's trapped
inside of it?!

00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:02.342
(OUKA gasp)

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:04.877
[CHIGUSA] What happens
to the Renard's soul?!

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.012
Hm...

00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:08.581
Once the stone is broken..

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:11.484
it cannot go back together.

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:20.360
"The soul also shares.. the very
same fate. Once split.. it can
never be..." (gasp)

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.196
(MIKOTO angrily upset)

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:25.465
[MIKOTO] No...

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.170
[CHIGUSA] Haruhime...

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.004
(OUKA anger)

00:14:32.105 --> 00:14:33.273
I see now..

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:36.576
And because Bell and Mikoto
got themselves involved...

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:38.878
Take?

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:40.646
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] A ritual
must be performed in order

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:45.118
to transfer a Renard's soul
into a Killing Stone.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.820
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] It can
only be held on the
night of a full moon.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.022
[OUKA] (gasp) Wait that means..

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:52.825
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] That's right...

00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:55.861
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] It's tonight.

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:07.640
[BELL] So this is where it
leads.

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:12.578
[HARUHIME] Master Cranel...

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:13.946
[BELL] Huh?

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:20.720
(BELL anticipation)

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.923
[HARUHIME] Hurry. Now, run far
away.

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:27.092
[HARUHIME] Go.. Master Cranel.

00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:30.830
Miss Haruhime... I think
you should come with me...!

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:38.804
I would but... This choker is
a magic item that keeps track
of my whereabouts.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.544
My location.. is
known to Lady Ishtar
at all times.

00:15:44.644 --> 00:15:49.182
Therefore.. I cannot
venture any farther.

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.783
[BELL] Why.. does she..?

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.084
[MIKOTO] Lady Haruhime!

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:52.718
[BELL] Huh?

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.220
(catching breath)

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.256
[BELL] Miss Mikoto!

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:58.023
[BELL] I'm glad you're.. huh?

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:02.728
[MIKOTO] I have just one thing
to ask you, Lady Haruhime!

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:05.097
[HARUHIME] What is it?

00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:08.168
Do you know anything about..
the Killing Stone?

00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:11.171
(HARUHIME gasp) (shame settle)

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:15.908
[MIKOTO] This is crazy.

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:18.411
[MIKOTO] You cannot be serious!
(HARUHIME surprised)

00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:20.413
[MIKOTO] Tell me you're
not a sacrifice!

00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:22.215
[BELL] You're a what..?

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.852
[AISHA] I had a feeling
this would happen.

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:28.221
(ALL gasp)

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.355
[HARUHIME] Haa!

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.426
Miss Aisha!

00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:34.727
Consider yourself lucky

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.095
you weren't devoured by Phryne,

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:37.497
but you shouldn't
have stuck your nose

00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:38.631
where it doesn't belong.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:39.899
What exactly is it

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.901
you're trying to
accomplish here?!

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.808
[AISHA] We want war.

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:50.243
(BELL &amp; MIKOTO gasp)

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:55.681
[AISHA] We're going to
crush the Freya Familia.

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:58.784
It is the divine will
of our almighty goddess.

00:16:58.884 --> 00:17:00.820
But, that's crazy!

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.988
[AISHA] You think
it's impossible?

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:06.992
[AISHA] It's true, our enemy is
the strongest Familia in Orario.

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:09.929
However.. that's why
we have this Renard.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.632
What does Miss Haruhime
have to do with it?

00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:13.966
[AISHA] You fool..

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:16.302
[AISHA] She's powerful,
you know.

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:19.172
[AISHA] Don't you remember
our scuffle in the dungeon?

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:20.473
(BELL gasp)

00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:22.842
[BELL] No way...
So that was...?!

00:17:22.942 --> 00:17:25.911
[AISHA] That's right.
I had a Level Boost.

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:29.782
That's the sort of
Sorcery she possesses.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.285
[AISHA] Tonight, Haruhime
will be our offering.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.355
And in doing so, she will
become our strength.

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:37.290
(BELL shocked)

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.092
It makes no sense...
Now wait just a minute!

00:17:40.193 --> 00:17:42.828
[BELL] I don't
understand any of this!

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:45.064
[BELL] Sacrifices, offerings...

00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:48.301
[BELL] You keep talking like
Miss Haruhime is going to die!

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:50.870
[AISHA] Because she is.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.739
She's sacrificing
her life tonight.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.876
This plan has been set
in stone for a long time.

00:17:56.976 --> 00:18:02.682
[BELL] How.. could you..
do that...? (confused/shocked)

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:04.317
[BELL] She's a part
of your Familia...

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:05.818
She's your family...!

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.820
How are you okay
with that!?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.757
How can you treat her like
a disposable weapon!?

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:14.927
This is wrong... and I
will not stand for it!

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:17.830
Such a passionate speech.

00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:21.801
[AISHA] Are you going
to take her from me?

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.505
[AISHA] I suppose
it's war, then.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.640
We'll take out your
Familia, too!

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.275
(BELL &amp; MIKOTO gasp)

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.350
[AISHA] Let me tell you the
story of a lowly prostitute.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.051
(BELL confused)

00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:41.521
[AISHA] There was a certain
person the prostitute hated

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.089
with every fiber of her being.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.093
She was a little Renard brat
who came from the Far East.

00:18:48.194 --> 00:18:49.295
(HARUHIME react)

00:18:52.365 --> 00:19:00.005
[AISHA] This impudent child had
gotten herself tricked and sold
off by some low‐life before
finally drifting into town.

00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:07.413
[AISHA] The prostitute took care
of her, but the Renard scamp had
this dumb, empty smile like she
had given up hope.

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:11.717
[AISHA] She never
opened up to anyone.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:14.120
[AISHA] She knew
nothing of the world.

00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:18.891
[AISHA] She didn't even cry.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:32.905
[AISHA] The prostitute loathed
the brat, despised her even...

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.244
[AISHA] Until one day.. she took
out her anger in a foolish way.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:44.417
[AISHA] She destroyed a very
important stone that had been
brought to her home.

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:46.819
(glass shattering)

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:50.790
[AISHA] Naturally, everyone
found out what the prostitute
had done.

00:19:54.994 --> 00:20:00.099
[AISHA] She was beaten within
an inch of her life by a
hideous toad of a woman...

00:20:01.734 --> 00:20:05.371
[AISHA] And then...
...and then...

00:20:07.407 --> 00:20:14.214
[AISHA] She was charmed and
abused to the point of
insanity at the hands
of her very own goddess.

00:20:18.518 --> 00:20:24.124
And so now.. that stupid
prostitute can't bring
herself to defy her goddess.

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.626
Now do you understand
our Familia?

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.361

[AISHA] What are

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:37.737
[AISHA] Are you going to

00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:41.006

What's there to think about?

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.610
[BELL] I just...

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.414
[AISHA] Is she really worth
nothing more than your pity?

00:20:48.514 --> 00:20:50.883
[BELL] Wait, I..!
[AISHA] Why the hesitation then?

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:51.851

00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:57.990
[AISHA] Are you afraid of going
to war?

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.959
[AISHA] Is that why
you refuse to act?!

00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:01.894

[AISHA] I cannot

[AISHA] That's not
the face of a man.

00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:15.975
It's one of a spineless coward.

00:21:16.075 --> 00:21:19.479
A boy who can't make
up his own mind.

00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:23.416
