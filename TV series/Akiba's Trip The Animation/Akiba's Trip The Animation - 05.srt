00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,958
Just means I have to train hard!

159
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,083
Bring on the friction
I'm ready to sparkle!

160
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,708
[PROFESSOR]
I was hoping you'd say that.

161
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,041
[ALL]
Huh?

162
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:25,875
[ARISA]
Professor!

163
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,291
[MATOME]
What's up?

164
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,916
After all we've seen,
I figured something like this

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,833
might happen, so I've
developed a fighting game

166
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,625
training program just in case.

167
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,500
You do want to be
the greatest, don't you?

168
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,208
[MATOME, ARISA]
Uh...

169
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,500
[TAMOTSU grunts]

170
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,250
[TAMOTSU pants]

171
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,083
[TAMOTSU] What am I,
a freaking hamster?

172
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,083
That is my training machine
number one, isn't it nifty?

173
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,208
And how will this make him
better at fighting games?

174
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,291
According to
my theories, immensely!

175
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,208
Slow it down, I can't keep up!

176
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,666
[gasps]

177
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,458
[MATOME gasps, screams]

178
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,291
Good. That should help.

179
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,125
[PROFESSOR]
Now hone your reflexes

180
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,833
with training machine two!

181
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,208
[TAMOTSU groans]

182
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,083
[MATOME]
Strike!

183
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,291
This doesn't make sense!

184
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,875
Shouldn't I be the
one with the bat?

185
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,500
[grunts]

186
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,333
Sorry, I swear I'll
get the next one!

187
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,125
[shouts]

188
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,625
--[TAMOTSU groans] My face!
--[MATOME] Stee-rike!

189
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,916
Great work, Tamotsu!

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,666
Next phase:
Building mental toughness!

191
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,541
[TAMOTSU]
Sharks?! Are you kidding?

192
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,875
[TAMOTSU yelps]

193
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,333
--[ARISA, MATOME gasp]
--[TAMOTSU] Help!

194
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,416
Once you're all done in there,

195
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,375
we'll move on to
quick button pressing!

196
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,625
[PROFESSOR] Yes, Tamotsu!
Tell us the answer! Fast!

197
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,833
Who is Shiki Masaoka?

198
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,833
[buzzer blares]

199
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,541
[TAMOTSU grunts]

200
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:45,375
[PROFESSOR] Next! Training to
withstand pressure!

201
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,375
Next! Training limbs
to withstand long

202
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,375
hours of fighting gameplay!

203
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,958
Next! Burning at the stake!

204
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,458
I don't remember how
this helps, but, yeah!

205
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,458
[grunts] I'm dying.
And I smell like chicken.

206
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,291
No I refuse to die! I have
to kick Matsuko's keister

207
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,291
and save my sister
in that order!

208
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,916
[yells]

209
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,583
[ARISA, MATOME snoring]

210
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:17,125
[shouts]

211
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,541
You've done it!

212
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:25,708
You've mastered the legendary
16 hits-per-second!

213
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,958
The answer lies in
the heart of battle.

214
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,541
I'm coming for you, Matsuko!

215
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,666
Okay! Welcome to the
first Akiba Way-Way Cup:

216
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,708
The Evolution Fight! So are you
people way-way excited, or what?

217
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,458
[AUDIENCE cheers]

218
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,750
I'm your host. Mashiro Kuga!

219
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,208
And I don't need to introduce
this web celebrity!

220
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,500
Hey, guys. Yes, it's true,
my game review channel

221
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,125
does have over one
hundred followers.

222
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,750
You know, a wise Sugoroku
master once said...

223
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,500
[TAMOTSU] Ha. I can't
believe how relaxed

224
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm feeling right now.

225
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,291
I guess burning at the stake
gives you some perspective.

226
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:09,125
Yeah, but. Check them out.
They look like serious pros!

227
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,875
Relax, Arisa, after the
training we put him through,

228
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,875
I'm sure there's no human gamer
on Earth who could beat Tamotsu.

229
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,000
That's right... I won't
let any of these jokers

230
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,916
keep me from a
final match with her!

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,625
[MASHIRO] Now let's
meet our first fighters.

232
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,875
From the United States
it's Frog oZma!

233
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,416
Facing the new blood from
right here in Akiba, Tamo-Two!

234
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,458
[MATOME, ARISA gasp]

235
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,416
Good luck, Tamotsu,
you can do it!

236
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,333
You stay sharp, and don't
let your guard down, okay?

237
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,333
[AUDIENCE cheers]

238
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,000
[MATOME, ARISA gasp, giggle]

239
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,708
Let's hear it as our tournament
gets officially underway!

240
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,666
Ready... go!

241
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,416
[MASHIRO]
Round one... Fight!

242
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,291
I don't have time to
waste on this loser!

243
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,791
You're just a speed-bump
on the way to Matsuko!

244
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,583
[MASHIRO]
A perfect K.O!

245
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:09,000
Frog oZma advances, setting the
tone with a dominant win!

246
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,375
What the--?

247
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,166
[MASHIRO] Losing your first
fight without managing a

248
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,708
single hit! Now that
has got to hurt!

249
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,583
Great job, Frog oZma,
I'm sure your mother is proud!

250
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,166
[NARRATOR] Previously,
in the scenes you just saw,

251
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,625
to save his kidnapped sister,
Tamotsu trained all night

252
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,166
for a Street Fighter
V Tournament,

253
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,416
only to be thrashed like
a little weakling baby

254
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,750
in the very first round.
But in an unbelievable comeback,

255
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,125
we didn't have time to animate,

256
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,791
Tamotsu has gone undefeated
in the losers' bracket

257
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,041
and clawed his way
to the final round!

258
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,875
Boy, we wish you
could have seen that!

259
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,458
[MASHIRO]
Boy, I'm glad I saw that!

260
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,083
Tamo-Two has crushed Inferno,

261
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,958
the tournament favorite, and is
the last contestant standing!

262
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,291
[AUDIENCE cheers]

263
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,583
[MASHIRO] That means
he's earned the right

264
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,250
to challenge the gaming
super-genius, Matsuko!

265
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,791
I can't wait!

266
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,916
How will this fight between
button-mashing titans play out?

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,458
I will defeat you.
I'm getting my sister back.

268
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,791
Sister-what now?

269
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,291
I have no clue what you're
talking about, player.

270
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,333
But I've been waiting
for this fight.

271
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:11,083
I knew the moment we met, there
was something special about you.

272
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,125
Something that would
finally let me compete

273
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,666
without holding anything back!

274
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,958
[gasps]

275
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,791
[MASHIRO]
Are you ready for this showdown?

276
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,833
[AUDIENCE cheers]

277
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,791
[MASHIRO] Let's go!

278
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,875
Round One... Fight!

279
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,000
Onward to glory!

280
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,791
[TAMOTSU shouts]

281
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,916
[MASHIRO]
Tamo-Two starts strong!

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,500
He attacks right
out of the gate!

283
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,625
[AYANOKOJI] The best
defense is a good offense...

284
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,708
[TAMOTSU] Wow, this is going
better than I thought.

285
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,000
I've got the advantage,
I can't let up!

286
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,750
[MASHIRO] Great work
with that air combo!

287
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,666
he's really keeping
up the pressure!

288
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,083
Now he lands his Critical Art!
And he's done it!

289
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:49,750
[AUDIENCE cheers]

290
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh yeah!

291
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,583
[MASHIRO]
Tamo-Two draws first blood,

292
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,166
winning the opening round!

293
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,250
[AYANOKOJI] Like the brilliant
saying I came up with myself,

294
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,333
"the early bird gets the worm."

295
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,500
--[MATOME cheers]
--[ARISA] Yeah!

296
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,333
Say moi moi, Matsuko,
you're going down!

297
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,708
Woo-hoo!

298
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,125
[FAT MAN] Don't start
feeling confident yet,

299
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,916
that's just how
Matsuko operates!

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,166
And who are you?

301
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,958
He's right. She always
spends the first round

302
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,583
studying her opponent,
it's her thing.

303
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,333
For real, who are you guys?!

304
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,833
[FAT MAN] If you study Matsuko's
fights, you'll see she's lost a

305
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,208
ton of first rounds in
best-of-three matches.

306
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,416
She starts by letting her
foes do as they like,

307
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,166
to observe their
fighting styles.

308
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,375
[TAMURO] Then she inputs the
enemy's performance data into

309
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,541
her head, and churns out the
perfect formula for victory.

310
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,666
Her mind has evolved into the
ultimate case of Game Brain!

311
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,083
[TAMOTSU gasps]
No way!

312
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,583
You're telling me she actually
threw the first round?

313
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,333
I'm a professional gamer.

314
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,458
My every move is a
step toward victory.

315
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,250
I never "throw" anything.

316
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,583
Strong words from our
unflappable champion!

317
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,250
She's as inspiring as ever!

318
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,041
Yeah, that's what
people say about me,

319
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,583
it's just how we winners are.

320
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,750
It's too bad. You just showed
me every tactic you've got.

321
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,583
I see it in your eyes.
You're in some real trouble now.

322
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,166
[TAMOTSU gasps]

323
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,833
[MASHIRO]
On to Round Two! Fight!

324
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,416
[RYU, CHUN LI]
Hadoken!

325
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,083
Dear god!

326
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,291
[MASHIRO] Matsuko reveals
her true skills!

327
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:08,500
Can Tamo-Two do anything to
stop this relentless carnage?

328
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,791
[gasps]
I at least have to block!

329
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,875
[MASHIRO]
A perfect K.O!

330
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,791
Matsuko wins the
second round decisively,

331
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,583
and worse, she made it
look super-stinkin' easy!

332
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,166
Does this mean the gap in talent
is too much to overcome?

333
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,416
Personally I'm all
for big gaps, Mashiro,

334
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,750
it just means an upset would
be that much more exciting!

335
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:30,500
[TAMOTSU gasps] You're strong.
Probably the best in the world.

336
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,291
They don't call you the "gamer
of the millennium" for nothing!

337
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,625
[MATSUKO]
No, don't sell yourself short.

338
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,875
You're strong, too. A lot
stronger than you realize.

339
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,833
You just haven't been
pushed hard enough yet.

340
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,291
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

341
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,166
Here comes the push!

342
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,666
[MATSUKO shouts]

343
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,750
Is this the moment
we've been waiting for?!

344
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,958
[MATSUKO shouts]

345
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,541
[MASHIRO]
You bet it is!

346
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,625
[TAMOTSU]
Huh?!

347
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,458
[MASHIRO]
Matsuko starts to disrobe!

348
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,250
Hold on to your butts, boys and
girls, it's Matsuko time!

349
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,583
[AUDIENCE cheers]

350
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,833
[AYANOKOJI] Yeah, folks,
clamp open those eyelids!

351
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,583
You don't want to miss
a second of this!

352
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,500
Wait, what? Why her clothes?

353
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,416
Hold on. Is she using the
ancient Chinese martial art

354
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,750
known as Fists of Shame?

355
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,333
[MATOME, PROFESSOR]
Huh?

356
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,833
[ARISA] Masters of this sacred
and incredibly difficult art

357
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,041
can expose their bodies as
a way to press themselves

358
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,958
into a corner, and awaken
their hidden potential!

359
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,166
It's said the fabled
mahjong master Jan Ki,

360
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,625
of the 16 kingdoms period,
used it to perfection.

361
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,833
And in Japan, the Edo-era
shogi master, Mataro the Viper,

362
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,083
employed the art as well.

363
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,625
The technique is even rumored
to be built into the code of the

364
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,083
computer program that defeated
the human go champion,

365
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,375
Yi Daeheol!

366
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,166
But I've heard it's
supposed to take 30 years

367
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,250
of training to master the
art of Fists of Shame.

368
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,500
So Matsuko must
truly be a genius!

369
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,791
Yeah, but, A Bugged
One disrobing?

370
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,250
[TAMOTSU grunts] But so many
people are watching!

371
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,791
Does this chick have no shame?

372
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,416
No player, this chick
does not have shame!

373
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,333
What she does have...

374
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,791
...is the will to win,
no matter what it takes!

375
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,166
[MASHIRO]
The shorts are off!

376
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,750
She's pushing herself
even harder!

377
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,875
[MATSUKO]
It's your turn! Show me yours!

378
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,125
Crap!

379
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,625
[MASHIRO] It all comes
down to the final round!

380
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,500
Fight!

381
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,500
[CHUN LI]
Kikoken!

382
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,041
I can't react fast enough!

383
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,541
[MASHIRO]
Matsuko's amped-up onslaught

384
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:20,125
seems to be unstoppable!
Does Tamo-Two stand a chance?

385
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,208
[RYU]
Shinku. Hadoken!

386
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,791
That was way too close!
He barely blocked the attack!

387
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,583
If that had landed full-force,
the match would be over.

388
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:31,916
Damn it! This sucks!
What am I supposed to do?

389
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:37,291
[TAMOTSU growls] I have
no choice! I'm undressing too!

390
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,500
[ALL gasp]

391
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,375
Stop it! If you take off
your clothes, you'll die!

392
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,625
[TAMOTSU]
I don't care anymore!

393
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,750
I'll do whatever it
takes to win this!

394
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,375
Even face death by de-pantsing!

395
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,833
[MASHIRO]
Tamo-Two, are you nuts?

396
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,500
This is a gaming tournament!
Consider the audience!

397
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,958
Your nudity won't please anyone!

398
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,333
[AYANOKOJI]
Actually there's a small but

399
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,750
very vocal fan base for that.

400
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,666
[CHUN LI]
Spinning bird kick!

401
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,291
[MATSUKO gasps]

402
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,958
[MASHIRO] Incredible! Tamo-Two
has just caught up with Matsuko!

403
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,958
Well done. Now... take this!

404
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,833
[MASHIRO]
She's down to her undies!

405
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,166
Matsuko has blessed us all!

406
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,500
[BOTH grunting]

407
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,875
[MASHIRO] Unbelievable!
This battle is so intense!

408
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,166
[BOTH scream]

409
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,375
[AYANOKOJI]
You're hearing it first from me:

410
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,500
this battle is so intense!

411
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,875
Their level of
concentration's amazing,

412
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,083
and they're totally equal!

413
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,083
But I still don't think
they've peaked yet!

414
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,625
[MASHIRO]
Uh oh, Tamo-Two's in trouble!

415
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,833
One more hit will end this!

416
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,333
It's everything I hoped for.

417
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,458
Facing someone of your caliber
has pushed me to new

418
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,500
extremes of power and
it's a fight I won't forget.

419
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,500
But this ends right here,
and right now!

420
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,708
That's where you're wrong!

421
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,458
It's not the end
it's the opposite,

422
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,125
it's where my legend is born!

423
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,666
What the--?

424
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,916
[MASHIRO] Tamo-Two is now doing
a handstand on the controls!

425
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,250
Has he completely snapped?

426
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,625
[TAMOTSU growls]

427
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:00,250
[MATSUKO gasps, grunts]

428
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,250
[MASHIRO] This is dangerous
on so many levels!

429
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,000
How will we put this online?

430
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,250
[AYANOKOJI] Eh, as long
as it's blurry, we're fine.

431
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,500
Oh wow! So that's what all the
training was for, Professor?

432
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,500
[PROFESSOR]
Sure, why not.

433
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,708
Is it done? Can I look?

434
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,208
[TAMOTSU yells]

435
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,458
[TAMOTSU yelling continues]

436
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,958
[MATSUKO grunts]

437
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,916
[CHUN LI]
I'll finish this!

438
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,166
You're done!

439
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,208
[MATSUKO gasps]
No!

440
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,375
[MASHIRO]
It's over?

441
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,291
[AUDIENCE gasps]

442
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,833
[AUDIENCE cheers]

443
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,625
[MASHIRO] The winner of this
astonishing battle is Tamo-Two!

444
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,791
He has defeated the champion
Matsuko to take the crown!

445
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,166
I can't believe he did it!

446
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,458
[PROFESSOR]
Exactly as I calculated.

447
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,833
[MATOME gasps]
Hold on!

448
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,916
I really beat her.

449
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,041
[gasps]

450
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,416
Ow, it burns,
it burns, it burns!

451
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,625
But I have so much
more to collect!

452
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,833
[TAMOTSU gasps]

453
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,583
[TAMOTSU]
Huh? You're helping me?

454
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,458
Your passion was just greater
than mine, I can't resent that.

455
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,041
Nicely fought.

456
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:18,291
Well thanks. It was a close one.
I was right on the edge myself.

457
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,708
Well, I won, so give
me back my sister.

458
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,541
That was the deal, right?

459
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,166
Like I said before, I have no
idea what you're talking about.

460
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,041
Oh come on, you can
stop playing dumb!

461
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:28,791
[MATOME grunts]

462
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,875
[MATSUKO gasps]
Huh?

463
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,291
[yelps]

464
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,833
[MATSUKO] No! Don't stare
at my cow-lick, please!

465
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,208

foolishly do the same,
