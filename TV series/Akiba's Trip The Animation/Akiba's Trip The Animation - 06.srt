you if I could, but alas!

158
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,791
[PROFESSOR]
Hm?

159
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,416
Sometime today?

160
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,333
[TAMOTSU] Yeah, yeah,
I'm coming. Chill!

161
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,000
[PROFESSOR chuckles]

[TAMOTSU gasps]

[MATOME]
Mm? Hm?

165
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,125
Hey, pay attention!
What are you looking at?

166
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,583
[gasps]
Sorry!

167
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,333
[MATOME grunts, gasps]

168
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,416
[MATOME]
Hm?

[TAMOTSU hums]

170
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,291
Oh, Pyuko, I'm home!

171
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,041
[gsps]

172
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,708
Welcome back home, Tamotsu.

173
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,750
[TAMOTSU]
Okay, what am I looking at?

174
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,583
[PROFESSOR] Say hello to the new
and improved Pyuko, version 2.0!

175
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,166
Pyuko now able to walk,

176
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,458
and follow Tamotsu to
outside environment.

177
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,916
[gasps]

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,958
Congrats, bro, she's mobile!

179
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,583
Walking isn't her
only new trick.

180
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,958
With a full array of
interchangeable arm attachments,

181
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,333
she can perform all
sorts of physical tasks!

182
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,291
[PYUKO]
Pyuko has magic hands.

183
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,833
[PROFESSOR] Since the most
important thing for any

184
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,625
collecting-obsessed otaku is
data storage, her behavior

185
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,333
routine now prioritizes that
over all other functions.

186
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,916
And she's got a great battery,

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,166
so you won't have to constantly
put her in "low power mode"!

188
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,916
I don't know what a
behavior routine is,

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,333
but I know I'm in love!

190
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,875
Ooh, a hug! How forward!
Things are moving so quickly!

191
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,583
[PYUKO grunts] This is a hug.
Pyuko has learned to hug.

192
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,041
[gasps, grunts]

193
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,833
Tamotsu. It's time to go patrol.

194
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,791
Hello? You down there?

195
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,708
Tamotsu already
left to go on patrol

196
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,125
and he took Pyuko with him too.

197
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,375
[gasps]

198
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,166
[TAMOTSU] Pyuko, this is
Manseibashi bridge!

199
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,041
[PYUKO] Pyuko has learned.
This is Manseibashi bridge.

200
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,708
[TAMOTSU] This used to
be an old vehicle museum.

201
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,541
I remember that place so well.

202
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,500
And this building's
super famous.

203
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,916
It's really important
to people like me.

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,958
I don't know if you'll
understand what I'm saying,

205
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,333
but this place is filled with
the ghosts of my youth.

206
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,500
Pyuko has learned.
And Pyuko understands.

207
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,750
This location filled with
Tamotsu youth ghosts.

208
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,375
Next. Another place
that shaped my youth.

209
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:31,916
Here--

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,958
[gasps]

211
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,125
Um. Actually I've realized
you're too young for this.

212
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,458
[PYUKO]
Pyuko has learned.

213
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,166
Pyuko is too young
for this location.

214
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,000
[TAMOTSU]
Hmm. Blended coffee, please.

215
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,541
Of course, Master, understood.
An excellent choice!

216
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,416
Also. Is there a power
outlet I can use nearby?

217
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,166
Yes, meow!

218
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,583
[SHOPPERS gasp]

219
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,250
[PYUKO grunts]
Pyuko detects staring.

220
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,000
Humans looking at Pyuko.

221
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,125
[TAMOTSU] Hm? Oh, are they?
Well, we shouldn't be surprised!

222
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,333
You're a beautiful computer,

223
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,291
I bet they all wish
they had a Pyuko, too!

224
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,416
Pyuko has learned
Pyuko is... beautiful.

225
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,250
[gasps]
System warning!

226
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,458
Uh-oh. What's wrong, Pyuko?
Are you overheating?

227
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,916
--[MATOME growls]
--[ARISA] Huh?

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,791
So why are we patrolling
separately now?

229
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,208
We usually all do it together.

230
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,750
It's tactical.

231
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,625
'Cause if we split up, we can
cover more area, obviously.

232
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,083
Let's go.

233
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,125
I think the opposite side of
Akiba needs our attention.

234
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,125
What? Hey, wait up!

235
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,875
Akiba precious to Tamotsu.
Pyuko has learned.

236
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,541
Pyuko. Sleep Mode.

237
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,375
[shouts]

238
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,000
[PYUKO]
Pyuko wins.

239
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,916
For 108th consecutive time.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,041
[TAMOTSU sighs]
The golden days of humankind

241
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,166
ruling the boards are over!

242
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,583
I hate this.

243
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,875
[ARISA]
Bad news!

244
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,000
Akiba's in serious trouble
this time, you guys!

245
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,708
PCs and robots and-- and
everything could go moimoi!

246
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,250
What is moi?

247
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,833
[PROFESSOR]
Pyuko. Bring up Clamas TV.

248
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,875
Command received. Executing.

249
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,916
Breaking. Yet another
shocking incident in Akiba!

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,625
Reports are flying in as we
speak that the new MofMap PCs

251
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,125
are transforming into
robots and creating chaos!

252
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,250
What you're about to
witness is exclusive footage

253
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,458
obtained by Clamas TV!

254
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,541
[MASUTO] Look! How can
this be happening, viewers?

255
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,958
Some experts speculate a
virus could be triggering

256
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,125
and exploiting a secret design
feature of the MofMap PC,

257
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,666
intended for a later upgrade.

258
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,416
But it seems it's too
early to know the truth!

259
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,083
What the hell? This has
Bug stink all over it!

260
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,125
Tamotsu! Arisa! Let's go!

261
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,083
Huh? Okay, and where
are we going exactly?

262
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,416
The MofMap store.

263
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,666
That's where all of these
PCs came from, isn't it?

264
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,708
[TAMOTSU, MATOME, ARIA pant]

265

[TAMOTSU] Looks like they
already skipped town.

266
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,500
[MATOME]
Even if that's true,

267
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,791
there could still be
clues inside. Arisa!

268
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,708
Right, say no more!

269

Wow. It's even Arisa-proof.

00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,250
[ARISA groans]
That's a first.

272
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,291
Pyuko will open.

273
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,750

00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,333
Done! Pyuko is now a hacker!

[TAMOTSU]
Not to split hairs,

277
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,083
but I think that makes you
more of a locksmith.

Who are you guys, are you
breaking into the store?

283
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,083
I'm too innocent to be
scandalized by thieves!

Someone help me, I'm so
scared and delicate!

Yeah. Right.

She's laying it on
a little thick, huh?

287
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,666
And you look too
old to pull off the

My plan is to rule Akiba

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,375
with robots disguised as
ridiculously cheap PCs!

you go tattling on me.
