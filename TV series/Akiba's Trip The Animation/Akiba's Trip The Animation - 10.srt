you can order double meat!

156
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,250
Wow, it's amazing!

157
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,250
They're enjoying the food
and having a good time!

158
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,375
But the next step is key!

159
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,625
Ah! You're right, you can't
talk about curry in Akiba

160
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,250
if you haven't eaten at Bengal.

161
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,958
And the layer of cinnamon
in the lassi's

162
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,583
an interesting twist, too.

163
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,375
[MATOME] Come on, let's go
to the next place.

164
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,833
Uh? Next?

165
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,833
[MATOME] Lucky for us,
it's right next door!

166
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,375
[TAMOTSU]
So we're eating here too?

167
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,625
[MATOME]
Of course!

168
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,125
Gansen is Akiba's most
famous Chinese place!

169
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,208
[TAMOTSU]
Whoa. Their menu's huge.

170
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,291
[MATOME] Plus there's the
weekly fried rice specials

171
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,416
and limited dishes you can
hear about if you follow

172
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,000
Gone, the owner online,
like I naturally do!

173
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,208
[TAMOTSU]
Uh-huh...

174
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,875
[MATOME] This is the
weekend-only beef tendon

175
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,708
in starchy sauce fried rice!

176
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,583
Wow. It looks great.

177
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,875
Oh, it is!

178
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,708
Just mix the soft boiled
egg on top, and boom!

179
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,250
Paradise!

180
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:26,541
[MATOME giggles]
It's so good!

181
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,083
I want that in my mouth.

182
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,958
But why a second meal?

183
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,208
Impressive. The fried rice in
this dish is perfectly balanced,

184
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,625
dry and smooth,
yet jam-packed with flavor.

185
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,541
And it's a perfect combo
with the beef tendon sauce!

186
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,375
It's like Liu Bei
and Zhuge Liang

187
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,375
running an empire
of flavor! Hm?

188
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,250
[MATOME giggles]
Oh yeah...

189
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,500
[TAMOTSU]
Hm?

190
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,625
[TAMOTSU chuckles]

191
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,500
[MATOME]
Alright here's our next stop!

192
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,875
--[ARISA gasps]
--[NIWAKA] They're eating again?

193
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,250
So this is Kitchen
Jiro. I've heard of this place

194
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,916
for years but never
tried it, either.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,708
It's the best "set meal"
restaurant in town!

196
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,708
Since we've already had curry
today, I'll try the minced meat

197
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,625
cutlet and fried
chicken with large rice.

198
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,125
You really still have
room for all that?

199
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,583
Duh! I'm gonna make room!

200
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,500
We have to eat when
we can, Tamotsu.

201
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,125
I can't believe you're not
eating. What, are you on a diet?

202
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,708
No, just full.

203
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,000
[MATOME] The meals here are huge
but reasonably priced and great!

204
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh... Wow! The miso
soup is tasty, too!

205
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,875
Just look how tender and
juicy this cutlet is!

206
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,000
The minced meat goes perfectly
with the sweetness of

207
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,333
the onions, and don't even
get me started on how well

208
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,333
it complements the rice!
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!

209
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,666
Sounds good.

210
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,583
Uh... Gimme!

211
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,166
Tamotsu, that's mine!

212
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,541
Mm! Wow the breading's
so crispy!

213
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,333
Never mind being full,
I can't say no to this!

214
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,708
[gasps]

215
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,666
[MATOME] A shared bite's
kinda like an indirect kiss.

216
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,750
Whatcha thinking?

217
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,416
No, nothing, just eating
delicious food!

218
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,958
[TAMOTSU gasps]

219
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,250
When you're eating, you look
the happiest I've ever seen you.

220
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,000
It's great. Just watching
you makes me hungry again.

221
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,833
[MATOME gasps] I guess that's
sort of a compliment, so thanks?

222
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,333
Anyway... If you're hungry,
where to next?

223
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,083
[NIWAKA, ARISA groan]

224
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,291
[TAMOTSU groans]

225
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,500
This seems less like a date

226
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,458
and more like an extreme
eating challenge.

227
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,500
I can't believe they went
to four more restaurants.

228
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,166
I'm sorry. I made you
eat too much, didn't I?

229
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,708
I'm... fine.

230
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,333
It's amazing, though. I've never
seen anyone eat like you do.

231
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,541
[MATOME gasps]

232
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,166
The truth is, well, I've lived
here for a long time.

233
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,916
And this district has
been through a lot.

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,916
There were darker days, when
there was almost nothing to eat.

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,958
I was so hungry it hurt.

236
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,125
And you never forget
how that feels.

237
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,458
So now, I eat when I can.

238
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,666
Gee, I had no idea.

239
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,208
Well, eating when you have the
chance sounds like a pretty good

240
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,208
philosophy for staying happy.
And I guess the fact we can

241
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,583
is also a nice reminder
we live in peaceful times.

242
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,083
Exactly.

243
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,750
[TAMOTSU] Hm. Okay you've
shown me your favorite places,

244
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,791
so why don't I show
you one of mine?

245
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,291
Ramen <i>Kagemusha</i> ?

246
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,583
It's that heavy-hitting
type that's in style.

247
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,750
So I'm thinking that means
it's right up your alley.

248
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,500
Are you sure this won't
make you feel sick?

249
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,708
Yeah sure, one bowl
never hurt anyone.

250
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,875
Hey guys, what's cooking?

251
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,750
[SUIDOBASHI, TAMOTSU grunt]

252
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,625
Okay, that was unexpected.

253
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,916
Huh? Hey! A vigilante!

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,041
What's wrong?

255
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,208
He's like a black hole.

[TAMOTSU, MATOME gasp]

257

[COOK A]
Please! Enough!

258
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,375
[TAMOTSU, MATOME]
Huh?

259
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,916
[SHOPPERS gasp]

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,458
Ah! Another bowl!

261
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,416
That brings the bounty
to 240,000y en!

262
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,916
Please, you have to stop!

263
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,625
That promotion was to help
my business, not to bankrupt me!

264
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,416
And you're wiping me out
of noodles and broth, too!

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,458
Hey! You're the one
who offered that bounty,

266

you dope, don't blame me!
Just get back in that kitchen

and make me another bowl
with extra toppings, now!

Wait, who is that guy?

269
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,208
A noodle hog, that's who!

270
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,458
Oh, when did you show up?

271
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,458
I've been here for an
hour waiting for ramen,

272
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,500
but that guy's stopping
everyone from ordering!

273
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,833
It's a lunch nightmare!

274
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:03,208
Hold on. I've seen him before.
On TV, maybe?

275
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,333
Yeah that's it! He's the world
champion corndog eater!

276
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,916
The food soldier,
Black Hole Kurota!

277
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,250
I heard he lost to
his rival, Minimum Tashiro,

278
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,250
in the last contest,
and then went missing.

279
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,458
I don't care about
his backstory, Tamotsu,

280
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,833
just make him stop!

281
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,791
Hey! Can't you see all these
customers are waiting?

282
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,958
[KUROTA] Huh? You saying
I'm not a customer too?

283
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,333
I'm saying it's a restaurant,
not your training kitchen!

284
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,375
I've got the right to eat what
I want, when I want, cupcake!

285
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,583
If you want me to listen to you,
why don't you challenge me

286
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,291
to an eating contest like
that silly girl just did.

287
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,750
If you can actually beat me,
I'll do what you say.

288
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,291
[TAMOTSU grunts] So that's
what happened to her.

289
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,083
[MATOME]
You're on!

290
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,166
[TAMOTSU, KUROTA]
Hm?

291
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,583
[MATOME]
If that's what it takes, fine!

292
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,791
As one of the proud vigilantes
who protects the people

293
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,541
of Akiba, I challenge
you to an eating duel!

294
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,083
It's another shocker
in Akiba, folks!

295
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,666
This time it's an impromptu
ramen-eating battle!

296
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,041
Right here in our
very own Horin Park!

297
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,666
The world-famous competitive
eater, Black Hole Kurota,

298
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,458
has been recklessly
challenged by the leader of

299
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,041
Electric Mayonnaise, a novice
who we will now call

300
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,000
Matome "Vacuum" Mayonaka.

301
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,291
Can she prevail with
her petite figure?

302
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,416
Well she better, 'cause they've
agreed the loser will pick up

303
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,541
the winner's tab at all
restaurants in Akiba

304
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,833
from now on!

305
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,000
I feel like this got out
of hand really fast!

306
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,333
Don't worry, you guys.
Mayo can handle him.

307
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,541
But what if she loses?

308
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,291
Then who's gonna pay
all those food bills?

309
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,500
Dunno, but it won't be me!]

Yeah, me neither!

You really think a little
girl like you can take me,

312
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,208
a professional food soldier,

313
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,666
who's won against the
best in the world?

314
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,250
Of course I can.

315
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,000
Because you don't appreciate the
food, you just do it for sport.

316
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,916
You don't deserve to overeat.

317

[KUROTA scoffs]
Taste doesn't matter.

318
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,875
Once it's in your stomach,
it's all the same.

319
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,916
[MASUTO]
The clock is set for one hour!

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,083
Whoever eats the most
ramen before time expires

321
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,541
will be the winner!

Okay contestants, get your
chopsticks ready! And... Go!

[horn blares]

324

[MASUTO] If Kurota wins
that meal ticket, he could hog

325
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,208
food at all the restaurants
throughout Akiba!

326
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,375
So the stakes are high,

327
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,583
and they've both hit
the ground running!

Go on. Eat, Mayo!
Eat for Akiba's future!

You can do it!

00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,416
A one-hour contest, huh?

331
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,916
That means pacing's
gonna be crucial.

332

[MATOME] This is delicious.
I could do this all day.

333

That girl's good,
especially for a newcomer.

334
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,666
Her water timing's perfect.

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,583
Yeah, the water's key.
if you drink too much of it,

up in your stomach.

their first bowls

almost simultaneously!

So fast!

Just watching them eat like
that gives me a stomach ache.

finished their tenth serving!

This competition is intense!

Man, they're so evenly matched.

352

She needs a tactic
to pull ahead.

What the--?

357

Vacuum Mayonaka has
thrown her ramen skyward

358
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,041
and I have no idea why!
Is she throwing this fight?

359
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,541
No! She caught it!

360
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,875
She tossed with her right hand
and caught with her left!

361
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,500
And now she's back to slurping!

362
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,166
Oh, now I get it.
She's throwing the noodles

363
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,000
to save herself time. The air
is cooling them down for her!

364
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,833
So she doesn't have to
waste valuable seconds

365
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,125
blowing on them herself!

me that pitcher of water!

drink extra water?

defiling the ramen!

would I care about that?
