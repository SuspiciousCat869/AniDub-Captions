or your master won't
be able to hear you!

160
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,666
[TAMOTSU]
Sorry, it's my first time.

161
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,416
I got performance anxiety.

162
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,208
[KUROI]
Go easy on him, Nishi.

163
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,458
We have to crawl
before we learn to fly.

164
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,791
[MAIDS, BUTLERS whimpering]

165
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,041
[KUROI] Now let's get
on with it, shall we?

166
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,875
[chuckles]

167
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,416
So who wants to tell me
our Great Goal of the Day?

168
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,750
[MAIDS, BUTLERS shouting]

169
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,958
Please! Let it be me, sir!

170
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,375
No! I want it more, sir!

171
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,958
[IWAKADO]
No, sir! Let me do it, please!

172
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,250
I want it with every
fiber of my being!

173
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,291
[KUROI] Very well.
You may have the honor.

174
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,458
[IWAKADO]
Oh, thank you, sir, thank you!

175
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,791
You won't regret this...

176
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,791
[TAMOTSU] What the hell
kind of workplace is this?

177
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,625
[TAMOTSU sighs]

178
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,958
[MATOME]
You were out late.

179
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,000
[TAMOTSU]
Huh?

180
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,625
Does that mean you
found a new job?

181
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,791
Yeah.

182
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,625
Now I'm working at a
maid-and-butler bar.

183
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,958
And I may have made a bad
choice, or at least a weird one.

184
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,625
Well just don't let your job
affect our patrols, okay?

185
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,666
[TAMOTSU] I think we need to
pause those for a while.

186
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,250
'Least till I settle in.

187
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,500
You're always making excuses to
get out of it. It's important!

188
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,958
I have to get up early,
will you let me sleep?

189
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,583
I need money.
The Buggies can wait.

190
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,791
What kind of attitude is that?!

191
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,833
Fine, I'll protect Akiba myself!

192
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,833
But you better patch
things up with Niwaka!

193
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,125
At least then you'll
do one thing right!

194
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,875
[NIWAKA]
He's so stupid.

195
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,958
One moment please, Master.
I'll be right with you.

196
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,458
Hi, thank you for
waiting, Master.

197
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,208
I am here to serve you!

198
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,166
[TAMOTSU yelps]

199
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,041
Uh, thank you for waiting,
Master. I'm here to serve you!

200
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,250
Whoa, that looks great!
Thanks, man!

201
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,416
Oh. Yeah, of course!
You're welcome!

202
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,083
I got a load of dishes here!

203
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,125
[COOK A]
Okay!

204
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,666
[sighs]

205
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,291
[IWAKADO]
I heard that.

206
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,083
Huh? Heard what? What'd I do?

207
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,625
Relax it's not bad.

208
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,000
I mean I heard you got your
first "thank you" from a master!

209
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,583
Great job!

210
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,458
Oh, but that's normal, right?
You get thanked all the time.

211
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,875
I do now, but when I started,

212
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,916
it took me a long time
to get my first "thanks."

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Looks like you might have a real
knack for this job, Tamotsu.

214
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:53,833
[chuckles]

215
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,500
Wow, you think so?

216
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,250
[NISHI] Could I get some
assistance out here, please?

217
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,875
Yeah! I'm coming!

218
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,416
Tamotsu.

219
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,291
This young lady is celebrating
her birthday with us today.

220
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,916
Oh, that's great to hear.
Happy birthday, master!

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,708
[NISHI] She would like to have
a photo to mark the occasion.

222
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,125
Yeah, sure.

223
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:17,708
Uh. Actually. Why don't we
kick it up another notch?

224
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,375
Say "cheese"!

225
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,750
Wow.

226
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,750
I haven't seen one of those
in a while. How retro!

227
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,958
Well I figure since
it's a special occasion,

228
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,166
we might as well do
something special, right?

229
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,333
[NISHI]
I think it's brilliant, Tamotsu.

230
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,416
From now on, you're the bar's
special event photographer!

231
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,583
[TAMOTSU]
Uh.

232
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,708
Photographer? I do like
the sound of that.

233
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,291
[GIRL A]
Wow!

234
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:43,708
I love it! It's perfect! Thank
you, Mr. Butler-photographer!

235
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,458
Using your talents
to delight a master,

236
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,583
now that is some
next level servitude!

237
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,250
You are a great new butler!

238
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,083
[TAMOTSU yelps]

239
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,041
It wasn't that impressive.
It was mostly point-and-click.

240
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,250
Let us both labor hard together!

241
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,333
Right. Yes sir!

242
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,416
[MAIDS, BUTLERS] Fare thee well,
Masters! Have a safe trip!

243
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,083
[KUROI]
Tamotsu.

244
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,916
[TAMOTSU]
Manager, sir!

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,125
Seems you found
the elbow grease.

246
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,333
Guess so.

247
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,208
But it's nothing I would
complain about, sir.

248
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,333
I just realized that when
masters have a good time,

249
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,541
I do, too.

250
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,125
Wow, that's great!

251
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,833
You've already reached the next
stage of service enlightenment

252
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,208
by seeing things from the
master's point of view!

253
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,375
[NISHI] Your call, sir.

254
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,041
[KUROI]
Mh-hm.

255
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,833
[KUROI chuckles]

256
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,333
[KUROI]
Here. You've earned it.

257
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,416
Whoa, you're giving
me a second heart?!

258
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,208
[KUROI] That's right, Tamotsu.
You're more than ready.

259
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,166
Keep working hard, and the
rewards will be vast, indeed.

260
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,666
Congratulations, Tamotsu!

261
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,250
This calls for a Cheer Circle!

262
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,250
[BUTLERS]
Congratulations, Tamotsu!

263
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,458
[MAIDS]
Congratulations, Tamotsu!

264
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,416
[MAID 7A] And up!

265
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,583
[MAIDS, BUTLERS]
Huzzah! Huzzah!

266
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,583
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

267
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,208
[TAMOTSU]
Thanks, guys!

268
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,166
[MAIDS, BUTLERS]
Huzzah! Huzzah!

269
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,083
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

270
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,291
[TAMOTSU laughing]

271
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,750
[sighs]

272
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,333
[TAMOTSU snoring]

273
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,750
[MATOME]
We barely see you anymore.

274
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,333
[MAID B]
I wonder how I'll do this week.

275
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,041
[IWAKADO]
You'll be fine. You worked hard!

276
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,291
Yeah, we all did.
There's no reason to worry!

277
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,000
[TAMOTSU]
Huh?

278
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,291
Hey, what's going on?

279
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,291
Oh, yeah, that's right,
this is your first one!

280
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,833
We're about to have our
weekly Thank You Pay Day.

281
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,541
What's a Thank You Pay Day?

282
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,708
We get extra "Thank You Pay"

283
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,708
for all the times
masters thank us.

284
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,333
Best day of the week!

285
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,125
So what, like he
hands out checks?

286
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:41,958
[IWAKADO]
You'll see!

287
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,500
Trust me, it's great!

288
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,916
[KUROI]
Excellent maid work!

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,166
[TAMOTSU] That flyer did mention
a unique payment scheme,

290
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,250
and getting more based
on performance.

291
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,625
I wonder how much I'll get.

292
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,958
[NISHI]
Wow, 40? Thank you, sir!

293
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,250
[TAMOTSU] Forty what?
Forty G's? Like forty thousand?

294
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:57,958
[KUROI]
Tamotsu.

295
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,041
Yes, sir!

296
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,666
You've done quite
well for yourself.

297
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,458
That's rare for a butler
in his first week.

298
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,541
Keep up the good work.

299
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,541
Thank you very much, manager!

300
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,250
[TAMOTSU]
This feels like a major wad!

301
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,875
[VOICE]
Thank you!

302
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,958
What the hell is this?

303
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,208
No way!

304
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,958
I've never seen anyone
get so many "thank you"s

305
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,208
in their first week!

306
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,166
[NISHI]
I knew you had great potential.

307
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,750
Am I missing something?
Do these have actual value?

308
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,250
The greatest value of all.

309
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,416
The value of knowing you've
made so many masters happy!

310
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,916
And shattering the
opening week record

311
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,375
is an incredible accomplishment,

312
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,291
which calls for
another Cheer Circle!

313
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,333
Thanks for making
us proud, Tamotsu!

314
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,625
[BUTLERS]
Thank you, Tamotsu!

315
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,916
[MAIDS]
Thank you, Tamotsu!

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
[MAIDS, BUTLERS]
Huzzah!

317
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,541
Okay. You're welcome, I guess.

318
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,541
Niwaka. It's good to see you.

319
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,416
So my brother's not here?

320
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,958
[MATOME]
Mm-mm.

321
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,666
[MATOME] You come to talk to
him about that broken figure?

322
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,333
[NIWAKA] Yeah. I think
I may have been a bit

323
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,041
too harsh on him.

324
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,833
And even if he deserved it, I
don't want it to drive us apart.

325
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,666
[MATOME sighs]
That big idiot.

326
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,750
He doesn't deserve a sister as
sweet and understanding as you.

327
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,333
And now he's left
you alone to worry.

328
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,416
[NIWAKA sighs]

329
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,583
Big brother! Whatcha readin'?

330
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm learning how to set myself
up with a work-free life!

331
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,625
Wow, really?

332
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,208
[TAMOTSU]
Done!

333
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,250
[NIWAKA gasps]
Looks great! You're so good!

334
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,000
[TAMOTSU grunts]

335
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,041
[NIWAKA]
Hey, bro!

336
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,833
[NIWAKA chuckles]

337
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,166
[gasps]

338
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,041
[NIWAKA gasps]

339
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,083
Tamotsu. If you care
why don't you show it?!

340
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,291
Did I... miss something?

341
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,041
[TAMOTSU gasps]
I'm sorry, Masters!

342
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,083
[IWAKADO] What's going
on with you today?

343
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,041
You're not acting like yourself.

344
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,625
Please forgive me.

345
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,875
You'll never get "thank you's"
with this kind of performance.

346
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,708
Look, You're way
better than this.

347
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,875
Are you giving your all?

348
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,458
I think so.

349
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,541
[IWAKADO] Lies! You're working
scared 'cause of one mistake!

350
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,750
Sorry, Head Maid.

351
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,333
I don't want to
hear more apologies.

352
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,250
What I want is for you
to rise to the potential

353
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,208
you've already
shown us you have.

354
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,666
When you got your first
"thank you," you were glowing.

355
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,291
That's the lover-of-work
I want to see.

356
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,291
But I'm not like you,
I don't love working.

357
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,125
I just wanted the cash!
I'm living a lie!

358
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,083
[IWAKADO] Nobody starts with
the pure passion for labor.

359
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,833
I was just like you once.

360
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,375
But I found the true path,
and so will you.

361
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,916
[TAMOTSU gasps]

362
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,125
[IWAKADO] Collecting smiles
and "thank you's" from masters,

363
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,583
that's the real essence of life.

364
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,041
Don't be scared, you'll learn.
We'll show you.

365
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,291
Let's stay on the "thank
you" path together, okay?

366
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,875
Okay!

367
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,833
[NISHI] You're not alone
and never will be again.

368
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,083
We're your new family, Tamotsu.

369
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,583
Don't give up
the fight, Tamotsu!

370
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,916
Stand up and make us all proud!

371
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,791
[TAMOTSU]
Yes. I'm sorry for doubting.

372
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,250
I'll never give up! I'll work
hard and always give my best!

373
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,291
[ALL] Do your best, Tamotsu!
Do your best, Tamotsu!

374
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,250
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah...!

375
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:08,791
[TAMOTSU giggles, laughs]

376
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,875
[MASHIRO grunts]

377
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,208
[TAMOTSU] The Butler and Maid
Bar GON-chan is awaiting our

378
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,041
master's return! We hope that
we may serve you soon, master!

379
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,875
[MASHIRO] Hey! Street soliciting
is banned!

380
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,250
[TAMOTSU] Miss Mashiro!
Thank you for pointing me

381
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,166
to a great new job
and way of life!

382
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,541
Here you go! Fare thee well!

383
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:32,750
[MASHIRO] That doesn't look
healthy. Hmm, whatever!

384
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,958
[KUROI] Who wants to say
the Great Goal of the Day?

385
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,791
I do! I do! Please pick me, sir!

386
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:42,000
I want it! I crave it!
I need it so bad!

387
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,416
Another round, please?

388
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,625
Thank you for waiting, master!
I'm here to serve you!

389
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,750
I need 50 orders of
sliced cabbage, quick!

390
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,041
Our masters are hungry!

391
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,166
Wait, 50?!

392
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,583
Don't worry guys,
I'm on it!

393
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,583
I'm writing up the schedule
for next week. What's your--

394
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,041
Please put me down
for every shift, sir!

395
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,708
You're really in
top form, aren't you?

396
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,125
Thank you sir! I finally
realized fate brought me

397
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,250
to Akiba so I could
work as a butler here!

398
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,958
This is my life's true calling!

399
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,208
It's strange. He's not even
coming home at night now.

400
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,208
We haven't seen
him in a week.

401
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,125
[ARISA] Guys, guys!
It's worse than we thought!

402
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,166
What's is it?

403
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,666
Tamotsu's in major trouble!

404
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,583
[NIWAKA]
What have they done to him?

405
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,250
[NIWAKA] Where is he?

406
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,875
[MAID B,C]
Hm?

407
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,208
[TAMOTSU] Welcome home, Master.
How may I serve you?

408
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,375
[ALL gasp]

409
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,833
[NIWAKA] Bro! Why do
you look like that?

410
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,166
Tamotsu! You have
to quit, right now!

411
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,708
You're way too close to
the point of no return!

412
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,583
What are you saying?
Why would I quit?

413
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,833
It's the best
workplace of all time.

414
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,541
Collecting "thank you's"
is everything.

415
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,208
It's my dream come true!

416
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,333
Your dream?

417
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,958
How does someone collect
"thank you's"?

418
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,250
You're making no sense!

419
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,708
This is bad, they've really
got into his head!

420
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:53,833
[MATOME, ARISA gasp]

421
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,083
Yes! You understand,
don't you, Niwaka?

422
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,666
Oh, I knew you would.

423
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,125
Now let us join as a team and
collect "thank you's" together!

424
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,500
[NIWAKA]
I'm doing this for you.

425
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,250
Huh? Doing what?

426
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,125
[TAMOTSU groans]

427
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,750
Wake up, Big Bro!

428
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,750
Oh, snap!

429
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,125
Man, that girl can hit.

430
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,416
Niwaka--

431
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,000
[NIWAKA]
I said wake up now!

432
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,541
[TAMOTSU groans]

433
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:22,958
[NIWAKA gasps]
Tamotsu! Bro, are you okay? Hey!

434
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,125
I wasn't trying to hurt you.
I was just trying to help you

435
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,083
snap out of this, so you
could be yourself again.

436
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,708
I know your real dream,
and it's not to work here.

437
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,583
You want to write your
own novel, which becomes a

438
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,125
best-seller and gets made
into a live-action movie.

439
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,791
The movie's a total flop, but
then it's rebooted as an anime,

440
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,458
and that's a gigantic hit! Then
you spend the rest of your life

441
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,250
lounging off the royalties! It's
your dream of unearned income!

442
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,458
Don't tell me you've
forgotten that!

443
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:51,083
[gasps] Unearned income!
That's right!

444
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,666
How could I become a sweaty cog
in the conformity machine?

445
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,375
That's not like me at all!

446
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,000
There's the Tamotsu
we know and love!

447
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,583
You've got a lot of
making up to do.

448
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,250
You made your poor
sister cry again.

449
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,125
Yeah, that's right
you big dummy!

450
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,875
[TAMOTSU] Sorry. Those were
some nice hits, though!

451
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,041
What's going on in here?

452
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,541
Those aren't the
sounds of hard labor!

453
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,666
[KUROI sighs] That's a shame.
And he showed so much promise.

454
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,500
Seventeen days.
The record ends there.

455
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,333
To make us slave away in
these inhumane conditions,

456
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,625
you must be inhuman
yourself, aren't you?

457
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,083
[chuckles] I never would've
guessed that this would be

458
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,333
the day I was exposed.

459
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,416
--[GIRLS] A Bugged One!
--[TAMOTSU] I called it!

460
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,208
My beautifully sinister plan
is to cut labor costs,

461
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,166
provide cheap food and drink,
and rule Akiba from its stomach,

462
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,416
and now that you've outed me,
I clearly can't let you live.

463
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,625
Technically-part-
time-warriors, attack!

464
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,916
[BUTLERS, MAIDS] Welcome home,
Master! How may I serve you?

465
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,708
