00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,166
Aw, come on!

158
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,458
Not again!

159
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,666
[ALL shout]

160
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,791
[TAMOTSU]
Ow! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot...!

161
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,000
[DENKO laughs] How do you like
my special microwave attack?

162
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,333
Neat, right?

163
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,708
It is pretty neat.

164
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,041
It's like being inside
a microwave oven!

165
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,541
[ALL gasp]

166
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,666
[DENKO laughs]
Bugged One Radio!

167
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,958
Where the hits
just keep on coming!

168
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:04,000
[DENKO laughs]

169
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,125
[TAMOTSU groans]
That stings!

170
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,041
This is some troubling news.

171
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,958
A Buggy fighting with EM waves
could be quite a threat.

172
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,750
The neighborhood's
in total chaos!

173
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,125
Computers and smartphones
are blowing up!

174
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,916
It seems like the only
way we can stop those

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,875
wave attacks is to
destroy that tower.

176
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,708
But if we get close, we'll be
cooked like baked potatoes.

177
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,083
I think her Tokyo Tower Two
dream is more like a nightmare!

178
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,916
Wait, Tokyo Tower Two?

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,125
Yeah. That's what the
lady up top called it.

180
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,250
Then she said something about
"reclaiming the tower dream."

181
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:38,333
[sighs] I see. I'm afraid
that means this

182
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,666
Bugged One woman is
someone I used to know.

183
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,375
[ALL gasp]

184
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,916
What makes you say that?

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,750
[PROFESSOR] We're going to need
help from the professor who

186
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,250
mentored me, back in
my Tsukuba days.

187
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,625
Anyone else lost?

188
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,750
Before she moved here,
Professor Latu used to be a

189
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,708
researcher at the Cutting Edge
Science Center in Tsukuba.

190
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,333
Cutting Edge Science, huh?

191
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,333
[ARISA]
You must be a real smarty-pants!

192
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,583
If you weren't in Akiba,

193
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,541
how'd you learn about
the Bugged Ones here?

194
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:05,625
Well, it was a blatantly
ambiguous number of years ago.

195
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,916
Back then, the Tsukaba
Express train to Tokyo

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,875
wasn't running yet, so it felt
way more like the boonies.

197
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,500
But the Science Center
drew researchers

198
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,041
from around the world.

199
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,250
Even though the Bugged Ones
weren't as active then,

200
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,750
we knew they worked behind
the scenes in Akihabara.

201
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,416
I was teamed with a woman
named Denko Busujima,

202
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,125
the one who must be
behind that tower,

203
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,500
to study these mysterious bugs.

204
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,000
We were guided the whole
way by Professor Yagyuda,

205
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,875
our instructor who ran the lab.

206
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,125
He was a researching heavyweight
in countless scientific fields,

207
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,166
including paranormal phenomena.

208
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,458
He was the one who encouraged
me to study Bugged Ones

209
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,750
in their natural habitat.

210
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,333
That's how I first
came to Akihabara.

211
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,208
[ARISA] Oh, Professor!
I had no idea!

212
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,333
How was that sad?

213
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,333
So? There's gotta be
more to the story.

214
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,291
Where does that Tokyo
Tower Two come in?

215
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,291
Yes. This is where
it gets interesting.

216
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,708
Through our research,
we discovered the

217
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,291
Bugged Ones emit a weak
but very distinct radio wave,

218
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,083
so we set our sights on a bold
new construction project.

219
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,500
Did you ever hear about the old
plans to build a replacement

220
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,458
for the Tokyo Tower?
Tokyo Tower Two in Akihabara?

221
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,041
That sounds vaguely familiar.

222
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,750
I remember, but wasn't
that over ten years ago?

223
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,375
[PROFESSOR]
With that huge antenna here,

224
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,791
we could have easily detected
their faint radio waves,

225
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,250
and probably have made some
kind of major breakthrough.

226
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,833
Denko and Professor Yagyuda
spent everything they had

227
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,708
to try and lure the next
broadcasting tower to Akihabara.

228
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,333
They tried, and tried,
and tried, and tried,

229
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,416
and tried, and tried,
and tried--

230
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,833
[bell dings]

231
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,833
[laughs]
Wow, that's hilarious!

232
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,791
So that's why she's
tower-obsessed.

233
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,875
You've got a brilliant scientist
who's evidently gone Buggy.

234
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,500
Good news is Professor
Yagyuda is an EM wave expert

235
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,625
who could help us out.

236
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,916
Of course, that presents
another problem.

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,416
[MATOME] What?

238
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,125
[PROFESSOR] After losing all
his money in that tower bid,

239
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,833
Yagyuda moved to Brazil.
To fund his next research,

240
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,916
he's been working
there as a garimpeiro.

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,916
As Gollum's pillow?

242
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,083
A God of play-dough?

243
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,125
Guys, she means a prospector!

244
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,083
Our problem is, the man
best-suited to help

245
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,000
is lost in the
Brazilian wilderness.

246
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,875
And thanks to the waves from
that tower, we don't have

247
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,666
working phones for calls or
computers to send emails.

248
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,083
Though he likely doesn't
have those either.

249
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,958
What we need is an alternative
form of communication.

250
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,875
An alternative form.

251
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,750
[gasps]
I've got it!

252
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,750
We can contact this Professor
Garimpeiro guy over the radio!

253
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,166
'Cause they're not
like computers!

254
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,625
Radios can't be
hacked by signals,

255
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,333
which makes them
practically invincible!

256
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,916
Oh, I didn't know that.

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,458
Yes. Right! That's why I asked
him to set up that beam antenna

258
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,791
on the roof, because I'm
smart and was thinking ahead!

259
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,708
[NIWAKA]
Really?

260
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,250
Hold on.

261
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,791
Can you really reach him on
the other side of the planet?

262
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,791
I thought radio couldn't even
handle a parking garage.

263
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,833
[TAMOTSU chuckles]
Yeah. You have no idea!

264
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,208
Grab your ballgowns, ladies,

265
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,250
it's time for a waltz
in the stratosphere!

266
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,375
[PROFESSOR] Tamotsu's right.
Communicating with Brazil

267
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,166
by radio is possible, though
it's not going to be easy.

268
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,916
Thanks to our resident fanatic,
we have the gear we need.

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,875
But the weather and ionospheric
conditions are beyond our sway.

270
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,083
If we could control the sun
through worship I'd pray,

271
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,166
but unfortunately I believe
in that gobbledygook

272
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,250
they call "science."

273
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,041
Okie doke!
Then I'll pray instead!

274
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,125
Oh, Amaterasu. Oh, Tsukuyomi,
please do some sun stuff!

275
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,166
You think Japanese gods are
gonna listen to someone

276
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,458
who says "moi moi" all day long?

277
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,458
[gasps]
How 'bout Finnish gods?

278
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,166
Oh, Ukko! Oh, Ilmarinen! Help!

279
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,416
I'm afraid that all we
can do now is be patient.

280
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,958
And wait for the "wind."

281
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,125
[ALL]
Right!

282
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,083
[TAMOTSU]
Hm...

283
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,875
[PROFESSOR] Good.
We're set to start trying.

284
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,750
Now let's discuss
Matome's question

285
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,166
about delivering radio
all the way to Brazil.

286
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,791
Since radio waves normally
travel in a straight line,

287
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,500
reaching the other side of the
planet would seem impossible.

288
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,833
However, nature gives us a
workaround in the form of

289
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,750
the Earth's ionosphere, an
atmospheric layer that has been

290
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,166
ionized, or charged, primarily
by the sun's ultraviolet rays.

291
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,791
This layer reflects radio waves,

292
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,125
similar to how a
mirror reflects light.

293
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,666
And variables, such as time
of year, time of day,

294
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,250
weather conditions,
and solar flares,

295
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,291
can expand the ionosphere and
intensify the reflections,

296
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,625
allowing us to bounce the waves

297
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,291
all the way to the
other side of the globe.

298
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,291
But even if we can do it,
the long distance

299
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,500
will make voice
communication unrealistic.

300
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,583
That's why Tamotsu
is using Morse code,

301
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,708
which can still be distinguished
through a weakened signal.

302
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,458
The professor knows
Morse code and scans the

303
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,333
frequencies for fun, but we
don't know when he's listening.

304
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,333
Or if our waves are
reaching that far.

305
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,583
So Tamotsu's testing
with a call sign.

306
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,041
Hm... Why don't we try switching
to the other antenna.

307
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,041
Niwaka, will you please
unplug that coaxial cable

308
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,500
and patch in number
three instead?

309
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,916
[NIWAKA]
Okay!

Two extra ham pizzas and a

You're working at the

Yeah! Our maid draft
was this month

00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,583
and the pizza parlor
had a first round pick!

What are you guys doing anyway?
It looks serious.

336
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,666
It's way too much
exposition to explain,

337
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,541
but it's a big
communication mission!

338
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,250
Communication? But I thought
that new tower was causing

339
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,833
total chaos and no
one could use their

340

connected devices anymore.
Aren't those crazy radio waves

341

screwing up your
equipment down here?

342
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,791
Well we're mostly using radio,
which is safe,

343
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,583
plus we're underground
and I installed some extra

344

shielding in the walls too.

Of all the possibilities,
you went with that?

Or maybe instead of an acronym,

375
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,666
the ordering of the letters
is some kind of key?

For a logic puzzle

377

though you kiddos probably
call it aluminum foil.

But each of those suits is like

a giant foil ball,
300 millimeters thick!

Though an average
person wouldn't be able

438
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,166
to move in that, they're all
strong enough to fight!

Sure, we had to eat a
mountain of chicken

440

[gasps]
What? Latu!

466
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,333
Hey Den-Den, long time no see.

467
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,291
I guess the last time was
Professor Yagyuda's

468
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,833
"Brazillian Send Off" Party.

469
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,041
Mind telling me
how you went Buggy?

470
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:08,125
[gasps] I, uh... I'm pretty
sure it was three days ago.

471
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,625
After the tower fiasco,
things got pretty bad for me.

472
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,250
I wandered the
country for years,

473
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,333
then finally ended up here.
I was going to end my life

474
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,875
where my dream
had been shattered.

475
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,250
But then a woman
with a weird hat

476
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,500
appeared out of nowhere
and stopped me.

477
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:26,000
She told me not to die, that my
dreams could still come true.

478
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,458
Then weird-hat-lady reached out
to me, and when I took her hand,

479
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,916
something happened.
It was indescribable.

480
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,625
Next thing I knew, I was
standing on the tower,

481
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,166
attacking the city
with those waves.

482
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,791
Oh god, what's wrong with me?
I did terrible things!

483
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,791
Don't cry. It wasn't your fault.

484
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,958
I'll make some phone
calls to clear your name.

485
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:55,083
So hang in there. You're okay.
Just keep off those ledges.

486
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,375
You never know, Akihabara could
still get its tower one day.

487
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:03,541
[sobbing] Oh, Latu.
Do... you... think... so?

488
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,458
[cries]

489
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,916
[PROFESSOR] Come on, let's have
drinks with tiny umbrellas

490
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,416
and talk about old times. Oh!
I talked to Professor Yagyuda!

491
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,625
It was all dots and dashes,
but he seems well!

492
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,666
[DENKO]
Really?

00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,666
we're broadcasting live from
the pulsing heart of Akiba!

496
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,958
I'm your DJ, Tamotsu Denkigai,

497
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,250
and we've got some
great guests today!

498
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,625
It's the pop idol trio tearing
up the local scene: Mania!

499
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,208
[ALL]
Moi, listeners!

500
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,375
So. I hear you're
on fire, ladies!

501
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,875
Is it true your
digital downloads

502
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,291
have reached triple digits?

503
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,666
[NIWAKA] Yup! Our new
song's called "Match for 3,000!"

504
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,333
And we're just
enjoying the ride!

505
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,666
Wow, that's so fun!

506
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,791
Who said you could make
our base a radio station?

507
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,041
You should be thanking
me for the free publicity!

508
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,250
Do you even know if
anyone's listening to us?

509
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,583
Nope! But our static
reaches Brazil!

510
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,125
And speaking of Brazil,
boy do I like coffee!

511
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,708
Isn't that so interesting?
I think it smells like natto.

512
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,250
Hey speaking of natto,
what do you girls put in yours?

513
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,250
Me, I just go with sugar.
I'm old-school.

514
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,375
[NIWAKA] That's not old-school.
That's not any school.

515
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,750
That's just you!

516
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,666
[TAMOTSU] Great chat,

Five is coming to our show!

520
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,166
[NIWAKA] Don't you have to say
Sneak Fighter, or Street Farter

521
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,625
or something you know,
a fake title?

522
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,958
[TAMOTSU] No I don't!
We actually got clearance!

523
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,500
[NIWAKA] Awesome!
How'd you pull that off?
