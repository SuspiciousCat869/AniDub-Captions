Wow, Niwaka. Where'd you pick up
that fascinating bit of trivia?

156
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,916
Hey, check out Clamas TV!

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,833
It looks like we're not the
only ones talking about this!

158
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:38,333
Breaking news! Another
strange anomaly in Akiba!

159
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,666
Various vigilante groups who've
been keeping the peace in our

160
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,291
beloved neighborhood
have been breaking up

161
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,000
one after another, and it seems
that in every case a girl

162
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,125
who recently
joined the group

163
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,750
was at the center
of the friction!

164
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,708
That's right! Circle crushing!
And it seems to be hitting our

165
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,333
streets like pink petals
in cherry blossom season!

166
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,500
We here at Clamas TV
will continue to

167
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,458
investigate these
troubling incidents!

168
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,166
So stayed tuned for
updates from your

169
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,291
hollerer-with-the-followers!

170
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,125
I don't know if it's fair
to blame the girls,

171
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,041
since boys who don't
have experience can get

172
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,708
crazy-excited by even the
smallest amount of attention.

173
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,708
Maybe the girls are just being
nice and they can't handle it.

174
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,875
[MATOME] But why is it
happening so much at once?

175
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,250
[ALL]
Huh?

176
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,500
[PROFESSOR] This could have
something to do with it.

177
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,958
[ALL]
Hm...

178
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,083
[TAMOTSU]
"Princess Company".

179
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,916
Let's see, "introducing
'Princesses' to your circles."

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,208
Ah, this flyer is definitely
laying it on thick.

181
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,708
"Akiba vigilantes, how about
adding a pretty flower

182
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,291
to your activities?"

183
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:33,708
"For a girl to idolize, contact
the following address." Sheesh.

184
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,041
Okay that is bad.

185
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,208
I feel like I've peered
into the otaku dark side.

186
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,541
That's troubling.

187
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,750
[TAMOTSU] Of course it is.
It's a total creep-fest.

188
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,250
Yeah, but it's more than that.

189
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,166
I'm sure if they tried,
that kind of business

190
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,875
could attract all sorts of
customers from around Tokyo.

191
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,583
Why limit themselves to the
Akiba vigilante groups?

192
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,875
That is, unless they have
something else in mind?

193
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,750
My thought exactly.
Which means--

194
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,541
[TAMOTSU] Which means
we're taking a field trip!

195
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,750
[TAMOTSU] Hey, isn't this where
that butler bar used to be?

196
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,250
I would say that makes it
even more suspicious.

197
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,791
[TAMOTSU]
Let's go!

[ALL] Welcome to the

200
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,916
Thank you for your business.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,791
Now what kind of princess
are you looking for?

202
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,750
The only business we're here for
is putting you out of yours!

203
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,000
[ARISA]
Yeah that's right,

204
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,583
we've already set up our
own harem with Tamotsu,

205
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,083
so we don't need any help
from you girls, but thanks!

206

That is not what
we're talking about!

Now you have my attention.

[IKETERU'S WOMAN sighs, giggles]

211
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,041
Good to meet you.

212
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,208
I am the founder and CEO
of the Princess Company.

213
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,916
The Iketeru Masada!

CEO?

215
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,791
That is some seriously
weird hair!

216
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,083
Moi, good-looking!

217
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,125
A young, handsome,
successful CEO.

218
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,083
Does it get any better
than that, Ma?

219
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,375
I know it's hard, but I'm
gonna need you to focus.

220
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,166
But he must make at least 30
million a year, probably more.

221
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,791
How does that not
make him great?

222
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,416
The hair's
definitely weird, though!

223
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,458
Don't judge a man's
worth by his income!

224
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,875
Judge him by how much of that
income he's willing to spend

225
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,375
on super-cool hobbies!

226
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,708
[ARISA swoons]

227
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,500
If you're done being stupid,
I'd like to move on!

228

This guy is obviously
a Bugged One!

[ARISA, TAMOTSU grunt]

230

Ha! Guess that means
you've figured out

231
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,750
my wickedly brilliant plan.

232
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,875
By using these ladies
to cause mad drama,

233
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,666
I was going to destroy all the
vigilante groups in Akiba,

234
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,500
leaving us free to
do as we please.

But, alas. I wasn't
expecting you to unravel

my scheme so quickly.

237

If the hottie guy seems
too good to be true,

then he probably is!

That's what grandma used
to say, but in Finnish!

Since you came all this way,
I feel I owe you something.

I want you to enjoy the full
Princess Company experience.

00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:03,041
[IKETERU laughs] I suppose it
shouldn't surprise me that they

249
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,791
weren't enough for the
famous Electric Mayonnaise.

250

You've slain quite a few
of my comrades.

to show you my true power.

No!

If I show you what I'm capable

of in simple hand-to-hand
fighting, you'll be obliterated.

Of course, where's the beauty
in that sort of brutish melee?

I choose combat by cards!

we'd go for that?

[NARRATOR] In Akihabara,
holy land of the Otaku,

267
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,208
the brave vigilante groups who
maintain peace in the realm

268
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,583
have been attacked from
within by ruthless,

269
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,708
circle-crushing hot girls.

270
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,500
Weakened by jealousies
and hormones, many groups

271
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,916
have disbanded,
raising the suspicions of

272
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,916
Electric Mayonnaise
and Friends.

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,916
So the gang traced the
growing crisis to its source,

the sinister Princess Company.

They infiltrated the
rent-a-babe lair

and confronted the company's
CEO, the questionably-quaffed

Iketeru Masada, whose
exposure as a Bugged One

278
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,875
surprised no one but Arisa.

Though to be fair, he's rich,
and who doesn't like that?

Now Iketeru has challenged
Tamotsu to combat by cards.

00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,250
to summon as many Groupie Girls
from my deck as I like!

309
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,958
[GROUPIE GIRLS giggle]

310
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,958
[TAMOTSU]
Three copies of the same card?

311
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,750
He's as hardcore as I thought!

312
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:57,083
[MATOME]
Huh? Um...

313
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,625
Sometime today, maybe?

314
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,291
Sorry, I'm just having trouble
deciding what to play next.

315
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,916
It's always hard at the start,
there's so many choices!

316
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,666
What in the world
are we doing here?

317
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,458
What do you mean,
it's obvious, Ma!

318
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,958
Now that he's realized
his destiny

319
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,125
and dedicated his life
to Battle Creatures,

320
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,375
Tamotsu's bound by honor to
accept any player's challenge!

321
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,291
Okay. But it's
three against one,

322
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,791
why can't we just
gang up on him.

323
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,833
And kick the guy's
butt in real life?

324
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,333
How can you say that?

325
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,583
Real life violence should only
be used as a last resort!

326
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,875
Alright I play the magic card,
Otaku Dance Squad!

327
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,208
This lets me Special Summon
up to three Happy Nerds

328
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,375
from my deck for a dance party
and inflict damage to the enemy

329
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,041
player of 300 points
times the number of nerds!

330
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,541
Activating my trap card!

331
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,791
You must now face the
Drinking Party Game!

332
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,416
This forces two target creatures
to do battle with each other,

333
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,041
and get used to it because
the effect lasts five turns!

334
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,375
[TAMOTSU] I activate my
Convention Staff effect

335
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,625
to play Sample
Booklet Inspection!

336
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,625
Reveal all face-down cards in
the opponent's playing field!

337
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,125
I activate "Busts" ability
on Hidden Breasts Girl!

338
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,083
You can do it!
Discover your self esteem!

339
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:07,083
[HIDDEN BREASTS GIRL gasps]
Oh, no!

340
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,291
[IKETERU] During this turn,
Pure Boy type creatures

341
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,708
can only attack
Hidden Breasts Girl!

342
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,208
I activate the Exploitative
Gatcha card from my hand!

343
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,375
While in play, this allows
me to take three cards

344
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,666
every time I draw!

345
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,375
Moi, that's amazing!
What a super-strong card!

346
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,250
Really? It doesn't sound
that super to me.

347
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,916
Trust me, by the
next tournament,

348
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,375
it'll be officially Forbidden!

349
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,291
[IKETERU] Then I play
my Flash Magic card!

350
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:32,125
"But Only If You're Hot!"
Any Promenade type creature

351
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:36,500
or attack party
gains 500 attack!

352
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,958
[HIDDEN BREASTS GIRL gasps]

353
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,666
[HAPPY NERDS grunt]

354
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,916
[TAMOTSU] I disable the effect
that disables the effect,

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,458
that disables the effect!

356
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,000
[IKETERU] And I disable that
effect that disables the effect,

357
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,208
that disables the effect
that disables the effect!

358
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,250
[ARISA gasps] Wowie, this fight
is incredibly intense!

359
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,791
[MATOME] Are we watching
the same thing?

360
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,583
It seems pretty low-key to me.

361
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,750
Open your eyes, Ma! Can't you
see the blood, sweat, and visual

362
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,875
effects between those clashing
souls locked in epic battle?

363
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,208
All you have to do is set
your imagination free!

364
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,458
Just open your mind
and join in the fun!

365
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,250
[MATOME]
Eh, I'd rather complain.

366
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,833
Not so fast!

367
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,500
I activate the second effect on
my "Take Home From Party" Card!

368
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,500
[TAMOTSU]
Oh, no!

369
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,458
[MATOME]
Uh... Wait.

370
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,875
The "second effect" is printed
on the card, right?

371
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,083
And since it's on the table,
Tamotsu could read it any time.

372
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:21,958
[ARISA groans]

373
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,458
So why was he acting shocked?

374
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,875
I mean obviously the guy's gonna
use the effect but Tamotsu

375
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,875
freaked like it was the biggest
surprise in the world.

376
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,291
[ARISA]
Don't question the tropes!

377
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,250
[MATOME] And why did you just
blast off like a rocket?

378
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,291
Hey, can you guys keep it down,
I'm trying to battle over here.

379
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,458
Now it's time for the
real fun to start.

380
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,666
I equip the
Virgin-Killing Clothes!

381
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,000
All Pure Boy type creatures
experience sensory overload

382
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,250
and are instantly sent
to the graveyard!

383
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,500
[HAPPY NERD C] Yes! Yes!
Bow-chicka wow-wow!

384
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,875
This can't be!

385
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,375
Without your nerds, your
playing field is wide open!

386
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,000
So I can launch a direct and
undefended attack against the

387
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,958
enemy player using my
Bright Eyes Hot Guy!

388
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,500
[chuckles]

389
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,416
[TAMOTSU screams]

390
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,958
[groans]

391
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,291
[gasps] No Tamotsu!
Please, don't die!

392
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,500
As long as the enemy
utters that cliché phrase

393
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,000
before the smoke clears,
you'll be all right!

394
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,666
You're finished.

395
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,708
What? But how?

396
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,958
That would have destroyed me,
but when you attacked I

397
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,750
played my "Self-Published Manga
Express Option Printing" card.

398
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,500
Which negates all
attacks during the turn

399
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,208
and sets my life to
one hundred points.

400
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,291
So that cost you four
hundred life points.

401
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,833
Big price to pay for some
extra time, Tamotsu-Boy.

402
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,916
Now what? You only
have a hundred life

403
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,625
and no creatures on the field.

404
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,541
You can't possibly think there's
a way out of this predicament.

405
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,125
Surrender and save yourself
more embarrassment!

406
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,791
Hate to disappoint you,
but there's nothing in my

407
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,875
deck's flavor text that mentions
anything about surrendering!

408
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,833
[IKETERU grunts] It's pointless!
Look at the table!

409
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,041
How can you keep fighting in
the face of absolute despair!

410
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,083
[TAMOTSU chuckles]
That's easy.

411
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,833
Because I... am a
Battle Creatures player!

412
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,416
[IKETERU, ARISA gasp]

413
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,375
[TAMOTSU] True, I don't
have a card in my hand

414
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:08,333
that can save me. And the
odds would say I'm toast...

415
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,041
...but I believe in my deck!

416
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,666
Because this deck and I have
been through it all together!

417
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,583
We've survived battles against
countless worthy foes!

418
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,083
It saved me then,
and it'll save me now!

419
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,458
I'll bet my life on this draw!

420
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,208
Here I go!

421
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,333
[TAMOTSU]
That's it. I can feel it.

422
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,541
[TAMOTSU]
This is the card I need!

423
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,208
From my hand I summon
Silent Unemployed Guy!

424
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,041
You're summoning a creature with
zero attack and zero income?

425
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,041
And how is that
supposed to save you?

426
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,541
Because I'm not finished yet!

427
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,125
I also play the magic card
Thirty-Year Hermit from my hand!

428
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,833
When this card is activated,
all Pure Boy type creatures

429
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,541
on the playing field
are immediately set

430
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,958
to defense mode! And Pure
Boy creatures affected

431
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,500
by this magic
cannot be attacked!

432
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,416
Ha! So you're going to
barricade yourself and defend?

433
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,666
How fitting for a
reclusive otaku!

434
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,833
But there's something
else about Pure Boys.

435
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,125
If they're still virgins at 30,

436
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,791
Then they transform
into wizards!

437
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,125
Wait, really?

438
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,583
When Thirty-Year
Hermit's in play,

439
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,958
it triggers another effect!

440
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,291
Silent Unemployed Guy
is able to evolve!

441
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,541
End the flow of wasted
milky fluids...

442
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,375
...and reach your
true potential!

443
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,750
[TAMOTSU] I Special Summon
the Mighty Mage of Virginity!

444
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,583
Pureness Wizard!

445
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,708
An attack strength of 3,000?

446
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,708
[IKETERU grunts]
Those are impressive moves,

447
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,500
but it's still not enough!

448
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,625
My Bright Eyes is at
twenty-five hundred!

449
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,208
Even if you beat him,
I'll only lose 500!

450
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,791
I'll survive your attack and win
the game on my next turn!

451
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,208
There won't be a next turn!

452
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,625
What now?

453
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,458
[TAMOTSU] When summoned,
Pureness Wizard disables all

454
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,250
effects of all cards
in the field,

455
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,166
and can attack the
enemy player directly!

456
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,000
And no, I'm still not done!

457
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,625
Because while this is in play,
the enemy can't counter!

458
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,791
That means you can't
activate any magic cards,

459
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,541
any traps, or any
