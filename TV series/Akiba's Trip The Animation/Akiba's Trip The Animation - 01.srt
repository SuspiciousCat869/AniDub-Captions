[TAMOTSU] Liver Blue Ranger:
Ultra Fatty Mode!

162
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,791
That's a Super-Limited Edition

163
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,666
only released at one
event last year!

And they never
reissued the thing

165
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,000
because it was so horribly
unpopular at that convention!

166

No, you're supposed
to say "moimoi"!

176
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,083
See, Moi is Finnish for "hello,
but moimoi means "goodbye"!

177

So you must say moimoi
right now because,

I'm sorry, but this is how it
must be. It is my Blue Liver!

The paint job isn't the only
difference with this release.

The mold was changed to get
closer to the original design!

184
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,666
So I'm going to paint it to
match the original colors,

is an experience itself.
