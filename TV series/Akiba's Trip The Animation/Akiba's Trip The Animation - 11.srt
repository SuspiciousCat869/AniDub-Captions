157
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,333
Hey! She was right!
You call me producer

158
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,291
but you're just treating
me like an errand boy!

159
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,916
Why are you mad? That's standard
practice in the idol biz.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,750
Don't you know producer's just
a nice word for man-slave?

161
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:55,208
I know, but an errand
boy can still dream. Huh?

162

[SUIDOBASHI grunts]

163

[TAMOTSU]
Is this about the posters?

164
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,041
'Cause I hung 'em
up real straight.

[SUIDOBASHI]
Order! Order! Let's begin!

172
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,875
The Akiba vigilante court,
presided by the Main Street

173
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,833

in this hall of the Akiba guild!

174
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,208
[ARISA] You have a court?

175
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,458
[MATOME]
Since when?

176
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,041
Hey! This is ridiculous!
What did we do wrong?

177
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,541
You've betrayed the public trust

178
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,625
and the solemn duty
of all vigilantes!

179
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,958
Instead of keeping the peace
in Akiba like you've vowed,

180
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,666
you've created
chaos of your own!

181
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,041
And it's an even greater sin
that you're doing it now,

182
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,416
right before the festival!

183
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,666
Okay slow down,
what chaos did we cause?

184
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,041
Yeah what are you
talking about?

185
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,625
These charges are false!

186
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,125
[SHOHEI] Don't play innocent!
We have all the proof we need!

187
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,458
What proof?

188
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,208
That's enough talk,
you scoundrels!

189
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,833
Just look at this
crime scene footage!

190
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,583
[SUIDOBASHI] This tree
near the Showa Dori exit of

191
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,916
the JR Akihabara station was
brutally slain in the prime of

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,166
its life, with this card jabbed
into its still-warm stump!

193
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,625
[ALL gasp]

194
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,166
[SUIDOBASHI]
Exhibit B!

195
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,625
All the wondrous capsule toys
were stolen from this store!

196
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,583
And on the pile of
empties left behind?

197
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,416
Another card, with a cruelly
sarcastic taunt!

198
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,791
And on it goes! The vile list of
atrocities is so long it would

199
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,375
take days to go
through all of them!

200
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,375
Fan fiction books on sale at
Tora no Ana swapped with blanks,

201
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,875
collectible figurines replaced
with suggestively-molded

202
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,250
devil's tongue, trading cards
from bags of potato chips

203
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,666
callously removed!
And on and on and on!

204
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,250
Anyone could have
written those cards,

205
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,500
so they don't prove anything!

206
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,791
And why would we just
tell everyone it was us?

207
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,333
[SUIDOBASHI] I see. So you want
to go down swinging, do ya?

208
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,750
Okay fine! Then feast your
eyes on the smoking gun!

209
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,000
This crude and talentless
graffiti was scrawled

210
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,750
on the side of the
Myojinzka Bridge!

211
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,750
And a security camera caught
you in the act, you morons!

212
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,500
Oh, come on!

213
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,750
How can you think that's me?

214
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,916
[ARISA] Or me?
I don't look like that!

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,583
It's like a bootleg figurine of
me you'd buy off the street!

216
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,625
When she puts it like that,
she does have a point.

217
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,875
Well I guess the eyes are a
little bit off, aren't they?

218
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,250
Maybe, but so what?
The outfits are the same!

219
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,541
The eyes are hardly the
only difference, guys!

220
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,250
If I looked like that,
I'd never leave the house!

221
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,375
[SUIDOBASHI]
Hm. I guess not, but look!

222
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,625
What about Matome?
She looks exactly the same!

223
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,166
[MATOME]
Huh?

224
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,166
[ARISA] Mm. I'll admit, that
does look like Ma's back side.

225
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,875
But without seeing her face,
we can't know for sure, right?

226
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,083
So you admit it's
possible that's Matome!

227
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,250
[TAMOTSU]
No! There's no way!

228
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,625
Tamotsu.

229
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,083
I can testify right now!
It's impossible that's her!

230
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,958
You expect us to simply take
your word for that, Tamotsu?

231
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,416
Or do you actually
have proof?

232
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,791
Mayo's part of our team and
we do everything together!

233
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,583
We would know if she'd left!

234
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,291
Besides, she's way
too good to do this!

235
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,750
[MATOME gasps]

236
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,500
[SUIDOBASHI grunts]
I'm sorry, but you vouching

237
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,333
for her does not
satisfy this court!

238
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,083
Unless you can present
tangible proof,

239
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,166
we have no choice but
to continue this trial!

240
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,333
[TAMOTSU] Okay, if you want to
keep wearing your little judge

241
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,583
robe that's fine with me,
we'll just catch these fakers

242
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:08,000
and bring 'em back to you.
How does that sound for justice?

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,166
How does that sound for justice?

244
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,500
I must say, that was a
pretty cool line, Tamotsu,

245
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,750
but now what do we do?

246
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,791
[TAMOTSU] Like I said!
We catch those fakers!

247
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,166
Okay. But how do we do that?

248
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,833
Well I haven't gotten to
that part of the plan yet.

249
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,375
What should we do, Professor?

250
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,375
[PROFESSOR gasps]
Uh, let's see.

251
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,500
We should start with what
we know about these posers,

252
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,916
which isn't very much except
they seem to enjoy performing

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,500
acts otaku consider
unspeakably evil as a way

254
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,916
to soil the good name of
Electric Mayonnaise, correct?

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,208
Oh! Why don't we do a
stakeout where we think they'll

256
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,500
strike next, then we can catch
'em in the act and grab 'em,

257
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,625
like they do in the movies!

258
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,541
Yeah. But how do
we figure that out

259
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,750
[NIWAKA] Uh... Good question.
They have been all over the map.

you think, Ma? Any ideas?

For what? Who this girl is?

No I mean where do you
think they'll strike next

263
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,500
to make otaku mad at us?

264
