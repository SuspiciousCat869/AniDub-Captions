You cut that a bit close,
don't you think?

00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,125
Moi! Thanks for
waiting, comrade!


16
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,916
Hey, hold on. Why aren't
Tamotsu and Matome here?


17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,583
We had to divide and conquer.


18
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,750
They're looking for
the final boss!


19
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:17,875
[TAMOTSU]
Hey there.

20
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:21,041
[MASUTO] Oh no.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

21
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,833
Please don't hurt me!

[blows landing]

23
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,833
[MASUTO]
Help!

24
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,833
That wasn't nice.

25
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,875
Okay Masuto Niikura of
Clamas TV, let's talk.

26
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,375
It's time for a special report.

27
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,458
[MASUTO] You don't have to beat
people up for information!

28
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,375
Huh?!

29
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,583
[MASUTO]
No, don't! I'll talk!

30
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,458
I'm sorry, I just got
in way over my head.

31
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,291
If I had any idea those
Metrotica people

32
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,375
were gonna be this crazy,
I never would have helped them!

33
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,250
After the ban, I got
scared and ran away.

34
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,958
I didn't want this to happen!

35
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,166
So our hunch was right,
you were working for them.

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,791
It always was suspicious how
you were the first to show up

37
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,041
at any Buggy attack.

38
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,208
[MASUTO sighs]

39
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,000
At first I didn't think
it was a big deal.

40
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,291
I was a struggling GonTuber with
a hundred-something views.

41
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,833
They said they could
make me popular

42
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,333
by giving me exclusive news,

43
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,250
I just had to report
what they told me!

44
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,458
So all this insanity after
the festival was cancelled.

45
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,875
Metrotica was behind it
every step of the way.

46
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,416
They propped up that minister
and manipulated the government

47
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,125
to pass the Akiba ban!

48
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,416
You've seen what happened next.

49
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,875
They used a special force
to wipe Akiba clean!

50
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,125
They've turned it
into a ghost town

51
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,625
to make it easier to conquer!

52
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:20,833
Then once they
get their claws in,

53
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,166
they'll rebel against
the government

54
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,750
and declare an independent
nation of Bugged Ones!

55
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,541
That's the master plan, drawn up
by the leader of Metrotica,

56
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,375
Fukame Mayonaka!

57
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,250
[MATOME and TAMOTSU gasp]

58
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,916
But that's your name.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,208
[MATOME sighs]
This "Metrotica..."

60
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,958
It's a name for the
Bugged One hit squad

61
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,958
that's used by the Hazoku.

62
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,458
And the squad's leader,

63
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,958
who's also in charge
of the Hazoku clan,

64
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,458
is my grandmother.

65
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,583
[TAMOTSU gasps]

66
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,750
Hold on. Did you say... grandma?

67
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,291
That's a pretty crucial bit of
information to keep from me!

68
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,708
[MATOME]
I know, but I couldn't tell you!

69
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,041
It would've been super awkward!

70
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,250
[TAMOTSU]
That's your excuse?

71
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,750
--So, uh...
--Let's just skip to the point.

72
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,166
You're gonna tell me how to
get into grandma's hideout.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The controllers were just
where he said they'd be.

74
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,041
So these puppies are the key to
unlocking Metrotica's base, huh?

75
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's see if the
instructions on the memo

76
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,458
he gave us work, too.

77
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,291
First, on controller one,

78
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,500
press "up, up, down,
down, then hold right

79
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,666
and press A and B
at the same time."

80
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,708
After that, on controller two,

81
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,958
do a clockwise circle
on the d-pad.

82
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,125
On controller one hit
Select four times,

83
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,583
then on controller two
press and hold A and B,

84
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,250
then hold those buttons plus
Start on controller one,

85
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,458
then d-pad left,
and then d-pad right--

86
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,166
You can help with
this too you know!

87
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,958
Metrotica.

88
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,041
[MATOME, TAMOTSU]
Hm.

89
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,041
Hey, so, I'm curious.

90
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,541
About?

91
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,625
If it's your own grandmother
doing this, do you know why?

92
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,958
[MATOME sighs]

93
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,708
For centuries, the Hazoku
kept the peace in Akiba.

94
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,291
But grandma believes this
place has become tainted

95
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,250
by uncontrolled human
greed and vice.

96
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,250
Wait, that's what
the minister said too.

97
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,375
Sort of, but it's different.

98
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,708
Grandma doesn't care about
morality for morality's sake.

99
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,916
According to her,

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,291
these foul impulses
corrupt the flow of Ki,

101
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,791
which adversely affects
the source of Hazoku power.

102
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:28,000
She says if we don't remove the
corruption, the Hazoku will die.

103
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,625
And for a long time
I believed that, too,

104
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,375
until I left the underground
for the first day in 50 years

105
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,000
and saw Akiba for myself.

106
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,500
Hold on, how old are you?

107
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,625
I'm 78.

108
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,666
Seventy-eight?

109
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,458
That's pretty young
for a Hazoku.

110
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,708
Anyway, from my point of view,

111
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,750
this place wasn't
"tainted" at all.

112
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,583
I was expecting dark streets
crippled by sickness,

113
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,291
but I saw a world teeming
with passion, and life.

114
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,125
A lot of it I didn't understand,

115
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,458
but I was drawn to the
vibrancy of these people,

116
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,916
and the shiny things that
brought them so much joy.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,583
Before I knew it, Grandma's
order to purify this land

118
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,083
flew from my
mind completely,

119
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,875
and I fell in love not with the
ideal she wanted it to be,

120
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,500
but with the Akiba
it already was.

121
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:11,666
That's when I left my clan, and
the underground Hazoku dwelling,

122
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,625
and started fighting
against Grandma's plot

123
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,041
to forcefully reshape Akiba.

124
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,208
Couldn't you talk to her

125
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,041
and help her see the
Akiba that you saw?

126
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,291
I tried many times to convince
her it wasn't actually tainted,

127
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,000
but she wouldn't listen.

128
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,416
Then one day, they moved
the entrance to the lair

129
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,666
without telling me,

130
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,916
and I couldn't meet her
face to face anymore.

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,708
I was completely shut out.

132
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,625
Man. Sucks when family drama
gets complicated like that.

133
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,041
It lacks the
"world in peril" thing,

134
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,666
but my dad doesn't get
what I like, either.

135
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,708
Huh? Two doors...

136
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,041
We should be careful.

137
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,583
One of these must
lead to a trap.

138
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,625
You're right.
It's a huge decision.

139
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,083
Okey-doke!

140
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,875
I guess I might as well
choose this door!

141
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,916
[MATOME gasps]

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,041
Well, we're not dead.

143
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,500
Awesome!

144
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,333
[MATOME] Honestly, I would
have picked the nicer door.

145
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,250
[TAMOTSU]
Yeah, it's a classic trick.

146
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,708
With all the games I've played
I'm kind of a trap master.

147
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,458
Hey. Don't get cocky, pal.

148
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,458
Trust me, we're fine!

149
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,583
[TAMOTSU yells]

150
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,000
You freaking idiot,
what did I just say?!

151
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,916
Sorry, my bad.

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,166
Whoa, this is a rare
Amami Shika Beetle!

[BOTH scream]

154
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,416
[TAMOTSU]
Ooh, what's this do?

155
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,583
[MATOME] Why are you going out
of your way to set off traps?

156
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,333
I like buttons!

157
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,458
Seriously, don't
touch anything else.

158
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,708

You're a strong
young woman, Matome,

220
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,833
but you are much too stubborn.

221
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,000
You used to be such
a nice little girl,

222
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,125
always doing everything
your grandmother asked.

223
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,958
Like me, you wanted
to purify this land.

224
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,958
Remove the corruption that was
slowly poisoning Akihabara.

225
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,000
When our kind
first moved here,

226
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,208
it was a beautiful
place full of good Ki.

227
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,833
And that helped nurture
the source of our power.

228
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:27,041
Life for the Hazoku
was magnificent.

229
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,250
But then we found ourselves
caught in the middle of a

230
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,750
conflict between humans,

231
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,500
and were forced to
escape underground.

232
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,708
Then, Akihabara itself
began to change.

233
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,583
First the land was overwhelmed
by greedy humans peddling

234
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,666
their goods,
followed by those with

235
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,458
strange obsessions and
twisted sexual desires.

236
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,500
If their filthy greed
keeps spreading,

237
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,000
this endless pursuit of objects
to feed their bizarre appetites,

238
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,541
Not only could we lose our
powers, we could be engulfed

239
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,583
by the tainted Ki and
vanish like 70 years ago.

240
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,458
But Grandma, that isn't true.

[KIKUCHI]
For the good of the Hazoku,

242

Why do you refuse to accept
the obvious reality.

that these dirty,

00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,041
the barrier's still intact.

478
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,041
That's okay.

479
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,625
[MATOME gasps]

480
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,958
It's not like we're gonna run
out of fun things to do here!

481
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,916
[MATOME chuckles]
Yeah, you're right.

482
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,500
[TAMOTSU gasps]

483
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,083
It's fine.

484
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,708
'Cause I have you.

485
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,791
[TAMOTSU chuckles]

486
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,333
[BOTH gasp]

487
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,166
[BOTH scream]

488
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,875
[TAMOTSU coughs]

489
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,541
What's going on?

490
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,958
[BOTH gasp]

491
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:11,791
[TAMOTSU]
We've got company.

492
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,583
[MATOME]
A Bugged One?

493
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,583
--Niwaka?
--Arisa?

494
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:19,500
What's with the crazy outfits?
You guys get cast in a new show?

495
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,833
Come with me, big bro,
we have to hurry! Now!

496
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:22,875
[ARISA]
You too, Ma!

497
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,125
[MATOME]
Aaahh!

498
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,375
Can we pause for a second?
What's this about?

499
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:29,583
Short answer: Akiba one hundred
years from now is in trouble!

500
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,125
A hundred years?

501
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,875
Yeah, that's right! And it's
all because of the two of you!

502
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,958
What? This is insane!

503
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,625
[NIWAKA] That's enough talk.
Just get in!

504
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,583
[TAMOTSU] Aw, come on! You've
got to explain a little bit!

505
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:45,041
[NIWAKA] To the Akiba Empire,
one hundred years in the future!

506
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,208
[ARISA]
Moi moi, present!

507
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,916
[MATOME, TAMOTSU scream]

508
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,750
[KAGE]
Akihabara...

509
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:55,833
It is a city of dreams,
that accepts everything.
