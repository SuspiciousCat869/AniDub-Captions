00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,541
[TAMOTSU] Then your
underling can live here, too.

157
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,166
Uh. But it's so small.

158
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,041
So what do I tell mom and dad,
they'll be worried sick!

159
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,291
Tell 'em I got a sweet job,

160
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,666
and a company apartment
is one of the benefits.

161
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,833
Huh... Mom might believe
someone would hire you,

162
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,500
but dad definitely won't.

163
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,208
I demand to have a say in this!

164
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,666
[ARISA] Moi! I love that idea,
it's like summer camp!

165
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,041
I can't wait, yay!

166
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,250
[MATOME]
Hey!

167
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,750
Don't worry, Matome,
we'll make this work.

168
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,041
Look. If we clear out that
space under the stairs,

169
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,291
we can fit one more person.

170
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,791
Well yeah, but--

171
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,916
I know he seems like an idiot,
but he's a harmless idiot.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,458
Besides, he's your underling,

173
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,541
which is kind of like a pet
and thus your responsibility!

174
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,166
[MATOME]
Hm...

175
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,250
[MATOME grunts]

176
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:01,833
Make sense?

177
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,625
[MATOME]
Tamotsu!

178
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,916
[TAMOTSU]
Huh?

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You can live here,
but your work starts today!

180
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,750
What? Seriously?

181
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:08,916
[gasps]

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,541
As a member of my
elite vigilante squad,

183
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,500
you will obey my instructions
at all times! Got that?

184
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,125
If you ever dare disobey
me or I find you useless,

185
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,791
I will kick you out immediately.

186
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,666
Out of the squad
and out of my base!

187
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,916
Can I make a counter-offer?

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,041
[MATOME]
Just say yes.

189
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,583
Fine, yes.

190
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,875
Good, now your first assignment
is to clear out these boxes.

191
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,291
[TAMOTSU sighs]
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,333
[MATOME] Patrol starts tomorrow
morning at seven sharp!

193
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,916
[TAMOTSU] That's insane!
Who wakes up before ten?

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,791
I'm not sure my brother
can survive this.

195
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,208
[ARISA hums]

196
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,833
And why are you here again?

197
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,583
'Cause I'm part of your
vigilante squad, Ma, you silly!

198
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,708
What's Ma?

199
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,583
Me... Ma!

200
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,166
Ma's me? Ah god, I'm starting
to sound like you.

201
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,083
Look, I didn't say
you could join us.

202
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,208
You don't have to say it!

203
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,166
Your actions speak
louder than words!

204
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,208
I saw all those toys
on your shelf!

205
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,291
[MATOME gasps]

206
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,083
[ARISA]
The Rangers you broke yesterday.

207
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,875
You went back to the store,
bought 'em, and then fixed 'em!

208
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,708
That tells me all
I need to know, Ma!

209
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,208
Anyone who cares that much
won't to say moimoi to me,

210
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,750
who just wants to help!

211
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,250
Uh... well. I just felt bad.

212
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,250
For the store owner and
the toys. Um... And uh...

213
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,333
...for you, too.

214
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,000
For me?

215
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,041
[MATOME] I thought you were
a Bugged One. I'm sorry.

216
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,958
Moi!

217
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,416
You're so cute, Ma, I love it!

218
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,375
You like to act icy but you
really care about everyone

219
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,083
and everything! From now on
we should be team mates,

220
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,708
soul mates, and whatever
other kind of mate--

221
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,208
[TAMOTSU]
Okay, I've got it!

222
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,208
[MATOME, ARISA]
Hm?

223
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,583
You've got
what exactly, Tamotsu?

224
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,916
A name for our squad.

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,208
It's the best team name
in team name history!

226
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,875
What? So is that
what you've been

227
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,875
concentrating so
hard on this morning?

228
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,333
[laughs] Actually, it was
this morning and yesterday.

229
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,458
You ready to be amazed?

230
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,541
[MATOME]
What?!

231
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,625
No, that sucks!
It's totally terrible!

232
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,208
It's inspired by your name
and my sweet glowy hair!

233
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,333
We should make some T-shirts!

234
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,625
Bonehead!

235
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,083
[SUIDOBASHI]
Excuse me, citizens.

236
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,000
[TAMOTSU]
Huh? The vigilantes?

237
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,708
Got some questions for ya.

238
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,458
Concerning the string of violent
incidents in Akihabra yesterday.

239
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,666
[KOZAKURA] We have intel
suggesting you were involved

240
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,625
in all of 'em.

241
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,708
[MATOME grunts]

242
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,333
And you hoodlums seem
to be organized.

243
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,250
Are you a vigilante group, too?

244
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,333
If so?

245
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,500
[TAMOTSU]
Yeah that's right! We are!

246
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,958
And you should learn
our team name

247
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,583
'cause we're gonna
be famous soon.

248
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:23,791
Presenting... The defenders
of Akiba: Electric Mayonnaise!

249
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,916
But,wait. You only used you and
her for the name, what about me?

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,916
[TAMOTSU gasps] Oh yeah, that is
kind of a jerk move, huh?

251
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,166
Okay, how about "Electric
Mayonnaise and Friends,"

252
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,250
is that better?

253
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,750
Oh, definitely.
It's perfect, thanks!

254
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,291
I told you I hated that,
didn't I?

255
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,291
No one's gonna fear us if we're
called "Electric Mayonnaise"!

256
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,333
Look. We don't care if you call
yourselves Electric Mayonnaise

257
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,875
or Peppy Ponzu Sauce,

258
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,791
we just want to know if you
caused that trouble yesterday!

259
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,083
That's right.

260
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,541
we don't like people
making messes on our turf!

261
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,666
[MATOME] What does
that mean? Your turf?

262
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,083
[HIJIRI] What do you
mean what do we mean?

263
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,708
Turf is one of the great
unspokes rules of vigilantism!

264
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,458
You're ridiculous. Let's go!

265
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,541
We're leaving 'cause
we're bored, not scared!

266
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,458
You better respect Electric
Mayonnaise and Friends!

267
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,166
We're not done talking!

268
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,208
[gasps]

269
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,708
[ARISA]
It's been swell meeting you!

270
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,958
I respect any group who wears
matching outfits! Moimoi!

271
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:15,666
Don't be mad, okay.
Moimoi, moimoi! Moimoi!

272
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,750
Hey, get back here! Uh. Captain?

273
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,875
Oh my god. She's so cute!

274
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:21,875
[KOZAKURA]
Eh?

275
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,166
[SUIDOBASHI]
Electric Mayonnaise.

276
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,125
We'll definitely
keep an eye on them.

277
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,250
Welcome home, master,
we're pleased to serve you!

278
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,625
Paradise is right this way!

279
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,583
These Bugged Ones.

280
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,000
What exactly are they trying
to achieve here, anyway?

281
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,916
'Cause all they've seemed to do
so far is light up the internet.

282
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,833
The online news is calling
our fight yesterday

283
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,125
"Cosplayers Gone Wild!"

284
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,541
The Kurobugs are used
to create armies.

285
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,583
So I'm sure the end game
is taking over Akiba.

286
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,375
My question is who's
running the show.

287
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,500
[METROTICA BOSS]
Humankind will kneel

288
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,375
at our adorably stockinged feet!

289
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,833
[MATOME] It could be
that Metrotica group,

290
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,000
or they may just be one faction.

291
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,541
Look. No offense, but how are
we supposed to fight a war

292
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,750
when we aren't even sure
who their real leaders are?

293
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't know. I'm doing what I
can to save this place, alright?

294
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,291
And why wouldn't you?

295
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,041
Akiba's full of
"splendid somethings,"

296
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,041
like they say in that
old radio jingle!

297
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,083
I would do anything
to defend it, too!

298
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,916
Hell yeah there's
"splendid somethings".

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
That's why I love this place!

300
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,583
I'm here in the Mecca of Otaku
but you make me patrol all day!

301
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,333
When am I supposed to shop?

302
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,333
Oh, boo-hoo!

303
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,541
[TAMOTSU]
Wait, I just realized.

304
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,916
Fighting off evil is
an unpaid job, right?

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,625
How do I support myself and
my shopping addiction?

306
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,750
Well, the research institute
where the Professor works

307
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,208
does give us a stipend to
help fund our operation.

308
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,708
But, to be honest,

309
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,750
it's barely enough money to

[TAMOTSU gasps] Then what
am I supposed to live on?

Whoa, so you're a big deal, huh?

330
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,916
[MOMO] Anyway, Master. If you're
looking for a job in Akiba,

I know of a great place
you can go for help!

Welcome to the no charge,

You're the cute, desperate guy
looking for a job, right?

337
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,458
That's me. I'd like something
with no experience required

338
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,916
that's easy and
pays a butt-load!

good to be true. Like this!

Whoa! Eighteen hundred?!

Look again,
that's the "max" pay.

Yeah, you probably wouldn't
make anywhere near that.

343
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,041
Well, that's why it's my
policy not to protect you

from getting screwed. But on
the plus side, I am free!

around that business address.

What is that?

348
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,291
It's a Bugged One sensor
the Professor built for me.

349
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,791
It's mostly useless, though,

'cause it only works when
they reveal their true nature.
