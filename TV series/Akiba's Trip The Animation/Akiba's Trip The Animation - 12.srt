you back, Lady Arisa.

157
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,541
What's Shangrila Trophy?

158
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,000
It's an American conglomerate,
one of the biggest.

159
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,375
Their CEO Mr. Diamond's known
as a god of the business world.

160
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,583
Everything he does,
even plucking his nose hair,

161
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,041
affects stock prices.

162
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,166
Okay, so what's he
want with Arisa?

163
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,208
Well guys. It's kind
of a long story again.

164
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,458
I met Mr. Diamond
during my time in America.

165
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,166
After finishing my MBA,

166
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,708
I went on a road trip while
I was waiting to graduate.

167
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,916
I travelled by horse,
'cause why wouldn't I?

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,375
One thing led to another,

169
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,458
and I wound up at a party
for finance-industry types,

170
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,416
as you do, and caught
Mr. Diamond's eye

171
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,208
with my boiled beetles
with avocados.

172
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,083
At first he hired me to be a
plastic-model-building tutor

173
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,750
to his emotionally-unstable
grandson, Turquoise.

174
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,916
But before I knew it,
I'd climbed the executive ranks

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
all the way to
first vice president.

176
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,416
None of these story points
connect in any logical way!

177
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,000
Our boss speaks
highly of her.

178
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,375
He most often compliments her
abilities and business acumen.

179
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,458
He's always said she would
be the best candidate

180
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,666
to take the reigns
as the next CEO.

181
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,083
He's joking, right?

182
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,708
But moi! I told him I
wouldn't be ready to do that

183
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,500
until I'm at least twenty!

184
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,833
We wrote you about the illness,

185
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,375
but it's hard to convey
tone in emails.

186
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,125
It's worse than those
smiley emojis suggested!

[gasps]

188
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,375
Since the board can't agree on
who would fill the position,

189
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,083
Shangrila Trophy is in chaos!

190
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,916
The very future of our company
and the entire American economy,

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,666
no, the global economy,
is on the razor's edge!

192
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,166
I'm not just begging you to
save our business, Lady Arisa!

193
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,125
I'm begging you
to save the world!

Please come back! Please!

195
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,083
I owe Mr. Diamond a debt,

196
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,041
which would take
even longer to explain.

197
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,000
But the point is,
if this illness is serious,

198
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,541
then I have to go help.

199

Don't you worry. I'm gonna
crush those Buggy--

I've got the Professor.

201
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,958
And I fought them for
a long time on my own.

00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:53,916
Okay... Then I guess
this really is moi moi.

But nothing's ever meant
more to me than Akiba!

209
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,541
The streets are so dead
it's almost apocalyptic.

there's no reason to come.

Then one law shuts
the whole place down.

We were trying to protect Akiba,
this neighborhood we love.

to get rid of me, Mayo?

We've formed a resistance
against the Akiba ban!

236

We've got the other vigilante

to our next story.

The Akiba ban has so far been
met with mixed reactions.

278

Today, a panel discussion was
held with community leaders

These self-described
"citizen activists"

proclaimed they could
not accept the law,

which they said had not been
properly justified or explained.

Minister Kiyoi herself,

citizens' understanding,
