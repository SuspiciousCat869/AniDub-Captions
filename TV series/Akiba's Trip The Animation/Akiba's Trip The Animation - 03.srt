Welcome! To the no-charge,
no-responsibility agency!

157
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,291
How can I help you in a
non-accountable way?

158
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,000
Hey there. I hate to say this,
but I need a new job.

159
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,500
[MASHIRO] Oh, you've come
in before, haven't you?

160
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,416
What sort of work are
you looking for now?

161
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,083
Something that pays
well and fast.

162
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,500
I don't care what it is,
I can't afford to be picky.

163
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,125
Wait a minute.

164
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,916
Did I just hear you say you'll
do anything for money?

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,750
Sort of. But it sounds
worse when you say it.

166
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,083
[chuckles] If you're that
desperate for cash,

167
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,916
then I've got some
perfect jobs for you!

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,250
[MATOME]
First the idol obsession,

169
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,625
and now he's at work?
It's ridiculous.

170
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,291
Is he ever gonna take
Electric Mayonnaise seriously?

171
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,583
That's his way. Tamotsu has
a habit of fixating on things,

172
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,916
and when he does,

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,333
it's like the rest of the
world stops existing.

174
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,833
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,833
I feel bad making you cover
for your brother like this.

176
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,750
Oh. It's cool, I've done
it for most my life.

177
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,083
[ARISA]
Well I know it's a problem,

178
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,583
but I can see how he'd get
carried away with idols.

179
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,791
[MATOME, NIKAWA]
Huh?

180
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,541
Idols are so dreamy!
Everybody adores them!

181
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,958
In fact it's my secret fantasy
for somebody on the street

182
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,583
to come up and
say "Moi, excuse me,

183
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,583
how would you like to
be an idol yourself?"

184
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,583
[CHIBUSA] Excuse me, girls.
Can we talk?

185
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,916
Yes, like that! When they
discover me they're gonna say

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,416
something just like that. Huh?

187
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
[CHIBUSA] I've been looking
for a trio like you.

188
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,666
How would you like to be idols?

189
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,666
[ALL gasp]

190
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,375
[ARISA gasping]

191
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,208
[NIWAKA]
Chibusa Benikage?

192
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,416
[MATOME]
Who is she?

193
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,000
Moi, are you kidding?

194
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,958
She's a famous former idol!
She dominated the scene

195
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,041
with her performances
and smoking hot bod!

196
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,541
Then turned the
industry on its head

197
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,083
with her auto-bio-graphical
play, "Why Don't They Pay".

198
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,166
exposing the shadowy secrets of
the idol-industrial complex!

199
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,458
Now she's a super
hyper media producer!

200
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,958
I'm flattered you know so
much about me, my dear.

201
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:35,375
Hi! I'm Nice Muramura!
Totally classy photographer!

202
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,291
I'll get to the point.
Beneath your rough,

203
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,333
un-exfoliated exteriors,
I see the glimmer of jewels.

204
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,791
You could be the best
trio in all of idol-dom!

205
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,333
[ALL shout]

206
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,208
So what do you say, ladies,
are you ready?

207
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,875
Will you climb on my pop
train and ride to the top?

208
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,916
This is so sudden,
I don't know what to say.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,541
It's nice you see
something in us,

210
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,583
but I'm in the middle of
a very important mission.

211
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,541
I hardly have time to
be dancing around--

212
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,875
Hells kylla!
Sorry, kylla is Finnish for yes.

213
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,000
I was saying hells yes.
Of course we want to be stars!

214
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,458
Perfect, then it's settled.

215
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,250
[MATOME, NIWAKA grunt]

216
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,833
Kylla!

217
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,500
[CHIBUSA]
"Ma" for Matome!

218
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,791
"Ni!" for Niwaka!

219
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,291
And "A" for Arisa!

220
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,750
From now on, you three will
be known as the next big,

221
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,958
pop-trio craze: Mania!

222
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,958
Great bodies are
essential for idols.

223
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,291
You may be in good shape,

224
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,125
but how about your
jiggling stamina?

225
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,833
[NIWAKA pants]

226

[NIWAKA, ARISA panting]

228
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,583
And now for the all-important
handshake training!

229
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,916
[ARISA]
Moi! Thanks for coming! Moi!

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,625
Oh thank you, you're so sweet!

231
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,916
No! I've never been
told that before!

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,875
[ALL giggle]

233
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,458
Aw! You're such a unique--

234
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,750
[CHIBUSA] Keep smiling! If you
frown you're as good as dead!

235
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,041
[TAMOTSU]
Hm.

236
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,666
Hey. What does this have to
do with our idol training?

237
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,833
These days they make videos
of all the pop stars climbing.

238
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,791
I have no idea why.

239
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,791
[TAMOTSU] Delivery! Thanks for
ordering the heavy stuff.

240
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,291
[ALL giggle]
Huh?

241
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,875
--[NIWAKA, MATOME shout]
--[ARISA] Silly boys!

242
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,083
[NICE] Yeah, bonus points
for the chocolate!

243
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,458
[NICE]
Yeah, work that mouth!

244
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,208
[NICE] Uh... A little
less teeth next time.

245
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,458
Uh, sir? I'm not complaining
but what is this for, again?

246
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,291
[NICE] For your
image video. That's all.

247
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,625
Sort of like a press kit, girls.

248
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,625
Trust me.

249
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,125
[MASHIRO]
What?

250
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,916
You did all that work and
you're still back for more?

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,958
That's right!

252
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,708
It's high-interest-rate
motivation!

253
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,916
I do have another cleaning
job at a location you

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,416
may have seen before.

255
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,041
[TAMOTSU gasps] Whoa, is that
place what I think it is?

256
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,666
Maybe while you're
cleaning the floor,

257
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,333
you'll get to see a
little something extra,

258
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,583
we'll just call it
a "business perk."

259
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,625
I like the way you think.

260
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:34,416
Moi! So many swimsuits,
how's a girl to decide?

261
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,958
I'll have to sit out for this.

262
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,083
Wait, what do you mean
you're gonna sit out?

263
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,750
You can't come this far
just to give it all up now!

264
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,541
I don't really have a choice.

265
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,916
Oh, of course!

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,791
Mayo will die if she reveals
too much skin, remember?

267
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,416
Oh yeah. I guess that
is a problem, huh?

268
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,250
Yeah. It's heartbreaking.

269
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,416
Obviously I'd love to do it
otherwise, it sounds so great.

270
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,750
[ARISA]
Wait, I know!

271
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,500
You don't have to give up
on your dream just yet!

Now we're talking, ladies!

276
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's start filming.
Who wants to go first?

277
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,708
I can. But, what's up
with those guys?

278
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,750
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling here.

Oh. Don't worry
about them, they're fine

280

They're what we call
the Shower Squad!

281
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,625
What's a... Shower Squad?

[SHOWER SQUAD] Shower time!
Not-strange-at-all shower time!

Oh! That feels so good!

Give me a smile, sweetie.

287
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,708
You're at a pool,
not the dentist.

288
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,083
There we go, close enough.

289
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh yeah, hot-diggity-dog!

290
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:58,041
Hey! Speaking of dogs,
let's try on all fours, okay?

291
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,291
[ARISA]
Like this?

292
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:03,291
[NICE howls] Nice!
Now let's try a ball shot!

293
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,583
[ARISA]
This good?

294
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,750
[NICE]
Better than good!

295
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,916
That's an "Oh yeah,"
with a very big "O"!

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,666
Now the bed!

297

[ARISA]
How's this?

298
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,041
[NICE]
I'm getting excited!

299
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,500
By the quality of this strictly
professional footage, I mean.

300
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,708
All right. You're doing
such a great job,

301
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,375
now let's take
off that top, huh?

302

[ARISA]
Yeah! Okay!

00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:21,958
Let's see here

304
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,833
Hey! Stop it!
That is not acceptable!

305
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,125
Look, maybe you're
not a genius,

306
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,208
but you should still
know better than that!

307
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,708
Oh yeah, you're right.

308
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,666
