GO!

00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,083
- (engines revving)

17
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,875
- THAT DID NOT JUST HAPPEN.

18
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,666
- WE ALREADY KNEW
WHAT A BADASS THIS GUY WAS

19
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,375
BEFORE WE WENT INTO THIS RACE.

20
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:41,500
BUT, SINCE THIS IS
GONNA BE MY LAST ONE,

21
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,875
WE ARE NOT GONNA WALK AWAY
WONDERING IF WE REALLY GAVE IT

22
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,250
EVERYTHING WE HAD!

23
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,750
WHAT IS IT?
YOU SCARED?

24
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,666
YOU'RE FREAKIN' USELESS!
I SWEAR!

25
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,416
NOTHING BUT A SACK
OF DEAD WEIGHT RIDING SHOTGUN!

26
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,000
- HUH? DEAD WEIGHT?

27
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,875
- YOU HEARD ME! YOU'RE SCREWING
UP THE POWER TO WEIGHT RATIO!

28
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,750
- SHE TURNS INTO A REAL HARDASS
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

29
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:04,916
I'M NOT DEAD WEIGHT YOU BITCH!
I'M I'M HOT! I'M NOT FAT!

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,250
I GOT A KILLER BODY!

31
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,791
- FORTY-NINE KILOGRAMS
OF EXTRA WEIGHT.

32
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,625
- I WEIGH FORTY-SEVEN DAMMIT!

33
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,625
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE HERE
WITH SELF RESPECT.

34
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,666
READY FOR THIS MAKO. TIME TO
PUT OUR LIVES ON THE LINE.

35
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,583
- WELL, WELCOME BACK
TO THE PARTY.

36
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,375
- LISTEN, ON THIS NEXT ONE,

37
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,458
ENTER THE TURN SO THAT YOU
ALMOST SCRAPE THE INSIDE WALL.

38
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,291
- OKAY. I'M ALL OVER IT.

39
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,416
- THANKS. I HAD
A REAL NICE TIME TONIGHT.

40
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,625
- SO DID I.

41
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,541
NATSUKI?

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,625
WHEN WILL I BE ABLE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN?

43
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,000
- IT'S HARD TO SAY.
SCHOOL'S STARTING UP SOON.

44
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,625
- THAT GIRL.

45
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,541
- ( tires screeching)

46
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,583
- Sayuki: THE NEXT CORNER
LOOKS PRETTY DUSTY.

47
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,333
I WANT YOU HUGGING THE INSIDE.

48
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,958
- I'M ON IT.

49
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,166
- NO CARS COMIN' AT YOU.
START THE DRIFT NOW.

50
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,375
- I HAVEN'T BEEN MYSELF
IN THIS RACE SO FAR.

51
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,625
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING
TOO MUCH ON HIM.

52
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,333
I GUESS DEEP DOWN I DIDN'T
THINK THERE WAS ANY RACER

53
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,083
WHO COULD FOLLOW US
SO TIGHT.

54
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,125
THAT THERE WAS NO ONE THAT GOOD.

55
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,291
BUT NOW I SEE THE TRUTH.

56
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,416
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO RACE
AT THE TOP OF MY GAME

57
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,125
IF MY ATTENTION IS HONED IN
ON WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND ME.

58
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,583
SO I'M NEVER LOOKING
IN THAT REARVIEW AGAIN.

59
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,625
- YOU'RE GONNA WANNA DRIFT HERE!

60
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,250
- (tires screeching)

61
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,000
- THERE CAN'T BE TOO MANY
MORE CORNERS TO HIT.

62
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,083
- Kenji: YEAH. I WONDER
IF HE'S STILL CHASIN'?

63
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,250
IF HE IS, HE'S PROB'LY HANGIN'
ON BY A THREAD AT THIS POINT.

64
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,750
TO TELL THE TRUTH, I FIGURED
THIS THING'D BE OVER BY NOW.

65
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,041
- CALM DOWN! HE'LL DO IT! 

66
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,708
EVEN IF HE CAN'T PASS
HER ON THIS RUN,

67
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,000
HE'LL BEAT HER ON THE NEXT ONE.

68
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,666
- NO WAY HE'S GONNA PASS 'ER.

69
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,916
IN FACT, I'M AMAZED THERE'S
STILL A RACE GOING ON AT ALL.

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,125
HE JUST HAD TO BE THE CAT.
THAT'S HIM.

71
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,041
NEW COURSE, SO TOSS OUT
THE ASS KICKER ATTITUDE.

72
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,125
- (engine revvs)

73
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,083
- IT'S WORKING!
YOU FIXED IT! WOW!

74
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:39,166
THANKS AGAIN. I'M MAKO SATO.
CALL ME SOMETIME!

75
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,458
- SORRY 'BOUT THAT, I JUST.

76
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,625
- I WANT MY LAST
RACE TO BE SPECIAL,

77
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,958
SOMETHING
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

78
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,458
I WANNA RACE THE EIGHT-SIX
HERE ON MY HOME TURF.

79
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,583
THAT'S MY FINAL WISH AS A RACER.

80
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,916
IF YOU HELP ME I'LL EVEN
GIVE YOU MY VIRGINITY.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,500
IF THAT'S WHAT IT'LL TAKE. THEN
THAT'S WHAT I'M WILLING TO DO.

82
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,416
- Kenji: YO, IKETANI!

83
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,000
- YEAH, WHAT?

84
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,166
- GEEZ, MAN. BRING IT ON
BACK DOWN TO EARTH.

85
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,583
YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT MAKO,
WEREN'T YA?

86
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,000
YOU ARE SO FREAKIN' OBVIOUS.

87
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,125
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

88
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,166
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

89
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,750
- NO POINT IN HIDING THAT
KINDA STUFF FROM YOUR BUDS.

90
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,416
I MEAN, I'LL BE REAL
WITH YA FOR ONCE.

91
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,458
I THINK SHE'S
A PRETTY SWEET CHICK.

92
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,958
- YOU DO?

93
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,958
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
THE DETAILS OF YOU GUYS.

94
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,333
BUT I'M THINKIN'
AFTER THIS RACE,

95
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,750
MAYBE YOU OUGHTA GIVE IT
THE OL' COLLEGE TRY.

96
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,291
YOU'D BE A GRADE A MORON TO LET
THAT SUPER HOTTIE SLIP AWAY.

97
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,958
- DUDE, I DON'T CARE.

98
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,500
- HUH?

00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,083
- COOL! I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT!

119
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,041
- CHECK THEIR DOWNHILL TECHNIQUE
WHEN WE SEE 'EM.

120
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,708
THAT'LL SHOW YOU
HOW GOOD THEY ARE.

123
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,500
- CALLED IT.

124
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:33,708
- SAYUKI CAN TIME ONCOMING
TRAFFIC PERFECTLY. IT'S A GIFT.

125
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,500
NOBODY ALIVE IS BETTER AT IT.

126
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,541
SHE ALWAYS CATCHES
THOSE DISTANT HEADLIGHTS

127
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,458
PEEKING THROUGH THE
TREE BRANCHES.

128
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,500
- EASE YOUR GRIP. AND YOU'LL
NEED TO STAY TO THE INSIDE!

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,333
NICE, MAKO. YOU'RE TOTALLY
NAILING THIS RUN.

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,291
YOU GONNA WANNA DRIFT
RIGHT THROUGH THIS ONE.

131
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,125
NO CARS AHEAD.
PULL ANOTHER DRIFT.

132
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:44,083
AMAZING. MAYBE TOO AMAZING.

133
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,416
THE BEST RACERS ALWAYS
LEAVE ROOM FOR ERROR

134
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,708
CUZ THEY KNOW THEY
CAN'T SEE EVERYTHING.

135
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,541
SO EVEN WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE EXCEEDING THEIR LIMITS,

136
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,916
THEY'RE STILL ONLY USING
FULL GRIP WHEN EXITING A TURN.

137
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,416
THEY EASE UP ON THE GRIP
WHEN BRAKING INTO ONE.

138
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,083
IT'S ONE THING TO BE FAST, BUT
SOMETHING ELSE TO BE RECKLESS.

139
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,208
ONE MISTAKE ON AN UNFORGIVING
COURSE LIKE THIS ONE

140
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,458
AND YOU'RE LUCKY
IF YOU WALK AWAY ALIVE.

141
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,250
BUT THE THING IS,
THE WAY SHE'S DRIVING,

142
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,291
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT
MARGIN OF ERROR.

143
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,958
AND SHE'S TOO FOCUSED
TO REALIZE IT.

144
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,625
SHOULD I BRING THIS UP TO HER
NOW? OR DO I JUST LET IT GO?

145
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,708
I MEAN, IT IS MY JOB
TO CLUE HER INTO THESE THINGS.

146
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,541
I DON'T KNOW!

147
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,500
THIS SUCKS. I DON'T
WANNA SAY ANYTHING

148
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,958
THAT'S GONNA THROW
HER OFF HER GAME.

149
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,000
SO FAR SHE'S PERFECT.

150
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,583
THERE'S ONLY ONE CALL
I CAN MAKE.

151
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,208
WE'RE THE BEST TEAM
OUT THERE.

152
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,250
HOW COULD I NOT BELIEVE
IN HER ABILITIES?

153
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:08,250
THIS IS EASILY THE BEST RACE
SHE'S EVER RUN. NO DOUBT.

154
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,708
- AH, MAN. THIS RACE IS GETTING
CRAZIER BY THE SECOND!

155
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,958
SHE'S SPED UP AGAIN.

156
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,375
IF SHE PUSHES IT ANY
FASTER THAN THIS,

157
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,458
I'LL BE SAILIN' PAST MY LIMIT.

158
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,541
HELL, I'M BARELY IN CONTROL
OF THIS SITUATION ALREADY,

159
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,000
ABUSING ALL FOUR OF MY TIRES.

160
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,625
I MAY NOT EVEN MAKE IT
TO THE END OF THIS THING.

161
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,708
- INITIAL D!

162
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,458
- INITIAL D!

163
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,333
- GO TIME. THIS IS THE
LAST CHANCE WE'LL HAVE

164
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,750
TO SHAKE THIS GUY OFF OUR TAIL.

165
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,416
- I KNOW THAT!

166
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,291
- NO CARS AT ALL.
KNOCK THIS SUCKER OUT!

167
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,458
HE'S NOT FOLLOWING US ANYMORE.
WHY NOT?

168
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,375
- MAKO, WOULD YOU CHILL OUT!
YOU'RE GOIN' IN WAY TOO SHARP!

169
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:14,500
DAMN! WE CAN'T PULL OUT!
IF YOU CAN, SPIN AWAY FROM HIM!

170
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,166
OH, NO! DON'T HIT US, PLEASE!

171
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
- OH, YES, WE'RE ALIVE.

172
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,000
- THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

173
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,416
HE JUST BEAT US
ON THE FIRST RUN.

174
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,125
THIS GUY'S SO SKILLED
THAT I WANNA HATE

175
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,583
EVERY SINGLE
THING ABOUT HIM.

176
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,083
YOU DOIN' OKAY?

177
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:29,958
- WELL, WE LOST, BUT SOMEHOW
I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT.

178
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,500
IT TOOK ME BACK A BIT.

179
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,458
BACK TO THE TIME
WHEN I FIRST STARTED RACING

180
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,125
AND THIS WAS STILL
SO FOREIGN TO ME.

181
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,375
WE'D STAY UP UNTIL DAWN

182
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,125
PRACTICING ALMOST EVERY
DAY OF THE WEEK.

183
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,416
THERE WAS SOMETHING SO PURE
ABOUT THAT, SOMETHING WE LOST.

184
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,250
- I THINK YOU TOOK IT TOO FAR
AT THE END THERE,

185
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,041
BUT YOU WERE KICKING
SOME ASS UP TO THAT POINT.

186
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,083
IT REALLY WAS THE BEST
RACE YOU EVER RAN.

187
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,750
- YOU THINK SO?

188
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,416
- WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO
WITH YOUR LIFE FROM NOW ON,

189
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,916
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE MY BLESSING.

190
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,458
YOU'VE EARNED IT.

191
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,083
- THAT MEANS A LOT. THANK YOU.

192
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,083
- DON'T START CRYING
LIKE A GIRL ON ME, MAKO.

193
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,125
LET'S JUST TRY TO
ENJOY OUR MOMENT

194
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,833
BEFORE THE BOYS START THEIR
VICTORY DANCE.

195
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,041
- (tires screeching)

196
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,000
- HEY, THEY'RE BACK!

197
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,375
I WONDER HOW THE RACE ENDED UP.
THE GIRLS ARE IN FRONT.

198
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,625
YOU THINK THEY'LL BE GOIN'
FOR ANOTHER RUN?

199
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,625
- YEAH.

200
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,000
- Itsuku: TAKUMI!

201
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,333
- HOW'D IT GO?

202
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,583
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA.

203
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:20,458
WE'RE NOT GONNA NEED TO PREP YOU
UP FOR A SECOND DOWNHILL ARE WE?

204
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,541
- THERE WON'T BE ANOTHER RACE.
IT'S ALL OVER, BOYS.

205
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,041
- I KNEW IT.

206
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,625
- I REALLY THOUGHT
HE COULD PULL IT OFF.

207
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,250
- MAN. THIS SUCKS.

208
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,583
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM
LOSE LIKE THIS.

209
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,125
IT'S JUST TOO TRAGIC.

210
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,458
- (chuckles) CHIN UP YOU GUYS.
WE LOST.

211
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,333
- WAIT. WHAT DID YOU SAY?

212
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,750
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN'.
YOU LOST?

213
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,291
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

214
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,750
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE A TOTAL JERK

215
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,958
AND MAKE ME REPEAT
MYSELF ARE YOU?

216
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,958
YOU'RE BUDDY HERE'S THE WINNER.

217
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,625
- (all exclaim)

218
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,291
- (cheers)

219
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,375
- NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS DID I
THINK WE'D LOSE ON OUR OWN TURF.

220
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,250
- ALL I DID WAS FOLLOW YOU AND I
DIDN'T EVEN DO A VERY GOOD JOB

221
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,833
AT THAT UP UNTIL THE VERY END.

222
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,333
I WOULDN'T REALLY
CALL THAT A VICTORY.

223
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,625
YOU WON'T SEE ME
BRAGGING ABOUT IT, ANYWAY.

224
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,250
- DON'T BE SO MODEST, KID.
YOU WON FAIR AND SQUARE.

225
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,916
AND WITH THE SKILLS
YOU SHOWED OUT THERE,

226
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,041
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO RUB IT IN IFYOU WANT TO.

227
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,958
- NO THANKS.

228
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,333
- WE'VE PUT IN MORE HOURS UP
HERE THAN ANYBODY ELSE WE KNOW.

229
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,625
WERE CONFIDENT
OF A VICTORY TONIGHT.

230
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:46,041
THEN YOU CHOSE TO CHASE US,
WHICH THREW US FOR A LOOP,

231
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,666
AND WE COULDN'T SHAKE YOU OFF.

232
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,208
WE ACCEPT OUR DEFEAT.
DON'T WE?

233
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,708
- MM-HMM.

234
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,250
- AH, MAKO.

235
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,583
- THAT WAS THE BEST RACE
I'VE EVER BEEN IN BY A MILE.

236
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,208
SO THANK YOU.

237
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,708
( giggles )

238
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,750
- CAREFUL, GIRLS ARE DELICATE.

239
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,166
- (all laughing)

240
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,375
- YOU'RE A MYSTERY TO ME,
YOU KNOW THAT?

241
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,458
YOUR NATURAL RACING
ABILITY IS GREATER

242
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,833
THAN ANYBODY'S I'VE EVER SEEN.

243
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,416
BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT YOU SEEM
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER KID.

244
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,375
- THAT'S WHAT WE ALWAYS SAY
ABOUT HIM.

245
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,375
WHEN HE'S NOT BEHIND
THE WHEEL RACING,

246
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,333
I SWEAR WE CAN'T TELL IF
THE GUYS ASLEEP OR AWAKE

247
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,166
OR THE LIVING DEAD.

248
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,958
- HEY. THANKS A LOT, MAN.

249
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,833
- Kenji: SHUT UP,
YOU KNOW HE'S RIGHT.

250
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,875
- EITHER WAY. I'M STILL AMAZED
AT HOW GOOD YOU ARE

251
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,000
CONSIDERING YOU'RE SO YOUNG.

252
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,416
- Kenji: I'M THINKIN'
AFTER THIS RACE,

253
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,375
MAYBE YOU OUGHTA GIVE IT THE
OL' COLLEGE TRY.

254
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:57,958
YOU'D BE A GRADE A MORON TO LET
THAT SUPER HOTTIE SLIP AWAY.

255
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,333
- Mako: IKETANI.

256
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,166
UH. THANK YOU, FOR TONIGHT.

257
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:13,458
MAKO, I... I... JUST UH...

258
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,125
- QUIT BEING SUCH A DEPRESSED
LOSER, IKETANI!

259
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,458
RACERS DON'T NEED CHICKS MAN!
ISN'T THAT RIGHT!

260
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,625
- NO. NO, WE DON'T.

261
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,208
- I DIDN'T NOTICE THIS BEFORE,

262
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,958
BUT THAT GUY'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY FREAKIN' CUTE.

263
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,083
SO. YOU GONNA TELL ME
YOUR NAME OR DO I HAVE TO GUESS?

264
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,958
- I'M TAKUMI FUJIWARA.

265
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,541
- I'M ITSUKI TAKEUCHI.
I'M EIGHTEEN! I'M AN AIRES.

266
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,000
MY BLOOD TYPE IS O,
AND MY FAVORITE CAR IS...

267
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,541
- UH, YEAH. I DON'T THINK
I ASKED YOU, SO JUST LET IT GO.

268
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,833
- (laughs wildly)

269
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,041
- ANYWAY, SINCE WE'RE
ALL FRIENDS NOW,

270
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,583
WHATTYA SAY WE GET TOGETHER?

271
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,708
MAYBE WE COULD GO OUT FOR A
SWIM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

272
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,583
- THAT SOUNDS AWESOME!

273
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,208
-WELL. KENJI YOU IN?
-MM-HMM.

274
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,291
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, BIG WINNER?

275
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,791
IKETANI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

276
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,333
- UH. YEAH, WHY NOT?

277
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:19,291
- SWEET! THIS IS GONNA ROCK!
THANKS FOR THE INVITE, SAYUKI!

278
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,666
- (exclaims in disgust)

279
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,208
- LET'S CUT LOOSE SUCKAS!

280
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,500
WE CAN ALL SQUEEZE IN AND
PARTY DOWN IN MY EIGHT-FIVE!

281
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,083
WHATTYA GUYS SAY?

282
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,333
- ( theme playing )

283
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

284
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,041
- Yuuichi: WISE
WORDS HERE, KID,

285
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,583
IF MEN WERE NEVER HONEST
WITH THEMSELVES,

286
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,500
MANKIND WOULD HAVE GONE EXTINCT
A LONG TIME AGO.

287
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,208
- YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT, SIR.

288
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,000
- THE BEGINNING
OF A RELATIONSHIP

289
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,250
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.

290
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,958
- MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DON'T, UH...

291
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,750
- YEAH, HI, HONEY.

292
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,041
SURE, I'M ON MY WAY.

293
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,625
- YOU'RE LEAVIN'? WAIT.

294
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,125
MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T' WHAT?

295
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:58,291
Announcer: NEXT ON INITIAL D,
THE END OF SUMMER

296
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,000
DON'T MISS IT.
