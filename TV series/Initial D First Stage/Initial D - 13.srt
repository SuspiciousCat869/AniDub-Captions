16
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,166
HEY, PUNK! WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOIN' UP HERE?

17
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,166
YOU HIT MY CAR!
LAST NIGHT, REMEMBER!

18
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,875
- OH, SO THAT WAS MY FAULT?

19
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,916
IF YOU COULD HANDLE YOUR RIDE,
IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,125
- WHAT?

21
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,916
- I JUST KNEW THE CAR IN
FRONT OF ME WAS SLOW

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,750
AND I COULDN'T TAKE
FOLLOWING IT ANYMORE.

23
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,875
I DIDN'T THINK THINGS UP HERE
WENT THAT SLOW,

24
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,416
BUT WHATTAYA GONNA DO?

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,666
I TRIED TO BRAKE, BUT I
GUESS I NUDGED YOU A BIT.

26
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,708
SUCKS TO BE YOU

27
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,166
- YOU WANNA SAY THAT
TO ME AGAIN!

28
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,875
- CALM DOWN, IKETANI.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT!

29
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,416
- I'LL TELL YA WHAT,
YOU WANNA SETTLE UP,

30
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,875
WE CAN RACE UNDER MY RULES.

31
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,125
AND IF YOU WIN, THEN I'LL
DROP TO MY FREAKIN' KNEES

32
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,666
AND BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS.

33
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY YOUR RULES?

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
WHY WOULD I AGREE TO THAT?

35
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,791
- IT COULD BE
INTERESTING FOR YOU.

36
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,583
WE CALL IT A GUM
TAPE DEATH MATCH

37
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,875
AND IT'S ONE WILD ASS TIME, HUH.

38
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,250
- GUM TAPE WHAT?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

39
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,083
- I HEAR THE SPEED STAR'S
EIGHT-SIX IS SUPPOSED TO BE

40
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,958
A DOWNHILL SPECIALIST.

41
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,208
TELL HIM I'LL BE WAITING
RIGHT HERE FOR HIM.

42
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,208
HE JUST NEEDS TO MEET
ME HERE NEXT SATURDAY

43
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,166
AT TEN O'CLOCK SHARP.

44
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,375
SEE YOU LOSERS THEN.

45
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,958
- YOU BELIEVE THAT CRAP?

46
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,166
THAT PUNK JUST
CHALLENGED YOU, TAKUMI.

47
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,333
- DOESN'T KNOW
YOUR FACE, THOUGH.

48
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,000
DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HE
RECOGNIZED YOU.

49
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,666
- RIP HIM APART, DUDE.

50
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,916
GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH,
WHO GIVES A CRAP!

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,250
JUST CRUSH THAT WANNABE INTO
THE GROUND 'TIL HE'S BEGGING

52
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,125
FOR THE SWEET RELEASE OF DEATH!

53
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,750
- IT'S TOO RISKY FOR HIM TO TRY.

54
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,000
YOU DO REALIZE HE WON'T EVEN
BE ABLE TO STEER.

55
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,833
- DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

56
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,500
HE BEAT THE THREE-TWO
AND THE FD, DIDN'T HE?

57
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,250
THIS ONE LITTLE RULE CHANGE
WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

58
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,625
- LISTEN. THIS GUY'S BEEN
PRACTICING THIS RACE STYLE

59
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,000
WAY MORE THAT TAKUMI.

60
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,625
I'M TELLIN' YA, MAN.
IT'S TOO MUCH OF A RISK TO TAKE.

61
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,333
DON'T BITE ONTO THIS BAIT.

62
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,666
- YEAH. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,916
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS GUY,

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,916
SO, WHY WOULD I
WANT TO RACE HIM?

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,458
- Iketani: GOOD. HE'S JUST
ANOTHER LOSER,

66
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,666
AND YOU'RE BEST OFF
TO IGNORE HIM.

67
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,541
- Yuuichi: A GUM TAPE
DEATH MATCH? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

68
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,125
- Iketani: NO.

69
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,000
- Yuuichi: THAT'S CRAZY. HOW'S
TAKUMI HANDLING THE WHOLE THING?

70
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,500
- WITH HIS USUAL CALM AND LESS
THAN ENTHUSIASTIC DEMEANOR.

71
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,333
ALMOST LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

72
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,875
HE'S NOT INTO ANY OF THIS
BUSINESS. DOESN'T EVEN CARE.

73
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,916
- YEAH, BUT I STILL
WANT HIM TO DO IT.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,416
IT'D BE AWESOME FOR HIM TO
CRUSH THAT GUY INTO POWDER

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,333
AND MAKE HIM APOLOGIZE FOR BEING
THE AWFUL PERSON THAT HE IS!

76
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,833
HE DRIVES A CIVIC, THE
HISTORIC RIVAL OF THE LEVIN

77
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,916
AND THE TRUENO. THAT
SHOULD BE ENOUGH.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,375
- YOU KNOW. BACK IN MY DAY,

79
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,291
WE RAN RACES IN A LOT OF
DIFFERENT WAYS.

80
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,500
EVERY GUY HAD HIS OWN FAVORITE
SET OF RULES AND REGULATIONS.

81
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,916
BUT WE ALL STAYED AWAY FROM
GUM TAPE DEATH MATCHES

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,083
BECAUSE WE KNEW HOW
DANGEROUS THEY WERE.

83
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,666
- IS THIS GUM TAPE THING
THAT BAD?

84
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,750
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
IN A CANDY STORE.

85
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,083
IT ACTUALLY SOUNDS
LIKE IT'D BE TASTY.

86
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,083
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO HOP IN
YOUR CAR FOR A MINUTE.

87
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,791
GIVE IT A SHOT,
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

88
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,416
- OKAY. NOW WHAT?

89
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,083
NOW, GRAB THE WHEEL
WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND

90
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,125
AND TURN IT AS FAR AS YOU
CAN TO ONE SIDE.

91
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,791
JUST SEE HOW FAR YOU CAN GET.

92
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,666
- ( Itsuki grunting )

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,166
I DON'T THINK IT'LL GO
ANY FARTHER.

94
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,416
LEAVE THE WHEEL SITTING WHERE
IT IS NOW AND HOP ON OUT.

95
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,750
- YEAH, ALRIGHT.

96
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,583
- I WANT YOU TO SEE
HOW FAR YOU STEERED.

97
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,125
- PRETTY FAR, I BET.

98
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:27,083
( gasps ) NO WAY.
I TURNED IT AS FAR AS I COULD!

99
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,583
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

100
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,125
- SEE?

101
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,541
- HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO CORNER
WITH YOUR WHEELS LIKE THIS?

102
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,791
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT TAKING ON
THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN PASS.

103
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,083
- THE STEERING'S JUST USED TO
INITIATE THE TURN.

104
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,291
THE TURN'S COMPLETED
BY SLIDING THE REAR TIRES.

105
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,416
NOT AN EASY THING TO DO.

106
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,833
AND YOU DO IT EVERY CORNER.

107
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,333
- WHAT? BUT TAKUMI'S
A DRIFT EXPERT.

108
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,083
HE CAN MANAGE. HE KNOWS WHAT'S
HE'S DOIN' MORE THAN US.

109
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,125
- YOU'RE OVERSIMPLIFYING
THE PROCESS, MAN.

110
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,416
YOU CAN'T COUNTER,

111
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,250
WHICH MAKES IT WAY HARDER TO
CONTROL THE DRIFT.

112
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,041
IT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE.

113
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,250
IF YOU OVERSTEER THE SUCKER,
THAT MEANS YOU FLY INTO A SPIN.

114
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,000
BUT IF YOU UNDERSTEER
INTO THE TURN,

115
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,083
THEN YOU'RE JUST
FREAKIN' HISTORY,

116
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,916
LIKE 'BOOM' INTO THE ROCKFACE.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,666
- THIS RULE OF HIS DEFINITELY
FAVORS THE FF OVER ANYONE ELSE.

118
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,416
THIS FELLA DRIVES AN EG-SIX?

119
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,791
- THAT'S RIGHT.

120
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,333
THE ACCELERATOR ON THAT CAR
ELIMINATES OVERSTEERING,

121
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,583
SO HE CAN ATTACK THOSE
CORNERS AT FULL SPEED.

122
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,000
AND IF HE CAN USE
THE HAND BRAKE,

123
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,583
THAT'LL CUT OUT THE
UNDERSTEERING.

124
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,875
BUT THE EIGHT-SIX NEEDS TO
DRIFT CONSTANTLY

125
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,083
THROUGH A NARROW AREA.

126
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,583
LIKE IT'S WALKING A TIGHTROPE.

127
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,500
I'D SAY YOU GUYS ARE PAINTED
INTO A CORNER ON THIS ONE.

128
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,958
IT'S BETTER TO JUST AVOID
THE WHOLE THING.

129
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,500
- OH, NO. TALKING LIKE THIS
MIGHT GET HIM INTERESTED

130
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,958
IN RACING THIS GUY.
BETTER CLAM UP.

131
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,708
- UH. BOSS.
- ( car honking )

132
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,791
- HEY, THAT'S KENJI'S CAR,
ISN'T IT?

133
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,916
YEAH.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,208
- IKETANI. I DID A LITTLE BIT OF
CHECKIN' UP ON THAT JERK

135
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,333
FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.

136
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,916
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I FOUND OUT.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,208
TURNS OUT HE'S NONE OTHER THAN

138
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,583
SHINGO SHOJI OF THE
MYOGI NIGHT KIDS.

139
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,916
- WE GOT ANOTHER NIGHT KID
ON OUR BACKS?

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,208
- IN THEIR LINEUP,
HE'S THE NUMBER TWO DRIVER.

141
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,416
BUT HE'S GOT ENOUGH CONFIDENCE
TO CALL HIMSELF

142
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,750
THE FASTEST DOWNHILLER
THE NIGHT KIDS HAVE TO OFFER.

143
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,916
HE STOPS AT NOTHIN'
TO GET WHAT HE WANTS,

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,666
WHICH DOESN'T MAKE HIM THE MOST
POPULAR GUY WITH HIS TEAMMATES.

145
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,875
ESPECIALLY NOT WITH THEIR
LEADER, TAKESHI.

146
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,250
THEY TEND TO GO
FOR EACH OTHERS' THROATS.

147
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,791
- NOW IT'S ALL COMIN' TOGETHER.

148
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,125
HE'S CHALLENGING US IN A BID
TO KNOCK TAKESHI OFF THE THRONE

149
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,166
SO HE CAN TAKE OVER
HIS GROUP'S LEADERSHIP.

150
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,666
- AND TALK ABOUT
PRESSIN' THE ISSUE.

151
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,916
HE'S BEEN SPREADING RUMORS
ABOUT THE RACE ALL OVER TOWN.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,250
- LIKE WHAT?

153
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,041
- SOMETHIN' ABOUT THE
SPEED STARS BEING SCARED.

154
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,541
DOIN' EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO
AVOID SHINGO'S CHALLENGE.

155
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,666
COURSE HE DOESN'T MENTION
ANYTHING ABOUT THE GUM TAPE.

156
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,250
- JUST A CRUMMY EFFORT TO
MAKE US LOOK AS BAD AS HE CAN.

157
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,625
- ( grunts ) I HATE THAT GUY!

158
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,250
- HE'LL DO ANYTHING HE CAN
TO DRAG TAKUMI INTO THIS RACE.

159
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,541
NOTHING'LL STOP HIM.

160
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,125
- TAKUMI?

161
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,916
GUYS JUST LET IT GO? REALLY I
DON'T WANNA RACE THIS GUY.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,708
I NEVER HAVE AND I NEVER WILL.

163
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,333
( sighing in relief )

164
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,500
- THAT'S GOOD, MAN. YOU KNOW
THERE'S NO POSTED RULE THAT SAYS

165
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,583
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT EVERY
CHALLENGE THROWN YOUR WAY.

166
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,666
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.

167
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,083
LET HIM SPIN HIS WHEELS.

168
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,166
- I WILL.

169
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,500
- SO, WHAT EVER CAME OF THE
WHOLE RACING THE EIGHT-SIX CRAP?

170
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,375
- ( scoffs ) I'M READY TO ROLL
WHENEVER HE IS.

171
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,250
BALL'S IN THE
SPEED STARS' COURT NOW.

172
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,333
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, FELLAS.

173
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,500
I'LL DRAG THIS IDIOT
OUT INTO THE OPEN.

174
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,958
- IT'LL BE A NICE BEATING
TO WATCH WHENEVER IT HAPPENS.

175
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,291
TAKESHI!

176
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,875
- HEY, SHINGO. LISTEN, I GET THE
FEELING THAT YOU'RE RAMPIN' UP

177
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,583
FOR SOMETHING PRETTY BIG.

178
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,541
SO JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT, OKAY?
I CAN'T STOP YOU.

179
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,333
JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING
THAT'LL TARNISH THE NAME

180
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,041
OF THE NIGHT KIDS.

181
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,500
- ( Shingo laughing )

182
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,958
- IS SOMETHING FUNNY TO YOU?

183
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,000
- I FIGURED YOU ALREADY
TRASHED OUR GOOD NAME

184
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,833
WHEN YOU GOT DUSTED
BY THE EIGHT-SIX.

185
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,416
WHAT?

186
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,166
- YOU GOT THIS MONSTER THREE-TWO
AND YOU STILL FELL FLAT

187
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,125
ON YOUR FACE IN
FRONT OF THAT GUY?

188
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,458
SERIOUSLY, YOUR FEET BROKEN
OR SOMETHIN'?

189
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,875
- SHUT UP.

190
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,166
- SHOULDN'T A LOSER BE OFF

191
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,916
CRYING IN A DARK
CORNER SOMEPLACE?

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,541
ACTING LIKE SOME LEADER,
AND GIVING ME A LECTURE.

193
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,166
YOU'RE WHAT'S FUNNY, MAN.

194
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,791
DON'T SWEAT IT. I'LL AVENGE YOU
ON THE MOUNTAIN, TAKESHI.

195
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,125
YOU CAN THANK ME LATER.

196
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,541
- ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU'RE GONNA
FIND OUT JUST HOW TOUGH

197
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,916
THAT EIGHT-SIX
ACTUALLY IS, SHINGO.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,041
AND I HOPE IT'S SOON.

199
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,541
- LOOKS LIKE TAKESHI
HIT THE ROCKS.

200
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,583
I ALMOST FEEL BAD
FOR THE STUPID PUNK.

201
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,041
- I GOT NO SYMPATHY.
HE DID THIS TO HIMSELF.

202
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,125
SHINGO, YOU'RE THE NEW LEADER
OF THE NIGHT KIDS

203
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,833
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

204
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,666
- THANKS. BUT BEFORE I CAN THINK
OF TAKIN' THAT POSITION ON,

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,250
I GOTTA SEND AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX
TO THE SCRAPYARD.

206
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,125
- ( dialing )

207
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,166
- ( ringing )

208
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,208
- HI THERE. MY NAME'S ITSUKI,
CAN I SPEAK TO...

209
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,416
OH. HEY, SAORI, HOW'RE YOU?

210
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,916
- HI. GLAD YOU CALLED.

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,625
YES, OF COURSE I REMEMBER
WHO YOU ARE, SILLY.

212
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,416
UH, SURE.

213
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,291
A ROAD TRIP UP TO
LAKE AKINA? YEAH, I'D LOVE TO.

214
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,666
- ( gasps )

215
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,375
GREAT, I'LL MEET YOU AT THE
BUS STOP AT ONE O'CLOCK

216
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,666
AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE.

217
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,750
YEAH. I'LL SEE YA THEN.

218
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,750
ALRIGHT!

219
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

220
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,333
MY YEARS-LONG
NO-GIRLFRIEND DROUGHT

221
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,125
IS FINALLY COMING TO AN END!

222
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,041
( laughs ) I'M BACK, BABY!

223
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,333
- ( alarm beeping )

224
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,625
- HERE YA GO.

225
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
- HEY, DAD, I GOT A
QUESTION FOR YA.

226
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,916
- WHAT IS IT?

227
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,500
- IS A GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH...

228
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,875
UH, NEVER MIND.

229
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,791
- A GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH, HUH?

230
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,833
- ( engine revving )

231
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,416
( tires screeching )

232
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,916
- Natsuki: TAKUMI,
YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

233
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
YOU'RE A GOOD DRIVER.
A VERY GOOD ONE.

234
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,833
AND TAKUMI, IF YOU HADN'T
FIGURED IT OUT,

235
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,916
I WOULDN'T MIND IT IF YOU WANTED
TO TAKE ME ON AN OVERNIGHT TRIP.

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,041
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HER

237
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,791
A WHOLE LOT LATELY.

238
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,416
INITIAL D!

239
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,500
INITIAL D!

240
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,666
- ( engine starting )

241
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,291
- Both: THANK YOU
FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

242
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,791
- YOU FELLAS SEEN ITSUKI?

243
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,583
- YEAH. HE WAS JUST OUT HERE
WASHING HIS CAR.

244
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,041
- Iketani: I DON'T SEE HIM.
WHERE'D HE GO?

245
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,833
- OKAY, OKAY. THAT MAKES SENSE.

246
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,250
- THERE YOU ARE. SO THIS WHERE
YOU BEEN HIDIN' ALL DAY, HUH?

247
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,166
- I WASN'T HIDING.
I WAS RESTING.

248
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,291
I DIDN'T GET MUCH
SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

249
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,458
- SO. WHATCHA READIN'?
LET'S TAKE A LOOK!

250
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,416
- GIVE IT BACK! IT'S NOTHING!
IT'S JUST A...

251
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,583
- MY GOODNESS. LOOK AT THIS.

252
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,041
"LOVE MANUAL, HOW TO
IMPRESS YOUR DATE."

253
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,958
- C'MON, I WAS JUST
LOOKING AT THE PICTURES.

254
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,166
BE STRAIGHT WITH ME. THE REASON
YOU'RE READING THIS IS

255
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,250
'CAUSE YOU GOT A DATE?

256
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,250
- YOU CAN TELL ME.
- YES!

257
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,916
- COME HERE, GOOFBALL.
IS IT THAT SAORI CHICK

258
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,791
YOU WERE TALKIN' ABOUT BEFORE?

259
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,041
WHAT ABOUT ME?
YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR MY ADVICE?

260
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,666
- SORRY. I GRABBED
THE BOOK YESTERDAY.

261
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,708
I JUST WANT THE DATE TO GO
SMOOTHLY, SO I BEEN STUDYING.

262
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,583
BESIDES, WHY WOULD I COME TO YOU
FOR ADVICE ABOUT WOMEN?

263
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,708
- YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT,

264
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,333
DUDE, BUT IT STILL
HURTS TO HEAR IT.

265
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,708
- ( Itsuki grunting )

266
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,166
NO!

267
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,583
- THINGS SEEM TO BE
A LOT EASIER NOWADAYS.

268
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,333
WHEN I WAS YOUNG IT
WAS NOTHING BUT TRIAL

269
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,958
AND LOTS AND LOTS OF ERROR.

270
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,583
LET'S SEE. "YOU SHOULD HAVE HER
EATING OUT OF YOUR HAND

271
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,666
BY THE THIRD DATE.

272
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,916
"IF NOT, REPEAT STEPS
TWO AND THREE.

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,833
"STEP TWO, CREATE A ROMANTIC
SETTING FOR YOUR FIRST KISS."

274
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,958
- YEAH. DON'T WORRY, BOSS,
I GOT THAT COVERED.

275
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,458
AND SO, LIKE I MENTIONED
TO YOU BEFORE,

276
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,083
I'D LIKE A DAY OFF THIS WEEKEND,
IF THAT'S OKAY BY YOU.

277
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,291
- OH, THAT'S WHY YOU WANT
TIME OFF. THEN, SURE.

278
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,708
- Iketani: YOU KNOW ITSUKI,
I'M A LITTLE JEALOUS.

279
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,666
- I LOOK SO FREAKIN' COOL.
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME!

280
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,291
WAIT. WHERE IS SHE?

281
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,625
( Saori panting )

282
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,250
- ITSUKI, I'M RIGHT OVER HERE!
SORRY I'M LATE!

283
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,708
( giggles )

284
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,833
- ( exclaims )
THIS IS GONNA BE SO FUN.

285
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,375
- THANKS FOR COME...

286
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,125
- I DON'T NEED ANY GAS,
GREASE MONKEY.

287
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,541
I JUST STOPPED BY TO
GET AN ANSWER

288
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,125
TO MY CHALLENGE INVITATION.

289
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,375
YOU DID PASS ALONG
MY MESSAGE, DIDN'T YOU?

290
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,208
- UH. YEAH. BUT HE SAID
HE DIDN'T WANNA RACE YOU.

291
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,583
WASN'T INTERESTED IN IT.

292
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,458
- ( grunts ) THAT'S HILARIOUS
IF IT'S TRUE.

293
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,041
I DIDN'T REALIZE THE EIGHT-SIX
DUDE WAS SUCH A GIANT COWARD.

294
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,750
HE CAN'T BE SCARED OF
A LITTLE GUM TAPE, CAN HE?

295
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,250
FORGET IT. I'LL MAKE SURE HE
WANTS TO COME OUT AND RACE ME.

296
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,875
- MAN, SHE'S SO CUTE!

297
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,625
- ( Itsuki grunting )

298
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,541
SINCE WE'RE STREET RACERS,

299
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,750
WE USUALLY DON'T TALK ABOUT
TURNING A CORNER.

300
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,083
WE LIKE TO SAY
ATTACKING THE CORNER.

301
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,375
- MAYBE I SHOULD GET
MY DRIVER'S LICENSE.

302
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,333
- SURE. I COULD TEACH YOU
TO DRIVE IF YOU WANT ME TO.

303
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,875
- GIVE ME SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THAT ONE.

304
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,250
WOW. MOUNT FUJI.

305
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,250

I THINK IT WAS?
