SURE IT'S AN EIGHT-SIX
BUT IT'S NOTHING SPECIAL.

17
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,875
YOU DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
TO PUT NEW TIRES ON.

18
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,625
- ( laughing ) OH, MAN,
THAT IS FREAKIN HYSTERICAL!

19
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,041
YOU GOTTA BE PRETTY HARD

20
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,708
UP TO BE DRIVING AN
EIGHT-FIVE NOWADAYS!

21
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,041

MAKE THOSE JERKS PAY. LET'S GO!

00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,333
- ( Itsuki yelling )

00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,916
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS!

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,125
DON'T YOU DO THIS, THIS IS
MY NEW CAR, YOU JERK!

29
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,958
SLOW DOWN, MAN.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT!

30
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,666
HEY, ARE YOU LISTENING?

31
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,625
TAKUMI!
HIT THE FREAKING BRAKES!

32
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,750
NO!

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,083
- YOU NAILED THAT CORNER!
- ( laughing )

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
- WHAT THE HELL?

36
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,166
THAT CAR BACK THERE IS FLYING UP
ON OUR TAIL PRETTY FAST, MAN.

37
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,958
- MUST BE ANOTHER AKINA LOSER.
YOU PICKED THE WRONG GUY

38
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,375
TO SCREW WITH TONIGHT.

39
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,791
TOO BAD FOR YOU, PAL.

40
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,333
- ( car honking )
- HUH?

41
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,791
I GOTCHA. YOU WANNA PLAY
A COUPLE ROUNDS, HUH?

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,125
- DUDE, STOP THE CAR! TAKUMI!
PLEASE. I DON'T WANNA DIE!

43
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,708
WHY WON'T YOU STOP? TAKUMI!

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,583
( Itsuki screaming )

45
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,958
UNBELIEVABLE. IS THIS ACTUALLY
MY PIECE OF CRAP EIGHT-FIVE?

46
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,500
- DAMN!

47
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,375
- I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU,
MAN. THIS SUCKER IS GOOD.

48
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:11,083
HOLD UP A SEC. DUDE,
ISN'T THAT THE EIGHT-FIVE?

49
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,125
THE SAME ONE WE SAW
BACK AT THE TOP?

50
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,416
- NO WAY AN EIGHT-FIVE COULD
KEEP UP WITH THESE WHEELS.

51
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,125
GOTTA BE SOMEBODY ELSE
MESSING WITH US.

52
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,416
IT IS THEM! HOW THE HELL DID
THEY CATCH UP TO US, MAN?

53
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,583
- THOSE LITTLE RAT-BAGS LIED
RIGHT TO OUR FACES!

54
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,416
THAT THING'S NOT WHAT THEY SAID!
IT'S GOTTA BE AN EIGHT-SIX!

55
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,041
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

56
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:42,458
WHAT THE... IT'S NOT WANTING TO
ACCELERATE DOWN THE HILL AT ALL.

57
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,541
THAT'S WEIRD.

58
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,000
AND THESE WHEELS,
THEY'RE NOT BALD,

59
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,291
BUT THEY'RE NOT GRIPPING,
EITHER. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

60
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,666
- ( screaming )

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,208
- DAMN! HE'S SO FAST!
ARE YOU SEEING THIS GUY, DUDE?

62
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,250
- ITSUKI SURE HAS A SLOW ONE
ON HIS HANDS.

63
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:07,416

THAT MUCH IS OBVIOUS.

HE MUST BE DRIVING AN EIGHT-SIX.

00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,625
A WELL-TUNED EIGHT-SIX AT THAT.
THERE'S NO OTHER EXPLANATION!

79
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:59,000
BUT, CHECK OUT THAT ROLL.
AN EIGHT-SIX WOULDN'T DO THAT.

TOO FAST.

- A GHOST!
- A GHOST!

IT'S ON ME.

90
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,541
SO, IKETANI WAS
TELLING ME ABOUT

91
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,583
HOW YOUR DOWNHILL SKILLS
WERE KIND OF...

92
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,208
WELL, HE TOLD ME YOU WERE SOME
KIND OF FREAK OF NATURE, DUDE.

93
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,791
- A FREAK, HUH. WOW,
I SURE HOPE HE MEANT

94
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,208
THAT AS A COMPLIMENT.

95
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,083
- 'COURSE HE DID AND HE'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE TOO CLOSE.

96
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,875
CAN'T SEE THE FOREST
FOR THE TREES.

97
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,458
( laughs ) I NEVER THOUGHT
A CAR COULD RUN LIKE THAT.

98
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,333
IN THE PAST HOUR,
YOU COMPLETELY CHANGED

99
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,333
MY WHOLE PERSPECTIVE ON RACING.

100
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,750
IT WAS SCARY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED,

101
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,291
BUT IT WASN'T THAT.

102
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,708
- WELL, SORRY IT SCARED YOU.
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT TO.

103
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,208
- NO, IT'S COOL.

104
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,833
YOU KNOW, I HONESTLY DON'T THINK

105
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,375
I'VE EVER BEEN THIS
HAPPY BEFORE.

106
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,250
- HUH?

107
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,125
- I JUST REALIZED THAT IT'S
NOT ABOUT WHAT MY CAR CAN DO.

108
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,458
NOT ENTIRELY, ANYWAY. IF THE
DRIVER HAS WHAT IT TAKES,

109
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,250
THEN, MAN, HE CAN BRING OUT
THE BEST IN HIS RIDE,

110
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,125
LIKE YOU BEHIND THE WHEEL
OF MY EIGHT-FIVE.

111
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,666
I FELL IN LOVE
WITH MY CAR TONIGHT.

112
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,500
I'M GONNA TAKE
REALLY GOOD CARE OF HER.

113
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,583
AND FIRST THING TOMORROW,
I'M GONNA START TRAINING,

114
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,625
HARDER THAN YOU'VE
EVER SEEN ANYONE HIT IT!

115
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,541
LET PEOPLE LAUGH. IT DOESN'T
BOTHER ME ONE LITTLE BIT.

116
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,625
I'LL BE AWESOME SOMEDAY. WITH
HARD WORK AND MY EIGHT-FIVE!

117
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,416
HEY, HOW ABOUT THE NEXT TIME
WE GO OUT FOR A DRIVE,

118
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,666
WE GRAB A COUPLE HOT BABES
TO COME WITH US!

119
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,208
- SURE.

120
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,375
- AND NO BLOWING ME OFF
THIS TIME, TAKUMI, EH?

121
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,791
YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?

122
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,833
- I HEAR YOU, MAN. I HEAR YOU.
- OKAY.

123
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:02,291
THE OCEAN, THE CHICKS, THOSE
HOT BIKINIS. I CAN'T WAIT!

124
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,458
- YEAH!

125
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,250
JUST LOOK AT HER.
MY BEAUTIFUL S-THIRTEEN.

126
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,583
BACK IN MY LOVING ARMS

127
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,500
AND LOOKING AS SWEET AS
THE DAY I BROUGHT HER HOME

128
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,041
FROM THE DEALERSHIP.

129
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,458
I THINK I MIGHT SHED A TEAR.
MAYBE TWO.

130
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,500
- ITSUKI, YOU MANIAC!
YOU TRYING TO RUN ME OVER!

131
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,416
- WE'RE GONNA START
TRAINING AGAIN TODAY, BABY.

132
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,333
PRACTICE DRIFTING ON SOME
LOWER GRADE TIRES

133
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,625
TO GO EASY ON YOUR NEW BOD.

134
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,791
- Itsuki: YOU CAN
COUNT ME IN, TOO.

135
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,250
SEE? CHECK OUT
MY TOTALLY SWEET STICKER!

136
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,833
- ( grunting )

137
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,416
- CUT IT OUT.
YOU SAID I COULD JOIN.

138
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,041
- YEAH, SURE.
I GUESS I DID, HUH.

139
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,541
- SWEET! I'M OFFICIALLY A
MEMBER OF THE SPEED STARS.

140
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,833
AND YOU CAN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT!

141
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,625
OH, YEAH. I SHOULD
PROBABLY START PRACTICING

142
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,958
BEFORE I FORGET
ALL THOSE KILLER MOVES

143
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,666
TAKUMI SHOWED ME LAST NIGHT.

144
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,083
- Both: WHOA, WHAT? YOU RODE
WITH HIM? IN THE EIGHT-SIX?

145
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,000
- THAT'S RIGHT,
I RODE WITH HIM.

146
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,666
( chuckling ) EXCEPT THAT
WE WEREN'T IN THE EIGHT-SIX.

147
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,500
- WHAT'RE YOU LAUGHING ABOUT?
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T?

148
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,291
- Iketani: YEAH,
FESS UP. WHAT IS IT?

149
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,791
- Itsuki: I'LL NEVER TELL!

150
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,666
- Iketani: THEN YOU'RE DRINKING
HIGH OCTANE FOR LUNCH.

151
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,541
- Itsuki: OKAY, OKAY
I'LL TELL YOU. GEEZ!

152
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,958
CHECK IT, I RODE SHOTGUN WHILE
TAKUMI DROVE MY EIGHT-FIVE

153
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,500
ON THE AKINA
DOWNHILL LAST NIGHT.

154
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,750
IT BLEW MY MIND THROUGH
THE BACK OF MY SKULL.

155
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,083
MAN! I'VE NEVER SEEN
DRIVING LIKE THAT.

156
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,083
IT WAS LIKE WATCHING
A MAGIC SHOW!

157
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,666
BEFORE WE EVEN HIT THE CORNERS
WE WERE DRIFTING SIDEWAYS.

158
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,500
ALL I COULD SEE WAS THE
MOUNTAIN BLURRING BY ME

159
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,125
IN THE WINDSHIELD.
IT WAS THE COOLEST EVER.

160
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,916
YOU GUYS TOTALLY MISSED OUT.
FEEL REAL BAD FOR YOU.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,416
- TAKUMI WAS OUT THERE
DRIFTING IN YOUR EIGHT-FIVE,

162
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,791
WITHOUT A LIMITED
SLIP DIFFERENTIAL?

163
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,916
- IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THERE WERE THESE TWO JERKS
THAT WERE MESSING WITH US,

165
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,166
BUT WE PASSED THEM BACK TO
BACK ON THE DOWNHILL HAIRPINS!

166
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,333
I'VE NEVER FELT MORE ALIVE THAN
I DID ON AKINA LAST NIGHT!

167
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,791
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

168
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,916
DO YOU BELIEVE HIM OR DO YOU
THINK HE'S FULL OF CRAP?

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,250
I KNOW TAKUMI'S GOOD,

170
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,125
BUT COULD HE REALLY DO THAT
WITH AN EIGHT-FIVE?

171
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,750
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT ANY DRIVER

172
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,291
COULD DRIFT AN EIGHT-FIVE.

173
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,291
EVEN SOMEBODY
WITH TAKUMI'S SKILLS.

174
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,708
- I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M OUT OF MY GOURD.

175
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,958
BUT I SAW WHAT I SAW.

176
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,000
I MIGHT BE A CAR IDIOT,
BUT I'M NOT BLIND.

177
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,333
- HMM. IF THAT'S THE TRUTH

178
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,750
WE'RE DEALING WITH
SOMETHING ELSE HERE.

179
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,958
AND IT MEANS THAT
TAKUMI'S ADAPT ABILITY

180
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,750
IS FAR BEYOND WHAT I
IMAGINED IT TO BE.

181
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,916
- Iketani: WELL, THE CARS
DON'T LOOK ALL THAT DIFFERENT.

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
MAYBE SINCE THEY BOTH
GOT THE SAME BODY,

183
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,250
THEY HAVE SIMILAR
MANEUVERABILITY.

184
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,791
- I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.

185
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,750
BUNTA'S BEEN WORKING
ON THAT EIGHT-SIX OF HIS

186
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,000
SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN.

187
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,458
THE EIGHT-FIVE IS A JOKE
IN COMPARISON.

188
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,208
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
YEARS OF IMPROVEMENTS

189
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,333
AND MODIFICATIONS.

190
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,000
- JOKE?

191
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,500
- Iketani: SO YOU'RE SAYING
TAKUMI CAN PRETTY MUCH DRIVE

192
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,875
ANY CAR WE THROW AT HIM.

193
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,458
- Yuuichi: YEAH. AS LONG AS
THEY GOT THE FR LAYOUT.

194
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,916
THAT'S HIS GROOVE.

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,541
IT'LL LET HIM PULL OUT
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.

196
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:04,500
NOT JUST ANYBODY CAN
DRIVE AN EIGHT-SIX.

197
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,291
YOU HAVE TO HAVE MASTERY
OF THE BASIC DRIVING SKILLS

198
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,916
TO KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,625
BUNTA USED TO HAVE
A SAYING ABOUT IT, IN FACT.

200
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,541
HE SAID "AN EIGHT-SIX
TRAINS THE DRIVER."

201
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,916
- INITIAL D.

202
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,208
- INITIAL D!

203
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,500
- OH, WEIRD.
I MUST BE SEEING THINGS.

204
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,583
OR DID THAT CAR
HAVE A NIGHT KIDS STICKER?

205
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,916
- Man: YEAH. IT'S GOT 'STREET
RACING' WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,541
YOU CAN REALLY TELL
A MODIFIED CAR

207
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,666
FROM THE REST OF THE DAY RUNNERS

208
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,291
JUST BY LOOKING
AT HOW IT ROLLS.

209
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,041
- AND THAT ONE'S
DEFINITELY MOD-ED OUT.

210
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,125
- YEAH.

211
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,416
- I NOTICED THAT THOSE
NIGHT KID PUNKS

212
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,416
HAVE BEEN COMING UP
TO AKINA A LOT LATELY.

213
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,041
I SEE THEM LIKE EVERY DAY.

214
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,750
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT'S ALL ABOUT?

215
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,666
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT SINCE THEIR
LEADER GOT HIS ASS HANDED TO HIM

216
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,916
THE OTHER NIGHT,

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,541
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
ANYBODY FROM THEIR TEAM'S

218
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,125
GOING TO WANT TO COME OUT HERE
SCOUTING FOR A REMATCH.

219
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,208
- I GOTTA SAY,
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

220
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,333
SINCE TAKESHI LOST
TO THAT EIGHT-SIX

221
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,083
HE CAN'T WALK AROUND LIKE HE'S
THE KING OF THE WORLD ANYMORE.

222
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,166
TOO BAD.

223
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,416
- Waitress: HEY, GUYS.
CAN I HELP YOU?

224
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,041
- YEAH. TWO COFFEES
- SURE.

225
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,291
- YOU KNOW, I HEARD THAT THE GUY
FROM THE SPEED STARS

226
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,666
WHO WAS DRIVING THE EIGHT-SIX

227
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,208
IS SOME PUNK KID
WHO'S STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

228
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,916
- I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
HOW GOOD THIS KID IS,

229
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,708
BUT I KNOW THAT WHEN I BEAT HIM,
I'LL BE BETTER THAN TAKESHI.

230
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,041
AND THAT'S ALL I REALLY CARE
ABOUT IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

231
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,500
I'LL BE THE FASTEST NIGHT KID.
HANDS FREAKING DOWN.

232
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,416
- I DON'T KNOW, SHINGO. YEAH,
YOU'RE FAST ON THE DOWNHILL,

233
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,541
BUT I HEARD THIS KID'S
OFF THE CHAIN.

234
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,083
- I KNOW I CAN TAKE HIM
FAIR AND SQUARE,

235
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,083
BUT I'VE GOT A MUCH MORE
INTERESTING IDEA.

236
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,125
SOMETHING TO ENSURE MY VICTORY.

237
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,750
- ( choking )

238
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,000
- YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN.

239
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,166
I'LL GIVE HIM A DOWNHILL
RUN THAT'S SO DANGEROUS

240
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,500
HE WON'T KNOW
WHAT BLEW PAST HIM,

241
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,958
'CAUSE THIS WORLD ONLY NEEDS
ONE DOWNHILL SPECIALIST.

242
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,625
THE EIGHT-SIX? AN OUTDATED
PIECE. TIME TO SEND THAT

243
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,375
THING TO A MERCIFUL
GRAVE IN A NICE SCRAPYARD.

244
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,500
- UH-OH.

245
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,083
I'LL SHOW THEM ALL THAT
SHINGO SHOJI OF THE NIGHT KIDS

246
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,750
IS THE FASTEST
DOWNHILL RACER IN GUNMA.

247
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,958
- ( car approaching )

248
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,083
- Fumihero: SO WHERE'S RYOSUKE?

249
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,375
- WHERE DO YOU THINK?

250
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,416
MY BROTHER'S LOCKED HIMSELF
IN HIS ROOM AGAIN,

251
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,458
STARING AT THAT DUMB ASS
COMPUTER SCREEN OF HIS.

252
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,083
HIS FAVORITE PASTIME.

253
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,958
AS FAR AS I KNOW, HE'S THE ONLY
STREET RACER IN GUNMA

254
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,250
WHO DOES MOST OF HIS TRAINING
IN AN OFFICE CHAIR

255
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,041
IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER.

256
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,583
HEY, I WAS WONDERING... WHAT
DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN

257
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,416
IF MY BROTHER AND AKINA'S
EIGHT-SIX WERE TO RACE.

258
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,750
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, MAN?

259
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,416
NO WAY RYOSUKE WOULD
LOSE TO THAT GUY,

260
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,916
YOU KNOW THAT.

261
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,458
RYOSUKE KNOWS EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW

262
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,041
ABOUT THE EIGHT-SIX BY NOW.

263
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,375
HE'S GOT ALL THE DATA HE NEEDS
TO CREATE A SIMULATION

264
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,416
OF A WINNING RACE IN HIS HEAD.

265
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,750
IF HE CAN JUST APPLY THAT
KNOWLEDGE IN AN ACTUAL RACE,

266
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,500
I CAN'T THINK OF A DRIVER WHO'D
EVEN MAKE HIM BREAK A SWEAT.

267
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,458
SHORT OF THE PROS, ANYWAY.

268
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,791
- I GET IT. NO STREET RACER
KNOWS MORE ABOUT CARS THAN HIM.

269
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,541
I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM LOSING
EITHER, NOT TO ANYONE.

270
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,375
AND CERTAINLY NOT WHEN I THINK
ABOUT THE SKILLS HE'S PACKING.

271
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,000
- YEAH, I KNOW.

272
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,500
- BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT THE EIGHT-SIX

273
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,583
IS GONNA LOSE A
RACE EITHER, SO...

274
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,125
- ( tires screeching )

275
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,375
- THAT HIGH-SPEED DRIFTING
IS REALLY SOMETHING SPECIAL.

276
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,916
NOT TO MENTION THE
DUDE'S CRAZY BRAKE CONTROL.

277
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,625
HE MIGHT BE AS GOOD
AS MY BROTHER.

278
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,000
BESIDES, HE'S ANOTHER FR DRIVER.

279
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,625
AND THE WAY THAT EIGHT-SIX
RUNS IS INCREDIBLE.

280
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,458
CAN'T HELP BUT BE IMPRESSED.

281
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,000
- SERIOUSLY?

282
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,250
- IF THEY EVER BATTLE, ONE OF
THEM IS GONNA END UP SECOND.

283
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,958
AND I SURE AS HELL DON'T
WANT IT TO BE MY BROTHER.

284
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,166
BUT I DON'T REALLY WANNA
SEE THE EIGHT-SIX LOSE

285
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,583
ANY MORE THAN RYOSUKE, YOU KNOW.

286
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,541
MAN, I'M TORN ON THIS.

287
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:40,458
- OH, SORRY!
I'M SUCH A KLUTZ!

288
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,500
HOLD ON A SECOND,
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

289
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,375
YOU KNOW, I HAD FUN
AT THE BEACH.

290
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,666
WHY DON'T WE GO
SOME PLACE TOGETHER AGAIN?

291
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,333
MAYBE THE MOUNTAINS,
OR THE HIGHLANDS,

292
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,166
OR EVEN THE BEACH AGAIN.

293
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,791
I MEAN WE ARE ON SUMMER
VACATION. COULD BE FUN!

294
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,916
- YEAH.

295
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,666
- WE SHOULD BE LIVING IT UP
AND MAKING NEW MEMORIES.

296
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,625
- YEAH, WE SHOULD.

297
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,708
- AND TAKUMI,
IF YOU HADN'T FIGURED IT OUT,

298
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:10,125
I WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU WANTED TO
TAKE ME ON AN OVERNIGHT TRIP.

299
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,791
SO WHEN IS YOUR NEXT DAY OFF?
THIS SUNDAY?

300
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,583
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WORK
ALL THE TIME.

301
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,541
- TELL ME ABOUT IT. IT JUST
DEPENDS ON WHAT THE BOSS NEEDS.

302
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,416
- DO YOU WANT TO TAKE ME
FOR A DRIVE AGAIN OR NOT?

303
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,416
I JUST FELL IN LOVE
WITH YOUR CAR, SO...

304
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,041
- NO BLOWING ME OFF.

305
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,375
BACK OUT AND YOU CAN KISS
OUR FRIENDSHIP GOODBYE!

306
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,958
- SO, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

307
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,000
IF MAYBE ITSUKI TAGGED
ALONG WITH US?

308
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,750
- THE THREE OF US?

309
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,000
- WELL, ACTUALLY, IF IT'S
NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

310
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,541
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
FIND HIM A DATE.

311
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,791
- OH.

312
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,875
- HE'S A GREAT GUY
WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.

313
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:01,041
HE'S JUST KIND OF SHY, YOU KNOW?

314
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,000
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
SUCH A CARING FRIEND,

315
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,416
ITSUKI'S LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

316
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,375
I JUST THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE A STEP

317
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,458
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR HIM.

318
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,500
- THEN I'LL START ASKING AROUND
AND SEE WHICH OF MY FRIENDS

319
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,500
WANTS TO COME.

320
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,583
- YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

321
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,250
- ITSUKI'S A REALLY SWEET GUY.

322
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,625
I KNOW PLENTY OF GIRLS WHO WOULD
ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH HIM.

323
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,041
- ( car brakes screeching )

324
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:56,625
- Itsuki: THAT WAS KICK ASS!
MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE THAT A SHOT!

325
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,083
- THINK I'M FINALLY
GETTING A GRIP

326
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,916
ON SLIDING THE REAR SIDEWAYS.

327
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,208
YEAH, NOW I'VE GOT THE TIMING
IT'S REALLY COMING TOGETHER.

328
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,041
- YEAH, ALL YOU GOT TO DO
TO START OFF THE DRIFT

329
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,833
IS PULL UP
ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.

330
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,041
- I'M PRETTY
SURE THAT'S WRONG.

331
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,166
I WAS WATCHING REAL CLOSE

332
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,916
WHEN I WAS RIDING
ALONG WITH TAKUMI,

333
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
AND I DIDN'T SEE HIM TOUCH
THE EMERGENCY BRAKE

334
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,041
THE ENTIRE TRIP, SO...

335
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,916
- 'CAUSE TAKUMI
USES THE FOOT BRAKE.

336
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,958
NOT THE HANDBRAKE
LIKE MOST DRIVERS USE

337
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,375
TO SHIFT THE CARS WEIGHT.

338
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,083
DON'T WORRY, PAL. YOU'RE
A LONG WAY OFF FROM THAT.

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,416
- YEAH.

340
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,000
- WE USUALLY BARREL INTO A
CORNER AND THEN ACCELERATE.

341
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,000
THAT SKIDS THE REAR TIRES
BEFORE COMING OUT OF IT...

342
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,791
BUT THAT'S AN ELEMENTARY
TECHNIQUE CALLED POWER SLIDE.

343
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,916
IT'S NOT A TRUE DRIFT.

344
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,125
TAKUMI DRIFTS INTO A CORNER
AND CONTROLS THE SKID

345
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,875
AT THE END TO STABILIZE THE CAR.

346
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,833
THAT'S A TRUE DRIFT.

347
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,291
IT'S THE FASTEST WAY
TO TURN

348
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,958
AND IT LOOKS PRETTY
FREAKING SWEET TOO.

349
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,458
LOT TO BE SAID FOR SHOWMANSHIP.

350
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,041
- WELL, MY MAN.

351
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,250
I SEE YOU'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT
OF STUDYING UP ON THE SUBJECT.

352
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,166
GOT SUPER BORED
WHILE MY S-THIRETEEN

353
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,083
WAS LAYED UP
IN THE CAR HOSPITAL.

354
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,625
SO I DID A LITTLE
EXTRACURRICULAR READING.

355
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,458
- I CAN'T WAIT TO GIVE THAT
SIDE-SPIN A SHOT MYSELF.

356
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,333
- OH, MAN.
THIS IS SO EXCITING!

357
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,666
- I THINK I'M JUST ABOUT READY
FOR THE NEXT STEP

358
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,250
IN THE PROCESS, GENTLEMEN.

359
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,916
INSTEAD OF HITTING IT
IN A STRAIGHT LINE,

360
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,666
I'M GOING TO TRY IT IN
A LOW-SPIN TURN.

361
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,208
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

362
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,625
- GOOD LUCK OUT THERE, IKETANI!
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT, DUDE!

363
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,500
- TRY NOT TO HIT ANY
OTHER CARS OUT THERE!

364
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,791
- WE'LL BE WAITING RIGHT HERE,
SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK!

365
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,833
- ( tires screeching )

366
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,583
- IT'S A HELL OF A THING TO BE
IN TOTAL CONTROL OF YOUR CAR.

367
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,625
CHALLENGING LIKE
I'VE NEVER KNOWN.

368
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,708
MAN, I WISH I COULD BE
MORE LIKE TAKUMI.

369
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,875
I WANNA RIDE WITH HIM
JUST ONE MORE TIME,

370
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,416
THEN I'LL HAVE IT DOWN.

371
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,791
WATCHING HIM DRIVE MY CAR,
IT'LL BE THE BEST WAY

372
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,250
FOR ME TO LEARN THIS STUFF.

373
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,958
AND HONESTLY,
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW.
