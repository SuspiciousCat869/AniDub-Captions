I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

19
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,375
HIS RIGHT-HAND COUNTER-STEER
WAS JUST A SETUP

20
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,208
FOR THE LEFT-HAND CORNER.

21
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,458
DID I JUST GET OWNED
BY THE GHOST OF SOME DUDE

22
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,833
THAT BIT IT ON THIS PASS
OR WHAT?

23
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,000

ONLY SOMEONE WHO
KNOWS THIS MOUNTAIN

25
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,083

COULD'VE PULLED IT OFF.

THAT FREAK SHOW?

- YEAH.

28

LIKE IT ONE BIT.

29
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,666
NO MOUNTAIN SPEC-TUNED FD
SHOULD GET SERVED

CLUNKER OF AN 8-6.

00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,625
NO WAY AM I GONNA
LET THIS STAND.

32
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,916
- Bunta: FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,208
HEY, TAKUMI! RISE AND
SHINE, SLEEPING BEAUTY.

34
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,000
COME ON, UP AND AT 'EM.
YOU'VE GOT A PHONE CALL.

35
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,291
- TELL ITSUKI
I'LL CALL HIM BACK!

36
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,416
- WHAT AM I, YOUR SECRETARY?

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,125
- ( yawning )

38
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,916
- ( speed dial hold )

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,791
WHAT'S UP, MAN?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,583
HUH?

41
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,541
- ( people chattering )

42
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,416
- HEY, TAKUMI! OVER HERE!

43
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,875
- WERE YOU SURPRISED
WHEN I CALLED?

44
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,416
- YEAH, SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,916
I PICKED UP THINKIN'
IT WAS ITSUKI.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
- THAT'S SO FUNNY.

47
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,333
LISTEN, I CALLED BECAUSE
IT'S HIGH TIME YOU AND ME

48
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,791
WERE FRIENDS AGAIN.

49
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,541
- UM, I GUESS I DIDN'T
REALIZE WE WEREN'T ANYMORE.

50
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,500
DID I MISS AN ARGUMENT
'TWEEN US OR SOMETHING?

51
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,541
- HEY, I OVERHEARD
YOU GUYS CARRYING ON

52
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,833
ABOUT CARS YESTERDAY.

53
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,166
SO, DOES THAT MEAN
YOU CAN DRIVE?

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,541
- YEAH. JUST GOT MY
LICENSE A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

55
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,750
- REALLY? I WAS JUST THINKING
HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE

56
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,458
TO GO FOR A RIDE.

57
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,000
HOW ABOUT YOU DO THE DRIVING

58
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,416
AND I PACK US A NICE
LITTLE PICNIC LUNCH?

59
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,958
- THAT SOUNDS...

60
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,625
I MEAN WE REALLY ONLY USED FOR
WORK, SO IT'S KINDA TRASHED.

61
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,958
- YOU BOYS
AND YOUR TOYS.

62
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,250
IT'S GOT A STEREO SYSTEM, RIGHT?

63
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,833
I COULDN'T CARE LESS WHAT SHAPE
THE CAR'S ACTUALLY IN.

64
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,291
JUST HAS TO GET US TO POINT B.

65
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,625
- I DUNNO.

66
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,750
C'MON! IT'LL BE FUN.
YOU KNOW IT WILL!

67
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,083
- ( sighs )

68
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,583
- WE SHOULD GO SOMEWHERE FAR.

69
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,291
AH, THE OCEAN!

70
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,625
THAT'D BE TOTALLY AWESOME.

71
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,000
WHAT'S SUMMER WITHOUT
A TRIP TO THE BEACH?

72
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,083
- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
THAT'S AN 8-6.

73
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,375
- MARK MY WORDS, IKETANI,

74
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,000
THE FASTEST DOWNHILL
CAR IN AKINA

75
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,541
IS AN 8-6 THAT DELIVERS TOFU.

76
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,791
- NO WAY. THIS CAN'T BE THE ONE.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,375
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
AN ORDINARY 8-6.

78
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,916
EARLY GT APEX,

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,125
TOTALLY STOCK,
EXCEPT FOR THE FOG LIGHTS.

80
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,125
THIS RELIC'S GOT NOTHIN'
ON THE LATEST MODELS

81
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,125
ROLLIN' OFF THE LINE.

82
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,375
I'M OUTTA MY HEAD,

83
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,875
CHASIN' SOME STUPID URBAN
MYTH LIKE A CHUMP.

84
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,291
- IKETANI? WHAT'RE YOU
DOIN' HERE, MAN?

85
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,041
- UH. HEY, TAKUMI?

86
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,625
- GOT AN ITCH FOR TOFU,
OR JUST TAKIN' IN THE SCENE?

87
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,416
- TOFU? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

88
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,291
OH, YOU MEAN THE SIGN?

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,166
- SO, UH, YOU SPEND A
LOT OF TIME HANGING OUT

90
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,416
IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE?

91
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,916
- OH, WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS YOUR HOUSE,

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,250
I JUST HAPPENED TO
BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

93
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,083
I GOTTA ASK YOU, IS THIS WHOLE

94
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,208
"I DON'T KNOW JACK ABOUT
CARS" THING FOR REAL

95
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,791
OR IS IT JUST AN ACT?

96
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,958
- HUH?

97
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,708
- I MEAN C'MON, LET'S FACE IT,

98
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,916
YESTERDAY YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT AN 8-6 WAS

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,916
AND TODAY I SEE ONE
SITTIN' IN YOUR DRIVEWAY.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,416
- WAIT. YOU TRYIN' TO PLAY
HEAD GAMES WITH ME

101
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,416
OR SOMETHIN'?

102
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,083
THAT PIECE OF JUNK'S
NOT AN 8-6.

103
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,958
MATTER OF FACT, I'M ALMOST
POSITIVE IT SAYS "TRUENO"

104
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,083
ON THE BACK OF IT.

105
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,625
- YEAH, I KNOW.
A TRUENO IS AN 8-6.

106
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,875
LEVIN, TRUENO, THEY'VE BOTH
GOT THE AE 8-6 CHASSIS,

107
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,250
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
BOTH CALLED 8-6's.

108
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,000
- Itsuki: WHAT? TAKUMI'S GOT
A FREAKIN' WHAT?

109
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,250
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
MESSING WITH ME, RIGHT?

110
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,291
- NOPE, 'FRAID NOT.

111
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,166
- FUJIWARA, YOU JERK!

112
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,750
WHY WOULD YOU KEEP
SOMETHING LIKE THAT FROM US?

113
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,958
- TAKE A PILL, ITSUKI,

114
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,958
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I HAD ONE 'TIL TODAY.

115
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,791
IF THEY EXPECT ME TO
CALL IT AN 8-6,

116
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,375
IT SHOULD SAY 8-6 ON THE BACK
INSTEAD OF TRUENO.

117
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,833
I'M NOT THE FRIGGIN'
CAR WHISPERER.

118
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,458
- WHY, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF...

119
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,250
HEY, NO HARD FEELINGS. I MEAN,
NOBODY'S PERFECT, RIGHT?

120
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,416
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT SEE YOUR WAY
CLEAR TO LETTIN' ME BORROW 'ER

121
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,833
THIS SATURDAY, PAL?

122
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,958
- WHAT FOR?

123
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,666
- SO I CAN LOOK
LIKE A TOTAL BADASS

124
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,875
WHEN I GO WATCH THE SPEED STARS

125
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,625
AND THE RED SUNS DUKE
IT OUT THAT NIGHT,

126
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,916
THAT'S WHAT FOR, YA DILLWEED!

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,500
I'VE BEEN SWEPT UP INTO THE
RACING SCENE SINCE LAST NIGHT.

128
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,583
IT'S CONSUMED MY LIFE!

129
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,666
DUDE, DON'T YOU WANNA SEE THE
LEGENDARY TAKAHASHI BROTHERS

130
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,583
FROM AKAGI GET DUSTED?

131
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,750
- NO. NOT REALLY.

132
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:18,541
YOU TRAITOR! ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR TINY MIND?

133
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,541
HAVE A LITTLE LOCAL PRIDE, DUDE!

134
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,708
COME ON! DUDE.

135
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,750
PLEASE CAN I BORROW THE 8-6
SATURDAY? PLEASE?

136
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,416
- THIS A FULL-SERVICE GAS
STATION OR A HIGH SCHOOL PLAY?

137
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,250
GET TO WORK.
I'VE GOT CUSTOMERS WAITIN'.

138
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,208
- OH, UM, YES SIR. SORRY.

139
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,208
HI THERE, GOOD AFTERNOON!

140
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,875
- WOW. REPLACING
ALL FOUR TIRES, HUH?

141
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,208
THAT CAN'T BE TOO CHEAP.

142
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,500
- NOT REALLY,
BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT.

143
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,416
I NEED THE HIGH GRIP TO
HELP IMPROVE MY TIME.

144
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,416
I DROPPED A FEW FOR SOME

145
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,166
HIGH-PERFORMANCE
BRAKE PADS, TOO.

146
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,750
ON THE DOWNHILL,
BRAKING'S THE NAME OF THE GAME.

147
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,416
- SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA GO FOR IT?

148
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,250
- YEP. ON THE DOWNHILL, I AM.

149
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,375
I'M GONNA GO AFTER THAT DAMN
MOUNTAIN LIKE IT OWES ME MONEY.

150
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,875
- DON'T OVERDO IT, MAN.

151
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,500
JUST ONE LITTLE SCREW-UP ON
THAT PASS'LL GET YOU DEAD.

152
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,083
- I KNOW, DUDE.

153
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,458
BUT MY PRIDE AS A RACER'S
NOT THE ONLY THING AT STAKE.

154
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,916
THIS IS OUR TURF.

155
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,333
- ( tires screeching )

156
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,541
- COME ON, YOU LITTLE PUNK.
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?

157
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,125
YOU'VE GOTTA BE PART
OF THE LOCAL SCENE,

158
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,708
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

159
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,958
YOU AND THIS MOUNTAIN
GO WAY BACK.

160
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,791
I'M NOT LEAVING AKINA
'TIL I GET MY REMATCH!

161
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,125
ARE YOU TOO SCARED TO GIVE A GUY
A FAIR SHOT AT PAYBACK?

162
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,791
SHOW YOURSELF!

163
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,625
THE SPEED STARS CAN BITE IT.

164
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,708
THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON
I'M STILL HANGING AROUND

165
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,208
THIS CRAP TOWN,

166
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,791
AND IT'S YOU.

167
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:13,000
- HOLY CRAP! KEICHII TSUCHIYA
IS THE DRIFT KING. NO CONTEST!

168
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,875
- YOU KNOW HE'S ONLY USIN' THE
GAS PEDAL THERE, RIGHT?

169
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,625
- HEY, TAKUMI.
YOU WATCHIN' THIS?

170
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,250
TELL ME THIS DOESN'T MAKE
YOU WANNA GET OUT THERE

171
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,500
AND MAKE THE ROAD BEG FOR MERCY!

172
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,708
- SURE.

173
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,083
- DUDE, ARE YOU SEEIN'
THIS DRIFT? AWESOME!

174
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,208
- SURE.

175
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,625
- WHOA, IS THAT A BOOK?

176
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,708
- SURE. HUH?

177
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,500
- I KNEW IT! YOU'RE NOT
PAYIN' ATTENTION!

178
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,833
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT
DRIFT IS MR. "SURE"?

179
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,750
- SURE, I MEAN, OF COURSE
I DO. EVERYBODY DOES.

180
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,125
- WELL, IF YOU KNOW SO MUCH,

181
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,500
WHY DON'T PUT YOUR
OWN SPIN ON IT FOR US?

182
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,166
- WELL, IN A CURVE, YOU...

183
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,500
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
DON'T CALL IT A CURVE.

184
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,708
PEOPLE IN THE KNOW
CALL IT A CORNER.

185
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,083
- YEAH. OKAY, FINE.
IN A CORNER THEN,

186
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,583
YOU MAKE THE FRONT TIRES SLIDE

187
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,083
SO THE CAR'S NOT FACING
THE INSIDE WHEN YOU TURN,

188
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,583
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE TOAST.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,750
- ( laughing )

190
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,833
- MAN, YOU SHOULD
TOTALLY DO STAND-UP.

191
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,083
LETTING YOUR FRONT TIRES SLIDE
IS CALLED UNDER-STEER,

192
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,333
WHICH IS USUALLY THE FIRST SIGN

193
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,083
YOU'RE ABOUT TO EAT
SOME GUARDRAIL.

194
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,833
- YOU USE THE BACK TIRES FOR
A DRIFT, NOT THE FRONT.

195
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,791
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS.

196
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,791
GOOD ONE THERE, LEMME TELL YA.
GOOD ONE.

197
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,291
- MAN, YOU OUGHTA TAKE THAT
SHTICK OUT ON THE ROAD.

198
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,250
SORRY, IKETANI.
YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG.

199
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,333
IN THE MIDDLE OF A DRIFT,

200
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,541
THE CAR IS ESSENTIALLY
UNDER-STEERING.

201
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,916
TAKUMI'S WAS THE KIND OF ANSWER
YOU'D ONLY EXPECT

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,708
FROM SOMEONE WHO'S MASTERED
THE FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT.

203
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,500
I'M IMPRESSED.

204
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,666
- ( car honking )

205
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,500
RIGHT. CUSTOMERS.
BOYS, EARN YOUR KEEP.

206
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,875
- UH, YES SIR.

207
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,750
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

208
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,125
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

209
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,125
- AN FD.
IS THAT KEISUKE TAKAHASHI?

210
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,125
- FILL 'ER UP. HIGH OCTANE.

211
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,250
- SURE.

212
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,416
- Iketani: SO, I'M BETTIN'
YOU'RE AN ENTHUSIAST.

213
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,833
- HUH?

214
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,541
SMALL WORLD. I THOUGHT THAT
S-13 LOOKED FAMILIAR.

215
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,125
SPEED STARS, HUH?

216
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,083
YA MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

217
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,708
YOU LOOK LIKE A
KNOWLEDGEABLE GUY.

218
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,583
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A GHOST ON THIS MOUNTAIN?

219
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,750
A GHOST THAT HAPPENS TO DRIVE
A TRICKED-OUT 8-6?

220
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,416
- WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?
IS HE A DRIVER OR A PILOT?

221
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,750
- I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T
RESPOND WELL TO SARCASM.

222
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,125
- HEY, I WASN'T TRYING
TO BE SARCASTIC.

223
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,666
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
IS A TRUENO.

224
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,125
LOOKS LIKE YOUR ORDINARY
PIECE OF CRAP FROM THE OUTSIDE,

225
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,500
BUT WHOEVER'S BEHIND
THE WHEEL'S A DEMON.

226
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,958
THERE'S NO WAY A LOCAL LIKE YOU
HASN'T HEARD OF IT.

227
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,750
FINE. PLAY DUMB.

228
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,041
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IF THAT'S YOUR BIG SECRET WEAPON

229
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,041
FOR SATURDAY'S RACE,

230
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,583
YOU'LL BE DOIN' ME A FAVOR.

231
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,500
YOU CAN TELL THAT GHOST FRIEND
OF YOURS I'M ON TO HIS GAME.

232
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,708
KEISUKE TAKAHASHI DOESN'T LOSE
TO THE SAME GUY TWICE.

233
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,583
NOW THAT I'M MORE
FAMILIAR WITH THE PASS,

234
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,041
THE SPEED STARS CAN KISS
ANY HOPE OF VICTORY GOODBYE.

235
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,041
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

236
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,625
- KEISUKE TAKAHASHI
LOST A RACE?

237
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,083
THE HELL'S HE TALKIN' ABOUT?

238
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,750
NO PIDDLY 8-6 CAN DUST AN FD.

239
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:43,291
WAIT A MINUTE. THE 8-6 I SAW
AT TAKUMI'S PLACE THE OTHER DAY,

240
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,166
IT WAS A TRUENO.

241
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,625
SO THE BOSS WAS RIGHT,

242
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,125
THAT CAR STILL BELONGS TO THE
FASTEST DOWNHILL RACER IN AKINA.

YOU DON'T LIKE IT, STOP STARIN'.

00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,333
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

276
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,583
DUDE, JUST IMAGINE IT, YOU AND
ME CARVE A NICHE FOR OURSELVES

277
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,208
IN THE RACING SCENE
AND WE'RE ONE STEP AWAY

278
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,916
FROM BEIN' AKINA'S GOLDEN BOYS!

279
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,791
- OKAY, REMIND ME AGAIN
WHY I SHOULD CARE

280
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,125
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

281
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,458
- HO-HO! AM I DETECTING
A HINT OF SOUR GRAPES?

282
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,916
JUST 'CAUSE YOU WHITE-KNUCKLE
THE WHEEL AT SPEEDS OVER THIRTY,

283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,750
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T BE
A GREAT RACER SOME DAY.

284
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,708
YOU DO HAVE A LONG ROAD
AHEAD OF YA.

BUT THEM'S THE BREAKS,

286
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,458
SOME PEOPLE GOT NATURAL
TALENT, SOME DON'T.

287
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,916
YOU CAN'T HOLD YOURSELF
TO THE STANDARDS SET

288
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,166
BY PEOPLE LIKE ME.

289

291
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,833
THAT'S JUST HOW IT GOES
IN THIS TOPSY-TURVY WORLD!

00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,291
- ( laughing )

294
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,916
TAKUMI!

295
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,541
TAKUMI. TAKUMI, I'M JUST
KIDDIN' AROUND. HOLD UP.

296
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,791
IF IT'S A SORE SUBJECT,
THEN FINE, I'LL LAY OFF,

297
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,541
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET
TO ACT LIKE A TOTAL JERK WAD.

298
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,625
- SORRY

299
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,583
- AND THEN ROOMIKO DECIDES
TO TELL MY BOYFRIEND

300
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,291
I'VE GOT THE HOTS FOR HER MAN,

301
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,375
- WHEN HE'S NOT EVEN HER MAN...

302
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,583
- JACKPOT.

303
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,291
- DUDE, I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE A PERVERT.

304
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,000
- HELL NO! IT SHOULD TOTALLY
BE AGAINST THE LAW

305
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,041
FOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS

306
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,875
TO WALK AROUND IN SKIRTS
THAT SHORT.

307
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,166
I MEAN, WHAT AM I?
MADE OF STONE?

308
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,833
SUNSHINE AT TWELVE O'CLOCK.

309
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,916
- MORNING, GUYS.
HOW'S IT GOING?

310
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,250
- ( both gasping )

311
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,750
- NATSUKI.

312
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,250
- OH, HEY. THAT'S RIGHT. I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU IN PRIVATE.

313
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,125
GOOD THING YOU RAN INTO ME,
HUH? LOOK ALIVE, MISTER!

314
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,583
- I HATE MY LIFE! I HATE
MY LIFE! I HATE MY LIFE!

315
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,666
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

316
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,291
- WELL, I... THERE'S, UH...

317
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,541
THERE'S SOMETHING
REALLY IMPORTANT

318
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,625
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO
HEAR FROM ME FIRST.

319
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,958
- OKAY.

320
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,833
- SEE, THE THING IS...

321
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,416
I BOUGHT A BRAND NEW
TWO PIECE YESTERDAY.

322
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,416
IT'S SO CUTE YOU COULD DIE!

323
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,750
- YOU DRAGGED ME ALL THE WAY
UP HERE FOR THAT?

324
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,208
- WELL, DUH! BELIEVE ME.

325
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,583
WE'RE TALKIN' A
ONE-IN-A-MILLION FIND,

326
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,250
I HAD TO TELL SOMEBODY
BEFORE I EXPLODED.

327
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,125
YOU WANNA SEE?
IT'S SO ADORABLE.

328
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,708
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT COLOR?

329
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,375
I'M GONNA GO WITH PURPLE?

330
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,833
- MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

331
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,416
BUT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW UNTIL
YOU DRIVE ME TO THE BEACH.

332
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,083
'TIL THEN, YOU'LL HAVE TO
USE YOUR IMAGINATION!

333
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,458
THE WEATHER'S SUPPOSED TO BE
REALLY NICE ON SUNDAY.

334
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,416
- Takumi: WELL, I DO HAVE THE
AFTERNOON OFF FROM WORK.

335
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,666
- Natsuki: EXCELLENT! THIS
COUNTS AS A VERBAL CONTRACT,

336
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,625
I HOPE YOU REALIZE.

337
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,875
NO BACKING OUT NOW.

338
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,708
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I HATE
MORE THAN SMOKERS,

339
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,583
AND I HATE SMOKERS, IT'S PEOPLE
WHO DON'T KEEP THEIR WORD.

340
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,750
- ( tires screeching )

341
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,583
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME...

342
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,000
THESE CORNERS ARE
NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE,

343
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,125
BENDS I'VE NEVER EVEN
THOUGHT OF AS CORNERS

344
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,250
MIGHT AS WELL BE HAIRPINS
FOR ALL THE LUCK I'VE HAD

345
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,416
GETTIN' THROUGH THE STUPID
THINGS AT THIS CLIP.

346
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,458
ROAD'S SHOWIN'
HER TEETH TONIGHT!

347
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,166
- ( tires screeching )

348
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,041
IT'S HOPELESS.
I'VE HIT A CEILING.

349
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,666
NOT EVEN A MIRACLE
WOULD IMPROVE MY TIME.

350
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,250
I THOUGHT IF I GAVE
'ER MORE THROTTLE

351
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,416
I'D AT LEAST HAVE A CHANCE,

352
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,250
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

353
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,750
IS THIS REALLY AS GOOD AS MY
TECHNIQUE'S EVER GONNA GET?

354
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,875
IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO
CAN REPRESENT AKINA,

355
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,375
WE MIGHT AS WELL RENAME OUR TEAM

356
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,208
THE FALLEN STARS AND
BE DONE WITH IT.

357
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,666
- ( bells tinkling )

358
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,958
- HELLO? ANYBODY HERE?

359
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,125
HELLO?

360
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,750
( sighs )

361
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,208
EXCUSE ME.

362
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,625
- I CAN HEAR YOU.
MIND GIVIN' ME A FEW SECONDS?

363
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,958
ALRIGHT THEN.

364
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,375
- Iketani: NO WAY. THIS IS THE
FASTEST DRIVER ON AKINA?

365
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,125
HIS 8-6 TOOK DOWN
KEISUKE TAKAHASHI?

366
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,958
- CAN I HELP YOU?

367
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,791
HEY.

368
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,916
- ( gasps )

369
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,083
UH, FRIED TOFU, PLEASE!

370
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,541
- COMIN' RIGHT UP.

371
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,375
- THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU,
DUDE? ASK HIM!

372
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,750
SO, UH, YEAH.
MY NAME'S IKETANI,

373
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,375
I'M WITH THIS GROUP
OF STREET RACERS

374
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,333
CALLED THE AKINA SPEED STARS.

375
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,708
YOU EVER HEARD OF US?

376
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,250
THERE'S LIKE A CRAZY RUMOR
MAKIN' THE ROUNDS LATELY

377
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,833
ABOUT THE FASTEST DOWNHILL RACER
ON AKINA OWNING A TOFU SHOP

378
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,625
AND TOOLIN' AROUND IN AN
BATTERED OLD 8-6 OR SOMETHING.

379
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,958
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU KIDS
COME UP WITH THIS STUFF,

380
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,000
BUT YOU'RE BARKIN' UP
THE WRONG TREE.

381
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,833
- COME ON, DON'T FEED ME
THAT LINE.

382
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,125
I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THIS CITY
AND YOUR TOFU SHOP'S

383
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,750
THE ONLY ONE WITH
AN 8-6 PARKED OUTSIDE.

384
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,375
- A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEN.

385
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,500
- OH. RIGHT. UH...

386
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,208
- Bunta: MUCH OBLIGED.

387
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,500
- Iketani: LISTEN, I'VE
KINDA GOT MY BACK

388
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,791
AGAINST THE WALL HERE, MAN.

389
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,125
ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO
IS HEAR ME OUT.

390
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,208
JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE
MINUTES OF YOUR TIME, OKAY?

391
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,416
- Bunta: IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED,
I'M RUNNIN' A BUSINESS HERE.

392
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,708
- HOW BUSY CAN YOU BE?
I'M THE ONLY CUSTOMER IN HERE!

393
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,125
- WOW. WAY TO WIN ME OVER BY
BADMOUTHIN' MY LIVELIHOOD.

394
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,250
- SORRY... THAT WAS THE
DESPERATION TALKING.

395
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,250
TRUTH IS, OUR TEAM'S
BEEN CHALLENGED.

396
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,208
A TIMED-ATTACK AGAINST THESE
JERKS CALLED THE AKAGI RED SUNS.

397
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,083
BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL
YOU THAT THESE GUYS

398
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,958
BELONG TO A CLASS
ALL TO THEMSELVES.

399
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,166
NO ONE ON THE SPEED STARS
CAN HOLD A CANDLE TO 'EM.

400
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,833
BUT THIS IS OUR MOUNTAIN.
WE CAN'T LET 'EM WALTZ IN HERE

401
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,916
AND WIPE THE FLOOR WITH US.

402
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,208
- AND WHAT EXACTLY AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT?

403
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,541
- MR FUJIWARA, PLEASE TEACH ME

404
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,500
TO DRIVE MOUNT AKINA'S
DOWNHILL LIKE YOU.

405
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,125
- I'M SORRY. THAT'S JUST
NOT POSSIBLE.

406
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,750
- BUT YOU'RE MY LAST HOPE.

407
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,250
JUST HELP ME SHAVE A FRACTION
OF A SECOND OFF MY TIME.

408
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,958
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

409
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,125
- I EMPATHIZE, BUT
EXPERIENCE TELLS ME

410
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,333
YOU CAN'T IMPROVE THAT MUCH
IN JUST A COUPLE DAYS.

411
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,541
TAKIN' THE MOUNTAIN
REQUIRES YEARS OF PRACTICE.

412
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,375
AND I'M TALKIN'
OBSESSIVE PRACTICE,

413
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,458
ESPECIALLY ON THE DOWNHILL.

414
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,000
BACK IN THE OLD DAYS,
YOU BETTER BELIEVE

415
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,000
I WAS ATTACKING THAT PASS
TOOTH AND NAIL

416
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,541
EVEN IN MY SLEEP.

417
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,791
TECHNIQUE CAN'T BE LEARNED LIKE
TYING YOUR SHOES

418
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,208
OR CHANGIN' A FLAT TIRE.

419
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,750
IT'S SOMETHIN' YOU GOTTA
FIGURE OUT FOR YOURSELF.

420
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,291
I'M SORRY, KID.
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME, OKAY?

421
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,333
- YEAH, WHATEVER. I'LL BE BACK.

422
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,958
- ( engine starting )

423

"OBSESSIVE PRACTICE".

424
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,500
WHAT'S THE OLD MAN THINK I'VE
BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME?

425
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,208
IF THAT'S ALL IT TOOK
I'D OWN THIS COURSE BY NOW.

426
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:11,041
MAN! I JUST DON'T GET IT.
WHAT THE HELL AM I DOIN' WRONG?

427
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,750
( gasps )

428
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,541
CRAP! GO TO THE INSIDE!

429

443
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,583
OUR GUEST TODAY IS THE OWNER OF
FUJIWARA'S TOFU SHOP,

444
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,833
MR. BUNTA FUJIWARA HIMSELF.

445
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,416
- Bunta: HMPH.

446
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,875
- SO, MR. F, LET ME MAKE SURE
I'VE GOT MY HEAD AROUND THIS.

447
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,833
ACCORDING TO YOU,
GOOD DRIVING TECHNIQUE

448
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,000
IS NOT SO MUCH PASSED DOWN

449
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,041
AS IT IS DISCOVERED,
AM I CORRECT?

450
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,083
THAT WAS A PRETTY COOL WAY
OF PUTTING IT, ACTUALLY.

451
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,750
- Bunta: UH, YEAH...

452
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,208
- ANYTHING COMING UP
NEXT EPISODE

453

YOU WANNA GIVE OUR AUDIENCE
THE INSIDE TRACK ON?

454
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,375
- HOW 'BOUT THEY JUST
WATCH FOR THEMSELVES?

455
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,500
- OH. VERY GOOD ADVICE, SIR.
