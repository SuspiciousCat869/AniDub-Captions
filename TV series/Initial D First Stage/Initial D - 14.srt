- HE BUMPED ME FROM BEHIND
RIGHT BEFORE A CORNER.

15
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT BASTARD
DID IT TO US AGAIN.

16
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,000
- I'LL DO IT.

17
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,333
GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH OR
WHATEVER. I DON'T CARE.

18
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,458
I'M TAKING HIM ON.

19
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,250
- Iketani: TAKUMI HOLD UP! WAIT!

20
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,250
CRAP, I'M SORRY!

21
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,875
DON'T LET HIM DRAG YOU IN!
THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST

22
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,041
A SORRY EXCUSE FOR RACING!
DON'T FALL FOR IT!

23
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,125
- IF IT'S A TRAP, FINE.
BUT THERE'S NO WAY

24
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,625
HE'S GETTING AWAY WITH THIS.

25
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:17,375
- Man 1: GOOD MORNIN'!
- Iketani: RIGHT THIS WAY, SIR!

26
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,208
WILL THAT BE REGULAR
OR SUPER UNLEADED?

27
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,416
HOLD ON, WE'LL BE RIGHT WITH YA!

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,708
- HAND ME YOUR ASHTRAY
AND I'LL EMPTY IT OUT FOR YA.

29
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,750
- SAY WHAT? TAKUMI'S DOING
A GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH?

30
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,916
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WOULD AGREE
TO THAT. WHAT A STUPID IDEA.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,083
- I'M PRETTY SURE
HE SNAPPED AFTER ALL

32
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,666
THAT HAPPENED TO ITSUKI.

33
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,375
I MEAN, I KNOW HOW HE FEELS BUT
HE'S JUST ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE.

34
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,583
- WAIT, TODAY'S SATURDAY.
WHERE IS HE?

35
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,958
- HE TOOK THE DAY OFF.
AND WITH ITSUKI IN THE HOSPITAL.

36
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,041
WE'RE RUNNIN' SHORTHANDED TODAY.

37
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,083
- LOOK, TAKUMI'S GREAT
AT THE DOWNHILLS.

38
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,041
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT HIM
DOIN' IT WITH ONE HAND.

39
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,916
- TELL YOU WHAT.
AFTER WORK I'LL TRACK HIM DOWN

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,250
AND TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

41
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,166
- I'M WITH YOU,
HE SHOULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT.

42
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,583
- COOL.

43
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,958
- ( horn blowing )

44
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,250
- HERE. MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.
HOW YOU DOIN' TODAY!

45
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,041
- THE WORLD WOULD
BE A DARK PLACE

46
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,583
IF NOBODY HAD A
SENSE OF JUSTICE.

47
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,541
SO I CAN'T BLAME TAKUMI
FOR ACCEPTING THE CHALLENGE.

48
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,750
LIKE IT OR NOT, THERE'S NO
STOPPING HIM NOW.

49
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,208
I WONDER IF WE COULD
FORCE HIM NOT TO RACE.

50
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,250
IT'S TOO MUCH OF A RISK
GOING UP AGAINST AN FF.

51
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,791
- Natsuki: YOU SURPRISED ME
THIS MORNING.

52
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,500
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE EVER CALLED ME.

53
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,125
WHAT MADE YOU DO IT?

54
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,583
- I'VE BEEN UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING LATELY.

55
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,583
WHILE I WAS TRYING TO
SORT IT ALL OUT IN MY HEAD,

56
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,041
AN IMAGE OF YOU POPPED UP
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE.

57
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,958
IT HELPED ME RELAX.

58
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,583
- WELL I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU CALLED!

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,833
SO HOW'S ITSUKI DOING?
IS HE FEELING ANY BETTER?

60
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,916
- HE WAS WEARING HIS SEATBELT
SO IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS,

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,708
BUT THE DOC'S GONNA
HOLD HIM ANOTHER DAY OR TWO.

62
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,291
HE STILL WANTS TO DO
SOME MORE TESTS.

63
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,666
- I THINK I MIGHT GO VISIT HIM
AND TRY TO CHEER HIM UP.

64
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,625
- YEAH. I THINK HE WOULD
LIKE THAT.

65
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,500
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
YOU'RE ACTING STRANGE.

66
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,166
- HUH? OH. SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,208
- YOU SEEM DIFFERENT.

68
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,958
DON'T WORRY THOUGH.
I STILL LIKE YOU.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,250
- Keisuke: HEY! BRO!

70
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,916
- WHAT'S UP?

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,583
- I JUST HEARD SHINGO, THE
NUMBER TWO FROM THE NIGHT KIDS,

72
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,833
CHALLENGED AKINA'S EIGHT SIX
TO A GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH

73
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,666
AND HE ACCEPTED!

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,833
- WHAT?

75
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,375
- HE'S GONNA BE GOING UP
AGAINST AN EG-SIX.

76
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,375
WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON
IN THAT SKULL OF HIS?

77
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,666
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT
A GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH

78
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,750
IS AN FR KILLER,

79
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,333
RIGHT? THAT RACE IS SET UP
FOR AN FF.

80
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,083
HE WON'T STAND
A SNOWBALL'S CHANCE IN HELL!

81
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,125
- OF COURSE NOT,
THAT'S COMMON SENSE.

82
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,375
- RIGHT?

83
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,208
- BUT NOW HE'S IN
A RACING MINDSET.

84
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,083
FOR A GUY LIKE HIM,
WHENEVER HE RACES,

85
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,166
COMMON SENSE FLIES
RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW.

86
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,083
- YOU WANNA GO?
CHECK OUT THE ACTION?

87
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,291
- Iketani: EXCUSE ME.

88
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,166
- SORRY KID, SHOP'S CLOSED.

89
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,916
AND WE SOLD OUTTA FRIED TOFU
AN HOUR AGO.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,125
- YEAH, WE'RE NOT HERE
FOR FRIED TOFU.

91
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,000
WE CAME TO SEE TAKUMI.

92
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,708
- AH. HE TOOK OFF
IN THE EIGHT-SIX.

93
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,750
HEADED OUT THIS AFTERNOON

94
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,041
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HIM SINCE.

95
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,583
SORRY, I CAN'T HELP YA.

96
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,500
- LISTEN WE WERE WONDERIN'.
YOU EVER HAPPEN TO RACE

97
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,875
IN A GUM TAPE DEATH
MATCH BEFORE?

98
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,041
- SURE, A LONG TIME AGO.

99
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,666
- WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
IF TAKUMI RACED IN ONE?

100
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,458
- TAKUMI?

101
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,458
HE'S STILL GOT A LOT TO LEARN
WHEN IT COMES TO RACING.

102
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,458
I COULD SEE HIM
FLYING OFF A CLIFF.

103
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,750
- COME ON, THERE'S A FEW MORE
PLACES WE CAN LOOK.

104
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,000
- YEAH. ONE MORE THING.

105
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,333
IF HE DOES COME HOME,

106
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,583
DO WHATEVER YOU CAN
TO CONVINCE HIM NOT TO RACE.

107
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,625
PLEASE. WE'VE GOT A BAD FEELING.

108
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,958
THANKS A LOT!

109
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,125
- AH, BOY. A GOOD OLD
GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH.

110
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,333
- 'BOUT TIME
WE GOT MOVING, SHINGO.

111
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,458
- YEAH.

112
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,166
OKAY AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX,
I'M WAITING FOR YA.

113
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,750
VICTORY WILL BE MINE.

114
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,708
AND JUST SO YOU'RE PREPARED,
CALL FOR HELP AHEAD OF TIME

115
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,583
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA END UP
AT THE BOTTOM OF A RAVINE.

116
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,625
- GUESS I'LL SEE YA LATER.

117
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,666
- ARE YOU GOING
TO CALL ME TOMORROW?

118
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,291
- OKAY. SURE.

119
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,166
- ALL RIGHT.

120
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,416
- MAN, THERE'S A TON
OF PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT.

121
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,708
- I KNOW. I WAS HOPING IT'D BE
A MUCH SMALLER CROWD.

122
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,291
WE CAME HERE TO TALK HIM
OUT OF IT,

123
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,000
BUT IT WON'T BE EASY WITH
ALL THESE PEOPLE HANGIN' AROUND.

124
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,000
- Man 2: LOOK! IT'S THE
NIGHT KIDS! THEY'RE HERE!

125
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,125
- ( tires screeching )

126
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,250
- WHY DO I ONLY SEE YOU
AND YOUR SLOW-ASS S-THIRTEEN?

127
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,166
WHERE'S THE GHOST OF AKINA?

128
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,625
- IGNORE HIM.

129
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,833
MAN, I HOPE HE GETS HERE SOON.

130
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,250
- HE KNOWS IT'S
HAPPENING AT TEN.

131
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,000
HE SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE NOW.

132
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,291
- Man 2: CHECK IT OUT!
HERE HE COMES!

133
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,458
THE EIGHT-SIX OF MOUNT AKINA!

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,250
- Shingo: FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP?

135
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,458
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

136
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,750
- TAKUMI. IT'S NOT
TOO LATE YA KNOW.

137
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,291
DON'T RACE THIS JERK,
IT ISN'T WORTH IT.

138
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,083
- WHY SHOULDN'T I?
I'VE GOT THIS IN THE BAG.

139
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,791
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE TO HIM.

140
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,250
- BUT THE DUDE DRIVES AN FF!
YOU HAVE TO HAVE KNOWN THAT!

141
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,125
- YEAH, I REMEMBER NOW. YOU'RE
THE PUNK FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.

142
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,041
THANKS A LOT
FOR WASTING MY TIME.

143
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,791
NOW WHAT ARE YOU FAIRIES
BABBLING ABOUT?

144
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,541
'CAUSE I AM GONNA BE
ROYALLY PISSED

145
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,416
IF YOU'RE THINKIN' OF
BACKIN' OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE.

146
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,833
- I'M SORRY IKETANI.

147
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,500
I CAME TO RACE AND THAT'S
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

148
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,458
- IT'S ALMOST TEN. SHOULD BE
STARTIN' ANY MINUTE NOW.

149
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,583
( sighs ) MAN...

150
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:48,166
I BELIEVE IN YOU, TAKUMI.
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,791
WIN THIS ONE FOR ME!

152
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,541
- ( car starting )

153
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,416
- GOT A BAD FEELIN' ABOUT THIS.

154
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,333
MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE FORCED HIM
INTO THE TRUNK

155
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,541
AND DRIVEN HIM HOME.

156
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,916
- IT'S TOO LATE.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,916
ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS TRUST
HE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,250
- Man 3: WE'RE GOOD.

159
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,083
- THEY'RE ALL SET UP
DOWN AT THE FINISH LINE.

160
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,458
WE'RE READY WHENEVER YOU ARE.

161
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,041
- OKAY.

162
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:28,625
- ALRIGHT, GENTLEMEN! WE'RE
STARTING IN TEN, NINE, EIGHT,

163
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,250
SEVEN,

164
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,625
SIX, FIVE, FOUR,

165
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,833
THREE, TWO,

166
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,333
ONE.

167
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,458
GO!

168
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,958
- ( tires screeching )

169
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,041
- ( sniggering )

170
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,166
- NO TURNIN' BACK NOW.

171
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,625
- TRY TO STAY COOL
OUT THERE, TAKUMI.

172
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,333
- ( scoffs ) I LIKE HOW SHINGO
EASED UP ON THE GAS

173
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,333
TO LET THE EIGHT-SIX
GO AHEAD AT THE START.

174
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,375
- HE PROBABLY DID IT SO
HE HAS A GOOD VIEW OF IT

175
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,875
SAILIN' OFF THE
CLIFF IN THAT FIRST TURN.

176
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,291
NO HUMAN BEING ALIVE
CAN DRIVE AN FR USIN' ONE HAND

177
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,125
WITHOUT CRASHIN' IT.

178
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,375
- HERE'S MY PREDICTION.

179
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,041
THE EIGHT-SIX DOESN'T
LAST THREE CORNERS.

180
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,500
- ( both sniggering )

181
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,083
- DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP, KID.

182
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,291
THE B-SIXTEEN-A ENGINE
IS THE BEST OUT THERE.

183
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,250
FACT IS, IF I'D WANTED TO BE
IN THE LEAD RIGHT NOW,

184
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,458
I WOULD BE.

185
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,041
YOUR FOUR-A-G ENGINE
IS WEAK OFF THE START.

186
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,041
I JUST WANNA SEE HOW YOU
HANDLE THESE FIRST FEW CORNERS

187
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,083
BEFORE I MAKE MY MOVE.

188
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,166
INITIAL D.

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,541
INITIAL D!

190
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,625
- ( beeping )

191
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,958
- GOTTA WONDER IF THERE'S
ANY WAY HE CAN MAKE IT

192
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,791
THROUGH THOSE CORNERS.

193
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,458
IT CAN'T BE EASY ONE-HANDED.

194
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,458
- LOOK. HERE THEY COME!

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,458
UH OH. KEEP AN EYE
ON THAT EIGHT-SIX.

196
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,375
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S COMING IN
WAY TOO HOT! THIS COULD BE BAD.

197
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:37,125
- HUH. LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING
SLOWER THAN HE NORMALLY DOES.

198
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,958
- YOU'VE GOT HEART.

199
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,583
BUT AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
SOMETHING IMPORTANT?

200
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,291
- ( tires screeching )

201
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,000
YES. IT'S ALREADY OVER.

202
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,333
- AH!

203
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,625
- THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.
I BARELY MADE IT THROUGH.

204
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,375
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SPRAIN
MY WRIST FOR A SECOND THERE.

205
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WAS ABLE
TO PULL OUTTA THAT!

206
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,375
- OH MAN. I THOUGHT THAT GUY
WAS GONNA PLOW RIGHT

207
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,958
INTO US FOR SURE!

208
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,500
- WOW. I'M GETTING TOO OLD
FOR THIS CRAP.

209
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,625
- WHAT'S GOING ON MAN?
LOOKS LIKE THAT FIRST TURN'S

210
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,291
MAKIN' YA HOLD BACK.

211
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,666
- ( tires screeching )

212
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:35,458
- I CAN'T JUST STAND HERE. LET'S
HOP IN THE CAR AND FOLLOW 'EM.

213
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,208
- DUDE, ARE YOU NUTS?
THE RACE STARTED TOO LONG AGO.

214
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,416
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
CATCH UP TO 'EM!

215
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,375
- I'M NOT GONNA TRY
TO CATCH UP TO THEM.

216
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,083
I JUST WANT TO BE CLOSE BY

217
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,666
IN CASE ANYTHING GOES
HORRIBLY WRONG.

218
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,958
THAT WAY
WE CAN REACH HIM QUICKER

219
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,083
IF HE NEEDS ANY HELP.
NOW COME ON!

220
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,625
- WELL, HANG ON! I'M COMING!

221
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,958
- ( beeping )

222
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,208
- ( heart beating )

223
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,375
- FINALLY. I'M GETTING THE HANG
OF THIS ONE-HANDED THING.

227
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,416

CLEARING EACH OF THE CORNERS

228
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,291
WITH BARELY
ANY COUNTER-STEERING.

229
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,375
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

230
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,708
A GUM TAPE DEATH
MATCH ISN'T SOMETHING

231
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,250
YOU JUST LEARN OVERNIGHT.

THE SAFER YOU DRIVE, THE DEEPER
INTO THE HOLE YOU SINK.

233
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,000
AGGRESSIVENESS IS THE KEY.

234
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,000
I MUST'VE SPENT
DOZENS OF HOURS TRAINING MYSELF

235
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,958
FOR THIS TYPE OF RACE

I LOVE IT!

TO SEE THE EIGHT-SIX
IN A GIGANTIC FIREBALL.

I'M PUTTIN' ALL THIS PRESSURE ON
HIM AND HE ISN'T EVEN REACTING.

280
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,666
HE WAS UNSTABLE AT THE START
BUT THE FARTHER WE GO

OF THEM HAVE CRASHED

287

THIS RACE ONE-HANDED,

288
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,541
THEN I WOULD'VE BEEN
WRONG ABOUT HIM.

289
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,291

A FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT

298
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,458
INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC

299
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,250
WITHOUT EVER LEAVING HIS LANE!
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE TECHNIQUE!

300
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,583
- AND HE MADE IT LOOK LIKE

301

IT WAS THE EASIEST
THING IN THE WORLD.

302

HE DIDN'T EVEN SHOW
AN IOTA OF PANIC

WHEN HE MANEUVERED
AROUND THE ONCOMING CAR.

WONDER IF HIS HAND'S

REALLY TAPED TO THE WHEEL

306
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,250
FOR ALL WE KNOW HE TOOK IT OFF

307
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,625
AFTER THAT CLOSE CALL
AT THE FIRST CORNER.

308
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,041
- IT IS POSSIBLE,

309
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,458
BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE
GIVING HIM MUCH CREDIT.

310
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,166
I'M GUESSING THAT HE JUST
ADAPTED TO THE SITUATION.

311
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,208
- THAT FAST?

312
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,166
- BY SHIFTING THE CAR'S WEIGHT
WITHOUT RELYING ON THE STEERING,

313
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,041
HE WAS ABLE TO ATTACK
THE CORNERS IN HIS NORMAL STYLE.

314
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,291
IT DIDN'T TAKE HIM LONG
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

FOR MUCH LONGER, PUNK.

318
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,666
I'D LOOK LIKE A FOOL IF I LOST

TALKIN' I DID.

TO DO TO GET A WIN.
