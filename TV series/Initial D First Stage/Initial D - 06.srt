SPEED ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS.

18
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,541
I'LL LET HIM CATCH UP.

19
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:14,375
R32, GTR. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE
HOW MUCH THIS GUY'S GOT TO GIVE.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,750
- THAT'S HOW WE'RE PLAYING?
THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO KNOW.

21
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,958
- ( tires screeching )

22
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,625
- YOU SURE IT'S ALL
RIGHT TO DROP YOU OFF

23
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,666
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

24
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,208
- Natsuki: UH, YEAH.
IT'LL BE FINE.

25
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,500
THAT'S MY HOUSE RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET.

26
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,708
YOU SAID THIS WAS A PRETTY
JUNKY RIDE YOU JUST USED

27
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,583
FOR YOUR DAD'S WORK.

28
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,541
BUT I ACTUALLY LIKE IT.

29
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,833
IT RUNS REALLY GOOD AND IT'S
SMALL AND KIND OF CUTE.

30
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,583
LIKE YOU.
WHAT KIND OF CAR IS IT ANYWAY?

31
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,083
- A TRUENO.

32
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,458
- A TRUENO? WELL, WE SHOULD GO
FOR A SPIN AGAIN SOMETIME.

33
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,833
I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME
WITH YOU TODAY, TAKUMI.

34
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,875
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL
LATER, OKAY?

35
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,625
- DID YOU HEAR THAT, GIRL?
SHE CALLED US CUTE.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,458
- ( tires screeching )

37
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,208
- KEEPING UP WITH RYOSUKE
TAKAHASHI AIN'T NOTHING.

38
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,750
I KNOW MY GTR IS BETTER THAN
ANYTHING THESE GUYS ARE PUSHING.

39
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:08,000
HE MIGHT BE A DECENT DRIVER, BUT
WITH THAT OUTDATED FC OF HIS,

40
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,875
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE
WAS ALREADY HITTING HIS LIMIT.

41
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,083
- NICE DRIVING. MY NAME'S
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

42
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,541
I'M WITH THE AKAGI REDSUNS.

43
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,125
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M TAKESHI NAKAZATO.

44
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,583
I RACE WITH A TEAM CALLED THE
NIGHT KIDS OUT OF MOUNT MYOGI.

45
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,375
- NAKAZATO OF THE NIGHT KIDS.
I'VE HEARD OF YOU BEFORE.

46
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,625
YOU'RE THE FASTEST STREET RACER
ON MOUNT MYOGI'S DOWNHILL.

47
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,541
- YOU KNOW, I'VE GOTTA
ADMIT IT'S A REAL HONOR

48
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,416
TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE GREAT
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

49
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,583
- ONLY THING IS, I'M ALMOST SURE
I'VE HEARD YOU DRIVE

50
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,541
SOMETHING OTHER THAN THIS.

51
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,458
I BELIEVE IT WAS AN S13,
IF MEMORY SERVES.

52
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,958
( scoffs ) NOT THAT IT MATTERS,
BUT I'VE GOTTA ASK,

53
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,625
WHAT'S A STREET RACER FROM MYOGI
DOING HERE ON SUCH A NIGHT?

54
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,208
- YOU'VE ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE
A PRETTY SMART GUY, RYOSUKE,

55
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,541
SO LET'S CUT THE CRAP, OKAY?

56
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,250
YOU AND ME CAME OUT HERE FOR
THE SAME REASON,

57
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,708
AND I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT THAT REASON IS.

58
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,041
WE WANTED TO RUN INTO THE
EIGHT-SIX FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.

59
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,875
IT GOT YOU INTRIGUED, DIDN'T IT?

60
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,750
- ( scoffs ) WELL, WHAT DO YOU
KNOW, A GUY IN A SWEET THREE-TWO

61
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,083
TRYING TO TAKE A BITE
OUT OF THE EIGHT-SIX.

62
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,750
THINK YOUR 380 HORSEPOWER ENGINE
WILL BE ENOUGH?

63
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,083
- WHAT?
- I CAN TELL THAT

64
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,291
BY JUST LOOKING AT HER.
AT THE EXHAUST PIPE,

65
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,833
THE POWER SHE CAN REACH
ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS.

66
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,541
KIND OF THING'S HARD TO MISS.

67
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,000
ON THE UPHILL THE EIGHT-SIX IS
NO MATCH FOR THIS MACHINE.

68
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,458
BUT IF WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE DOWNHILL,

69
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,875
THERE'S NO WAY IN
HEAVEN OR EARTH

70
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,958
YOU'RE EVER GONNA BEAT
THAT EIGHT-SIX IN THE THREE-TWO.

71
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,250
- THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING?

72
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,291
THAT MY RIDE CAN'T HOLD UP
TO THE DOWNHILL?

73
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,000
THAT I'LL LOSE TO THAT WANNABE?

74
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,625
- IT'S NOT A PERSONAL ATTACK.
I'M JUST VOICING MY OPINION

75
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,416
BASED ON MY KNOWLEDGE
OF BOTH CARS.

76
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,416
- RIGHT. I THINK THE REAL
PROBLEM IS YOUR LACK OF NERVE.

77
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,541
YOUR KID BROTHER MIGHT'VE LOST
ON THE DOWNHILL,

78
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,333
BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO
GET ALL INTIMIDATED

79
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,416
BY SOME FREAKIN' RUST
BUCKET EIGHT-SIX.

80
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,750
- I THINK ONCE YOU RACE
AGAINST IT,

81
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,416
THIS'LL START TO MAKE A
LITTLE MORE SENSE.

82
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,833
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S
GONNA BE ABLE TO BEAT HIM.

83
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,791
- IF YOU'RE TRYING SOME KIND OF
REVERSE-PSYCHOLOGY THING ON ME,

84
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,625
YOU CAN FORGET IT. I DON'T EVER
WALK AWAY FROM A CHALLENGE.

85
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,333
I AM GONNA DESTROY
THAT EIGHT-SIX

86
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,666
AND WIPE THAT SMUG GRIN
OFF YOUR FACE!

87
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,708
I'LL MAKE YOU REMEMBER THE DAY
YOU MET TAKESHI NAKAZATO!

88
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:22,083
THAT CRAP ROTARY IS NO MATCH
FOR MY THREE-TWO!

89
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,583
- ( car door closes
and car drives off )

90
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,750
- I'M ALMOST SURE
I'VE HEARD YOU DRIVE

91
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,083
SOMETHING OTHER THAN THIS.

92
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,583
AN S13, IF MEMORY SERVES.

93
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,833
- DON'T ACT LIKE YOU KNOW ME.
I'VE CHANGED A LOT SINCE THEN.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,708
- Takeshi: ( voiceover )
DAMN! I CAN'T PASS IT!

95
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,083
I CAN GET CLOSE IN THE CORNERS,

96
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,375
BUT HE LOSES ME
IN THE STRAIGHTAWAYS.

97
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,416
I HAVE BETTER TECHNIQUE
AS A RACER.

98
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,250
I KNOW IT! HOW AM I
LOSING TO THIS GUY?

99
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,583
WITH THIS S13 I CAN'T BEAT A
THREE-TWO, NO MATTER WHAT I DO.

100
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,458
I WAS THE FASTEST STREET RACER
ON MOUNT MYOGI'S DOWNHILL

101
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,041
AND LOOK AT ME NOW.

102
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:48,041
THIS IS PATHETIC. LOSING TO A
THREE-TWO THAT CAN'T EVEN DRIFT.

103
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,083
- Ryosuke: ( voiceover )
ALL CARS HAVE THEIR LIMITS.

104
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,750
NO MATTER HOW KILLER
THE DRIVER IS,

105
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,458
NO ONE CAN DRIVE BEYOND WHAT
THE CAR'S GOT SET IN ITS STEEL.

106
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,458
NOT EVEN THAT EIGHT-SIX.

107
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,375
- Takumiitsuki: MORNING, GUYS!

108
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,791
- HEY!

109
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,416
- Takumi: HERE,
GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

110
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,916
- COOL. SO, WHAT IS IT?

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,750
- Takumi: SOME FRIED TOFU.
IT'S LEFT OVER FROM YESTERDAY.

112
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,583
MY DAD TOLD ME I SHOULD BRING IT
TO YOU. HE SAID YOU LIKED IT.

113
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,708
- TELL HIM THANKS.

114
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,500
I'LL PUT THIS IN THE FRIDGE
FOR YOU.

115
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,708
- WOW. MADE A BETTER IMPRESSION
THAN I THOUGHT. ( laughs )

116
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,625
- HEY, TAKUMI?
- YEAH?

117
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,750
- IS IT TRUE YOU'VE BEEN
DELIVERIN' TOFU TO LAKE AKINA

118
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,416
FOR LIKE THE PAST FIVE YEARS?

119
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,375
- THAT'S RIGHT, ABOUT THAT LONG.

120
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,041
- COME ON, I THOUGHT YOU AND ME
WERE CLOSER THAN THAT, MAN.

121
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,416
SO, WHY THE BIG SECRET?

122
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,041
- BECAUSE IF I HAD
TALKED ABOUT IT AT ALL,

123
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,375
MY OLD MAN MIGHT'VE GOTTEN
INTO TROUBLE.

124
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,000
DON'T YOU THINK?

125
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,708
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT, I GUESS.

126
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,791
FIVE YEARS AGO WE STARTED
JUNIOR HIGH.

127
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,000
BACK THEN, I SEEM TO REMEMBER
THAT TROUBLE HAD A WAY

128
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,083
OF FINDING US ANYWAY.

129
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,000
- YOU'VE DRIVEN A LOT LONGER
THAN ME. SINCE JUNIOR HIGH,

130
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,250
YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING EVERY
DAY ON MOUNT AKINA.

131
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,291
SNOW, RAIN, NOTHING MATTERED.

132
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,000
YOU GOT OUT THERE AND YOU DROVE.

133
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,166
- SURE, BEFORE DAWN.

134
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,875
NOBODY ELSE IS ON THE
ROAD. NO BIG DEAL.

135
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,791
- I DON'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT. THOSE CORNERS!

136
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,083
I MEAN, WEREN'T YOU SCARED?

137
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,333
I'D FLIP MY LID!

138
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,041
- OH. WELL, WHEN I FIRST
STARTED, YEAH, I WAS.

139
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,541
BUT IN SIX MONTHS,
THE FEAR WAS GONE.

140
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,666
I NOTICED RIGHT AWAY THAT
THE TIRES SLIPPED NATURALLY

141
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,041
WHEN I'D ACCELERATE,

142
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,583
BUT I THINK IT TOOK ANOTHER
SIX MONTHS OR SO BEFORE

143
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,541
I FELT LIKE I HAD
ANY CONTROL OVER IT.

144
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,125
- THEN YOU MASTERED THE DOWNHILL
IN ONLY ABOUT A YEAR.

145
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,458
IS THAT RIGHT?

146
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,708
- WELL, BEING ON IT EVERY DAY,

147
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,583
THE NERVOUSNESS VANISHED
PRETTY QUICKLY.

148
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,875
I HAD NOTHING ELSE
TO DO OUT THERE,

149
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,708
SO WHEN I STARTED GETTING
BORED WITH THE DRIVE

150
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,791
I'D SEE HOW CLOSE I COULD GET

151
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,125
TO THE GUARDRAILS
WITHOUT TOUCHING.

152
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,750
- ( gasps ) THAT'S INSANE!
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

153
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,083
- I WOULDN'T CALL IT INSANE.

154
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,916
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER WRECKED
AND AT MY BEST,

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,916
I CAN GET AS CLOSE AS A
CENTIMETER OR SO

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,916
TO THE GUARDRAIL.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,916
- ARE YOU FOR REAL?

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,916
- Takumi: ( voiceover ) DRIVING
THE SAME ROUTE OVER AND OVER

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,916
FOR MY DAD EVERY DAY
GETS SUPER BORING.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,708
UNLESS I CAN FIND SOMETHING
TO DO TO BREAK UP THE ROUTINE.

161
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,125
WHICH IS WHY I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D WANT TO IMPROVE AS A DRIVER.

162
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,708
DIDN'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT IT
TO WANT TO.

163
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,291
BUT YOU KNOW, I GET IMPATIENT
AND I'D WANNA GET HOME

164
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,750
OR TO SCHOOL, WHEREVER, FASTER,

165
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,916
SO I'D TRY GOIN' AS
FAST AS I COULD.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,583
- WAIT. THERE ONE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

167
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,916
- WHAT'S THAT?

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,333
- HOW IS IT YOU CAN DRIVE WITH
A CARLOAD OF TOFU?

169
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,583
GO TOO FAST,
YOU COULD DAMAGE YOUR HAUL.

170
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,250
- I DON'T HAVE MUCH SPEED
ON THE UPHILL, SO IT'S COOL.

171
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,166
AND MY DAD PUTS A PAPER CUP FULL
OF WATER IN MY CUP HOLDER.

172
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,666
SAYS IF I CAN DRIVE
WITHOUT IT SPILLING,

173
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,750
THEN I WON'T DAMAGE
THE TOFU IN BACK.

174
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,750
DOESN'T MATTER
HOW FAST I'M GOING.

175
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,750
- Yuuichi: AH.

176
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,250
- THE FIRST FEW TIMES
I TRIED IT,

177
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,791
I DIDN'T THINK I'D EVER GET
THE HANG OF IT.

178
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,833
EVEN DRIVING SLOW,
I'D SPILL WATER ALL OVER MYSELF.

179
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,875
- HMM. I'D IMAGINE SO.

180
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,458
- Takumi: THE BRAKE, STEERING
WHEEL, SHIFTER, GAS PEDAL,

181
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,416
IF EVEN ONE OF THEM MOVES A
LITTLE ROUGH, THE WATER SPILLS.

182
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,458
DAD WOULD SAY CRAP LIKE,
"ROLL THE WATER IN THE CUP."

183
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,666
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE AT FIRST,
BUT I LEARNED.

184
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,625
- WHAT'S "ROLL THE WATER
IN THE CUP" MEAN?

185
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,708
- SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE
SURFACE TENSION OF THE WATER.

186
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,875
IT'LL ONLY STRETCH SO FAR

187
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,375
BEFORE IT SPILLS.

188
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,750
SO YOU HAVE TO ROLL THE WATER
AROUND THE RIM OF THE CUP.

189
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,000
AT EACH CORNER I ROLL THE WATER
TO THE EDGE OF THE RIM

190
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,791
AS I DRIVE UP THE HILL.

191
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,791
IT DID TAKE ME A LITTLE WHILE
TO BE ABLE TO DRIFT

192
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,208
WITHOUT SPILLING THE WATER.

193
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,208
IT SEEMED LIKE FOREVER,
BUT I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.

194
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,583
- DRIFTING WITHOUT SPILLING?

195
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,166
YOU MEAN YOU CAN ACTUALLY
DO THAT CRAP?

196
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,000
- YOU BETTER NOT BE LYING TO US,
TAKUMI! YOU HEAR ME?

197
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,291
- THE PRIMARY CONTROL POINT
WHEN IT COMES TO ANY CAR

198
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,416
IS THE CENTER OF BALANCE.
THAT'S THE STARTING POINT.

199
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,250
- Iketani: ( voiceover ) THE
DRIFT KING, KEICHI-I TSUCHIYA,

200
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,083
SAYS SO IN HIS VIDEO.

201
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,708
- Yuuichi: ( voiceover ) IT'S
NOT AN EASY TRICK.

202
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,416
TO DRIVE WITHOUT
SPILLING THAT WATER,

203
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,916
TAKUMI WOULD HAVE TO
HAVE MASTERED

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,750
THE EIGHT-SIX'S
CENTER OF BALANCE.

205
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,083
FORGET ANYTHING ABOUT DRIFTING.

206
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,500
- ( grunting )

207
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,208
- THAT KIND OF THING
IS IMPOSSIBLE! LIAR!

208
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,083
- Takumi: I'M NOT LYING!

209
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,458
- YOU BEAT KEISUKE. SO?

210
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,541
WHAT, NOW YOU ACT LIKE YOU
KNOW EVERYTHING?

211
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,625
- ( screams )
- OH, A CUSTOMER.

212
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,625
HOW YOU DOING? CAN I FILL HER
UP WITH HIGH OCTANE FOR YOU?

213
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,583
- Customer: THANKS,
THAT'D BE GREAT.

214
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,000
- ( voiceover ) AMAZING, BUNTA.

215
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,666
YOUR BOY'S TECHNIQUE
IS WAY ABOVE

216
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,666
JUST A REGULAR MOUNTAIN RACER.

217
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,791
- GOODBYE, AND...

218
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,375
- ( both ) THANK YOU
FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

219
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,375
- TAKUMI, I NEED TO ASK YOU
A FAVOR.

220
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,291
WOULD YOU LET ME RIDE IN
THE PASSENGER SEAT

221
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,083
WHEN YOU DO THE NEXT DOWNHILL
RUN AT AKINA?

222
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,916
- INITIAL D!

223
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,291
- INITIAL D!

224
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:37,250
- Bunta: YOU WANT TO USE
THE CAR? AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

225
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,666
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D LET ME
ANYWAY. FORGET ABOUT IT.

226
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,208
NOT A BIG DEAL.
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

227
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,958
- DID YOU HEAR ME SAY, "NO?"

228
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,083
- WELL, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT
IF YOU WERE GONNA USE IT.

229
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,166
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T NEED IT
FOR ANYTHING TONIGHT?

230
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,500
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE A MEETING

231
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,625
AT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
OR SOME OTHER REASON.

232
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,375
MAYBE YOU NEED
A LITTLE TIME TO THINK.

233
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,583
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

234
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,833
SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK
YOU'LL BE IN TROUBLE

235
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,333
IF I DON'T HAVE TO USE IT.

236
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,500
- WHAT? NO. NO,
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

237
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,416
- FINE. THEN TAKE THE CAR.
BUT DON'T FORGET,

238
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,583
THAT MEANS I'M RELYING ON YOU

239
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,250
TO PICK ME UP
FROM MY MEETING LATER.

240
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,666
- UH, OKAY, SO YOU REALLY
DO HAVE A MEETING.

241
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,583
- ( engine starting )

242
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,666
- ( laughing )

243
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,541
- LOOK AT ME, MAN.
I'M ALL NERVOUS.

244
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,166
LIKE I'M ABOUT TO GET ON THE
HUGE ROLLER COASTER AT THE PARK.

245
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,166
- OH, MAN. I'M ALL JEALOUS.
YOU ARE SO LUCKY. SERIOUSLY.

246
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,791
- HE'S JUST RIDING IN
A CAR, YOU GUYS.

247
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,416
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
GOING TO THE MOON.

248
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,333
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE GOT THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

249
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,958
- RIGHT ON! READY WHEN YOU
ARE. TEAR IT UP, MAN!

250
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,250
NOW BACK AWAY FROM THE
CAR, YOU LOSERS.

251
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,250
- ( engine revving )

252
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,708
- HE'S GONNA HAVE
THE TIME OF HIS LIFE.

253
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,958
- OH, MAN. I'M FREAKING JEALOUS.
YOU ARE SO LUCKY. SERIOUSLY.

254
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,958
- ( engine revving
in the distance )

255
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,208
- Iketani: ( voiceover ) THE
FIRST CORNER IS COMING UP SOON.

256
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,916
I'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT
HE'S DOING DIFFERENT FROM ME

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,791
AS SOON AS HE TAKES IT.
THEN I'LL STEAL THE TECHNIQUE.

258
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,250
HEY! WAIT! WHOA! TAKUMI, BRAKE!

259
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,083
( screaming )

260
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,083
( voiceover) HOW CAN HE CONTROL
THE CAR LIKE THIS?

261
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,916
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?

262
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,875
- WHOAH.

263
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,000
- ( Iketani screaming )

264
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,208
THE SPEEDOMETER WARNING SOUND
IS ON. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

265
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,708
THAT MEANS WE'RE MOVING AT
OVER 100 KILOMETERS AN HOUR.

266
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,791
AND WE'RE COMING UP
ON THE NEXT CORNER.

267
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,958
- HUH?

268
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,916
- HOLD UP. WHAT THE HELL
THEY DOING BACK HERE ALREADY?

269
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,291
- MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPENED.

270
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,083
IT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO BE BACK
FROM THE BOTTOM.

271
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,541
( both gasp )

272
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
- Itsuki: IS HE UNCONSCIOUS?

273
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,583
TAKUMI!

274
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,875
WHICH CORNER DID THIS HAPPEN
TO HIM ON?

275
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,708
YEAH? THE THIRD ONE?

276
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,208
AH! I KNEW IT!

277
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,916
THE AGONIZED CRY OF
HIS LAST MOMENT

278
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,416
DURING THIS HORRIFYING DOWNHILL
ECHOED ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN!

279
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,333
POOR IKETANI.
IN THE THIRD CORNER...

280
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,333
TOTALLY PASSED OUT!

281
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,916
- THEN ALL OF THIS
HAS TO BE TRUE.

282
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,625
- UH, HEY, BOSS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

283
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,291
- ( laughs ) SEEING WHAT
YOU WERE UP TO.

284
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,083
( laughs )

285
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,625
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST HEAD ON HOME.

286
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,500
- Waitress:
TAKE YOUR TIME, BOYS.

287
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,875
- I'VE HEARD OF THAT GUY.
NAKAZATO OF THE NIGHT KIDS.

288
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,291
THERE'S NOBODY LEFT IN MYOGI

289
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,791
WHO'LL GO UP AGAINST HIM
ANYMORE. THE DUDE'S UNTOUCHABLE.

290
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,000
- IT'S HARD TO BE IMPRESSED
BY THE TECHNIQUE OF SOMEBODY

291
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,541
WHO DRIVES A THREE-TWO.

292
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,916
IN THAT RIDE, THE CAR DOES
MOST OF THE WORK FOR YOU ANYWAY.

293
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,083
- MAYBE NOT.

294
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,750
- WHAT? YOU THINK I'M
WRONG ABOUT THAT?

295
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,916
- HERE WE GO AGAIN.

296
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,791
WE KNOW YOU HATE THE
THREE-TWO, KEISUKE.

297
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,916
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

298
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,500
- AND RYOSUKE LIKES IT.

299
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:41,791
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S BAD FOR
NAKAZATO TO DEFEAT TAKUMI FIRST.

300
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,625
'CAUSE IF THEY TAKE
HIM BEFORE US,

301
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,333
THE NIGHT KIDS WILL BRAG
THEY BEAT THE CAR

302
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,166
AND DRIVER WE COULDN'T,
WHICH COULD LOOK TERRIBLE.

303
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,541
LIKE WE'RE ON A
LOWER RUNG THAN THEM.

304
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,166
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF A HICCUP

305
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,041
ON OUR RECORD.
YOU KNOW HOW RUMORS

306
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,958
HAVE A TENDENCY TO SPIN
OUT OF CONTROL.

307
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,791
AND THAT, I THINK,
IS EXACTLY WHAT NAKAZATO WANTS.

308
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,083
- I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO
WORRY ABOUT IT, FUMIHIRO.

309
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,541
NONE OF THOSE EXHAUST SUCKING
LOSERS IN THE NIGHT KIDS

310
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,708
CAN BEAT THE EIGHT-SIX.

311
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,333
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.

312
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,375
AS LONG THEY'RE RIDING
THE DOWNHILL OF AKINA,

313
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,583
I CAN'T THINK OF
ANYBODY THAT COULD BEAT HIM.

314
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,916
EXCEPT OF COURSE,
MY BROTHER HERE.

315
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,333
THE EIGHT-SIX HAS GOT SPEED
ON A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL

316
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,208
THAN ALMOST ANY OF US.

317
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,083
- YEAH, I'M NOT FOLLOWING
ANY OF THIS.

318
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,625
THERE ARE A LOT OF NEW
STATE OF THE ART CARS OUT THERE.

319
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,041
WHY CAN'T ANY OF THEM
COMPETE WITH THE EIGHT-SIX?

320
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,750
- THE STRAIGHT TRUTH IS THAT
SOMETIMES A CAR

321
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,750
HAS TOO MUCH POWER TO
BE VERY EFFECTIVE.

322
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,833
- ( gasps )

323
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,416
- TURBO'S GREAT
ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS,

324
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,708
BUT WHEN YOU'RE COMING
OUT OF THE CORNERS

325
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,791
IT CAN SERIOUSLY HINDER
THE CAR'S BEHAVIOR

326
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,583
AND LIKE A DOUBLE-EDGED
SWORD, IT CAN CUT YOU

327
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,041
JUST AS EASILY AS IT
DOES YOUR ENEMIES.

328
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,291
THE EIGHT-SIX ON THE OTHER HAND
GETS FASTER

329
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,791
ONCE IT'S HIT ITS STRIDE.

330
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,375
WHEN THE STRAIGHTAWAYS
ARE SHORTER,

331
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,625
THE MORE POWERFUL CAR DOESN'T
ALWAYS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

332
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,375
SOMETIMES IT JUST BOILS DOWN
TO WHOEVER'S MORE AGGRESSIVE.

333
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,416
WHICH IS WHY KEISUKE'S TURBO,
CLEARLY THE FASTER CAR...

334
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,875
- Fumihiro: ( voiceover )
HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.

335
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,000
- Keisuke: THAT'S RIGHT.

336
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,541
ON AKINA'S DOWNHILL,
THE AMOUNT OF TIME

337
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:04,083
I HAD TO USE ALL OF MY CAR'S
350 HORSES WAS NEXT TO NOTHING.

338
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,125
REALLY TICKED ME OFF.

339
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,875
THE SECOND I'D THINK I HAD
GAINED ENOUGH GROUND

340
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,000
TO LEAVE HIM BEHIND,

341
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,500
I'D HAVE TO BRAKE
FOR THE NEXT CORNER.

342
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,583
THEN IT WOULD TAKE ME TOO LONG
TO ACCELERATE AFTER THAT.

343
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,916
- OF COURSE IT DID, THAT'S HOW
IT GOES WITH THE FR.

344
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,916
IT GETS ALL ITS POWER FROM THE
REAR TIRES GRIPPING THE ROAD.

345
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,250
- WHOA, HOLD UP. THEN WHAT'LL
HAPPEN WITH THE THREE-TWO?

346
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,500
THAT'S A FOUR WHEEL DRIVE,
ISN'T IT?

347
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,333
AND IT'S GOT THE ATTESA E.T.S.

348
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,625
THAT THING CAN GIVE
STABLE TRACTION

349
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,791
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE
GIVING IT THE GAS.

350
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,500
SO HE CAN USE THE TURBO
AS MUCH AS HE WANTS.

351
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,916
NAKAZATO'S THREE-TWO MIGHT BE
ABLE TO BEAT THE EIGHT-SIX!

352
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,250
- ( both ) THANK YOU
FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

353
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,500
- WELCOME!
HOW'RE YOU DOING TODAY?

354
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,500
- ( bell ringing )

355
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,416
- I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST FEEL KIND OF WEIRD NOW.

356
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,333
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SUDDENLY
THIS WHOLE OTHER PERSON

357
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,541
I'VE NEVER MET.

358
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,291
- WHAT? WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

359
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,666
- UH, NEVER MIND. HERE.
HAVE ANOTHER HOT SPRING BUN.

360
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,875
- SURE.

361
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,125
- EH?

362
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,416
AND THEN YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

363
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,875
AND YOU'RE BACK TO BEING
REGULAR OLD TAKUMI.

364
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,958
THE SPACED OUT DUDE WHO
ALWAYS LOOKS TIRED

365
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,916
AND EATS A BOATLOAD OF MANJU.

366
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,416
- PEOPLE REALLY THINK
I LOOK SPACED OUT?

367
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,916
- YEP.

368
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,916
BUT ONCE YOU'RE IN THE
DRIVER'S SEAT OF THE EIGHT-SIX,

369
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,750
BARRELING DOWN AKINA'S CORNERS
AT BREAKNECK SPEED...

370
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,208
YOU BECOME THE PRIDE OF EVERY
STREET RACER AROUND HERE, MAN.

371
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,208
WOMEN WANT YOU, MEN WANT
TO BE YOU, YOU'RE AWESOME!

372
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:42,750
- YOU THINK SO? THAT'S KIND OF
EMBARRASSING, BUT, YEAH... OW!

373
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,250
- I TOLD YOU I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW!

374
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,083
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE JUST
THE SPACED OUT IDIOT, REMEMBER?

375
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,750
- I'M NOT SPACED OUT! BUT, WELL,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

376
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,416
I DO FEEL KIND OF STRANGE.

377
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,041
- ABOUT WHAT?

378
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,250
- WELL, DURING THE LAST RACE,

379
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,916
AND EVEN WHEN I HAD IKETANI
RIDING WITH ME,

380
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,125
I WAS JUST DRIVING THE WAY
I NORMALLY DO.

381
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,666
I DON'T GET WHY EVERYBODY IS
SUDDENLY FREAKING OUT ABOUT IT.

382
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,041
IT'S JUST DRIVING.

383
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,416
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, NOT LIKE
I'M CURING SOME DISEASE.

384
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,958
I GUESS I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN
THE KIND OF GUY WHO LIKES

385
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,458
ALL THE THINGS THAT SEEM
TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY.

386
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:20,125
BUT I'M STARTING TO THINK
MAYBE DRIVING ISN'T SO BAD.

387
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,208
- ( tires screeching )

388
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,416
- HEY.
- HUH?

390
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,541
I'VE BEEN SEEING THAT THING
ALL OVER THE PLACE!

391
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,583
- ANY CLOSER AND HE'LL BE
UP MY TAILPIPE!

392
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,958
- DON'T LET HIM PASS YOU, DUDE.
JUST KEEP YOUR SPEED UP.

393
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,166
- DUH! I'LL NAIL HIM
ON THE DOWNHILL.

394
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,958
I'VE GOT MORE HORSEPOWER
THAN THE EIGHT-SIX

395
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,208

I DON'T LIKE TO RIDE

IS GOING UP AGAINST TAKESHI OF

IS, TAKUMI DOESN'T WANNA RACE.

DON'T GET TO SEE THEM GO AT IT?

444
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,666
- Yuuichi: DON'T WORRY. I THINK
I HAVE AN IDEA. LEAVE IT TO ME.
