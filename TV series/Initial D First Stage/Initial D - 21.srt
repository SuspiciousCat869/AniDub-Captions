1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,708
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,166
- ♪ BREAK INTO THE NIGHT,
IT'S THE TIME ♪

4
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,958
- ( Itsuki mimics
driving noises )

5
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,666
THEN WHEN I HIT THAT CORNER,
I WAS ALL LIKE...

6
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,458
( yelling )

7
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,750
AND I TOTALLY CLEARED IT.

8
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,500
IN THAT MOMENT I WAS
LIKE THE WIND,

9
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,250
LIKE A MYSTERIOUS
FORCE OF NATURE.

10
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,625
NOTHING BEATS AKINA PASS BOYS.

11
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,791
WHEN YOU GROW UP AND
GET YOUR OWN CARS

12
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,541
YOU REALLY GOTTA
GO CHECK IT OUT.

13
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,125
WHAT? OH, MY CAR?

14
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,083
IT'S EVERY RACER'S DREAM CAR.
AN EIGHT-FIVE.

15
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,125
BET YOU FELLAS
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

16
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,041
- Itsuki: NOW THAT WAS WHAT
I'D CALL A KICK ASS SUMMER.

17
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,375
IT'LL STICK WITH ME
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

18
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,666
- WHY'S THAT?

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,041
- "WHY'S THAT?" BECAUSE A,
I BOUGHT A CAR DUDE,

20
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,625
AND B, YOU SHOT ONTO THE RACING
SCENE LIKE A FREAKIN' COMET.

21
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,125
DID YOU FORGET THAT?

22
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,125
- GIMME A BREAK.
I'M NOT THAT GOOD.

23
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,958
- WELL, ONE, TWO, THREE...

24
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,916
- ARE YOU TRYING TO REMEMBER HOW
TO COUNT AGAIN?

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,458
- NO, I WAS REMEMBERING
YOUR RACES.

26
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,750
YOU WON FOUR OF THEM OVER THE
SUMMER, IN CASE YOU FORGOT.

27
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,208
FIRST, THERE WAS KEISUKE OF THE
RED SUNS AND HIS BADASS FD.

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,958
- ( tires screeching )

29
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,250
- SECOND YOU WENT UP AGAINST
TAKESHI OF THE NIGHT KIDS

30
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,750
AND HIS THREE-TWO.

31
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,875
THIRD, YOU HAD THAT WHACKED OUT
GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH

32
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,916
WITH SHINGO'S EG-SIX.

33
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,375
THEN LAST YOU TOOK
DOWN MAKO AND SAYUKI

34
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,750
IN THEIR SIL-EIGHTY
AT USUI PASS.

35
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,291
FOUR OUTA FOUR, BUDDY.

36
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,458
YOUR START AS AN UNDEFEATED
LEGEND BEGAN THIS SUMMER,

37
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,875
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

38
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,208
YOU'RE NO LONGER JUST SOME
OTHER IDIOT HIGH SCHOOLER

39
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,583
TRYIN' TO SLIDE ON BY.

40
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,708
- WOULD YOU STOP EXAGGERATING,
YOU DOOFUS?

41
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,250
- ( laughs )

42
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,666
STOP ACTIN' EMBARRASSED BRO.

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,166
YOU'LL KEEP WINNIN',
YOU KNOW THAT.

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,500
UNTIL I BEAT THE PANTS OFF YOU,
AND BECOME THE FASTEST GUY

45
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,916
THAT GUNMA OR ALL OF
KANTO'S GOT TO OFFER

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO BE
YOUR CHEERLEADER.

47
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,500
CUZ THEN EVERYONE'S
GONNA CALL ME,

48
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,166
AKINA'S COMET.

49
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,625
- Natsuki: I WAS THINKIN' SINCE
SCHOOL ENDS EARLY TODAY,

50
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,625
WHY DON'T WE DO' SOMETHING
THIS AFTERNOON? COULD BE FUN.

51
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,666
- UH. I KIND OF HAVE TO
WORK THIS AFTERNOON.

52
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,708
- YOU DO?
WELL, THAT REALLY SUCKS.

53
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,375
I WOULDN'T MIND GOIN' FOR
ANOTHER RIDE IN YOUR CAR.

54
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,041
I HAD A LOTTA FUN LAST TIME.

55
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,958
IT'S A SUPER CUTE RIDE.

56
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,250
- WHATEVER, NATSUKI,
IF YOU SAY SO.

57
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,916
BUT I MEAN AT THE END
OF THE DAY, IT'S MY DAD'S CAR.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,583
- I REMEMBER YOU SAID SOMETHING

59
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,041
ABOUT WANTING TO
BUY YOUR OWN CAR.

60
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,458
HAVE YOU SAVED UP MUCH MONEY?

61
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,458
- MOST OF THE CASH I'VE
MADE FROM WORK

62
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,625
HAS BEEN PUT INTO SAVINGS.

63
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,750
BUT I'M STILL LIGHT YEARS
AWAY FROM IT.

64
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,000
- SO HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?

65
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,750
- AROUND A MILLION YEN,
IF I WANT SOMETHING GOOD.

66
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,000
- WOW. A MILLION, HUH?

67
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,583
AND HOW MUCH YOU GOT NOW?

68
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,208
- NOTHIN' CLOSE TO THAT.

69
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,416
- OKAY, TAKUMI, I JUST
HAVE TO ASK YOU.

70
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,916
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF I GAVE YOU
THE MONEY YOU NEED?

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,250
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY?

72
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,250
BUT I BET YOU'D NEVER STOP
THANKING ME

73
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,208
AND TREAT ME LIKE
A PRINCESS EVERY DAY

74
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,208
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

75
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,125
IN FACT, WITH WHAT YOU'D OWE ME

76
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,333
AND THE AMOUNT OF
PAYBACK I'D NEED,

77
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,375
THEN YOU'D HAVE TO QUIT
WORKING YOUR DAY JOB

78
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,625
AT THE GAS STATION.

79
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,833
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU
COULD TAKE CARE OF ME!

80
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,708
( giggling )

81
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,625
- I'M SO EMBARRASSED!
I SHOULD SHUT UP, LIKE NOW!

82
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,666
LOOK THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH MONEY
FOR ANYONE TO JUST COME UP WITH

83
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,083
OUT OF NOWHERE.

84
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:32,541
- YEAH I KNOW. I WAS JUST
THINKIN' OUT LOUD, GEEZ.

85
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,208
YOU HAVE NO IMAGINATION.
CAN'T A GIRL HAVE SOME FUN?

86
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:40,250
- IMAGINATION IS ONE THING.
THAT'S CRAZY!

87
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,916
- Iketani: WE NOW BY THIS POINT
THAT TAKUMI'S TECHNIQUE

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,583
IS THE REAL DEAL AND IT'LL HOLD
UP ANYWHERE TO ANYONE.

89
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,333
- Yuuichi: YEAH, BUT IT'S MORE
THAN JUST TECHNIQUE.

90
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,875
YOU NEED A TIGHT GRIP
ON SOME NATURAL TALENT

91
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,750
TO BE ABLE TO RACE WELL
ON A NEW COURSE.

92
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,541
- HE'S BORDERLINE GENIUS FOR
BEING ABLE TO DEFEAT

93
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,916
ALL THOSE MODERN CARS
WITH A TEN YEAR OLD EIGHT-SIX.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,791
THAT'S LIKE ROCKSTAR STATUS
DRIVIN', DUDE.

95
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,250
WISH I WAS AS GOOD AS HE IS.

96
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,541
- CHECK YOU OUT.
WEREN'T YOU THE ONE WHO SAID

97
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,916
HE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO COMPETE
ANYWHERE ELSE

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,583
BECAUSE ALL HE KNOWS
HOW TO DRIVE IS AKINA PASS?

99
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,125
- WELL, YEAH BUT THINGS CHANGE.

100
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,125
- YEP, THAT'S WHAT WE
ALL THOUGHT TOO.

101
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,875
TAKUMI'S A STRANGE ONE, THOUGH.

102
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,583
WHEN I HEARD ABOUT HIM
TROUNCING UP TO USUI,

103
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,000
I WAS SURE HE'D
LOSE TO MAKO'S SIL-EIGHTY,

104
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,500
BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

105
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,000
SORRY, IKETANI.

106
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,750
- DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'M COOL.

107
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,833
I'VE DECIDED FROM NOW ON
I'LL BE KNOWN AS IKETANI,

108
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,416
THE LONELY DRIVER.

109
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,666
- I THINK I'VE HEARD
THAT ONE BEFORE.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,666
- JUST PULL RIGHT ON IN, SIR.

111
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,708
- FLOWERS? ARE YOU SURE
THIS ISN'T A MISTAKE?

112
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,375
THIS IS A GAS STATION,
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE

113
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,875
WHEN YOU ROLLED IN.

114
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,125
THEY'RE FOR YOU, KID.

115
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,916
- WAIT. WHO'S SENDING ME
FLOWERS TO WORK?

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,583
- RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

117
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,125
- ( all gasping )

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,208
- RYOSUKE.

119
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,250
- TAKAHASHI.

120
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:06,125
- THE NUMBER ONE BADASS IN
ALL OF GUNMA WANTS YOU!

121
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,333
- HERE! IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA READ
IT TO US, THEN I WILL!

122
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,541
"SEPTEMBER 15TH AT TEN PM.
THE TOP OF MOUNT AKINA."

123
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,916
OH GET REAL.
IT'S GOTTA SAY MORE THAN THAT!

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,750
- IT SOUNDS LIKE HE...

125
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,125
- IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED.

126
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:34,541
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI HAS CHALLENGED
OUR BOY TO A DOWNHILL BATTLE.

127
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,041
- ( all exclaiming )

128
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,708
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO DUDE?

129
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,750
- DUH! HE'S GONNA ACCEPT! WHAT
THE HELL ELSE IS HE GONNA DO?

130
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,833
HE ALREADY SMOKED 'RYOSUKE'S
BROTHER LIKE A BIG FAT SAUSAGE!

131
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,500
- Iketani: THAT'S RIGHT.

132
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,333
AND AVOIDING A REMATCH
IS TEN TIMES MORE HUMILIATING

133
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,875
THAN LOSING ONE.

134
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,750
- WHAT'S GOIN ON?
YOU LOOK LIKE SOMETHING'S 'UP.

135
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,041
DO YOU NOT LIKE BEING WITH ME?

136
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,083
- NO. I MEAN, YES,
I LIKE BEING WITH YOU.

137
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,541
- YOU JUST SEEM LIKE YOUR MIND'S
OFF SOMEPLACE ELSE.

138
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,500
LIKE YOU'RE PREOCCUPIED.

139
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:22,625
WHICH. I GUESS IS KINDA NORMAL.
BUT YOU JUST SEEM SO FAR AWAY.

140
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,500
IF YOU'RE NOT
HAVING A GOOD TIME,

141
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,166
THEN MAYBE THE TWO OF US SHOULD
JUST GO BACK HOME.

142
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,541
- I'M' HAVIN' A GOOD TIME.
NATSUKI, LOOK, I'M SORRY.

143
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,083
- I'LL FORGIVE YOU ONLY IF YOU
TELL ME ONE THING.

144
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,500
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WERE
JUST THINKING ABOUT?

145
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,791
WELL, I, UH... ITS JUST, I DON'T
REALLY THINK YOU'D GET IT

146
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,416
IF I DID TELL YOU.

147
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,041
- LATER.

148
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,083
- OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU! YOU
DON'T HAVE TO FREAK OUT.

149
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,791
- A BATTLE?
- MMM-HMM.

150
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,708
- SO. LIKE A FISTFIGHT?

151
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,708
- NO. A BATTLE IS A RACE.

152
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,125
TWO DRIVERS GOING UP
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

153
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,041
- SO A CAR RACE. FOR REAL?

154
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,708
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE
FIGURED IT OUT,

155
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,541
BUT I NEVER KNEW RACING
CARS WAS YOUR HOBBY.

156
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,625
- IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
ALWAYS BEEN MY HOBBY.

157
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,208
IT JUST KINDA BECAME ONE
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

158
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:15,750
AND, THE GUY I'M RACING NEXT IS
REALLY GOOD AND SUPER POPULAR.

159
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,708
IT'S ALL I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO THINK ABOUT

160
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,250
SINCE I WOKE UP THIS MORNING.

161
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,750
I GUESS THE PRESSURE IS
REALLY STARTING TO GET TO ME.

162
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,958
- WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE A GREAT
DRIVER. I'M SURE YOU'LL BE FINE.

163
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,250
- HATE TO TELL YA,
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

164
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,250
- IF YOU REALLY DON'T
WANNA RACE, JUST BLOW HIM OFF.

165
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,916
- NAH, IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T
WANNA RACE THE GUY.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,250
I MEAN, THERE'S A CHANCE
I MIGHT EVEN LOSE TO HIM.

167
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,625
BUT I DON'T WANNA
NOT RACE HIM YA KNOW.

168
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,041
- THAT BACK AND FORTH BUSINESS
SOUNDS SO MUCH LIKE YOU.

169
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,583
DEEP DOWN INSIDE IT'S WHAT YOU
REALLY WANT TO DO ISN'T IT?

170
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,416
EVEN THOUGH YOU WON'T SHOW IT.

171
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,958
YOU'RE A CRAZY
COMPETITIVE PERSON.

172
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,916
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
I REALLY LIKE.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,958
I'VE LIKED IT SINCE WE MET.

174
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,000
- ARE YOU READY TO GO?

175
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,041
- WELL, I WAS THINKING WE COULD
TALK FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER,

176
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,000
IF THAT WAS COOL WITH YOU.

177
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,375
- SURE.

178
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,541
- I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT I KNOW, UH,

179
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,875
WHY YOU GOT INTO
THAT FIGHT WITH MIKI

180
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,666
IN THE LOCKER ROOM LAST YEAR.

181
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,625
IT WAS WELL AFTER
YOU HAD QUIT THE TEAM,

182
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,000
ONE OF YOUR TEAMMATES TOLD ME
WHAT HAD HAPPENED

183
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,500
AND WHY YOU DID IT.

184
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,625
YOU STOOD UP FOR ME.
THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED.

185
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,708
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

186
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,375
I'M SORRY. I DON'T MEAN TO
MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.

187
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,708
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

188
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,250
NONE OF THAT STUFF
EVEN MATTERS ANYMORE.

189
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,958
FORGET IT.

190
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,375
- INITIAL D.

191
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,958
- INITIAL D!

192
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,125
- ( yawning )

193
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,583
THAT'S TAKUMI'S EIGHT-SIX.

194
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,041
( gasps )

195
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,250
WHO'S THAT CHICK WITH HIM?

196
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,625
- ( car honking )

197
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,791
- ( exclaims ) DUDE,
KEIICHI TSUCHIYA'S DRIFT

198
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,583
TOTALLY ROCKS THE
FREAKING HOUSE.

199
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,791
CHECK THAT OUT.

200
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,916
LOOK AT THESE PICS, BRO.

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,458
TAKUMI? HEY. TAKUMI.

202
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,750
- WHAT, ITSUKI? TIME FOR LUNCH
OR SOMETHIN'?

203
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,958
- ( exclaims ) YOU IDIOT!

204
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,958
( laughs ) I WAS TALKING
TO MYSELF. I DO THAT SOMETIMES.

205
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,041
- Iketani: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
TAKUMI'S BEEN ACTING WEIRD?

206
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,291
- YEAH, WHAT'S HE BEEN DOIN'
THAT'S SO STRANGE?

207
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,583
- I DUNNO MAN.
HE JUST SEEMS OFF.

208
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,250
- RIGHT. LIKE EVERY DAY.

209
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,708
- SURE, YEAH I GUESS DUDE.

210
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,416
BUT HE WAS JUST A WHOLE LOT
BETTER DURING THE SUMMER.

211
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,708
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT.

212
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,166
IT'S LIKE WHEN SCHOOL STARTED,

213
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,750
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE JUST, KINDA...

214
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,500
HE'S TURNED INTO A BIGGER SPACE
CADET THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE.

215
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,500
- HE COULD BE WORN OUT
FROM ALL THE RACING.

216
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,875
- NO WAY. HE JUST
STARTED THAT STUFF UP

217
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,166
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER.

218
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,416
YA KNOW IT MIGHT
BE SCHOOL ITSELF

219
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,541
THAT'S PULLING HIS FOCUS AWAY
FROM THE CIRCUIT.

220
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,375
- SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT
WE'RE MISSING THE MARK HERE.

221
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,416
IT'S LIKE THERE'S A GEAR
SOMEWHERE IN HIS HEAD

222
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,416
THAT'S BUSTED AND
NEEDS REPLACING.

223
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
- WHOA, HANG ON. YOU THINK HE'S
GONNA BE ABLE TO KEEP RACING

224
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,625
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS HEAD
SCREWED ON TIGHT?

225
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,666
- WAIT, I GOT IT.
DOES HE HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

226
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,000
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

227
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,666
- 'CAUSE MAYBE HIS HEAD
IS STUCK IN THE CLOUDS

228
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,500
DAYDREAMIN' ALL DAY LONG.

229
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,500
- DAYDREAMING?

230
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,666
- LIKE HOW YOU WERE WITH MAKO.

231
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,750
CAN'T STOP THINKIN'
'BOUT HER HOT BOD.

232
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,833
- UH. KENJI YOU DUMBASS.

233
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,875
MIGHT NOT WANNA SAY
THAT NAME AROUND HERE.

234
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,583
- NO, IT'S ALRIGHT. I'M FINE.

235
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,666
- SO. ANYWAY, LIKE I WAS SAYIN,

236
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,041
I SAW TAKUMI DRIVING AROUND
WITH SOME CHICK EARLIER.

237
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,708
- WHAT! ARE YOU SERIOUS?

238
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,291
- YEAH, I AM. I ONLY GOT
A GLIMPSE OF HER,

239
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,875
BUT SHE SEEMED PRETTY HOT.

240
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,083
- TAKUMI'S GIRLFRIEND.

241
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,958
- ( screaming )

242
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,375
- WELL. NO WONDER THE GUY KEEPS
DITCHIN' ME AFTER SCHOOL

243
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,583
LIKE I'M SOME KIND
OF DISEASED FREAK.

244
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,958
THAT TRAITOR! THAT JERK.

245
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,833
AND ALL WHILE I'VE NEVER EVEN
GOTTEN TO WALK AROUND

246
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,250
HOLDING A GIRL'S HAND.

247
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,541
- OH. YES! THAT HAS TO BE THE
REASON! I'M SURE OF IT!

248
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,291
- YOU JUST LEAVE IT ALL TO ME.

249
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,250
I'M GONNA INTERROGATE HIM
LIKE HE'S IN A PRISON CAMP!

250
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,333
WE RACERS, WE DON'T NEED CHICKS!
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, IKETANI!

251
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,041
- RIGHT!

252
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:42,041
- YOU AND ME, WE'RE 'THE
LONELY DRIVERS, MY MAN!

253
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,250
- WHY DO I HANG OUT
WITH THESE LOSERS?

254
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,291
- ( tires screeching )

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,416
- WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
YOU'VE BEEN QUIET.

256
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,166
- OH, HAVE I?

257
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,000
WELL BRO, YOU'VE BEEN DATIN'
NATSUKI BEHIND MY BACK,

258
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,958
SO WE'RE BOTH KEEPING SECRETS.

259
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,041
- THAT ALL?

260
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,875
- "THAT ALL?"

261
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,583
- IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE BEEN
KEEPIN' IT A SECRET.

262
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,333
BUT TO BE HONEST IT'S NOT
LIKE THERE'S REALLY MUCH

263
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,833
OF A STORY TO TELL EITHER.

264
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,625
- I DON'T GIVE A HOLY FLYING
CRAP, JUST ANSWER ME THIS...

265
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,458
HOW, UH... HOW FAR HAVE
THE TWO OF YOU GONE?

266
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,500
I'M ASKING YOU AN
HONEST QUESTION.

267
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,916
HOW FAR DID THE TWO OF YOU GO?

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,458
- HOW. HOW FAR'D WE...

269
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,375
- AND YOU HAD BETTER TELL
YOUR BEST FRIEND THE TRUTH!

270
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,291
- ITSUKI, KEEP YOUR EYE
ON THE ROAD, DUDE!

271
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,541
- ( screaming )

272
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,666
( tires screeching )

273
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,958
- FINE, I'LL TELL YOU!

274
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,291
- THEN TELL.

275
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,125
- LAST SUNDAY THE TWO OF US...
- ON SUNDAY.

276
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,916
- WE, UH...

277
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,500
YEAH. THE TWO OF YOU?

278
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,208
- WE WENT UP TO AKINA LAKE.

279
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,208
ITSUKI, SERIOUSLY!
GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS!

280
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,708
WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW WAS
WHICH BASE YOU GOT TO.

281
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,916
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW TO
TALK TO A GUY? DAMN, DUDE.

282
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,500
- THE BASE I GOT TO.

283
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,083
- YEAH. DID YOU KISS HER?

284
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,541
OR DID YOU DO
SOMETHING ELSE, HUH?

285
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,791
- WE KISSED.

286
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,708
- YOU DID WHAT?

287
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:29,041
- ITSUKI, EYES FORWARD! COME ON,
YOU'RE DRIVING LIKE A MANIAC!

288
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,041
- HE'S DAYDREAMING
ABOUT HER RIGHT NOW.

289
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,708
- WHY ARE YOU STARING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

290
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,875
- YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
LIKE A FREAKSHOW.

291
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,083
- I HAVE?

292
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,750
- I KNOW YOU NEVER USE
THAT BRAIN OF YOURS

293
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,250
BUT HERE YOU ARE ACTIN'
LIKE YOU'RE THINKIN'

294
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,250
ABOUT SOMETHIN' CONSTANTLY.

295
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,791
- I GUESS I AM.

296
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,541
- HE PROBABLY CAN'T
STOP THINKIN' ABOUT

297
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,500
NATSUKI'S SOFT, SUPPLE LIPS,
HER WARM SKIN.

298
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,666
- I DON'T KNOW, LATELY
I'VE BEEN' THINKIN A LOT

299
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,791
ABOUT ALL OF THE
DIFFERENT 'THINGS

300
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,250
THAT COULD HAPPEN TO
US IN THE FUTURE.

301
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,458
- ( gasps ) YOU'RE THINKIN'
ABOUT THE FUTURE!

302
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,916
ONE KISS, AND IT'S A
SLIPPERY SLOPE AFTERWARDS.

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,541
HOW CAN EVEN THINK OF BRINGIN'
UP SUCH A SHAMEFUL

304
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,916
AND TRAGIC SUBJECT

305
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,416
IN FRONT OF THE MAN YOU KNOW
TO BE THE LONELY RACER?

306
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,541
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY GET WITH
THE PROGRAM BRO,

307
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,041
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING ALL THIS
KISSIN' IS GONNA LEAD TO!

308
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,666
- OH YEAH?
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

309
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,041
YOU KNOW, DUDE! IT!

310
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,500
- YOU'RE INSANE. NOW GET
YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME.

311
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,916
WHAT I MEAN WHEN I'M TALKIN'
ABOUT THE FUTURE IS...

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,541
OH. NO. JUST FORGET IT.

313
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,791
YOU KNOW I DON'T EXACTLY
HAVE A WAY WITH WORDS,

314
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,333
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

315
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,916
- LOOKS LIKE THIS DAYDREAMING
THING ISN'T GONNA GET FIXED

316
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,833
IN JUST ONE QUICK SWIPE.

317
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,000
( tires screeching )

318
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,291
- Man 1: MAN! THOSE SUCKERS
ARE FLYIN'.

319
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,916
IT'S KEISKE'S FD AND
KENTA'S S-FOURTEEN.

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,666
- Man 2: KENTA'S FAST GOIN'
DOWN THE HILL.

321
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,416
THAT NON-TURBO S-FOURTEEN
OF HIS IS MADE JUST FOR THAT.

322
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,416
- Man 1: YOU KNOW, KEISUKE
TOOK HIM UNDER HIS WING

323
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,416
AND 'HAS BEEN TRAINING HIM
PERSONALLY EVER SINCE.

324
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,291
- Man 2: YEP, AFTER KEISKE,
HE'S OUR NUMBER TWO SUCCESSOR.

325
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,833
- THE BATTLE AGAINST THE NIGHT
KIDS IS ONLY TWO DAYS AWAY.

326
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,125
I DON'T THINK THAT
KEISUKE SHOULD BE WASTING

327
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,041
ANY OF HIS TIME WITH
KENTA RIGHT NOW.

328
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,041
- I GUESS HE MUST BE PRETTY
CONFIDENT THEN.

329
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,041
- WELL MAYBE TAKESHI IS THAT
CRUMMY OF A DRIVER.

330
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,416
YA KNOW EASY PICKIN'S.

331
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,708
- WOULDN'T DOUBT IT.
KAYSKAY'S BEEN ON FIRE LATELY.

332
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,750
- HE SEEMS ALMOST LIKE HE'S BEEN
DRIVIN' A LITTLE BIT MORE

333
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,000
LIKE REEOHSKAY THESE DAYS.

334
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,250
DON'T YOU THINK?

335
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,250
- MAYBE. I NOTICED
A LITTLE OF THAT.

336
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,041
RYOSUKE'S GOTTA BE FEELIN'
PRETTY CONFIDENT

337
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,666
ABOUT HIS BROTHER PUTTIN' HIM
IN THAT POSITION.

338
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,500
- I HEARD THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT
COMIN' BACK TO MYOGI.

339
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,208
- Kenta: CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION, KEISUKE?

340
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,541
- Keisuke: WHACHA GOT FOR ME?

341
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,291
- I JUST WANNA KNOW WHY WE'RE
NOT CHALLENGING THE EIGHT-SIX.

342
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,416
I MEAN, IT SEEMS TO ME WE
SHOULD'VE HAD HIM OUT TO AKAGI

343
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,916
SO WE COULD'VE GOTTEN OUR
REVENGE YA KNOW?

344
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,458
- AKAGI, HUH?

345
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,875
- THAT'S RIGHT, MAN.

346
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,458
THERE'S NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST
CHANCE ON THIS PLANET

347
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,416
THAT YOU'D LOSE TO HIM IF YOU
GUYS BATTLED ON OUR OWN TURF.

348
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,208
AND I'LL TELL YA, IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DO IT, THEN I WILL!

349
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,250
- FORGET ABOUT IT, KENTA.

350
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,666
- WHY? YOU THINK THIS GUY'LL
ACTUALLY BEAT ME?

351
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,583
NOT ON AKAGI'S DOWNHILL
HE WON'T.

352
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,875
THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT, BUDDY.

353
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,041
YOU'RE AN OFFICIAL RED SUN NOW.

354
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,125
DON'T YOU EVER LET THAT
SLIP YOUR MIND.

355
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,916
WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF RACING
ON OUR OPPONENTS' COURSES.

356
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,666
NOT ON OUR OWN.

357
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,958
- RIGHT. I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT WE DO.

358
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,375
IT'S JUST ALMOST TOO MUCH
FOR ME TO HANDLE SOMETIMES.

359
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,541
WITH THAT DAMN EIGHT-SIX
ALWAYS GETTING THE BEST OF US!

360
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,250
I JUST WANT US TO BE ABLE TO
BATTLE THOSE FREAKIN' LOSERS

361
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:20,166
FAIR AND SQUARE FOR ONCE!
PLEASE. PLEASE LET ME TAKE HIM!

362
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,625
- YOU CALM THE HELL DOWN!

363
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,875
DON'T FREAK OUT ABOUT IT.

364
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,916
WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY
SHOWS ITSELF,

365
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,625
THE PERSON WHO NEEDS TO
PUT AN END TO THIS MESS

366
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,958
IS GONNA DO JUST
THAT. I PROMISE.

367
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,125
- YOU MEAN.
RYOSUKE WILL DO SOMETHING?

368
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,750
- BE PATIENT AND
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

369
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,708
BUT FIRST, WE GOTTA RACE
THE NIGHT KIDS.

370
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,125
SO JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE
TO ME AND MY BROTHER.

371
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,541
- HE DOES SEEM KINDA WEIRD.

372
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,625
- YOU SEE? HE CONFESSED TO ME

373
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,791
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM
AND THAT CHICK.

374
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,166
HE'S DAYDREAMING ABOUT
HER ALL DAY LONG.

375
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,708
- WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

376
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,750
THERE'S ONLY A WEEK
LEFT BEFORE THE BIG RACE

377
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:19,583
AND HE'S OUT TO LUNCH.

378
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,458
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

379
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,333
- Kenji: THINGS STAY LIKE THIS,
WE'RE IN SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE.

380
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,583
- ( theme song playing )

381
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

382
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,375
- Itsuki: THIS IS SERIOUSLY
NOT A GOOD THING!

383
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,000
- Announcer: WHAT'S NOT
GOOD, ITSUKI?

384
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,500
I MEAN, THE BIG RACE IS...

385
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,458
- FORGET THE STUPID RACE!
TAKUMI'S BEEN DAYDREAMING ABOUT

386
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,041
THAT DAMN CHICK DURING A CRUCIAL
TIME IN HIS RACING LIFE!

387
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,583
- Announcer: DAYDREAMING?

388
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,250
- Itsuki: WHAT WITH HIM AND
NATSUKI DOING WHO KNOWS WHAT,

389
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,166
AND MAYBE EVEN
THE BIG FREAKIN' IT!

390
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,500
- Announcer:
NOT THIS CRAP AGAIN.

391
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,000
- Itsuki: HUH? NEXT TIME ON
INITIAL D,

392
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,458
"FIERCE UPHILL BATTLE!"

393
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,000
DON'T MISS IT!
