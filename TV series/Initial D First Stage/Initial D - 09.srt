15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,416
MOUNT AKINA IS CALLING MY NAME.

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,583
I'VE NEVER WANTED TO GET BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF THAT CAR

17
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,250
SO MUCH IN MY LIFE.

18
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,166
AM I LOSING MY MIND?

19
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,250
NO ONE KNOWS THAT PASS
LIKE I DO.

20
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,708
I'VE DRIVEN THAT THING
RAIN OR SHINE EVERY DAY

21
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,958
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

22
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,833
IT'S BECOME A PART OF ME.

23
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,583
- ( engine revving )

24
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,083
I'LL SEE YA LATER. THANKS
FOR BEIN' ALL COOL

25
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,416
WITH ME TAKIN' THE
CAR OUT TONIGHT.

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,625
I OWE YOU.

27
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,750
TAKUMI. WE'D BETTER PUT THE
PEDAL TO METAL.

28
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,291
WE'VE DON'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT OF TIME LEFT.

29
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,416
- Man: HEADS UP, THERE HE IS!

30
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,833
- ( exclaims in horror )

31
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,500
- IT'S TOO LATE!
THEY'VE LOCKED IN ON ME!

32
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,083
THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE NOW

33
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,458
GOODBYE, CRUEL WORLD.

34
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,208
- ( car approaching )

35
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,916
- HEY ITSUKI. WHAT'S GOIN ON?

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,250
YOU MIND GETTIN' OUT OF THE WAY
OR DO I HAVE TO RUN OVER YA?

37
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,708
TA. TA.

38
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,250
DUDE, SERIOUSLY. GET OUT OF
THE WAY. YOU WANNA DIE?

39
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,541
- ( laughs )

40
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:09,458
- TAKUMI! I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HERE!

41
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:13,208
- YEAH. MY BAD. I'M LATE.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

42
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,291
- IT'S OKAY. I'M...

43
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,541
- IT'S LIKE YOU SAID.

44
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,583
I'M A STREET RACER AND
I'VE BEEN CHALLENGED.

45
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,583
SO, THIS IS WHERE I'M
SUPPOSED TO BE. RIGHT?

46
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,666
- ( crying ) THANK YOU. TAKUMI!

47
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,958
- HEY, DON'T SNOT ALL OVER ME!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

48
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,750
- MAN, THIS DUDE'S JUST A KID.

49
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,791
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF HE'S HAD HIS LICENSE

50
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,750
FOR LESS THAN A YEAR NOW.

51
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,208
HE CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH
EXPERIENCE UNDER HIS BELT.

52
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,000
HOW'D HE LEARN HIS TECHNIQUE?
GO-CARTS?

53
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,458
CRAZY. I WOULDA FIGURED I'D BE
FACING SOMEONE OLDER THAN ME.

54
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,000
- SO THAT'S A GT-R.

55
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,458
- GOOD DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE.
IN A CLASS BY ITSELF.

56
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,333
IT'S TOP OF THE LINE
DRIVING SYSTEM

57
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,291
MERGES EVERY PERFECT
THING ABOUT THE FR

58
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,458
AND THE FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

59
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,250
MAKES IT AN UNSTOPPABLE BEAST.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,541
- I'M TAKESHI OF THE NIGHT KIDS.

61
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,541
YOU GOT A NAME, DONTCHA KID?

62
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,875
- IT'S TAKUMI FUJIWARA.

63
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,125
- I'LL REMEMBER THAT. FUJIWARA.

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,250
LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

65
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,958
- ( people chattering )

66
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,958
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT A HEAVY
UNDERSTEER DURING FULL THROTTLE

67
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,583
IS A BETTER SETTING IF YOU HAVE
THE SKILLS TO HANDLE IT.

68
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,333
MAKES SENSE. BUT IF THE CAR
STARTS HANDLING DIFFERENTLY

69
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,750
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

70
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,083
TAKUMI COULD PANIC WHEN
HE'S PUSHIN' INTO THE CORNERS!

71
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,875
DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD'VE
BEEN A WISE DECISION

72
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,416
TO WARN HIM ABOUT
IT AHEAD OF TIME?

73
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,916
- Bunta: I COULD HAVE
BUT IT WOULDN'T

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,416
HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,375
TAKUMI'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'D CALL A CEREBRAL DRIVER,

76
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,375
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

77
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,958
- Yuuichi: WHAT? THAT'S REASON
ENOUGH TO TELL HIM ABOUT IT!

78
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,958
- JUST WAIT AND SEE, YUUICHI,
IT'LL BE ALRIGHT.

79
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,625
I KNOW MY SON MIGHT NOT BE
THE SHARPEST KNIFE IN THE DRAWER

80
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,250
WHEN IT COMES TO USING HIS HEAD.

81
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,125
BUT THE BOY HAS
CAT-LIKE REFLEXES,

82
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,041
AND THAT'S WHAT WINS RACES.

83
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,750
THERE'S NO TIME TO THINK FIRST
AND THEN REACT TO THE NUANCES

84
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,291
YOU FEEL THROUGH THE SEAT.

85
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,125
YOUR ARMS AND LEGS HAVE MOVE
TOGETHER ALMOST INSTINCTIVELY

86
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,416
IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE DRIFT.
SO DON'T WORRY.

87
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,166
TAKUMI'S GOT A KNACK FOR SENSING
WHEN AND HOW TO ACCELERATE

88
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,916
WHEN HE'S IN THE
MIDDLE OF A DRIFT.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,666
SO IF THE SUSPENSION
SETTINGS ARE ALTERED

90
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,250
A LITTLE HERE AND THERE,
IT WON'T MATTER.

91
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,541
HE'LL MAKE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS
WHEN HE NEEDS TO.

92
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,666
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO
DRIVE AN EIGHT-SIX.

93
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,083
THAT CAR TRAINS ITS DRIVER.

94
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,791
- WE'RE AT THE FINISH.

95
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,083
ROAD'S CLEAR, SO IF THEY'RE
READY TO GO, SEND 'EM DOWN.

96
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,375
- ( static )

97
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,833
- IKETANI, WE JUST GOT THE
GO-AHEAD TO START.

98
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:13,958
- GOTCHA.

99
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,666
ALRIGHT, WE'RE ABOUT TO START
THE COUNTDOWN!

100
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,000
WE GO IN TEN SECONDS!

101
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,375
- ( engines revving )

102
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,000
- COME ON, TAKUMI!
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT!

103
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,000
- HEY, KEISUKE.

104
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,000
WHILE THE WANNABES
WATCH FROM THE SIDELINES

105
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,958
WE'LL HAVE THE BEST SEATS IN THE
HOUSE. HOP IN. THEY'RE STARTING.

106
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:44,875
- FIVE. FOUR. THREE. TWO. ONE.

107
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,041
GO!

108
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,083
- ( tires screeching )

109
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,416
- THE THREE-TWO'S IN THE LEAD!

110
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,333
- BUT TAKUMI ISN'T
TOO FAR BEHIND HIM.

111
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,291
- Keisuke: HERE THEY COME!

112
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,458
- Ryosuke: YOU BETTER BUCKLE UP.

113
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,583
- ( tires screeching )

114
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,666
- HOLY CRAP, LOOK!
IT'S RYOSUKE'S FC!

115
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,458
HE'S NOT TRYING TO
JOIN THE RACE, IS HE?

116
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,916
- WHAT THE HELL'S HE DOIN'?

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,958
NO ONE SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS BEING A 3-WAY!

118
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,458
- EPIC! THIS WILL DECIDE WHO THE
FASTEST DRIVER IN GUNMA IS.

119
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,750
- THE GUY IN THE GT-R
IS SLOWING DOWN.

120
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,000
IS HE WAITING FOR ME
TO CATCH UP?

121
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,791
I COULD LOSE HIM ON
THE STRAIGHTAWAY

122
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,166
AND BE DONE WITH IT,

123
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,916
BUT WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT?
I CAME HERE TO BATTLE.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,291
THE RACE STARTS AS SOON AS
WE HIT THE FIRST CORNER.

125
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,541
- ARE YOU SEEIN'
WHAT I'M SEEIN'?

126
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,458
HE'S SLOWIN' DOWN AND WAITIN'
FOR THE EIGHT-SIX TO CATCH UP.

127
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,083
- WE'LL SEE IF HIS
OVERCONFIDENCE

128
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,125
ENDS UP COSTING HIM
IN THE LAST HALF OF THE RACE.

129
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,916
- HERE THEY COME!

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,041
THEY'RE AT THE FIRST CORNER!

131
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,125
ALL THREE CARS ARE
IN A TIGHT PACK!

132
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,291
- WOW. BUNTA CALLED IT ALRIGHT.

133
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,000
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
NO WAY.

134
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,791
THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE
THIS CLOSE IS BECAUSE I LET YOU.

135
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,458
BUT IT'S THE CLOSEST YOU'LL GET
TO MY BUMPER, JUST WATCH!

136
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
- WATCHING THIS KID
DRIVE UP CLOSE.

137
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,875
IT'S CLEAR TO ME NOW.
HIS DRIFT'S AN ART.

138
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,958
HE'S PULLING A FOUR-WHEEL
DRIFT WITH FULL THROTTLE

139
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,583
AND BARELY USING ANY
COUNTER-STEERING.

140
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,583
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW INCREDIBLE THAT IS?

141
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,833
HE'S USING EVERY BIT OF POWER
THAT EIGHT-SIX HAS,

142
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,166
AND HIS CONTROL IS PHENOMENAL,

143
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,208
LIKE IT'S AS EFFORTLESS AS
CONTROLLING HIS HANDS

144
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,250
OR HIS FEET.

145
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,125
I CAN'T EVEN CONTROL MY OWN FC

146
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,250
WITH THAT LEVEL OF
PRECISION HANDLING.

147
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,458
THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING.

148
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,416
- YEAH, MAYBE SO, BUT TAKESHI'S
PULLING AHEAD OF HIM AGAIN.

149
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,833
IF THE EIGHT-SIX CAN WIN, THEN
HE'D BETTER MAKE HIS MOVE SOON.

150
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,125
- YES! THIS IS WHAT I LIVE FOR.

151
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,916
THIS IS THE KINDA THING THAT
REALLY GETS MY BLOOD PUMPING!

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,708
I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME
FOR A GOOD BATTLE.

153
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,791
ALRIGHT KID.
TIME TO CUT YOU LOOSE.

154
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,291
FOLLOW THIS!

155
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,166
- WAIT A SECOND.

156
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,041
SOMETHING FEELS DIFFERENT.

157
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,541
I'M NOT LOSING AS MUCH CONTROL
WHEN I FLOOR THE GAS.

158
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,125
MAYBE I CAN ACCELERATE SOONER
THAN I NORMALLY DO.

159
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,041
WHEN I WAS AT WORK,
WAS DAD MESSING WITH IT?

160
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,041
THAT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION
I CAN THINK OF.

161
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,166
CAUSE IT SURE WASN'T LIKE THIS

162
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,958
WHEN I MADE DELIVERIES
THIS MORNING.

163
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,625
I GET IT.

164
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,083
THAT'S WHERE HE WAS EARLIER.
HE WAS TWEAKING THE CAR FOR ME.

165
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,750
WHATEVER HE DID, I LIKE IT.

166
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,541
I'M NOT SLIDING NEARLY AS MUCH
AS I USUALLY DO,

167
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,875
AND THAT MEANS I CAN
PUSH IT ALL THE WAY!

168
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,583
- Man 1: WOAH! CHECK IT OUT!

169
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,000
- Man 2: AWESOME DRIFT!

170
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,791
- I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE
TAKE THAT TIGHT OF A CORNER

171
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,500
WHILE MAINTAINING A SOLID DRIFT.

172
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,958
- THAT DUDE IS A MANIAC.

173
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,000
YOU'D HAVETA BE PERFECTLY
IN CONTROL OF YOUR SPEED

174
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,416
TO PULL THAT OFF.

175
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,750
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

176
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,291
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
NOBODY DRIFTS LIKE THAT!

177
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,083
- FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE! I TELL
YA', MAN, THAT WAS LEGENDARY!

178
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,666
DON'T YOU FORGET IT!

179
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,583
- INITIAL D.

180
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,750
- INITIAL D!

181
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,625
- ( static )

182
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,000
- Man: THE EIGHT-SIX IS RIGHT
ON THE THREE-TWO'S TAIL!

183
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,458
- HE'S REALLY DOIN' IT!

184
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,291
TAKUMI'S GIVIN' THE THREE-TWO
A RUN FOR ITS MONEY!

185
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,083
- YES!

186
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,708
SERIOUSLY, NOCKAZATO'S GOT
SOME MAD SKILLS ON HIS OWN,

187
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,000
BUT PUT RYOSUKE BEHIND HIM

188
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,916
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A
SUPERSTAR BATTLE ROYAL!

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,958
AND MY BEST FRIEND'S RACING
AGAINST BOTH OF 'EM

190
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:15,958
AT THE SAME TIME!

191
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,083
THAT IS SO FREAKIN' SWEET!

192
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,916
- I'M WITH YOU MAN,
IT'S PRETTY EXCITING,

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,333
BUT RYOSUKE AND HIS FC
AREN'T ACTUALLY IN THE RACE,

194
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,875
THEY'RE JUST
FOLLOWING ALONG.

195
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,208
HE'S JUST A SPECTATOR WITH A
REALLY SWEET VIEW OF THE ACTION.

196
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,083
- YEAH. JUST TAKUMI AND TAKESHI.

197
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,541
- THE THREE-TWO
HAS THE EIGHT-SIX

198
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,541
AT A HUGE DISADVANTAGE.

199
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,750
BUT I KNOW TAKUMI'LL FIND A WAY
TO PULL THROUGH.

200
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,250
- Itsuki: YEAH!
TAKUMI'S GOT THIS, RIGHT GUYS?

201
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,708
AM I RIGHT?
AH, YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

202
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,166
- MAN, THE THREE-TWO'S LEAD
IS GETTIN' BIGGER.

203
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,916
- NAKAZOTO'S GOT A BIG MOUTH,

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,250
BUT AT LEAST HE HAS
THE SKILLS TO BACK IT UP.

205
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,958
JUST LOOK AT THE WAY
HE DISTRIBUTES THE LOAD

206
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,375
AND EASES THE UNDERSTEER
IN THE TURNS.

207
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,333
HE REALLY KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES
TO DRAW OUT EVERY OUNCE

208
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,958
OF THE GT-R'S POWER.

209
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,041
IT ISN'T PRETTY TO LOOK AT,

210
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,958
BUT THIS ISN'T THE TIME
TO PLAY IT SAFE.

211
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,875
- I GOTTA ASK YOU, BRO. WHOSE
SIDE ARE YOU REALLY ON ANYWAY?

212
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,083
IF THE KID LOSES THIS RACE,

213
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,916
THEN OUR CHANCE AT
REDEMPTION IS OVER.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,208
- THIS BATTLE HASN'T EVEN BEGUN.

215
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,083
THE FIRST HALF IS ALMOST
ALL STRAIGHTAWAYS

216
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,666
WITH LOTS OF GENTLE SLOPES.

217
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,458
THE EIGHT-SIX DOESN'T PERFORM
WELL IN THAT SORT OF TERRAIN.

218
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,750
BUT THE DECLINES ARE GONNA BE
GETTING ROUGH HERE SOON,

219
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,916
A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
FOR A DOWNHILL SPECIALIST

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,291
TO REALLY SHINE.

221
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,750
- ( tires screeching )

222
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,875
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

223
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,833
THE THREE-TWO WAS MADE
FOR THIS NEXT CORNER.

224
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,416
A LOW-GEAR HAIRPIN.

225
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,291
ALL I GOTTA DO IS CUT MY SPEED
BY SLAMMIN' ON THE BRAKES.

226
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,541
- ( engine revving )

227
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,750
WHEN I'M ON THE DOWNHILL
THE FRONT WHEELS

228
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,291
STILL HAVE TO BEAR THE LOAD.

229
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,750
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO
KEEP THE UNDERSTEER

230
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,750
FROM PUSHIN' TOO HARD.

231
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,958
BUT COMING OUT OF THE
TURN ACCELERATING

232
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,208
FROM A LOW GEAR IS A BREEZE.

233
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,416
IT'S NO SECRET THIS IS FASTEST
MACHINE ON THE RACING CIRCUIT.

234
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,416
AND IT DOMINATES ON THE
OPEN ROADS, TOO!

235
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,208
THE GT-R LOGO ON THE BACK MEANS
THIS IS THE BADDEST SET

236
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,416
OF WHEELS YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

237
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
TOO BAD YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET
CLOSE ENOUGH TO READ IT, KID!

238
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,791
- Kenji: HEY, IKETANI.

239
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,583
- Iketani: YEAH?

240
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,666
- WELL. I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

241
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,708
UP UNTIL NOW I'VE
ALWAYS SEEN TAKUMI

242
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,791
AS THE KIND OF DRIVER
WHO'S ONLY REALLY FAST

243
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,416
WHEN HE'S RACING ON HIS HOME
TURF, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

244
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,666
BUT WHAT IF HE RACED
ON A DIFFERENT PASS.

245
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,125
HOW WELL YOU THINK
HE WOULD REALLY DO?

246
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,875
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT?

247
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,041
- WELL, SURE. I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT A FEW TIMES ACTUALLY.

248
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,291
BUT RIGHT NOW WE JUST
NEED TO FOCUS.

249
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,750
C'MON TAKUMI. WIN.

250
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,875
- HELL YEAH!

251
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,708
- ( tires screeching )

252
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,250
- MAN, I CAN BARELY
KEEP HIM IN SIGHT!

253
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,791
( chuckles ) LOOKS LIKE THE REAL
ACTION'S ABOUT TO GET STARTED.

254
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,708
HE'S GRIPPIN' THE EDGE OF
THE ROAD WITH HIS INSIDE TIRES.

255
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,583
THIS IS IT.
THE MOVE THAT BEAT ME.

256
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,750
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET
THE CHANCE TO SEE IT AGAIN

257
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,375
WITH MY OWN EYES.

258
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,250
RYOSUKE'S GONE QUIET.

259
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,458
I BETTER DO THE SAME, I DON'T
WANNA BREAK HIS CONCENTRATION.

260
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,833
I'VE RIDDEN SHOTGUN WITH HIM
FOR YEARS NOW.

261
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,458
AND HE'S NEVER DRIVEN WITH
SUCH INTENSITY BEFORE.

262
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,125
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SO FOCUSED.

263
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,916
- HE'S GAINING ON ME!

264
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,041
HOW THE HELL IS THE
EIGHT-SIX CLOSING THE GAP?

265
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,166
IMPOSSIBLE!

266
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,458
- ( tires screeching )

267
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,416
- IT'S AMAZING, CATCHIN' UP
TO ME AFTER SUCH A HUGE LEAD.

268
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,708
NOW I SEE HOW WRONG I
WAS THINKING THE 8-6

269
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,375
COULDN'T HANDLE THIS.

270
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,541
THAT THING IS A
TRUE FIGHTING MACHINE

271
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,875
RIGHT UP THERE WITH MY GT-R!

272
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:13,375
ALRIGHT, PLAY TIME IS OVER. MAN,
I'M GETTING SUCH A RUSH!

273
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,458
THIS FEELS GREAT! I HAVEN'T BEEN
IN A FIGHT THIS INTENSE

274
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,166
SINCE I BOUGHT THIS CAR!

275
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,291
- ( tires screeching )

276
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,416
- WHEN IT COMES TO MANEUVERING
THROUGH HAIRPIN TURNS,

277
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,916
THE POOR KID DOESN'T HOLD
A CANDLE TO THE THREE-TWO.

278
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,541
THEY'RE CLOSE GOIN'
INTO THE TURN,

279
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,375
BUT THE EIGHT-SIX
LOSES GROUND AFTER A HAIRPIN.

280
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,750
CAN'T FORGET ABOUT
NAKAZATO THOUGH.

281
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,791
ATTACKING THE DOWNHILL
IN A HEAVY THREE-TWO.

282
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,625
TAKES SOME SERIOUS GUTS!

283
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:58,958
- NO WAY!

284
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,416
- THE EIGHT-SIX CAUGHT UP AT THE
FASTEST CORNER ON THE TRACK?

285
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,250
DOIN' OVER A HUNDRED
KILOMETERS AN HOUR

286
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,750
IN A FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT IS NUTS.

287
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,958
HE NEARLY GRAZED
THE GUARD RAIL!

288
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,166
THESE MOVES DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

289
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,583
TO DO WITH THE CAR'S
CAPABILITIES.

290
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,250
IT'S THE DRIVER.
HE'S GOT A SCREW LOOSE.

291
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,083
JUST ONE SLIP UP AND
HE'LL BE SPLATTERED

292
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,250
ALL OVER THE MOUNTAIN.

293
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,750
NOW I KNOW HIS SECRET.

294
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,791
A LIGHTWEIGHT CAR LIKE THE
EIGHT-SIX HAS WEAK ACCELERATION,

295
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,000
WHICH MEANS IT TAKES FOREVER

296
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,041
TO GET BACK UP TO
SPEED AFTER BRAKING.

297
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,083
SO HE NEVER SACRIFICES MORE
SPEED THAN HE ABSOLUTELY HAS TO.

298
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,791
IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE NOW.

299
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,708
WHEN I RACED HIM, I'D LOSE HIM
ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS

300
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,791
AND THEN, SURE ENOUGH,

301
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,500
HE'D BE BACK ON MY TAIL
AFTER EACH TURN.
