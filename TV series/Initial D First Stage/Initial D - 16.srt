00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,541
LEAVE THREE INCHES.

30
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,083
BE CAREFUL UP HERE.
THE GROUND'S SANDY!

31
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,708
PERFECT! YOU'RE LOOKIN' SHARP!

32
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,583
YOU'VE SO GOT THIS ONE
IN THE BAG.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,500
- Takumiitsukiyu: WHAT?

34
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,083
- Kenji: NO WAY!

35
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,916
SOME RANDOM GIRL YOU HAPPENED
TO MEET ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,916
ACTUALLY GAVE YOU
HER PHONE NUMBER?

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,833
DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE THAT?

38
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,875
WAIT, LET ME GUESS. SHE'S BIG
AS A HOUSE AND UGLY AS SIN.

39
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,041
- YOU BETTER BE JOKING,
IKETANI!

40
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,541
THAT SORTA STUFF DOESN'T
JUST HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE!

41
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,000
TELL ME IT'S NOT TRUE.

42
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,291
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

43
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,208
REAL STREET RACERS
DON'T NEED GIRLFRIENDS!

44
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,875
- COME ON, DUDE.
JUST LEVEL WITH US ALREADY.

45
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,291
SHE'S GOTTA BE
SCREWED UP SOMEHOW.

46
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,208
- HOLD ON, KENJI. WHAT THE
HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

47
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,541
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SUCH
A JERK? JUST BELIEVE ME.

48
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:05,291
- WHY WOULD I? SERIOUSLY, IT'S
YOU WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,791
- HMM. I GET IT.

50
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,125
YOU'RE ALL JEALOUS.

51
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,333
I FOUND SOMEONE SPECIAL
AND YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT.

52
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,208
YOU SHOULD SEE HER LONG
SILKY BROWN HAIR

53
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,416
AS IT WAVES IN THE WIND.

54
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,583
HER SEDUCTIVE EYES.
AND HER SKIN!

55
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,208
I'M POSITIVE THAT THE HEAVENS
ABOVE SENT HER TO ME

56
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,250
AS REWARD FOR ALL THE YEARS
OF HARD WORK

57
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,791
THAT ONLY AN HONEST MAN
LIKE MYSELF CAN ACHIEVE!

58
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,250
TOMORROW'S THE BIG
DAY WHEN MAKO AND I

59
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,583
WILL CELEBRATE OUR
VERY FIRST DATE!

60
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,166
( sobbing )

61
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,541
OH! ALRIGHT MEN, BACK TO WORK!

62
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,666
( hopping )

63
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
- LISTEN UP, GUYS.
I GOT AN IDEA.

64
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,916
WHY DON'T WE FOLLOW
HIM ON HIS DATE

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,250
SO WE CAN CHECK THIS GIRL OUT!

66
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,791
- DUDE, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

67
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,708
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO
SEE THIS CHICK WITH MY OWN EYES.

68
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,291
COUNT ME IN!

69
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,208
- AND WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU
PLAN ON TELLING IKETANI

70
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:51,916
IF HE FINDS OUT?

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,458
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

72
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,708
LOOK AT HIM. HE'S IN FANTASY
LAND RIGHT NOW.

73
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,125
HE'LL NEVER KNOW.

74
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,791
THIS MIGHT BE THE ONLY CHANCE
WE GET TO SEE THIS CHICK

75
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,875
BEFORE SHE DUMPS HIM.

76
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,666
I WANNA KNOW IF
SHE'S THE ANGEL HE SAYS.

77
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,333
- LEAVE IKETANI ALONE. DON'T
YOU HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO?

78
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,083
- BUT WE'RE JUST
LOOKIN' OUT FOR HIM, BOSS!

79
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,083
AND THEN WHEN SHE
EVENTUALLY DUMPS HIM

80
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,333
WE'LL LET HIM CRY
ON OUR SHOULDERS.

81
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,250
ISN'T THAT WHAT
FRIENDSHIP'S ABOUT?

82
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,375
- HOW CAN YOU BE
SO SURE SHE'LL DUMP HIM?

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,583
- ( glass squeaking )

84
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,166
- OH!

85
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,708
- HOW MUCH YOU WANNA
BET THAT SHE'S NOT AS PRETTY

86
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,125
AS HE SAYS SHE IS?

87
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,791
YOU KNOW IKETANI, LIKE HOW
HE EXAGGERATES EVERYTHING.

88
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,500
AND HE GETS OBSESSED REAL EASY.

89
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:46,875
- DUDE, THAT IS SO TRUE!

90
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,541
- ME AND IKETANI WENT FISHING
AT LAKE AKINA ONCE.

91
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,083
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, I THINK
IT WAS BACK IN JUNIOR HIGH.

92
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,791
ANYWAY THE FISH
WEREN'T BITIN' THAT DAY,

93
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,166
BUT RIGHT BEFORE WE LEFT
I FINALLY MANAGED

94
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,375
TO CATCH A LITTLE ONE.

95
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,541
AND HE WAS ALL
"OH MAN, THAT FISH IS HUGE!"

96
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,000
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HIM,
I THOUGHT HE'D LOST HIS MIND.

97
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,625
IT WAS THIS BIG.

98
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,166
ALL THESE PEOPLE CAME BY

99
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,208
EXPECTING TO SEE
THIS GIGANTIC FISH.

100
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,416
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES.

101
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,583
IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING.

102
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,750
- FUNNY.

103
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,875
- HE ALWAYS BLOWS THINGS
OUT OF PROPORTION.

104
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,291
THAT'S JUST THE WAY HE IS.

105
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,625
- HEY, GUYS.
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT COMPANY.

106
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,083
- HOLY CRAP, WE'RE BUSTED!

107
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,625
I WAS SO CAUGHT UP IN THE STORY
I COMPLETELY FORGOT

108
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,958
TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE ROAD!

109
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,916
SO MUCH FOR OUR TOP-SECRET
SURVEILLANCE MISSION.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,875
WE'RE TOTALLY DEAD IN THE WATER.

111
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,916
I AM SO SORRY, IKETANI!

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,375
PLEASE FORGIVE US.

113
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,625
WE JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT SHE
LOOKED LIKE, THAT'S ALL!

114
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,541
- Itsuki: IT'S TRUE! WE WEREN'T
GOING TO BOTHER YOU.

115
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,250
WE JUST WANTED TO TAKE
A QUICK PEEK AND BE ON OUR WAY!

116
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,916
DON'T BE MAD AT US. WE WERE
JUST LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,125
WE'LL TURN AROUND
AT THE NEXT EXIT, WE SWEAR!

118
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,166
- FORGET IT,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

119
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,750
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU GUYS TO HER.

120
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,916
YOU CAN SEE WHAT SHE'S LIKE AND
THEN FIND SOMEBODY ELSE TO BUG.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,375
- REALLY?

122
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,291
- THAT'S AWESOME!

123
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,458
- BUT, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
NOT TO FOLLOW US AFTERWARDS,

124
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,583
'CAUSE IF YOU DO
I'LL BE BEYOND PISSED.

125
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,583
- SCORE!

126
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,625
- Iketani: SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

127
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,583
SO UHH. I WANT YOU TO MEET
A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS.

128
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,333
- HI THERE. I'M MAKO SATO.

129
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,083
- HELLO, MA'AM.
- IT'S A PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,291
- SO ARE YOU READY TO GO?
- YEAH, OKAY.

131
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,625
- HEY, EASY NOW.
WE AREN'T PUPPIES, YA KNOW.

132
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,333
- ( car starting )

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,708
- 'KAY, SO WE'RE
DEFINITELY NOT DREAMING.

134
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,458
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

135
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,125
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

136
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,083
SHE IS PERFECT. I NEVER
KNEW IKETANI HAD IT IN HIM.

137
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,250
- TRUE STREET RACERS
DON'T NEED WOMEN.

138
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,750
COME ON, KENJI.
LET'S CRY TOGETHER.

139
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,333
- I'M NOT GONNA CRY.

140
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,416
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING' AT?

141
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,583
YOU SAYIN' I CAN'T
FIND A GIRLFRIEND?

142
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,250
- WOAH! CAN'T ANYONE
TAKE A JOKE ANYMORE?

143
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,541
- Itsuki: WELL.
WHAT DO YA GUYS WANNA DO NOW?

144
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,583
- Kenji: I DON'T KNOW.

145
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,291
THIS AREA ISN'T EXACTLY
THE BEST PLACE

146
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,000
FOR THREE SINGLE
GUYS TO HANG OUT,

147
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,958
ESPECIALLY THIS TIME OF YEAR.

148
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,125
- Itsuki: HEY, I KNOW!
LET'S CHECK OUT USUI PASS!

149
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,500
- ( loud music playing )

150
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,541
- UH. SORRY.

151
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,916
SO I'M REALLY INTO CARS.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,500
ARE THERE ANY IN
PARTICULAR THAT YOU LIKE?

153
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,916
- YEAH, THERE ARE SOME.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,458
THE FIRST ONE
THAT COMES TO MIND,

155
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:55,291
WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE
THE LAST GENERATION RX-SEVEN.

156
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,916
- AN FC, HUH?

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,166
WOW. YOU'VE GOT
EXCELLENT TASTE IN WHEELS.

158
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,083
- I TAKE IT YOU'RE A STREET
RACER, IS THAT RIGHT?

159
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,625
- UH YEAH.
IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

160
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,166
WHEN I'M NOT RACING I TRY TO
DRIVE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,

161
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,583
TO BLEND IN, YA KNOW?

162
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,208
SO. MAKO.

163
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,750
THIS MAY SOUND WEIRD, BUT I,

164
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,083
I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT
YOU THOUGHT OF STREET RACERS.

165
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,583
- I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH 'EM.

166
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,666
I MEAN, I KINDA GOT A THING
FOR CARS MYSELF.

167
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,875
- YOU DO?

168
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,208
- I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED STREET
RACERS OVER NORMAL DRIVERS

169
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,916
BECAUSE OF THE SKILL
IT TAKES TO BE ONE.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,708
YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

171
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,458
SPEND ALL THE MONEY YOU WANT TO
ON THAT EXPENSIVE CAR,

172
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,750
BUT MONEY DOESN'T
BUY YOU TECHNIQUE.

173
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,666
I HAVE MUCH MORE
RESPECT FOR SOMEONE

174
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,125
WHO CAN HANDLE A TIGHT HAIRPIN,

175
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,916
THAN THE PERSON
WITH THE FASTEST CAR.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,083
BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG,
IF I HAD A CHOICE

177
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,750
I'D GET THE FASTEST ONE
I COULD AFFORD.

178
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,458
- SHE'S PERFECT!
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!

179
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,000
- SO THIS IS
THE FAMED USUI PASS.

180
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,791
NEVER DRIVEN THIS
STRETCH OF ROAD BEFORE.

181
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,666
MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BUT
IT'S A HECKUVA LOT CURVIER

182
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,458
THAN I IMAGINED IT WOULD BE.

183
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,666
- Itsuki: YEAH,
IT LOOKS PRETTY TOUGH.

184
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,916
THERE'S A LOT OF CORNERS
AND THE ROAD ITSELF

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,166
IS REALLY FREAKIN' NARROW.

186
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,541
EVERY TURN ON THE THING
IS A DEATH TRAP.

187
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,250
IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING
LIKE AKINA PASS BACK HOME.

188
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,916
I WONDER WHO HAS
THE BEST TIME HERE.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,125
WHOEVER IT IS MUST BE
REALLY TALENTED.

190
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,458
- UM. SO I HAVE A QUESTION.

191
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,750
- YEAH? WHAT'S UP?

192
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,458
- HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A GIRL

193
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,833
WHO LIKED TO DRIVE

194
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,708
THE PASSES AT NIGHT
AND ACTED LIKE A STREET RACER?

195
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,166
WOULD THAT BOTHER YOU?

196
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,708
- A SIL-EIGHTY?

197
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,125
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE
FASTEST CAR IN TOWN RIGHT NOW

198
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,208
IS A BLUE SIL-EIGHTY.

199
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,791
BUT WAIT 'TILL YOU HEAR
THE CRAZY PART.

200
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,083
THE PERSON WHO DRIVES
THAT CAR IS A WOMAN.

201
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,291
- WOMEN CAN'T DRIVE!

202
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,666
- A GIRL STREET RACER?

203
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,000
- YEAH.

204
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,583
- I WOULDN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT.

205
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,166
ACTUALLY I THINK
IT'D BE AWESOME.

206
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,333
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
I THINK I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE

207
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,666
HANGIN' OUT WITH A GIRL
WHO RACED THAN ONE WHO DIDN'T.

208
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,750
- OH, REALLY?

209
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,583
- FOR SURE.

210
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,708
- AHA, NOW I GET IT.

211
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,041
SHE WANTS TO GET INTO RACING.

212
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:19,250
SO THAT MUST BE WHY
SHE LIKES THE FC SO MUCH. COOL.

213
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,083
- Kenji: A SIL-EIGHTY
WITH A CHICK DRIVIN' IT.

214
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,916
- A SIL-EIGHTY. I NEVER HEARD
OF IT. IS THAT AN IMPORT?

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,625
- WHADDYA MEAN, IMPORT?

216
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,791
IT'S LIKE YOUR
RUN-OF-THE-MILL ONE-EIGHTY

217
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,958
WITH A SILVIA FRONT END SLAPPED

218
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,666
ON THE BODY
'CUZ THE PARTS ARE CHEAPER.

219
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,541
IT GETS THE NAME BY COMBINING
SILVIA AND ONE-EIGHTY.

220
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,958
SO SIL-EIGHTY, YA GET IT?

221
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,500
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE FASTEST DRIVER ON USUI PASS

222
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,666
IS DRIVIN' A SIL-EIGHTY
AND IT'S SOME CHICK!

223
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,958
I MEAN, WHAT'RE THE ODDS?

224
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,500
THAT'S SOMETHIN' I GOTTA SEE.

225
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,416
- WELL, SHE'S UP THERE
ALMOST EVERY NIGHT.

226
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,458
YOU COULD PROBABLY CATCH HER
TONIGHT IF YOU WANTED.

227
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,125
BUT. IF YOU BOYS ARE THINKIN'
ABOUT CHALLENGING HER,

228
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,500
I'D RECONSIDER.

229
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,333
NOT EVEN THE LOCALS
HAVE COME CLOSE TO BEATIN' HER.

230
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,625
INITIAL D.

231
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,666
INITIAL D.

232
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,958
- WE'RE CALLED
THE AKINA SPEED STARS.

233
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,541
I BUILT THE TEAM MYSELF
FROM THE GROUND UP.

234
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,083
WE HAVE A NEW GUY ON THE TEAM
WHO'S SHOWING A LOT OF PROMISE.

235
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,250
HE'S ACTUALLY
THE FASTEST ON AKINA.

236
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,708
IF YOU'RE JUDGING BY SPEED ALONE
I'D SAY I'M RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

237
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,583
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG, MAKO?

238
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,708
- NO. I'M SORRY. I'M LISTENING.

239
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,958
- SORRY.

240
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,916
I MUST BE BORING YOU WITH
ALL THIS CAR TALK.

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,375
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?

242
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,666
- NO, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

243
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,125
I ACTUALLY LIKE
TALKING ABOUT CARS.

244
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,041
AND YOU OBVIOUSLY DO TOO.
I'M LEARNING A LOT FROM YOU.

245
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,250
- OH, THEN COOL.
I'D BE HAPPY TO OBLIGE.

246
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,083
SO.

247
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,708
WHAT OTHER THINGS ARE YOU INTO?

248
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,666
YOU SAID YOU ADMIRED
DRIVING TECHNIQUE,

249
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,791
DOES THAT INCLUDE DRIFTING?

250
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,916
- YEAH, DEFINITELY.

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,833
BECAUSE DRIFTING.

252
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,958
ISN'T SOMETHING YOU JUST DO.
YOU NEED A LOTTA EXPERIENCE

253
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,041
TO PULL OFF A QUALITY DRIFT.

254
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,666
THEY'RE REALLY DANGEROUS.

255
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,958
- IF I WERE TO GUESS I'D
SAY YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD

256
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:02,750
AT DRIFTING YOURSELF.

257
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,958
- YOU WOULD BE RIGHT.

258
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,708
- THAT'S GREAT.
YOU MUST BE REALLY TALENTED.

259
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,166
- I GUESS SO.

260
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,625
- WELL, I'LL SEE YA. I HAD A
GREAT TIME WITH YOU TODAY.

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,583
- UM, MAKO?

262
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,750
- YES?

263
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:27,041
- I WANTED TO
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

264
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,833
I KNOW THIS IS ONLY
OUR FIRST DATE

265
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:33,000
BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'RE SEEING ANYONE.

266
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,041
- I DON'T
HAVE A BOYFRIEND, NO.

267
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:43,541
YOU SHOULD CALL ME
AGAIN SOMETIME, IF YOU WANT.

268
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,333
- ( screams )

269
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,416
- Kenji: IKETANI.
CAN YOU HEAR ME? IKETANI.

270
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,125
- HE'S LIKE A ZOMBIE.
- HEY YO, WAKE UP, DUDE.

271
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,708
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS DOIN' HERE?

272
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,875
- WELL, WE COULDN'T HEAD BACK
HOME WITHOUT CHECKING IN ON

273
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,750
OUR BESTEST BUDDY
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

274
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,541
- C'MON, DUDE. FILL US IN.
HOW WAS THE BIG DATE? HUH?

275
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,125
- OH, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
IT WAS THE GREATEST DAY

276
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,375
OF MY WHOLE LIFE!

277
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,541
( laughs )

278
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,791
WHO'S HUNGRY FOR SOME GRUB?

279
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,208
'CAUSE DINNER'S ON ME!
ANYTHING YOU GUYS WANT!

280
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,458
AFTERWARDS WE CAN
GO CHECK OUT USUI PASS

281
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,375
AND SEE WHAT THE RACING
COMPETITION'S LIKE UP HERE.

282
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,041
- Itsuki: WOW.
SOUNDS LIKE IT WENT PRETTY WELL.

283
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,958
- Kenji: I GUESS MIRACLES
REALLY DO HAPPEN.

284
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,583
- OH!

285
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,250
- EVERY CAR WE'VE SEEN TONIGHT
HAS BEEN HAULING ASS.

286
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,416
ALL THESE DUDES OUT HERE
ARE REALLY GOOD.

287
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,125
- SO HEY, TAKUMI.

288
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,916
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T DRIVEN
ANY OTHER PASSES BESIDES AKINA,

289
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,125
BUT I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU
THOUGHT OF THIS ONE HERE?

290
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,916
- I DUNNO, I CAN'T REALLY SAY.

291
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,208
I WASN'T THE ONE DRIVING
SO I GUESS I WASN'T

292
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,458
PAYING ALL THAT MUCH ATTENTION.

293
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,166
- I WAS KINDA ZONED OUT.
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

294
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,083
YOUR EYES LOOKED
PRETTY INTENSE TO ME,

295
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,791
LIKE YOU WERE
REALLY CONCENTRATING.

296
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,208
- OH YEAH?

297
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,375
- YEAH, BUT YOUR EYES
LOOK TOTALLY DIFFERENT NOW.

298
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,750
DUDE, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT.

299
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,500
SO TELL ME, COULD YOU
RACE HERE OR WHAT?

300
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,791
- I AM TELLING YOU, MAN, I DON'T
KNOW. I'D HAVE TO TRY IT FIRST.

301
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,291
- LOOK! THERE IT IS!
THE SIL-EIGHTY!

302
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,791
- A CONTINUOUS REVERSE DRIFT?

303
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,041
- NO WAY!

304
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,958
- MAN, SHE'S GOOD.

305
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,416
- DID YOU GUYS JUST SEE THAT?

306
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,000
- THAT WAS INTENSE, DUDE.
THE ROAD'S SO NARROW!

307
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,916
- I JUST GOT DONE TELLING MAKO
THAT I WAS AN EXPERT

308
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,500
WHEN IT CAME TO DRIFTING.

309
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,166
BUT I STILL TEND TO PANIC
EVERY TIME THE REAR

310
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,750
SLIDES OUT FROM UNDER ME.

311
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,000
I NEED TO WORK ON
FIXING THAT AND FAST,

312
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,250
OTHERWISE I MAY LOSE MY ANGEL!

313
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,041
LET'S HEAD DOWN
TO THE FINISH LINE.

314
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,416
- YEAH. SURE.

315
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,666
- ( laughs )

316
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,958
- EVERY PASS HAS A HERO, HUH?

317
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,000
- WHAT THE?

318
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,916
IS IT JUST ME
OR IS HE GOING WAY TOO FAST?

319
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,958
I'VE GOT TWO
EXTRA BODIES IN HERE.

320
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,375
I CAN'T KEEP THAT PACE.

321
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,833
- HEY, SLOW DOWN AND GIVE HIM
A LITTLE BIT MORE ROOM.

322
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,375
- YA, SEE THAT?
HIS CAR'S ACTING WEIRD.

323
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,041
ALMOST LIKE HE'S
OUT OF SYNC OR SOMETHING.

324
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,250
- AND HOW CAN YOU TELL THAT
FROM BACK HERE?

325
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,208
- I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE,
IT'S JUST A FEELING I'VE GOT.

326
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,041
I GUESS.

327
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,416
- A FEELING YOU'VE GOT, HUH?

328
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,083
- Itsuki: WHOA.
HE JUST SPUN OUT!

329
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,083
- MAN, TAKUMI,
YOU WERE DEAD ON.

330
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,333
- OH CRAP!
THERE'S A CAR COMIN'!

331
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,708
- ( brakes screeching )

332
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:01,041
- Sayuki: THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.
WHO IS THIS NUMB-NUTS?

333
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,375
HE'S GOTTA BE A NOOBIE
TO MAKE SUCH A ROOKIE MISTAKE.

334
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,291
HIS REAR SLID OUT IN THE DRIFT
SO HE PANICKED

335
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,583
AND OVERCOMPENSATED
THE STEERING.

336
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,416
HEY YOU IN THE S-THIRTEEN!

337
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,458
YOU MIND MOVIN' YOUR
CRAP-BOX OUTTA THE ROAD

338
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,500
BEFORE YOU GET US ALL KILLED?

339
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,875
WE'RE TRYIN' TO PRACTICE!

340
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,333
- ALRIGHT, I'M MOVIN'.

341
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,208
- HA! HE JUST GOT OWNED!

342
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,458
- EVERYBODY KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN
AND PRETEND WE DON'T KNOW HIM.

343
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,458
- SORRY 'BOUT THAT, I JUST...

344
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,916
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,916
- NOTHING. I'M FINE.

346
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,041
- SO MAKO'S THE ONE
DRIVIN' THE SIL-EIGHTY.

347
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,916
SHE'S THE FASTEST AT USUI PASS.

348
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,125
I'M SO HUMILIATED I WANT TO DIE!

349
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,250
- Itsuki: HE'S TAKIN'
A DAY OFF?

350
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,041
- I GUESS SO.
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM.

351
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,416
THIS ISN'T LIKE IKETANI.
HE'S USUALLY SUCH A WORKAHOLIC.

352
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,791
SOMETHING HAS TO BE UP.

353
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,250
HE MUST'VE TAKEN EVERYTHING

354
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,666
THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY
REALLY HARD.

355
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,791
- I DON'T THINK I HEARD A
WORD OUT OF HIM

356
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,375
AFTER WE RAN INTO THOSE
CHICKS ON THE MOUNTAIN.

357
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,625
AND WHEN WE STOPPED AT
THAT REST AREA ON THE WAY BACK

358
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,750
HIS EYES WERE ALL GLASSED
OVER LIKE HE'D SEEN A GHOST.

359
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,083
I FELT SO BAD FOR HIM
I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

360
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,625
- YA KNOW, I HAD A BAD FEELIN'
ABOUT THIS CHICK FROM THE START.

361
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,958
I MEAN BOTH OF YOU SAW
WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE.

362
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,333
TOTALLY OUTTA HIS LEAGUE.

363
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,916
- LIKE I SAY, STREET RACERS
DO NOT NEED GIRLFRIENDS.

364
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,750
I THINK I'M GONNA GO
BY A NEW NAME.

365
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,125
CALL ME
ITSUKI THE LONELY DRIFTER.

366
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,666
- I JUST HOPE OUR
BUDDY SNAPS OUT OF THIS FUNK

367
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,166
BEFORE TOO LONG.

368
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,291
- ( phone ringing )

369
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,250
- Iketani's mom: KOECHERO!
PHONE'S FOR YOU!

370
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,916
- IT'S PROBABLY JUST KENJI.

371
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,791
TELL HIM I'M STILL SLEEPING.
I DON'T CARE.

372
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:08,291
- IT'S SOME GIRL NAMED MAKO!
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A MESSAGE?

373
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,083
- YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT SOMETHING?

374
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,875
- YEAH.

375
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,666
- IF YOU CAME HERE TO
RIDICULE ME THEN PLEASE,

376
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,583
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

377
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,791
- WHAT? NO, I...

378
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,125
NO, I WOULDN'T THINK
OF MAKING FUN OF YOU.

379
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,583
- I NEVER SUSPECTED
YOU TO BE HER.

380
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,083
I WATCHED YOUR SIL-EIGHTY DRIFT
THROUGH A NARROW TURN EARLIER

381
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,916
WHEN YOU WERE
GOING DOWNHILL.

382
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,500
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
THE FASTEST AT USUI PASS.

383
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,083
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING BEFORE?

384
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,458
YOU KNOW I WOULD'VE
APPRECIATED A WARNING.

385
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,458
- I'M SO SORRY.

386
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,166
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I SHARE WITH PEOPLE.

387
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,416
AND SEEING YOU
REALLY SHOCKED ME TOO.

388
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,875
BUT THEN. ONCE I SAW YOU
I REALIZED THAT YOU DESERVED

389
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:01,708
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

390
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,291
- YEAH, AND WHAT'S THAT?

391
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:09,333
- YOU SEE. I'M ACTUALLY MORE
OF A QUIET TYPE OF GIRL.

392
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,958
- IS THAT RIGHT?

393
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,250
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. YOU
DON'T EXPECT A DRIVER LIKE YOU

394
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,791
TO BE A WALLFLOWER.

395
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,083
- I CAN SEE HOW YOU'D THINK
THAT, BUT I'M THE KIND OF PERSON

396
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:21,333
WHOSE PERSONALITY CHANGES
WHENEVER I GET BEHIND THE WHEEL.

397
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,875
NO MATTER HOW FAST
OR DANGEROUS I DRIVE THE PASS,

398
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,000
MEN ALWAYS SEE ME
AS MORE OF A THREAT

399
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,541
THAN AS GIRLFRIEND MATERIAL.

400
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,208
IT'S HELPED ME REALIZE IT'S
TIME FOR ME TO MAKE A DECISION.

401
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,083
NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS ME.

402
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,708
SO ONCE SUMMERTIME COMES AROUND.
I'M GONNA QUIT RACING.

403
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,791
I WANT MY LAST RACE
TO BE SPECIAL,

404
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,125
SOMETHING I'LL NEVER FORGET.

405
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,541
I WANNA RACE THE EIGHT-SIX
HERE ON MY HOME TURF.

406
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,041
THAT'S MY FINAL WISH AS A RACER.

407
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,125
IF YOU HELP ME I'LL EVEN
GIVE YOU MY VIRGINITY.

408
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:57,250
IF THAT'S WHAT IT'LL TAKE.

409
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,041
- WAIT, HOLD ON. I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

410
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,833
- WHAT? AM I NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

411
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,416
- NO, NOT THAT.

412
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,333
TAKUMI IS A CLOSE
FRIEND OF MINE.

413
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,916
I CAN'T SELL HIM OUT LIKE THAT.

414
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,333
IT JUST WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

415
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,000
I GET IT NOW.

416
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,875
SHE WAS USING ME.

417
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,208
IT WASN'T ME SHE WAS AFTER.

418
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,583
IT WAS TAKUMI.

419
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,833
KENJI WAS RIGHT.

420
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,458
A PRETTY GIRL LIKE HER
WOULD NEVER GO OUT

421
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,583
WITH A LOSER LIKE ME.

422
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,916
SCREW IT. I CAN'T
MAKE ANY PROMISES,

423
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
BUT I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

424
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,250
- YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?

425
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,416
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY.

426
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,333
IF I DO THIS FOR YOU, IT'LL BE
FOR MY OWN PERSONAL REASONS,

427
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,375
AND NOT BECAUSE I WANT
TO SLEEP WITH YOU.

428
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,625
- OH, IKETANI.

429
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,416
- I JUST...

430
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,083
I WANNA DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

431
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,166
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

432
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,666
BECAUSE FOR
A LITTLE WHILE THERE.

433
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,458
I WAS ACTUALLY FALLING FOR HER.

434
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,666
IF HER WISH COMING
TRUE MAKES HER HAPPY,

435
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,916
THEN THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

436
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,625
- ( tires screeching )

437
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:20,500
- THE GUYS WOULD PROBABLY LAUGH
AT ME FOR SAYING THIS BUT,

438
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,250
I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE ONE.

439
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,375
I REALLY DID.

440
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,750
I LOVED HER.

441
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,625
BUT I GUESS IT
WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

442
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,125
- ( theme song playing )

443
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,083
- Announcer:
I HAVE TO ASK, MAKO.

444
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,458
HOW WERE YOU EVER
INTERESTED IN IKETANI?

445
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,875
- Mako: UH, I DON'T KNOW.

446
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,750
- AND THAT PROPOSITION
YOU MADE HIM. THAT WAS CRAZY!

447
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,125
- OKAY, MAYBE I WENT
A LITTLE TOO FAR.

448
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,916
- THERE ARE TONS
OF GOOD-LOOKIN' GUYS OUT THERE.

449
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,500
SO WHY SETTLE ON IKETANI?
I DON'T GET IT.

450
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,250
- ALL I CAN SAY IS.
I REALLY LIKE HIM.

451
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:54,541
- THAT'S CRAZY TALK!
I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND WOMEN!

452
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:58,750
NEXT TIME ON INITIAL D:
SUDDEN-DEATH DEATH MATCH!

453
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,250
- DON'T MISS IT!
