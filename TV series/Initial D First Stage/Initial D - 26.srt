13
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,333
NO MATTER HOW FAST I GO,
I CAN'T SHAKE HIM.

14
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,708
THIS SUCKS.

15
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,750
AT THIS RATE I'M GONNA LOSE.

16
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,541
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,708
THIS GUY'S THE BEST.
NO WAY I CAN COMPARE TO HIM.

18
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:34,250
I WISH IT WEREN'T TRUE,
BUT, I'M GONNA LOSE THIS!

00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,291
- ( tires screeching )

20
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:24,083
- THIS WHOLE RIDE IS SENDING
CHILLS DOWN MY SPINE.

21
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,791
TO SEE THIS KID FOLLOWING
A PERFECT LINE

22
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,375
IS LIKE WITNESSING A MIRACLE.

23
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,541
IF I WEREN'T RIGHT ON HIM,
SHADOWING HIS EVERY MOVE,

24
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,125
IT WOULD BE DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ME TO PULL THIS OFF.

25
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,333
I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S
ANYONE ABLE TO DO IT.

26
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,791
BEGINNERS CAN DRIVE FAST ON A
STRAIGHT LINE. THAT'S CAKE.

27
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,250
INTERMEDIATE DRIVERS START
TO WORK IT A LITTLE BETTER

28
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,666
BY MASTERING THE CORNERS.

29
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,416
BUT THE TRULY ADVANCED
DRIVERS FIND THEIR OWN COURSE.

30
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,083
THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF MY
'FASTEST DRIVER' THEORY

31
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,916
IS TO FIND THAT ULTIMATE COURSE.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,583
I CAN'T BELIEVE AFTER
SEARCHING FOR SO LONG

33
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,791
THE BEST EXAMPLE I'VE FOUND OF
MY THEORY IS HERE,

34
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,666
TONIGHT, IN THIS KIND OF A RACE.

35
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,458
THIS KID HAS SOME
AMAZING TALENT.

36
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,208
- ( engine revving )

37
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,208
- HEY, HERE THEY COME.

38
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,791
- WHO'S IN FRONT?
IS IT THE EIGHT-SIX OR THE FC?

39
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:39,833
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!

40
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,125
- ( tires screeching )

41
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,000
- ( engine revving )

42
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,541
- WHOA! THAT'S INTENSITY!

43
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,500
- IMPRESSIVE THEY CAN PULL
IT OFF SO CLOSE.

44
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,708
- ( tires screeching )

45
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:07,125
- THIS ISN'T WORKING.
I CAN'T WIDEN THE LEAD.

46
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,541
- ( tires screeching )

47
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,791
- Blondie Redsun: THIS IS IT.
HERE THEY COME.

48
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,500
JUST THE SOUND OF THOSE SQUEALS
GIVE ME THE FREAKIN WILLIES.

49
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,166
- Kenta: THAT STRAIGHT LENGTH OF
TRACK BEFORE THE HAIRPIN TURN,

50
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,625
IS A LONG SECTION FOR THE
GUYS TO SHOOT THROUGH.

51
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:24,291
BET THERE'S ABOUT TO BE SOME
HARD-ASS BRAKING COMIN' ON.

52
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,375
- CHECK IT OUT!
THE EIGHT-SIX IS IN FRONT!

53
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,500
- Kenta: RYOSUKE!

54
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,750
- Boy 1: THIS IS THE ENTRANCE
TO THE FIVE HAIRPINS.

55
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,333
I GOT MY EYES ON BOTH CARS NOW
AND THE EIGHT-SIX IS LEADING.

56
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,416
- ( engine revving )

57
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,833
- HE SCREWED UP,
HE'S GOING IN TOO FAST.

58
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,250
- ( tires screeching )

59
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,875
- DAMMIT! TURN!

60
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,666
- ( crowd gasping )

61
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,583
- ( tires screeching )

62
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,041
- HE COULD'VE POWERED THROUGH
IT AND BROUGHT IT BACK AROUND,

63
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,125
IF HE WERE DRIVING
A MORE POWERFUL CAR.

64
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,041
BUT TRYING IT WITH AN EIGHT-SIX
IS NOTHING SHORT OF RECKLESS.

65
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,125
-Boy 1: RYOSUKE'S FC
TOOK THE LEAD!

66
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,791
- HE WHAT?

67
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,583
- THE EIGHT-SIX
OVER-ACCELERATED.

68
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,083
THEN WHEN HE UNDERSTEERED,

69
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,000
RYOSUKE DROVE A NAIL IN HIS
COFFIN AND PASSED HIM.

70
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,250
- Keisuke: THE EIGHT-SIX
UNDERSTEERED?

71
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,166
- RYOSUKE'S BETTER
THAN I'VE EVER SEEN HIM.

72
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,458
NO ONE CAN MATCH
THE TALENT THAT GUY'S GOT.

73
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,083
- Boy 1: DUDE, AIN'T
THAT THE TRUTH!

74
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,416
HE'S TOTALLY DRAGGIN'

81

BACK AS LONG AS I COULD

82
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,083
TO HIDE MY STRENGTHS.

83

BUT NOW THAT I'M IN FRONT,

84
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,916
I DON'T WANT HIM TO GET RIGHT
UP ON ME AND SCOPE ME OUT.

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,791
SO BEFORE HE RECOVERS ANY
GROUND, I NEED TO WIDEN THE GAP.

86
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,625
THAT'S HOW I'LL SECURE THE WIN.

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,083
I MEAN, HOW COULD IT

106
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,500

IT AGAIN TONIGHT.

ISN'T IN THE POWER
IT INNATELY HAS.

123
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,375
IT'S IN THE AGILITY YOU GET
FROM AN IDEAL FRONT

AND REAR END WEIGHT
DISTRIBUTION.

125

I JUST LOVE THE CONSISTENT

EVEN IF I HAVE TO PUT
MY PRIDE ON THE LINE,

128
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,958
THE ROTARY ENGINE CAN'T FALL
BEHIND THE EIGHT-SIX

129
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,416
ON THESE CORNERS.

131
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,791
- LOOK AT THOSE BOYS.

132
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,000
THEY'RE SOMETHING ELSE
ON THAT ASPHALT TOGETHER.

133
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,083
THE DRIFT PUNKS 'ROUND HERE
CAN'T EVEN COME CLOSE

134
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,250
TO THE SPEED THOSE GUYS
EFFORTLESSLY HAVE.

135
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,833
- I KNOW. SO WHO DO YOU THINK
IS GONNA WIN THIS THING?

136
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,041
- WELL, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO PASS RYOSUKE

137
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,291
ONCE HE'S TAKEN THE LEAD.
THAT'S A FACT.

138
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,541
BUT THEN AGAIN, THIS IS
TAKUMI HE'S RACING AGAINST.

139
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,916
I MEAN HE HASN'T
GIVEN UP THE GOLD.

140
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,208
HE'S CHOOSING BETTER LINES
THAN THE FC FOR SURE.

141
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,208
YOU CAN TELL HOW OFTEN
HE'S DRIVEN AKINA PASS.

142
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,958
- ( tires screeching )

143
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,166
- I FIGURED AS SOON AS HE
GOT OUT IN FRONT OF ME,

144
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,458
HE WOULD'VE LEFT ME IN THE DUST.

145
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,958
LOOKS LIKE I'VE
STILL GOT A CHANCE.

146
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,083
I'VE GOTTA GET CLOSER.

147
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,041
ALMOST THERE.

148
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,250
- WHAT THE HELL?

149
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,125
ALL OF THE SUDDEN MY FRONT TIRES
AREN'T STICKING TO THE ROAD.

150
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,291
COULD IT BE HEAT WEAR?

151
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,083
FOLLOWING THE EIGHT-SIX AND
COPYING HIS DRIVING MIGHT HAVE

152
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,666
PUT MORE OF A STRAIN ON THE
FRONT TIRES THAN I EXPECTED.

153
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,666
HE'S GAINING.

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,625
I WONDER IF HE'S HAVING THE
SAME PROBLEMS WITH HIS TIRES

155
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,375
THAT I'M HAVING WITH MINE.

156
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,458
IT DOESN'T MATTER. A LITTLE
WEAR ON THE TIRES

157
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,875
WON'T AFFECT MY
TECHNIQUE ONE BIT.

158
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,041
- INITIAL D!

159
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,458
INITIAL D!

160
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,250
- I'LL NEVER CATCH HIM
AN INCH AT A TIME.

161
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,125
I'VE GOT TO GET CLOSER FAST.

162
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,625
- ( engine revving )

163
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,291
- ( tires screeching )

164
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,000
DAMN! IS THIS THE BEST I CAN DO?

165
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,291
MAYBE I SHOULD TRY THAT MOVE
DAD WAS TELLING ME ABOUT.

166
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,458
"THE OTHER
GUTTER DRIVING" THING.

167
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,958
- YOU'RE BACK. THAT WAS QUICK.

168
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,375
- HEY, DAD. I THINK I FIGURED
OUT A PRETTY COOL TRICK TO AVOID

169
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,500
SKIDDING OUT ON A CURVE
IN SNOWY WEATHER LIKE THIS.

170
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,958
HOOK THE TIRES ON ONE
SIDE INTO THE GUTTER

171
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,291
ON THAT SIDE OF THE ROAD.

172
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,583
IT MAKES CORNERING SO
EASY IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

173
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,958
- "GUTTER DRIVING". I USE THAT
TECHNIQUE A LOT MYSELF.

174
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,958
- WELL, DAMMIT.
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT TOO?

175
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,250
- LISTEN UP. THERE ARE TWO WAYS

176
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,958
TO USE THE GUTTERS ON
AKINA'S ROADS.

177
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,833
THE METHOD YOU STUMBLED
ONTO IS TO USE THE GUTTER

178
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:08,916
AS YOU ENTER THE CORNER

179
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,250
SO YOU CAN
PREVENT UNDER STEERING.

180
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,916
BUT...

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,375
THERE I'S ANOTHER ONE AND THIS
ONE EMPHASIZES RECOVERY

182
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,500
AFTER A CORNER.

183
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,541
THE TIMING USED FOR
GETTING IN AND OUT

184
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,000
OF THE GUTTER IS DIFFERENT.

185
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,125
IT'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY TOUGH DEAL.

186
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,291
BEST FOR YOU
TO FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF.

187
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,416
- ( engine revving )

188
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,291
- I HAVEN'T EVEN
TRIED THE MOVE YET.

189
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,333
IT'S ONE HELL OF A GAMBLE.
SHOULD I GO FOR IT?

190
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,500
- ( tires screeching )

191
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,416
- SCREW IT, HERE GOES!

192
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,458
- WHAT THE HELL DID HE
JUST PULL OFF?

193
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,083
I GOTTA KNOW WHAT HE JUST DID.

194
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,125
- Takeshi: HEY SHINGO,
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE COMIN'.

195
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,541
- AND JUDGING FROM
THAT SKIDDING SOUND,

196
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,833
THEY'VE GOTTA BE RIGHT ON
TOP OF EACH OTHER.

197
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,333
- I'D EXPECT AS MUCH
FROM THESE TWO.

198
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,750
- THIS IS IT. THE PLACE
TO GO FOR THE WIN.

199
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,583
THE STRAIGHTAWAY
LETS YOU SPEED UP

200
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,291
FOR THE BRAKING YOU
GOTTA DO COMING UP.

201
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,750
IT'S NOT NARROW AS HELL
LIKE THE REST OF THE PASS.

202
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,208
THIS CORNER'S GOT THREE LANES.
YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR OWN LINE.

203
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,250
ON TOP OF THAT
THIS IS A COMPOUND CORNER

204
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,125
WHERE YOU GOT TWO LINES
OVERLAPPING EACH OTHER.

205
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,416
THE FINISH LINE'S
RIGHT OVER THERE.

206
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,458
WHERE ELSE IS EITHER
OF 'EM GO FOR THE WIN?

207
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,125
NO OTHER CHOICE.

208
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,666
- SO THE ONE WHO LEADS
AFTER THIS CORNER,

209
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,375
HE'S GOTTA BE THE ONE
WHO WINS THE RACE.

210
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,833
- ( tires screeching )

211
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,250
- DUDE, HERE THEY COME!

212
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,000
THE FC'S IN FRONT!

213
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,333
- BUT CHECK IT. THE
EIGHT-SIX IS RIGHT BEHIND!

214
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,541
- THIS IS OUT THERE!
WHAT'LL THEY DO!

215
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,916
- THERE'S NO WAY TO PASS
FROM THE OUTSIDE!

216
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,583
HE'S GOTTA GO INSIDE!

217
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,000
- Takeshi: I DON'T KNOW, MAN!

218
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,583
- Both: HE'S TAKIN' THE OUTSIDE!

219
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,208
- RYOSUKE DIDN'T LEAVE HIM
ANY ROOM ON THE INSIDE!

220
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,791
THERE WAS NO WAY
FOR HIM TO GO THERE!

221
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,458
THIS IS ALL HE CAN DO!

222
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,916

228
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,250
- THE INSIDE LINE'S
GOT THAT ADVANTAGE!

229
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,000
- THE FC IS SKIDDING
TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE CURVE!

230
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,166
IS THAT FOR REAL!

231
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,125
- I'M TELLIN' YOU,
HE'S GOING WAY TO FAST

232
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,625

00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,041
HE'S HISTORY!

237
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,375
- THEIR LINES ARE GONNA CROSS!

238
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,416
- THIS IS IT! HERE THEY COME!

239
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,416
- ( pop music playing )

240
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,750
- NO WAY!

241
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,750
- I CAN'T BELIEVE RYOSUKE
IS GONNA LOSE THIS!

242
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,666
- HEY THAT'S TAKUMI'S CAR!

243
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,416
TAKUMI. HE WON.

244
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,833
- Boy 1: IT'S THE EIGHT-SIX!
THE EIGHT-SIX WON IT!

245
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,250
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

246
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,083
AND ON TOP OF THAT HE SET
AN AMAZING COURSE RECORD.

247
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,708
- MY BIG BROTHER LOST.

248
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,541
I CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD
AROUND THAT.

249
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,541
THE LEGEND OF THE UNBEATABLE
MAN WAS JUST CRUSHED.

250
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,958
- HE DID IT!

251
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,958
TAKUMI WON!
HE ACTUALLY WON THE RACE!

252
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,583
- Both: OH, KILLER!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

253
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,875
- Yuuichi: BUNTA,
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?

254
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,000
I SAID, TAKUMI WON
THE DAMN RACE!

255
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,916
- DON'T GET
SO WORKED UP, YUUICHI.

256
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,375
OF COURSE HE WON THE RACE.

257
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,916
- AND THE COURSE RECORD
HE SET IS CRAZY!

258
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,125
- GREAT. GOOD.
NOW I'M GONNA HANG UP.

259
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,625
- I DON'T GET HIM.

260
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,416
- SO HE WON. THAT'S MY BOY.

261
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,708
- THAT'S ONE HECK OF A RACE
WE JUST WITNESSED.

262
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,458
- HONESTLY, I'M STILL IN SHOCK.
I GOTTA SHAKE IT OFF.

263
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,208
HEY, SHINGO.
YOU MIND MOVIN' AWAY?

264
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,083
PEOPLE SEE US SITTIN' TOGETHER
THEY MIGHT THINK

265
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,000
WE'RE FRIENDS AND I DON'T WANT
ANY PART OF THAT.

266
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,625
- THEN YOU GET AWAY!

267
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:12,083
- TAKUMI DID A HELLUVA THING.
BEATING RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

268
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,958
- THAT'S SOMETHING
TO BE PROUD OF.

269
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:19,166
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'LL SEE IF HE
FEELS LIKE GOING OUT SOMETIME.

270
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,833
WHY DON'T YOU ASK OUT
THAT OTHER GUY?

271
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,375
WHAT WAS HIS NAME ANYWAY?
I FORGET. IKA...

272
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,250
- IT'S IKETANI.

273
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,166
- BINGO! IKETANI,
THAT'S THE ONE!

274
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,000
SO HIT HIM UP. WE COULD
DO THE DOUBLE DATE THING.

275
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,291
- SO, UH...

276
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,041
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE
BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU

277
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,125
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

278
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,250
AND IT'S GONNA BUG ME
IF I DON'T.

279
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,916
I JUST DON'T GET WHY YOU WAITED
FOR ME TO TAKE CHARGE TONIGHT?

280
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,791
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

281
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,083
- OH, SO YOU THINK I SLOWED
DOWN DURING THAT LAST HALF

282
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,541
OF THE RACE ON PURPOSE, UH?

283
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,125
THAT'S NOT HOW IT HAPPENED
AT ALL, I HATE TO TELL YOU.

284
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,250
- THEN WHAT DID HAPPEN?

285
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,375
YOU MUST'VE PICKED UP
YOUR PACE A NOTCH.

286
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,083
I TRIED MY BEST
NOT TO SLOW DOWN,

287
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,291
BUT MY FRONT TIRES
KEPT ACTING UP.

288
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,416
DON'T KNOW WHY.

289
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,750
DIDN'T EXPECT IT.

290
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,000
- YOUR TIRES?

291
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,875
- DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT
USING THEM AS AN EXCUSE.

292
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,875
CONDITIONS WERE THE
SAME FOR BOTH OF US

293
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,250
AND I WAS CLEARLY THE LOSER.

294
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,333
- RYOSUKE.

295
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,125
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I DON'T THINK THAT I'M...

296
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,916
WELL THAT I'M LIKE A FASTER
DRIVER THAN YOU OR ANYTHING.

297
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,333
- YOU REALLY ARE
A WEIRD KID YA KNOW.

298
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,708
I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE
LIKE YOU BEFORE.

299
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,458
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
CONTENT WITH WINNING

300
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,166
ON SUCH A SMALL STAGE
LIKE THIS ONE.

301
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,416
THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER
WORLD OUT THERE.

302
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,416
YOU WERE A FAST DRIVER TONIGHT,
TAKUMI FUJIWARA.

303
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,333
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

304
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,416
- ( engine revving )

305
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,041
