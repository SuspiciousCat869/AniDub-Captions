00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,333
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!

34
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,083
SOMETHING'S IN THE ROAD.
YOU NEED TO CUT OVER.

35
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,250
THIS GUY'S NOT HALF BAD.

36
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,125
BETTER THAN
OTHER RACERS I'VE SEEN.

37
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,833
HE'S ACTUALLY KEEPING UP.

38
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,416
- MAYBE HE'LL GIVE US A RACE
THAT LASTS LONGER

39
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,916
THAN THE FIRST 5 CORNERS.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,875
- I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GONNA
BE ABLE TO KEEP THIS PACE.

41
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,291
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE'S NOT
USED TO THIS COURSE

42
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,875
OR THE WAY WE RUN.

43
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,625
IT'S LIKE I'M NOT EVEN
RACING THESE CHICKS.

44
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,458
FEELS LIKE I'M IN THE FRONT SEAT
OF A ROLLER COASTER.

45
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,166
I'M JUST ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

46
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,500
IT'S SCARING THE HELL OUT OF ME
HOW OUT OF SYNC I AM.

47
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,000
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

48
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,750
BUT THE SECOND I FALL BEHIND
THESE GIRLS, I'M DONE FOR.

49
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,416
I'VE GOTTA STAY CLOSE!

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,458
I'M SO USED TO AKINA.

51
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,375
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT
IT WAS TO KNOW THE COURSE.

52
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,250
IF I WAS TO LOSE FOCUS,
EVEN FOR A SECOND,

53
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,041
I'D SPIN OUT AND CRASH INTO THE
ROCKFACE OR SAIL OFF THE CLIFF.

54
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,000
- NOW I GET WHY SO
MANY PEOPLE ARE TALKIN'

55
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,333
ABOUT THIS EIGHT-SIX.

56
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,750
HE'S STUCK TO OUR BUMPER
LIKE A DAMN LICENSE PLATE.

57
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,375
GOOD FOR HIM.

58
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,791
NOT WHATTYA SAY YOU FOCUS ON THE
PART OF THE ROAD IN FRONT OF US.

59
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,041
NOT BEHIND.

60
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,583
- NARROW RIGHT TURN COMING UP.

61
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,666
- OKAY, I SEE IT.

62
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,291
- MAN, THIS GIRL'S
GOT SOME SPEED. DAMN.

63
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,500
I'VE GOTTA STAY ON HER,
NO MATTER WHAT.

64
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,500
IF SHE CAN DO THIS, SO CAN I.

65
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,291
- IT'S THAT OLD WHAT ONE MAN CAN
DO, SO CAN ANOTHER PHILOSOPHY.

66
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,166
TAKUMI SAID THAT IF SHE COULD
MAKE IT AROUND THE CORNERS,

67
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,250
SO CAN HE.

68
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,791
- YEP. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE SAID.

69
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,541
- HOW'S THAT A PHILOSOPHY?
GEEZ. IT'S A LITTLE CHILDISH.

70
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,458
BUT BRAVE FOR SOMETHING
THAT SOUNDS SO GRADE SCHOOL.

71
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,791
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MORE
IMPRESSIVE HE SAID IT

72
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,291
OR THAT HE BACKED IT UP.

73
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,333
SOMEBODY OF LESSER ABILITIES,
WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN TRIED.

74
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,958
- I GUESS HE CAN PROBABLY
CONTROL HIS RUN PRETTY WELL

75
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,916
AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T
PUSH PAST HIS OWN LIMITATIONS.

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,791
- OF COURSE HE CAN.

77
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,500
YEAH. BUT HAVE EITHER OF YOU
CONSIDERED THAT HE'S RACING

78
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,541
AGAINST NOT ONE BUT TWO CHICKS
WHO KNOW EVERY DETAIL

79
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,833
OF THIS COURSE.

80
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,416
THEY'RE GONNA ENTER
EACH CORNER LIKE A BULLET

81
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,541
AND HE'LL HAVETA DO THE EXACT
SAME IF HE WANTS TO KEEP UP.

82
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,583
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, HE KNOWS
NOTHING ABOUT THE COURSE.

83
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,625
HE'S DRIVING IT
COMPLETELY COLD.

84
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,791
IT KINDA FREAKS ME OUT.

85
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,041
I'M JUST GLAD IT'S TAKUMI
OUT THERE INSTEAD OF ME.

86
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,958
- YEAH. IT'LL TAKE
ALL HIS TECHNIQUE.

87
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,000
AND EVERY OUNCE OF HIS COURAGE.

88
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,041
JUST ONE MISTAKE,
EVEN A TINY ONE

89
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,291
AND TAKUMI COULD DIE OUT THERE.

90
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,041
- SO HE'S OUT RACING
A SIL-EIGHTY.

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,958
WHAT THE HELL IS A SIL-EIGHTY?

92
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,125
- ( engines revving )

93
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,708
- DAMN. HE'S STILL ON ME.

94
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,833
WHY? AM I NOT GOING
FAST ENOUGH FOR HIM?

95
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,166
- YOU'RE ROCKIN' IT.

96
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,000
JUST LEAVE HIM IN THE REARVIEW
WHERE HE BELONGS.

97
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,708
- I'M TRYING, BUT I CAN'T
SEEM TO SHAKE HIM OFF.

98
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,125
- YOU KEEP
WORRYING ABOUT HIM

99
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,583
AND YOU'RE GONNA SCREW
UP YOUR RHYTHM.

100
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,916
LEAVE ALL OF THE BUSINESS
WITH THIS EIGHT-SIX TO ME.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,750
I GOT THIS KID'S NUMBER.

102
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,916
THIS RACE IS JUST
GETTING GEARED UP.

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,375
AND SINCE WE'RE JUST
GETTING STARTED,

104
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,583
WHAT SAY WE TRY
TO ENJOY IT SOME?

105
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,458
- SOUNDS GOOD. JUST MAKE SURE
WE DON'T GET KILLED.

106
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,375
- I'M YOUR PARTNER. THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

107
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,583
TOGETHER WE'RE THE FASTEST TEAM
IN USUI. DON'T FORGET THAT.

108
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,041
Sayuki: HOW ABOUT WE RUN
A CAT AND MOUSE RACE

109
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,083
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN?

110
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,458
THEY'RE FUN.
IT'S BASICALLY A CHASE.

111
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,375
IF THE MOUSE GETS AWAY,
THE RACE IS OVER.

112
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,083
IF NOT, WE KEEP SWITCHING
POSITIONS UNTIL SOMEONE WINS.

113
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,791
THINK OF IT AS A
'SUDDEN DEATH, DEATHMATCH.'

114
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,458
- WITH THIS KIND OF SET UP
I'M THINKING IT WILL BE BEST

115
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,666
IF YOU GO IN FRONT FIRST.

116
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,041
- HE'S RIGHT.
'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY

117
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,541
THIS IS GONNA END WITH
JUST ONE RACE.

118
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,791
THAT WAY YOU AT LEAST
GET IN ONE PRACTICE RUN.

119
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,000
- THAT AND IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
TO LOSE IN THE SECOND RACE.

120
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,416
- Takumi: I THINK I WANNA
CHASE HER ON THE FIRST RUN.

121
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,416
YOU NEED TO THINK
THIS OVER, TAKUMI.

122
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,291
SORRY BUT THIS IS MY RACE
SO I'M GONNA RUN IT MY WAY.

123
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,416
I CAN'T BELIEVE I CHOSE
TO CHASE HER.

124
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,375
AND ONLY BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANT HER CHASING ME.

125
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,625
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

126
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,666
DAMMIT, THIS IS TOUGH.

127
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,500
- ON AN UNFAMILIAR COURSE,
IT'S CRUCIAL FOR A DRIVER

128
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,708
TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT SPEED

129
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,500
IN WHICH TO ENTER THE CORNERS.

130
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:48,125
KEISUKE'S LOSS TO THE 8-6,
AND NAKAZATO'S BOTH HAPPENED

131
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,791
FOR THE SAME REASON.

132
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,291
COURSE KNOWLEDGE GIVES THE RACER
A DEFINITE ADVANTAGE.

133
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,083
REGARDLESS OF HIS
TECHNIQUE OR SKILL LEVEL.

134
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,583
SO THE QUESTION IS,
HOW CAN I BEAT THE EIGHT-SIX?

135
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,625
UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, I SHOULD
BE ABLE TO EKE OUT A WIN.

136
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,333
EVEN AT AKINA PASS.

137
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,166
- COMING INTO THIS I WAS
WAY TOO OPTIMISTIC.

138
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,333
I TOOK A RISKY CHALLENGE
AND IT'S NOT PAYING OFF.

139
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,208
THE DIFFERENCE OF A FEW INCHES
AND A LITTLE SPEED AT THE START

140
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,416
OF A CORNER MAKES A HUGE IMPACT
ON THE EXIT.

141
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,291
I WISH I KNEW
THE ROAD BETTER.

142
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,541
DAMN! TOO WIDE!

143
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,416
CRAP. I NUDGED THE GUARDRAIL!

144
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,041
THIS SUCKS! I'VE GOTTA FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO STAY CLOSER!

145
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,875
- EVERY HEART-POUNDING MOMENT
BEHIND THE WHEEL

146
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,333
SCULPTS THE RACER INTO A LEANER,
FIERCER DRIVER.

147
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,708
WITH MY KID'S EXCEPTIONAL
CONCENTRATION

148
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,083
AND REFINED TECHNIQUE.

149
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,583
AND OF COURSE,
WITH MY EIGHT-SIX UNDER HIM,

150
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,875
THE CAR I'VE SPENT
YEARS CRAFTING

151
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,583
INTO THE ULTIMATE
RACING MACHINE,

152
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,250
HE WON'T LOSE.

153
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,666
- WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

154
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,666
I WONDER IF IT'S ALL
OVER BY NOW.

155
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,666
- NOTHING IS OVER UNTIL THEY
GET THEIR BUTTS BACK UP HERE.

156
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,333
- THIS IS A ONE-SIDED RACE
NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

157
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,000
THOSE CHICKS
GOT IT IN THE BAG.

158
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,625
- IKETANI, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
LET THAT ATTITUDE GO.

159
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,750
YOU KNOW TAKUMI'S NEVER BEEN
FAVORED IN A RACE BEFORE

160
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,708
AND HE'S COME OUT ON THE WINNING
END EVERY SINGLE TIME.

161
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,875
NAKAZATO'S THREE TWO WAS LIKE
AN ANVIL FALLING FROM THE SKY

162
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,125
BUT HE DODGED IT.

163
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,291
AND THE GUM TAPE DEATH
MATCH WAS HIS FIRST TIME

164
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,708
EVER TRYING SOMETHING LIKE THAT

165
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,458
AND HE BLEW THAT LOSER
OFF THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,

166
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,583
ALMOST LITERALLY.

167
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,916
- BUT THROUGH ALL OF THAT,

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
TAKUMI HAD ONE CONSTANT HE
COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON.

169
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,333
HE WAS ALWAYS ON AKINA PASS.

170
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,875
THE SAME ROUTE THAT HE'S
DRIVEN EVERY SINGLE MORNING,

171
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,083
YEAR AFTER YEAR.

172
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,166
SO YOU REALLY THINK
THE LOCATION OF THE RACE

173
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,916
MAKES THAT BIG OF A DIFFERENCE
ON THE OUTCOME?

174
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,916
IF THE GUY HAD DRIVEN THIS
PASS EVEN ONCE BEFORE

175
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,791
I WOULDN'T BE WORRIED,
BUT THIS IS HIS FIRST RUN.

176
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,666
HE'S NEVER EVEN
SEEN THIS PAVEMENT.

177
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,500
- Kenji: HEY, IKETANI.
I GOT A QUESTION.

178
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,708
WHAT IN THE HELL
WAS THAT BLONDE CHICK DOING?

179
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,208
THE ONE SITTING NEXT TO MAKO.

180
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,583
I THOUGHT CHICKS ONLY WENT
TO THE BATHROOM TOGETHER.

181
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,500
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT ISN'T LIKE I TRAINED THEM.

182
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,125
- I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT,
TOO. I MEAN, THIS IS A RACE.

183
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,666
IT'S SERIOUS. AND SHE
SLIPPED INTO THAT SEAT

184
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,958
LIKE IT WAS THE MOST
NORMAL THING IN THE WORLD.

185
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,875
- SHOOT, MAN.
I DON'T HAVE DETAILS.

186
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,000
ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE TWO OF
'EM ARE LIKE BEST FRIENDS,

187
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,416
HAVE BEEN FOREVER.

188
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,541
THEY'VE BROKEN
DOWN RACING STYLES

189
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,833
AND ANALYZED TECHNIQUE TOGETHER

190
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,375
SINCE THEY GOT INTO
RACING A FEW YEARS BACK.

191
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,375
DOING IT LIKE THAT IS THE ONLY
WAY THEY KNOW IT, I GUESS.

192
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,458
- SO SAYUKI'S LIKE THE
NAVIGATOR OR THE SPOTTER,

193
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,875
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

194
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,458
- OH, NO. THAT MAKES IT
A HECKUVA LOT WORSE FOR TAKUMI.

195
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,625
- NO, WAIT, I DON'T CARE.
HE'S NOT GONNA LOSE.

196
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,000
IT'S UNFATHOMABLE.

197
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,416
- I CAN TELL YOU'RE STRESSED
WHEN YOU USE BIG WORDS,

198
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,958
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

199
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,083
IF YOU GOT A GOOD NAV, YOU CAN
CONCENTRATE ON YOUR DRIVING.

200
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,375
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
WHAT MAKO'S DOING.

201
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,666
- 'KAY. WE GOT SOMETHING
COMING UP IN THE LANE AHEAD.

202
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,208
CUT TO THE OUTSIDE. NOW!

203
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,416
- GOT IT!

204
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,541
- INITIAL D!

205
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,625
INITIAL D!

206
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,875
- THIS KID IS AMAZING. HE'S
KEEPING UP WITH MAKO'S BEST.

207
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,875
AND IT STILL ISN'T
FAST ENOUGH FOR HIM.

208
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,333
I'M BLOWN AWAY.

209
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,791
HEY. C-121 IS COMING UP
PRETTY QUICK.

210
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,250
WE CAN SHAKE HIM OFF THERE.

211
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,375
REMEMBER, WE NEED TO HEAD
INTO THAT CORNER DRIFTING.

212
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,625
DIVE INTO USUI'S TOUGHEST
CORNER HEAD FIRST.

213
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,333
THAT'LL SHOW THIS
LITTLE BUMPKIN

214
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,125
EXACTLY WHO HE'S
DEALING WITH OUT HERE.

215
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,083
- HELL YEAH. THIS'LL BE
THE END OF IT.

216
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,583
IT'S TIME YOU AND ME GAVE HIM
A LESSON ON HOW DRIFTING

217
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,166
IS REALLY SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.

218
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,458
NO ONE BUT ME HAS EVER CLEARED
THAT CORNER AT FULL SPEED.

219
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,583
NO ONE.

220
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,833
- ARE MAKO AND SAYUKI
UP HERE TONIGHT?

221
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,416
CAN'T FIND 'EM ANYWHERE.

222
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,375
- SORRY, MAN. I DON'T KNOW. I
HADN'T SEEN 'EM UP HERE ANYWAY.

223
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,458
- I WANNA CHECK OUT
THAT SIL-EIGHTY'S DRIFT.

224
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,833
IT KILLS.

225
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,250
EVERYBODY KNOWS C-121 IS
THE BEST PLACE TO CATCH IT.

226
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,500
SO I THOUGHT I'D COME HANG OUT.

227
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,666
- IT'S A HELLUVA THING
TO PULL OFF, ISN'T IT?

228
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,250
- NOTHIN' HARDER.

229
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,125
IF YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH TO
DRIFT THROUGH THIS TURN,

230
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,666
YOU'RE GOLDEN.

231
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,666
YOU WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH
ANYTHING USUI THROWS AT YOU.

232
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,250
- COURSE BEING THE BEST IN USUI
BASICALLY RANKS YOU

233
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,250
AS THE BEST ANYWHERE.

234
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,125
- REALLY?

235
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,875
- YEAH, THAT'S THE TRUTH.

236
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:56,958
AND IF YOU DON'T
HAVE THE CAJONES

237
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,416
TO FLY INTO THAT CORNER
AT FULL TILT,

238
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,083
YOU DEFINITELY DON'T
HAVE THE SPEED

239
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,583
TO DRIFT THROUGH TO THE END.

240
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,541
IT'S THE ONE CORNER WHERE NEWBS
ALWAYS SCREW UP. SUCKERS.

241
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,833
- BUT SOME OF 'EM CAN ACTUALLY
PULL IT OFF, CAN'T THEY?

242
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,916
I MEAN, THEY DON'T ALL CRASH.

243
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,500
- YEAH, SURE, I GUESS NOT.

244
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,416
BUT MAKO'S SIL-EIGHTY KNOCKS IT
OUT AT FULL SPEED EVERY TIME.

245
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,250
I DUNNO WHAT KINDA SPEED
SHE'S CLOCKIN' BUT THERE'S

246
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,000
NO ONE I EVER HEARD OF WHO'S
MANAGED TO PULL IT OFF BUT HER.

247
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,166
THAT GIRL IS NOT OF THIS WORLD.

248
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,458
- ( cars approaching )

249
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,416
- SOMEBODY'S BLOWIN' DOWN
THE ROAD FAST.

250
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,458
- YEAH, YOU AIN'T JOKIN'.
THAT'S SOME SERIOUS SQUEALIN'.

251
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,833
RIGHT THERE.

252
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,083
THE SIL-EIGHTY!
IT'S MAKO AND SAYUKI!

253
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,333
THAT DUDE IN THE WHITE CAR.
WHO'S HE?

254
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,291
NOBODY TOLD ME THERE WAS
A RACE TONIGHT!

255
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,083
- ( all exclaim )

256
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,416
- Boy 1: AN EIGHT-SIX?

257
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,916
- NO CARS AHEAD. SHOW THIS
LOSER WHAT YOU CAN DO!

258
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,125
GO!

259
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,125
- All: THEY'RE GOING
INTO THE TURN!

260
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,500
THAT DUMBASS JUST FLEW
INTO THE CORNER

261
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,875
AT THE SAME SPEED AS MAKO!
WHAT THE HELL IS HE THINKIN'?

262
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,416
DOESN'T HE REALIZE THIS IS ONE
OF THE MEANEST CORNERS

263
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,666
ON THE PLANET?

264
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,125
- JUST BEING DUMB ENOUGH
TO FOLLOW HER ALL OUT

265
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,041
ISN'T ENOUGH
TO GET HIM THROUGH THIS ALIVE!

266
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,875
- Sayuki: DAMN, HE'S GOT GUTS.

267
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,708
FOLLOWING MAKO
INTO THE CORNER LIKE THAT?

268
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,500
I WONDER IF HE EVEN
REALIZES THAT AT THIS SPEED

269
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,750
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW.

270
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,333
THERE'S A HARSH EXIT
COMING UP AT C-121.

271
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,500
IT'S NARROWER THAN
MOST PEOPLE EXPECT.

272
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,083
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE COULD BE
A FEW GOOD LINES TO TAKE

273
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,875
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE
THAT'S PERFECT.

274
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,458
WELL, KID. IT'S YOUR
FIRST TIME ON USUI.

275
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,625
CAN YOU FIND IT?

276
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,375
THAT DID NOT JUST HAPPEN.

277
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,041
- THE NEW GUY
CLEARED THE TURN.

278
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,333
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

279
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,958
- WHO IS DRIVING
THAT EIGHT-SIX?

280
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,083
- YOU DON'T THINK IT'S ACTUALLY
THE FAMOUS EIGHT-SIX

281
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,750
FROM MOUNT AKINA WE KEEP
HEARING ABOUT, DO YOU?

282
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,458
- DUDE, I'VE TOTALLY
GOT THE CHILLS.

283
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,625
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

284
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:11,041
FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT AT FULL SPEED
IS RANKED AS ULTRA D DIFFICULTY.

285
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,541
EVEN MAKO MISSED THE PERFECT
LINE BY THREE INCHES

286
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,125
AND SHE KNOWS THIS COURSE
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

287
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,000
HOW WAS THIS GUY ABLE TO HIT
IT RIGHT ON THE MONEY?

288
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,375
I DON'T THINK WE
CAN WIN THIS ONE.

289
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,708
WE'RE UP AGAINST A MONSTER
THAT OUTCLASSES US IN EVERY WAY.

290
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,791
MAKO, YOU'VE GOTTA CHILL!

291
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,208
YOU CAN'T SWING THE CAR
THAT MUCH THROUGH HERE!

292
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:58,250
- YOU COULDN'T HAVE TOLD ME THAT
A LITTLE SOONER! THANKS A LOT!

293
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,208
FOCUS ON WHAT WE'RE DOING.
WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?

294
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,208
THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU AT ALL!

295
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,583
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN'T SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE MAKO.

296
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,250
WE HAVE TOTALLY UNDERESTIMATED
THIS EIGHT-SIX.

297
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,500
HE'S OUT OF OUR LEAGUE
BY A FREAKIN' LIGHT YEAR.

298
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,125
WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

299
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,791
- WHERE'S YOUR ATTITUDE?

300
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,666
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT
USUAL STUBBORN BITCHINESS?

301
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,833
THIS THING ISN'T OVER YET
AND YOU'RE GIVING UP!

302
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,416
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA!

303
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,083
- I JUST DON'T SEE THE POINT
IF WE CAN'T WIN.

304
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,250
- WHATEVER. I GUESS I DIDN'T
REALIZE I'D BEEN RIDING

305
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,041
WITH A QUITTER ALL THIS TIME.

306
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,625
I'LL HAVE TO DO THIS MYSELF.

307
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,250
WE ALREADY KNEW WHAT
A BADASS THIS GUY WAS

308
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,958
BEFORE WE WENT INTO THIS RACE.

309
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:45,041
BUT SINCE THIS IS GONNA BE
MY LAST ONE,

310
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,458
WE ARE NOT GONNA
WALK AWAY WONDERING

311
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,916
IF WE REALLY GAVE IT
EVERYTHING WE HAD!

312
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,208
WHAT IS IT? YOU SCARED?

313
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,250
YOU'RE FREAKIN' USELESS!
I SWEAR!

314
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,875
NOTHING BUT A SACK
OF DEAD WEIGHT RIDING SHOTGUN!

315
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,458
-HUH? DEAD WEIGHT?

316
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,416
- YOU HEARD ME! YOU'RE SCREWING
UP THE POWER TO WEIGHT RATIO!

317
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,416
- SHE CAN TURN INTO A REAL
HARDASS BEHIND THE WHEEL.

318
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,625
I AM NOT DEAD WEIGHT, YOU BITCH!
I'M HOT! I'M NOT FAT!

319
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,916
I GOT A KILLER BODY!

320
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,208
- FORTY-NINE KILOGRAMS
OF EXTRA WEIGHT.

321
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,416
- I WEIGH FORTY-SEVEN, DAMMIT!

322
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,083
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE HERE
WITH SELF-RESPECT.

323
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,125
READY FOR THIS MAKO? TIME TO
PUT OUR LIVES ON THE LINE.

324
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,083
- WELL, WELCOME BACK
TO THE PARTY.

325
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,916
- LISTEN, ON THIS NEXT ONE,

326
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,916
ENTER THE TURN SO THAT YOU
ALMOST SCRAPE THE INSIDE WALL.

327
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,916
- OKAY. I'M ALL OVER IT.

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,458
- ( Japanese song playing )

329
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,333
- SHE'S NOT HALF BAD.

330
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,333
I'VE GOTTEN BETTER
JUST BY CHASING HER,

331
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,416
EVEN IF I HAVE BEEN RECKLESS.

332
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,041
I THINK I'M FINALLY GETTING
A FEEL FOR THE RHYTHM.

333
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,125
I'M IN SYNCH.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

334
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,625
NOT MANY CORNERS LEFT
IN THIS RUN.

335
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:16,375
I JUST GOTTA ATTACK EACH ONE
AS HARD AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

336
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,250
I WANNA WALK AWAY FROM THIS
WITH NO REGRETS.

337
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,208
MY PRIDE AS USUI'S FASTEST
IS ON THE LINE.

338
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,291
- ( theme song playing )

339
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

340
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,541
- Announcer: BUNTA, DO YOU
HONESTLY THINK TAKUMI

341
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,916
HOLDS A CHANCE AGAINST
THE SIL-EIGHTY?

342
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,166
- Bunta: I DUNNO.

343
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,083
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU D...
- I SELL TOFU.

344
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,375
I DON'T PREDICT THE FUTURE.

345
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,041
- WHAT IF I BOUGHT
SOME GOONMO AND ATSO...

346
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,791
- I'VE REALLY WORKED UP
THAT EIGHT-SIX.

347
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,041
NO ONE CAN TOUCH IT
ON A DOWNHILL.

348
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,750
COURSE, IT'S ULTIMATELY
IN THE HANDS OF THE DRIVER.

349
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,291
GUESS WE'LL JUST SEE NEXT TIME.

350
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,125
- WHAT IF I BOUGHT SOME
MOMEN AND SOME KINUGOSHI, TOO?

351
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:57,083
- NEXT ON INITIAL D,
"SUPER DRIFT."

352
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,875
IT'S A MUST-SEE EPISODE.

353
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,166
- DON'T MISS IT!
