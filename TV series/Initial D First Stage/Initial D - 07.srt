- DUDE, IT WAS A BEATING.

16
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,125
- WHO KNOWS, BUT I'M STARVING.
LET'S GO GRAB SOME SLICES.

17
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,958
- NO WAY? WITH NATSUKI MOGI?

18
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,875
- AH MAN, THAT IS ONE FINE
PIECE OF TAIL.

19
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,458
EVERYBODY I KNOW
WANTS TO HIT THAT.

20
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,208
- LIKE I WAS SAYING, SHE DOES
WHATEVER I TELL HER TO.

21
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,208
AND LIKE A GOOD DOG, I THINK
IT'S TIME TO BREAK HER IN.

22
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,708
- WAIT. WHAT DO MEAN
'BREAK HER IN'?

23
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,375
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE MEANS, HUH?

24
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,791
( laughs )

25
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,875
- CHICKS ARE THE SAME ALL
OVER, MY BROTHERS...

26
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,208
THEY ALL ACT LIKE THEY
DON'T WANT IT,

27
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,791
BUT BELIEVE ME, THEY DO...

28
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,041
THE OTHER DAY I CALLED HER UP TO
THE ROOF AND I GOT HER TO, UH...

29
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,416
- ( loud bang )

30
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,666
- IF YOU DON'T SHUT YOUR MOUTHS
RIGHT NOW... I'LL DO IT FOR YOU.

31
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,750
- AND JUST, WHO
THE HELL, ARE YOU?

32
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,958
- THIS BEAN POLE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO HE'S MOUTHING OFF TO.

33
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,208
- DUDE, TAKUMI, SHUT UP.

34
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,750
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF LISTENING
TO YOU ASSHOLES.

35
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,916
- YOU'LL REGRET THAT!

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,958
- ( grunting )

37
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,625
- BACK OFF, TAKUMI!
- I'LL KILL YOU!

38
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,458
- ( panting )

39
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,333
- ( gasps )

40
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,500
YOU'RE ACTING KINDA RUDE. I HOPE
YOU REALIZE THAT.

41
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,291
WHEN A GUY IS WITH A CUTE GIRL
IN A BATHING SUIT,

42
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,291
DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD BE
STANDING THERE STARING OFF

43
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,000
AT NOTHING OR STARING AT HER?

44
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,916
I WAS JUST TRYING TO ASK...

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,041
IF THERE'S ANY GIRL THAT YOU
LIKE RIGHT NOW.

46
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,666
I MEAN, THERE IS THIS
ONE GUY I THINK OF, SOMETIMES.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,333
- Yuichi: IKETANI? HEY, WHERE'D
IKETANI RUN OFF TO?

48
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,708
- I REALLY COULDN'T
TELL YOU, BOSS.

49
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,708
- OH, YOU MEAN THE MAN WHOSE
TERRIFIED SCREAMS ECHOED DOWN

50
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,833
FROM MOUNT AKINA AS
HE PASSED OUT...

51
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,375
THAT IKETANI JUST LEFT ON
A DELIVERY.

52
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,333
HE TOOK THE PICKUP TRUCK.

53
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,375
- OKAY... WELL,
IF IKETANI'S OUT,

54
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,166
THEN MAYBE YOU CAN
HELP ME, TAKUMI...

55
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,791
JUST DELIVER THESE PAPERS
TO THE YAMADA SHOP.

56
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,541
YOU CAN TAKE MY CAR.

57
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,125
- UH... SURE.

58
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,958
- HEY, BOSS.

59
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,666
QUESTION. YOU DO
REALIZE THAT I HAVE

60
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,166
A DRIVER'S LICENSE TOO, RIGHT?

61
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,333
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS ASK
THE OTHER GUYS TO DO DELIVERIES

62
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,708
AND LEAVE AN AWESOME FELLA
LIKE ME OUTTA THE LOOP?

63
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,750
- SINCE YOU ASKED,
I'LL TELL YOU.

64
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,708
PUT YOUR HAND ON YOUR CHEST
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU FEEL.

65
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,916
- DO YOU GET IT NOW?
- NO...

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,750
- TO PUT IT SIMPLY I CAN
TRUST THOSE TWO

67
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,541
TO BRING MY CAR
BACK IN ONE PIECE,

68
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:43,625
BUT WITH YOU, THERE'D BE A DENT
THE SIZE OF YOUR CAVED-IN CHEST.

69
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,208
- ( screams )

70
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,541
WELL, THAT'S THE LONG
AND SHORT OF IT.

71
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,708
- JUST WAIT. ONCE I GET MY OWN
EIGHT-SIX, I'M GONNA BE THE

72
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,458
FASTEST RACER AKINA
HAS EVER SEEN!

73
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,833
SWEET! A THREE-TWO!
CAN I HELP YOU, SIR?

74
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,916
WHAT A RIDE! THIS BAD
BOY IS THE BOMB!

75
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,958
- ( gasps ) NIGHT KIDS!

76
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,833
- 'SUP, KID. NAME'S TOCKASHI.
FRIEND OF MINE BACK HOME TOLD ME

77
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,625
I SHOULD SWING BY THIS PLACE...
I'M LOOKING FOR A MEMBER OF THE

78
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,666
AKINA SPEED STARS. MY BUDDY

79
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,666
WORKS AT THIS GAS STATION.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,166
SO TELL ME SOMETHIN',
YOU GOT ANY IDEA

81
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,916
WHERE I CAN FIND THAT
EIGHT-SIX THAT RIDES AKINA?

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
YOU HEARIN' ME, KID? HEY,
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

83
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,291
AREN'T YOU ONE OF
THE SPEED STARS?

84
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:42,625
- ME? ONE OF THE SPEED STARS?
HOW COOL...

85
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,750
- HIT THE BRAKES FOR THE
WRONG GAS STATION, I GUESS.

86
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:50,916
- WAIT! NO, YOU'RE AT THE
RIGHT PLACE, I PROMISE.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,375
ACTUALLY, THE EIGHT-SIX DUDE,
WE'RE KINDA TIGHT.

88
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,916
PEOPLE MISTAKE US FOR BROTHERS.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,333
- THEY DO?

90
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,000
- SURE. KNOWN AS
THE EIGHT-SIX DUO,

91
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,458
FASTEST DOWNHILLERS ON OUR TEAM.

92
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,666
HATE TO TOOT MY OWN CAR
HORN, BUT THAT IS THE WAY IT IS.

93
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,208
- WAIT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

94
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,291
- AS A HEART ATTACK. I MEAN,
YEAH, HE MIGHT BE JUST A LITTLE

95
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,208
BIT FASTER THAN ME, BUT AT THOSE
SPEEDS, WHO'S COUNTING?

96
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,291
- I DIDN'T REALIZE THE SPEED
STARS HAD ANYONE ELSE

97
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,083
WHO COULD RACE ON THAT LEVEL.

98
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,833
- WELL, NOW YOU KNOW WE DO.

99
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,791
IF YOU WANTED ME TO, I COULD
DROP OFF A MESSAGE TO HIM.

100
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,000
IT'S NO SKIN OFF
MY BACK, HEH, LIKE I WAS

101
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,083
SAYING, HE AND I PRETTY
MUCH INSEPARABLE.

102
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,833
- ( engine starting )

103
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,625
- ALL RIGHT, THEN, YOU COULD
TELL HIM SOMETHING FOR ME.

104
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,291
10 O'CLOCK THIS SATURDAY NIGHT.

105
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,916
- 10 ON SATURDAY...
I'LL PASS IT ALONG.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,708
- WE'LL MEET UP ON TOP OF AKINA.

107
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,791
AND TELL HIM TO LOOK FOR
TAKESHI NAKAZATO.

108
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,083
- WHY ARE YOU GONNA MEET HIM AT
NIGHT UP ON THE MOUNTAIN?

109
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,791
- IT'LL BE A RACE TO THE BOTTOM.

110
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,500
- UH! NO WAIT! THAT'S, HOLD ON,
DON'T LEAVE! THERE'S SOMETHING

111
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,791
ELSE I GOTTA TELL YOU,
UH, DON'T, CRAP.

112
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:52,375
NOW I'VE REALLY DONE IT. THAT
GUY JUST CHALLENGED TAKUMI,

113
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,416
AND I STOOD HERE LIKE
AN IDIOT AND LET HIM!

114
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,208
I'M TOO DUMB TO LIVE!
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL TAKUMI!

115
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,250
- ( horn honks )

116
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,500
TAKUMI!

117
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,708
- WHAT ARE YOU ACTING ALL
FREAKED OUT ABOUT NOW?

118
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,750
- NOTHIN' OUT OF THE ORDINARY...

119
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,708
SO, MY MAN IF YOU'RE
FREE THIS SATURDAY

120
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,041
WANNA GO RACING ON AKINA?

121
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,416
YOU AND I COULD
HAVE SOME SERIOUS FUN.

122
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,333
- NOPE.
- WHY NOT?

123
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,000
- I'M SORRY, MAN, BUT THESE DAYS
I JUST DON'T LIKE GETTING BEHIND

124
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,791
THE WHEEL OF A CAR UNLESS IT'S
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

125
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,416
- HEY, TAKUMI! COME ON INSIDE.

126
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,541
I GOT SOME FRESH
COFFEE BREWED UP.

127
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,625
- SURE.

128
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:34,708
- HEY! NOT GOOD...
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

129
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,125
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.

130
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,125
- TAKUMI, WAIT UP.

131
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,750
- SOMETHING I WANTED TO RUN BY
YOU, NOW SUPPOSE, JUST

132
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,708
SUPPOSE THAT A RACER YOU DIDN'T
KNOW WAS TO HUNT YOU DOWN AND

133
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,625
CHALLENGE YOU TO A RACE. YOU
WOULD ACCEPT IT, WOULDN'T YOU?

134
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,541
- NO WAY. THE RACING SCENE
REALLY ISN'T FOR ME.

135
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,125
- WHAT? DON'T SAY THAT!
- WHY DOES IT MATTER TO YOU?

136
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,875
- UM, WELL, THAT'S ENTIRELY
BESIDE THE POINT, SORTA...

137
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,583
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RACER'S
LAW. IF A RACER RECEIVES A

138
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:08,125
CHALLENGE THEN HE HAS TO FACE
THE MUSIC AND ACCEPT IT, DUDE!

139
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,000
- THAT SOUNDS RIGHT, IF YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT A STREET RACER...

140
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,375
BUT I'M NOT, AND
YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING

141
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,958
A HARD TIME
REMEMBERING THAT.

142
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,666
- YOU'RE CRAZY!

143
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,666
- BESIDES, YOU KNOW ME. BEING
FORCED INTO ACCEPTING CHALLENGES

144
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,791
ISN'T EXACTLY UP MY ALLEY.

145
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,791
- MAN, THIS IS NOT GOOD.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

146
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,583
OH, CRAP.

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,958
- ( engine revving )

148
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,666
- 2 DAYS LEFT. RYOSUKE AND
THAT PUNK EIGHT-SIX

149
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,416
WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM.

150
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,958
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
WHO'S NUMBER ONE!

151
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,166
- IKETANI!

152
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,458
WANNA TELL ME WHEN THE HELL
YOU ACCEPTED A CHALLENGE

153
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,125
FROM THE MYOGI NIGHT KIDS?

154
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,291
THAT'S HUGE, MAN! WHY WERE
YOU KEEPIN' THAT FROM US?

155
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:16,333
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKIN'
ABOUT? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

156
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,375
- DON'T TRY TO DENY IT. THE
WHOLE TOWN KNOWS ABOUT IT.

157
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,791
THE EIGHT-SIX VERSUS THE
THREE-TWO ON THE DOWNHILL,

158
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,375
SATURDAY NIGHT!

159
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,958
- EIGHT-SIX? THIS IS THE FIRST
I'VE HEARD OF IT, I SWEAR, DUDE!

160
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,000
- THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. WORD ON
THE STREET IS TAKESHI CAME TO

161
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,000
THE GAS STATION HIMSELF
TO ISSUE THE CHALLENGE.

162
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:32,708
WHO'D HE TALK TO?

163
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,333
THE PHANTOM SPEED STAR?

164
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,416
- WELL, TAKUMI. HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

165
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,208
- NO, THIS IS ALL NEWS TO ME.

166
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,625
- HOW AM I THE ONLY ONE?

167
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,875
WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN'
ON AROUND HERE?

168
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,250
- I'M SORRY!

169
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,666
- ITSUKI, YOU DIDN'T, DID YOU?

170
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,375
- I DID IT. I ACCEPTED THE
CHALLENGE FOR YOU.

171
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:01,000
PLEASE FORGIVE ME! YESTERDAY,
TAKESHI NAKAZATO CAME BY HERE

172
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,083
AND I GOT ALL NERVOUS. I WAS
ALONE, I COULDN'T EVEN CONTROL

173
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:08,666
MY MOUTH. STUPID ME PRETENDED TO
BE A SPEED STAR. I JUST WANTED

174
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,666
TO BE COOL FOR ONE SECOND. THEN
BEFORE I KNEW WHAT WAS GOIN'

175
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,458
ON, HE HAD ALREADY ISSUED THE
CHALLENGE AND DRIVEN OFF.

176
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,291
- WHY DIDN'T OPEN YOUR
BIG FAT MOUTH

177
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,500
ABOUT THIS BEFORE YOU DUMBASS?

178
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,083
- I WAS GONNA TELL
YOU ABOUT IT.

179
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,708
I WAS, I WAS JUST WAITIN' FOR

180
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,375
THE RIGHT MOMENT, TAKUMI, I'M
SORRY, I SCREWED THE POOCH, I

181
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,416
KNOW, I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO HATE ME FOR THIS.

182
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,625
- I DON'T HATE YOU,
BUT GEEZ, DUDE...

183
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,625
- FORGIVE ME.
I SCREWED UP, BAD,

184
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,916
BUT I PROMISE IT
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

185
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,875
- LOOKS LIKE THAT
THREE-TWO'S OUT AGAIN.

186
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,458
I HEARD SOMEBODY SAYIN'
THAT HE'S GONNA BE RACIN'

187
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,625
AGAINST THE EIGHT-SIX
TOMORROW NIGHT...

188
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,625
I AM GONNA BE ALL
OVER THAT RACE!

189
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,291
- IF THAT NAKAZATO GUY FROM THE
NIGHT KIDS IS CHALLENGING THE

190
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,083
EIGHT-SIX THAT BEAT KEISUKE,
YOU CAN BE DAMN SURE

191
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,958
I'LL BE THERE FOR
THAT THROW DOWN.

192
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,625
- IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE A RACE
BETWEEN THE SPEED STARS AND THE

193
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,041
NIGHT KIDS ON THE SURFACE BUT
IF YOU DIG A LITTLE DEEPER

194
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,416
YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT'S REALLY A
BATTLE BETWEEN THE TAKESHI

195
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,625
BROTHERS' PRIDE AND
NAKAZATO'S ARROGANCE.

196
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,583
- NO MATTER HOW THE RACE
UNFOLDS, I PROMISE YOU

197
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,958
RYOSUKE IS NOT GONNA SIT
BACK AND WATCH IT HAPPEN.

198
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,416
- YEAH, THESE SUMMER NIGHTS ARE
ALREADY HEATIN' UP! HELL YES!

199
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,750
- OH, MAN...

200
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,208
- NOW WHAT?

201
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,875
- EVERYONE AND THEIR
FREAKIN' DOG'S

202
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,083
TALKIN' ABOUT THIS RACE NOW.

203
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,166
IT'S TOO LATE TO BACK OUT.
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST ASK TAKUMI

204
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,583
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

205
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,250
- I'D LIKE TO THINK HE'D
HAVE THE STONES

206
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,791
TO PUT THIS THREE-TWO IN

207
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,208
ITS PLACE, BUT I'M NOT SURE.
TAKESHI NAKAZATO OF THE NIGHT

208
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,416
KIDS IS AS FAMOUS A STREET
RACER AS EITHER ONE

209
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,125
OF THE TAKAHASHI BROTHERS.

210
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,041
- I'M NOT SAYIN' IT'D BE EASY.

211
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,500
HELL, IT COULD BE OVER FROM
THE WORD 'GO'.

212
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,958
ON SECOND THOUGHT...
MAYBE I WON'T ASK HIM AT ALL.

213
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,750
- Narrator: Initial D!

214
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,875
- Narrator: Initial D!

215
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,208
- ( car starting )

216
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,666
- HERE YOU GO.

217
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,458
- DAD, HOLD UP.

218
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,458
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE 3-2?

219
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,041
- SHE CAN DO SOME DAMAGE.

220
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,666
FOR A CAR THAT SIZE,
IT'S PRETTY FAST.

221
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,583
- YEAH, BUT COULD YOU
WIN AGAINST ONE?

222
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,166
I MEAN IN A DOWNHILL?

223
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,041
- OF COURSE. I CAN'T THINK OF
ANY CAR THAT I COULDN'T BEAT,

224
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,666
3-2 OR NOT.

225
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,958
- HOW ABOUT ME?
DO YOU THINK I COULD I WIN?

226
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,041
- THAT I DON'T KNOW.
IT'D BE A CLOSE RACE,

227
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,541
I CAN TELL YOU THAT MUCH...

228
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,166
WHY YOU ASKING
ALL THIS ANYWAY?

229
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,333
WHY THE INTEREST?
RACIN' A THREE-TWO?

230
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:59,250
- NO, I'M, I'M JUST CURIOUS,
I GUESS, I'LL SEE YA.

231
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,208
- NOW HE'S UP AGAINST
A THREE-TWO.

232
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,541
I BETTER GET IN THERE AND ADJUST

233
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,250
THE SETTINGS ON THAT EIGHT-SIX.

234
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,291
- Bunta: IT'D BE A CLOSE RACE...
I CAN TELL YOU THAT MUCH...

235
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,208
- THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU WAS
ABOUT THIS TIME OF NIGHT, SO I

236
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,333
FIGURED IF I CAME UP HERE
AROUND THE SAME TIME,

237
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,041
I MIGHT RUN INTO YOU...

238
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,958
AND HERE YOU ARE.

239
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,583
SO YOU'RE GOIN' TOE-TO-TOE
AGAINST THAT NAKAZATO LOSER...

240
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,375
THAT'S ALL ANYONE IN THIS
TOWN'S BEEN TALKIN'

241
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,416
ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

242
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,875
- PEOPLE TALK, SO WHAT?
BESIDES, I NEVER EVEN ACCEPTED

243
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,500
THAT CHALLENGE IN
THE FIRST PLACE.

244
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,083
- WHAT?

245
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,291
- HE CAME TO CHALLENGE ME BUT I
NEVER SAW HIM FACE TO FACE...

246
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,291
AND IT'S NOT LIKE I PLAN
ON RACING THE GUY.

247
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,333
- THE HELL DO YOU MEAN YOU
DON'T PLAN ON IT, MAN?

248
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,666
HE ISSUED A PERSONAL CHALLENGE!

249
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,375
WHETHER YOU HEARD IT
FROM HIS LIPS OR NOT,

250
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,500
IT WAS THROWN OUT!

251
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,625
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ACCEPT IT!

252
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,291
SHOW HIM YOU'RE
FASTER THAN HE IS!

253
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,791
I KNOW YOU CAN BEAT THIS IDIOT!

254
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,833
- I JUST DON'T SEE WHY
IT MATTERS TO YOU.

255
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:46,750
LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT

256
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,458
IT'S BETWEEN HIM AND ME.

257
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,416
- IT'S NOT JUST BETWEEN
YOU TWO.

258
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,958
MY INTEREST IN THIS IS
CUZ YOU BEAT ME.

259
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,333
IF YOU LOSE TO ANYONE, I WANNA
MAKE DAMN SURE THAT YOU LOSE TO

260
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,875
ONE OF THE TAKAHASHI BROTHERS.
UNTIL ONE OF US BEATS YOU, YOU

261
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,208
CAN'T LOSE TO ANYONE ELSE. NOT
EVEN TO THAT THREE-TWO!

262
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,625
- YOU MUST NOT HAVE HEARD ME,
SO I'LL SAY IT AGAIN,

263
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,958
I DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO
RACE THIS GUY.

264
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,875
- WHAT? A REASON?
SINCE WHEN DOES A RACER

265
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,333
NEED A REASON TO GET OUT
THERE AND BATTLE?

266
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,416
- YEAH OKAY. AND WHERE DID YOU
GET THE IDEA I WAS A RACER?

267
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,708
- I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR JOKES.

268
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,208
DON'T BE SARCASTIC WITH ME,
YOU LITTLE PUNK.

269
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,791
FOR YOUR TECHNIQUE
TO BE AS SOLID AS IT IS, YOU'VE

270
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,625
GOTTA HAVE PRACTICED FOR YEARS.
WHY WOULD SOMEONE DRIVE LIKE

271
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,250
THAT IF HE'S NOT AN
HONEST-TO-GOD STREET RACER?

272
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,166
- LOOK, I DON'T DRIVE LIKE THAT
BECAUSE I LIKE TO DO IT, I

273
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,083
DRIVE LIKE THAT BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE DO

274
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,666
TO HELP OUT AT HOME.

275
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,000
- STOP DENYING IT, PAL. NO ONE
GETS AS GOOD AS YOU IF THEY HATE

276
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,083
DRIVING. YOU LOVE IT
AS MUCH AS I DO.

277
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,375
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG...
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

278
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,583
- I UNDERSTAND FINE, IT'S YOU
THAT DOESN'T GET IT. YOU THINK

279
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,041
SOMEONE WHO HATES RACING
COULD EVER MASTER DRIFTING?

280
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,541
ONLY SOMEONE WHO LOVES THIS
CRAP COULD PULL THAT OFF!

281
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,500
SOMEONE WHO BREATHES EXHAUST
FOR BREAKFAST!

282
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,833
YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IT. MAYBE YOU
CAN'T FACE IT. BUT YOU'RE A

283
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,041
RACER. LOOK DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU LOVES

284
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,083
DRIVING. IT'S OBVIOUS, I DON'T
KNOW HOW YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

285
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,500
BUT SINCE YOU LOVE IT, THEN
YOU ARE A RACER.

286
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,291
AT LEAST ENOUGH OF
ONE TO DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

287
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:13,000
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD BE
PROUD OF. YOU GOT THE SKILLS.

288
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,666
ACCEPTING CHALLENGES IS THE
PRIDE OF EVERY STREET RACER.

289
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,125
IT'S IN HIS HEART.

290
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,958
WHAT YOU'RE DOIN' JUST
STRAIGHT UP MAKES ME SICK.

291
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,625
- I WONDER IF HE'S RIGHT. MAYBE
I REALLY DO LIKE DRIVING.

292
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,583
STILL, BEING FORCED TO ACCEPT
EVERY CHALLENGE THAT COMES

293
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:55,791
ALONG, I DUNNO,
THAT JUST ISN'T FOR ME!

294
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:02,250
- YO! ITSUKI! WHERE'S TAKUMI?
- HE'S ON THE LATE SHIFT TODAY.

295
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,291
- GOTCHA.

296
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,250
- HEY, IKETANI...

297
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,833
I'M, I'M GONNA GO UP TO
MOUNT AKINA TONIGHT

298
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:13,250
SO I CAN APOLOGIZE TO
TAKESHI PERSONALLY.

299
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,916
- YOU SURE?

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,625
- YES. IF I GOTTA I'LL GET DOWN
ON MY KNEES. ONCE I TELL HIM THE

301
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,458
TRUTH, HE'LL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.
I MEAN, THE SPEED STARS HAVE

302
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,625
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
IT'S ALL ON ME.

303
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,125
- YOU REALLY DON'T THINK WE CAN
CONVINCE TAKUMI TO RACE HIM?

304
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:31,625
- NO. I KNOW THE GUY BETTER THAN
ANYONE. HE'LL NEVER DO IT.

305
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:35,083
IT'S JUST THE WAY HE IS. HE
HATES BEING PUSHED INTO THINGS

306
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,666
OR HAVING TO FOLLOW OTHER
PEOPLES' ORDERS.

307
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,208
- ( chuckles )

308
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,083
HE'S A CHILL GUY MOST OF THE
TIME, BUT ONCE HE SETS HIS MIND

309
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,625
ON SOMETHING, THERE'S
NO TURNING BACK.

310
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,958
- STUBBORN...
JUST LIKE HIS FATHER.

311
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,000
- HE DOESN'T SEEM TO GET WHY
RACERS HAVE TO ACCEPT

312
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,000
CHALLENGES. I REALLY COULDN'T
TELL YOU WHY. BUT THE ENTIRE

313
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,250
CONCEPT REALLY SEEMS TO GET
UNDER HIS SKIN. WHEN SOMEBODY

314
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,750
TRIES TO FORCE HIM TO DO WHAT
HE DOESN'T WANT TO, HE SNAPS...

315
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,958
ONCE IN ELEVENTH GRADE, HE BEAT
THE HELL OUT OF SOME SENIORS

316
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,333
AFTER SOCCER PRACTICE.

317
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,250
WHAT? THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE TAKUMI!

318
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,458
- HEY BOSS, I FINISHED
CLEANING UP OUTSIDE,

319
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,500
AND I LOCKED ALL
THE PUMPS FOR YOU.

320
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,041
- HEY! THANKS, KID.

321
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,750
- YEAH, SURE. WELL I'M OUTTA
HERE SO I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

322
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,208
- TAKUMI.

323
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,583
HAVE A SEAT AND TALK
WITH ME FOR A SECOND.

324
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,708
- OKAY...

325
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,166
- YOU KNOW, I OVERHEARD SOME OF
THE GUYS TALKING EARLIER, THEY

326
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,916
SAID YOU'RE GONNA BE GOING UP
AGAINST A THREE-TWO TONIGHT.

327
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,208
- WHAT? THEY WERE WRONG.

328
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,333
- DON'T DO IT, KID. THAT GUY
HAS BAD MOJO.

329
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,000
- WELL. I GUESS IT'S A
GOOD THING I WASN'T...

330
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,208
- NO, NO, I ALREADY KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY, SO DON'T EVEN

331
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,208
BOTHER, I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED,

332
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,333
YOU GOT PRESSURED INTO
ACCEPTING THIS BATTLE

333
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,958
EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T
REALLY WANT TO...

334
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,333
- ITSUKI RAN HIS MOUTH AND TOLD
THE GUY YOU'D RACE.

335
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,875
- YEAH...

336
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,208
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TOO NICE OF A
PERSON SOMETIMES, TAKUMI...

337
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,041
- IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU STARTED
LETTING YOUR FRIENDS

338
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,750
CLEAN UP THEIR OWN MESSES.

339
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,833
TRUST ME. DON'T RACE
THAT THREE-TWO.

340
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,500
THERE'S A LOT YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT CARS. I'M GUESSING YOU

341
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,125
DON'T EVEN HAVE A CLUE THE KINDS
OF THINGS THAT ONE'S CAPABLE OF.

342
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,625
- IS THE THREE-TWO
REALLY THAT GOOD?

343
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,083
- THAT'S IT. HE TOOK THE BAIT.

344
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,625
'GOOD' DOESN'T EVEN COME
CLOSE. IT'S IN A CLASS BY

345
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,125
ITSELF. IT'S TOP-OF-THE-LINE
DRIVING SYSTEM MERGES EVERY

346
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,625
PERFECT THING ABOUT THE FR
AND THE FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE

347
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,000
MAKES IT AN UNSTOPPABLE BEAST.

348
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,791
AN EIGHT-SIX OR A GT-R IS JUST
NO MATCH. IF THE DRIVER WAS AN

349
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,125
AMATEUR, THEN MAYBE,
BUT THIS GUY'S BIG TIME.

350
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,125
HE'LL BURY YOU OUT THERE.

351
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,625
- DAD NEVER TOLD ME ANY OF THIS.

352
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,916
ALL HE SAID IS THAT IT'D
BE A CLOSE RACE.

353
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,458
- TAKUMI?

354
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,791
YOU STILL HERE? YOU JUST BEAT
THAT TEAM FROM AKAGI, YOUR

355
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,875
REPUTATION AS A RACER IS AT A
HIGH POINT RIGHT NOW...

356
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,625
DON'T BLOW IT SO SOON.

357
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,666
IT'S NOT WISE TO GO UP AGAINST
SOMEONE YOU HAVE NO CHANCE OF

358
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,708
DEFEATING. THAT MAKE SENSE?
YOUR OPPONENT'S DRIVING A

359
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,166
THREE-TWO. NOT A MAN I KNOW

360
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,166
WOULD CALL YOU A COWARD
FOR BACKING OUT.

361
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,125
- A COWARD?

362
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:25,666
BOSS, I APPRECIATE THE
WARNING. I REALLY DO.

363
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,625
AND YOU KNOW YOUR OPINION
MEANS A LOT TO ME.

364
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,916
BUT TO BE HONEST...

365
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,291
I COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT ANY FAME THAT I GET

366
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,458
OR DON'T GET AS A RACER.

367
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,458
- SO YOU AREN'T GONNA BACK DOWN?

368
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:44,583
- NO, HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT HOW
AMAZING THAT CAR IS ONLY MADE ME

369
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,083
WANNA SEE THE THING IN ACTION.

370
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,458
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT IT CAN DO.

371
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,041
MAYBE STREET RACERS ARE AFRAID
OF GOING UP AGAINST A 3-2,

372
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,500
BUT NOT ME.

373
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,041
- THOUGHT THAT BIT MIGHT WORK.

374
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,750
HE REALLY IS EXACTLY
LIKE HIS FATHER.

375
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,333
- TEMPORARILY CLOSED?

376
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,416
DAD NEVER MENTIONED THIS TO
ME, HOW'S HE SUPPOSED TO MAKE

377
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,541
ANY MONEY WITH THE SHOP SHUT
DOWN? OH, NO! THE CAR!

378
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,041
IF HE WENT OUT DRINKIN'
WITH HIS BUDDIES

379
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,458
THEN I'M TOTALLY SCREWED.

380
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,250
HE WON'T BE BACK
UNTIL AT LEAST MORNING,

381
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,750
WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?

382
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,375
MAN, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING IF
I DON'T HAVE A CAR!

383
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,250
DAMMIT, I SHOULD HAVE
ASKED TO BORROW

384
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,291
THE STUPID THING BEFORE I LEFT.

385
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,750
- Boy: DUDE, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THE CROWD,

386
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,333
THEY'RE PACKED IN LIKE CATTLE.

387
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,375
WAY MORE PEOPLE THAN
THE AKAGI RACE, MAN.

388
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,750
- THIS IS, LIKE, WHACKED OUT.
WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY PEOPLE

389
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,250
CAME OUT HERE TONIGHT?

390
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,916
- YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT HERE TO
SEE SOME LOUSY THREE-TWO.

391
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,458
- HELL, YES. THEY'RE HERE
FOR THE EIGHT-SIX DRIFT.

392
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,500
- I HEARD THIS DUDE SAY HE SAW
IT BARREL THROUGH A CORNER

393
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:04,958
LIKE IT WAS A STRAIGHTAWAY.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS!

394
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:10,250
- Takumi: OH, I SEE, OKAY, WELL
THANKS FOR CHECKING FOR ME.

395
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:14,416
IF HE HAPPENS TO SHOW UP COULD
YOU ASK HIM TO CALL HOME?

396
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,250
GREAT. THANK YOU.

397
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:22,958
CRAP. IT'S NO USE, I'M NEVER
GONNA FIND THAT JERK.

398
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,791
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
GIVE ME BACK MY EIGHT-SIX?

399

EIGHT-SIX, BUT I'M HONESTLY NOT

415
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,625
SURE IF EVEN TAKUMI
CAN BEAT A GT-R.

416
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,208
IT IS THE FASTEST DOMESTIC.
