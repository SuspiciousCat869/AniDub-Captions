1
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,041
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,291
- ( singing on Japanese )

3
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,125
♪ BREAK INTO THE NIGHT,
IT'S THE TIME ♪

4
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,666
- ( yawning )

5
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,541
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO GUYS.

6
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,541
BUT WE GOTTA PULL TAKUMI'S HEAD
OUT OF THIS DAYDREAMING FUNK

7
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,125
HE'S BEEN STUCK IN.

8
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,125
- THE RACE IS ON THE FIFTEENTH.

9
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,458
SO THAT ONLY LEAVES US
A WEEK TO FIGURE OUT

10
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,958
WHAT THE HELL WE'RE GONNA DO

11
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,125
- IT'S A GOOD THING THIS ISN'T
GOIN' DOWN TOMORROW.

12
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,750
- WAIT A SECOND. I HEARD
THAT THE RED SUNS

13
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,250
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RACIN'
THE NIGHT KIDS.

14
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,166
THAT'S HAPPENING TOMORROW
NIGHT, ISN'T IT?

15
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,291
- THAT'S IT! WE HAUL TAKUMI OUT
THERE, PLANT HIS ASS,

16
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,791
AND MAKE HIM WATCH
THOSE TEAMS RACE EACH OTHER!

17
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,708
YES! GENIUS! THAT COULD BE
EXCITING ENOUGH

18
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,875
TO SNAP HIM OUT OF THIS
DAYDREAMING ABOUT NATSUKI CRAP!

19
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,416
- I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
BETTER THAN A RACE

20
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,916
TO GET HIM TO STOP THINKIN'
WITH THE WRONG HEAD.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,375
- MIGHT BE A BIT OF
A RUDE AWAKENING

22
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,125
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
THIS GUY NEEDS RIGHT NOW.

23
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,375
- ( yawning )

24
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,666
- HEY, DAD. I'VE BEEN THINKIN'
ABOUT SOMETHING.

25
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,500
- 'BOUT WHAT?

26
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,250
- THE OTHER NIGHT, A COUPLE OF
US WENT UP TO USUI

27
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,791
AND I RACED THESE TWO CHICKS.

28
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,416
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,875
FROM RACING HERE.

30
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:15,083
BUT YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS DRIVING IT,

31
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,458
I NOTICED HOW SIMILAR IT WAS
TO DRIVNG ON AKINA PASS.

32
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,458
- THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

33
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,916
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,958
- SURE USUI'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT COURSE

35
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,041
FROM AKINA IN EVERY WAY.

36
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,166
BUT THE RACE YOU RAN,
WAS THE SAME ONE

37
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,416
YOU WOULD'VE RUN ON AKINA.

38
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,916
THINK OF IT LIKE THIS.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,458
IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH
AKINA YOU TAKE WITH YOU

40
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,000
TO THE OTHER COURSES.

41
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,708
GOOD LUCK WITH THE DELIVERIES.

42
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,958
- THANKS.

43
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,625
- HOW MUCH AKINA I TAKE WITH ME.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,416
- ( car revving )

45
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:18,083
I THINK I KINDA GET WHAT THE
OLD MAN'S TRYING TO SAY.

46
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,458
- ( yawning )

47
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,625
I NEED A NAP.

48
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,875
- HE'S COMPLETELY LOST IN
ANOTHER ONE OF HIS DAYDREAMS.

49
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,083
RIGHT! IT'S TIME TO LET
THIS OPERATION BEGIN!

50
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,750
WASSUP, TAKUMI, MY MAIN MAN?
HOW'S THINGS GOIN'?

51
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,583
( laughs ) GOT SOME BIG
NEWS FOR YA DUDE!

52
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,166
NOW DON'T FREAK OUT WHEN
I TELL YA, 'KAY?

53
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,708
BUT THE RED SUNS AND
THE NIGHT KIDS,

54
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,583
THEY'RE HAVIN'A HUGE THROW DOWN
TONIGHT! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

55
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,833
- YEAH, SO?

56
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "SO"?
IT'S A HUGE DEAL, BUD!

57
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,250
YOU'RE TAKIN' ON RYOSUKE
NEXT WEEK.

58
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,166
WATCHIN' WHAT THESE GUYS DO
ON THE ROAD TONIGHT

59
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:03,916
IS A NO BRAINER.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,083
YOU GOTTA GET OUT THERE.

61
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,625
GREAT! THEN IT'S SETTLED.
LET'S TAKE YOUR EIGHT-SIX.

62
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,125
IT'D JUST BE A WASTE OF
GAS TO TAKE TWO CARS UP THERE,

63
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:11,666
DON'T YOU THINK?

64
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,958
I DO. PERFECT.

65
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,791
- YOU WANNA TAKE MY CAR?

66
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,750
- ( exclaiming excitedly )

67
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,916
TELL ME YOU'RE EXCITED TOO!

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,541
UH. YEAH.

69
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,041
- EXCELLENT! THEN I'LL MEET YOU
AT YOUR PLACE AT SEVEN SHARP!

70
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,875
DON'T FORGET TO TALK TO YOUR DAD
ABOUT BORROWIN' THE EIGHT-SIX.

71
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,583
THIS'LL BE SO AWESOME!

72
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,458
- ( people chattering )

73
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,166
- THEY GOT A BIG CROWD
PACKED IN TONIGHT.

74
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,750
HEY, YOU SEE TAKUMI AND
ITSUKI HERE YET?

75
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,333
- UH UH. BUT THEY SHOULD
BE HERE SOON.

76
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,666
- I HOPE ITSUKI
WORKED SOME MAGIC.

77
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,583
WE NEED TAKUMI TO SEE THIS.

78
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,666
- Itsuki: IF YOU CAN'T FIND
THE ROAD SOON, DUDE,

79
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,333
WE'RE GONNA MISS THE RACE.

80
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,750
AND FOR THE RECORD,

81
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,416
WE GOT LOST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
WANNA TAKE THE TOLL ROAD

82
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,166
AND HAD TO TAKE
THE SIDE STREETS.

83
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,583
YOU'RE JUST TOO DAMN
CHEAP SOMETIMES.

84
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,708
- LOOK WHO'S TALKING.
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DIDN'T DRIVE

85
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,333
BECAUSE YOU SAID WE WERE
GONNA SAVE MONEY ON GAS

86
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,416
COMING UP HERE TOGETHER.

87
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,458
- DUDE, I'VE NEVER EVEN
HEARD OF A RACER

88
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,500
WITH NO SENSE OF
DIRECTION BEFORE.

89
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,125
( sighs )

90
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,416
MUST BE A SIDE EFFECT
OF HIS DAYDREAMING.

91
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,708
- COOL. THINK I GOT IT.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,458
- GO, GO, GO! WE GOTTA FLY
TO MAKE IT THERE!

93
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,041
- ( thunder rumbling )

94
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,833
- YOU MADE ME WAIT.

95
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,208
- COME ON DUDE, DIDN'T YOU KNOW
THE MAIN CHARACTER

96
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,416
ALWAYS SHOWS UP LAST?

97
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
- MYOGI'S RAVINE IS
PRETTY STEEP.

98
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,250
SO TRY NOT TO FLY OFF AND DIE
WHILE YOU'RE TAKIN' HER CURVES.

99
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,208
- ENOUGH B.S. TRASH TALKIN'.

100
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,375
I CAN SEE YOUR
HANDS ARE SHAKIN'.

101
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,916
YOU DON'T GOTTA WORRY
ABOUT A THING.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,666
IT'LL BE A QUICK VICTORY FOR ME.

103
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,416
NO NIGHT KID CAN TOUCH
WHAT I BRING.

104
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,000
- YOU SHOULD LOSE
THAT ARROGANCE.

105
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,750
THAT KINDA THING COULD GET YOU
KILLED UP HERE TONIGHT, KEISUKE.

106
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,625
- ( thunder rumbling )

107
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,500
- LET'S GET ROLLIN' BEFORE THESE
CLOUDS OPEN UP HUH?.

108
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,875
YEAH.

109
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,041
- Man: YOU GUYS SEEIN' THAT?
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

110
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,500
- ( tires screeching )

111
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,291
- AN EIGHT-SIX?

112
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,250
- Itsuki: CHECK OUT THE SIZE
OF THIS CROWD, BRO.

113
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,916
- YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,666
JUST FOCUS ON FINDING
OUR FRIENDS, OKAY?

115
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,583
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING.

116
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,416
GEEZ. IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S THE
EASIEST THING TO DO

117
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,708
WITH ALL THESE
FREAKIN' PEOPLE HERE.

118
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,583
- HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE WE SHOULD GO

119
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,625
TO PARK THE CAR?

120
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,000
- WHAT ABOUT GOIN' UP
TO THE TOP?

121
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,041
THE PARKING LOT UP THERE
SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM.

122
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,541
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN IT IS THEN.

123
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,875
- I KNEW YOU'D SHOW UP TONIGHT.

124
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,250
JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO
GET ME REVVED UP.

125
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,916
- I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW MUCH I'VE IMPROVED

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,541
SINCE THE LAST TIME
WE MET, EIGHT-SIX.

127
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,916
- DUDE, AN EIGHT-SIX.
- YOU MEAN AKINA'S?

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,375
- YEAH, MAN.
- NO KIDDIN'.

129
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,083
- OKAY, TAKUMI.

130
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,833
IS IT JUST ME OR DO
YOU GET THE FEELIN'

131
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,375
THAT PEOPLE KEEP STARING AT US

132
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,791
- AS WE GO THROUGH HERE LIKE
WE'RE CELEBRITIES OR SOMETHIN'.

133
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,833
- YEAH.

134
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,291
- "YEAH"? THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY?

135
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,958
DO YOU EVEN REALIZE HOW MUCH
THEY TOTALLY RECOGNIZE US

136
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,208
IN THIS RIDE?

137
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,541
AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX IS LIKE
MOVIE-STAR FAMOUS.

138
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,666
ISN'T THAT COOL?

139
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,166
EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR
EYE'S ON YOU NOW.

140
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,875
THEY ALL WANNA KNOW
WHAT YOU GOT PLANNED NEXT.

141
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,416
I THINK IT WAS A SUPER IDEA
TO BRING THE EIGHT-SIX UP HERE,

142
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,375
IF I DO SAY SO.

143
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,333
- WHY DO YOU KEEP ON BABBLING?

144
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,625
- OKAY! BRING 'EM FORWARD GUYS!

145
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,458
COME ON!

146
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,125
- ( engines revving )

147
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,583
- COOL. I GOTCHA. WE GOT A
CLEAR ROAD AHEAD OF 'EM!

148
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,291
- I'LL START THE COUNTDOWN!

149
00:08:55,375 --> 00:09:01,041
FIVE. FOUR. THREE. TWO. ONE. GO!

150
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,500
- WOW! THAT WAS A
HELLUVA FAST START!

151
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,333
- I HAVE ALL THE
FAITH IN THE WORLD

152
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,000
THAT KEISUKE'S GONNA
WIN THIS THING.

153
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,208
DON'T YOU FREAKIN' LOSE THIS.

154
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,583
IT'S NOT AN OPTION
ON OUR OWN TURF.

155
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,125
- MUST HAVE STARTED BY NOW.

156
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,583
RAIN TONIGHT.

157
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,958
THE FD'S BEST WEAPON IS
ITS HIGH CORNERING SPEED.

158
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,500
YOU CAN'T FORGET THAT
WHEN YOU'RE BATTLING KEISUKE.

159
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,291
- ( thunder rumbling )

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,791
- HEY TAKUMI.

161
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,541
DO YOU EVER GET THE FEELIN'
THAT MYOGI PASS HERE

162
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,500
IS ACTUALLY KINDA SIMILAR
TO AKINA PASS?

163
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,500
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
FOR ME, USUI PASS

164
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,541
SEEMS MORE LIKE AKINA
THAN ANYTHING ELSE

165
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,958
I'VE DRIVEN BEFORE.

166
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,750
- YOU'VE GONE INSANE.
IT'S NOTHING LIKE AKINA PASS.

167
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,125
THIS IS USELESS. HE'S TOTALLY
LOST IN THAT SEA OF DAYDREAMS.

168
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,916
'DUDE SERIOUSLY. COME ON. LOOK.

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,583
IT'S NOT NEAR AS NARROW AS USUI,

170
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:13,291
AND THE UPHILL IS JUST LIKE THE
UPHILL AT AKINA. ARE YOU BLIND?

171
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,083
- YOU'RE NOT TOTALLY WRONG.

172
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,416
I GUESS, THE RHYTHM
IS KINDA SIMILAR.

173
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,958
- THE RHYTHM?

174
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,875
- BE CAREFUL! YOU KNOW HOW QUICK
THE FD IS AROUND THE CORNERS.

175
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,416
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D
FIND ANOTHER DRIVER

176
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,041
WHO'D BE ABLE TO FOLLOW ME
UP MYOGI'S HILL.

177
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,333
- HE'S STARTING TO
ABUSE HIS STEERING.

178
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,375
THAT'S JUST HIM TRYING TO
SPEED AWAY FROM ME.

179
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,916
IF HE DID THAT ON A DOWNHILL,

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,625
THE TIRES WOULD COMPRESS
IN NO TIME FLAT.

181
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,166
- INITIAL D!

182
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,375
- INITIAL D!

183
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,083
- RYOSUKE, THEY JUST PASSED
THE MID-POINT.

184
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,416
THE THREE-TWO' IS IN FRONT.

185
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,208
I GOTTA TELL YA, THOUGH MAN,
THEY' ARE TIGHT.

186
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:12,166
- COURSE, THEY ARE.
TELL ME ONE OTHER THING.

187
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,416
HOW DID KEISUKE LOOK TO YOU
COMING OUT OF THE TURN?

188
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,583
- MAYBE 'BOUT A FRACTION
SLOWER THAN TAKASHEE.

189
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,916
BUT, OVERALL, HE'S UNDER CONTROL
AND MOVING SMOOTH.

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,833
JUST WHAT YOU'D EXPECT.

191
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,250
NOTHIN' LIKE TAKASHEE.
HE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.

192
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,541
AGGRESSIVE AND INCONSISTENT.

193
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,458
- GREAT. THAT 'WAS ALL I NEEDED.
THANKS FOR CALLING IN.

194
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,000
THAT'S A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT
YOU'VE MADE, KEISUKE,

195
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,708
BEING ABLE TO HANDLE
YOURSELF LIKE THAT.

196
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,291
- Man: THE THREE-TWO
IS IN FRONT

197
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,666
BUT THESE GUY'S
ARE RIDIN' CLOSE!

198
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,125
I MEAN THEY JUST PASSED ME,
LOOKING LIKE ONE CAR.

199
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,583
NAKAZATO IS BARELY LEADIN'
AT THIS POINT.

200
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,541
- IT SOUNDS LIKE OUR
BOY'S MANAGING

201
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,041
TO HOLD HIS OWN OUT THERE.

202
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,833
- HE'S BEEN TRAINING HARDER THAN
I'VE EVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.

203
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,750
- HE TURNED INTO A DIFFERENT
GUY AFTER LOSING HIS ASS

204
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,750
TO THE EIGHT-SIX LIKE HE DID.

205
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,583
- I'VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED
TAKESHI TO BE MY ENEMY.

206
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,125
THAT'S NO SECRET.

207
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:05,333
BUT RIGHT NOW, JUST KNOWING THAT
HE'S FIGHTING FOR OUR PRIDE,

208
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,666
I FINALLY FEEL THIS BIT
OF CAMARADERIE

209
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,916
INCHING UP INSIDE FOR HIM.

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,250
NEVER FELT THIS BEFORE.
NOT FOR THAT GUY.

211
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,166
- I HAVE THE THREE-TWO
IN THE LEAD!

212
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,583
- RIGHT, TAKESHI! WIN THIS.
YOU CAN DO IT!

213
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,375
- ( tires screeching )

214
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,000
- I CAN HEAR THOSE SQUEALIN'
TIRES LOUDER THAN FIREWORKS,

215
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,416
BUT I CAN'T SEE THEM
ANYWHERE DOWN THERE.

216
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,666
- WAIT.
- WHAT'S UP?

217
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,541
- RAIN.

218
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,458
- ( rain pattering )

219
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,708
- OH, CRAP. AND THOSE
GUYS ARE OUT THERE

220
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,708
KICKIN' IT AT FULL SPEED!

221
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,791
- AND THE ROAD'S
DANGEROUS AS HELL

222
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,958
WHEN IT FIRST STARTS RAININ'.

223
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,750
THAT RAIN HITS THE ASPHALT
LIKE A SPONGE

224
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,541
AND SUCKS OUT
ALL THE DIRT AND OIL

225
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,083
MAKIN' IT SLICKER
THAN FRESH GREASE.

226
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,666
THEY COULD CRASH ANY SECOND.

227
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,666
- RAIN, GREAT. COULDN'T IT HAVE
WAITED 'TIL WE WERE DONE?

228
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,250
- I GOTTA BE ON MY GAME.

229
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,541
I COULD LOSE CONTROL WITHOUT
ANY WARNING IN THIS DOWNPOUR.

230
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,750
- DAMN, IT'S POURING.
I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

231
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,625
I HOPE THEY DON'T JUMP THE GUN
AND STOP THE RACE BECAUSE OF IT.

232
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,875
- ITSUKI, I GOT A QUESTION.
- YEAH?

233
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,500
- SINCE THAT'S THE FINISH LINE
OVER THERE,

234
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,250
THIS HAS GOTTA BE THE
LAST CORNER IN THE RACE, RIGHT?

235
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,875
- YEAH.

236
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,333
- SO THAT'S THE HIGHEST
POINT IN MYOGI.

237
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:05,041
AND THIS OVER HERE.
THIS IS A DOWNHILL CORNER.

238
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,208
- IT'S THE ONLY DOWNHILL CORNER.

239
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,750
- ( tires screeching )

240
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,041
- THEY'RE COMIN' UP!

241
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,666
- THIS IS IT! HERE WE GO!

242
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,250
THAT'S SUICIDE. HE'S GONNA CRASH
INTO THE WALL AT THAT SPEED.

243
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,250
IF HE DOES,
HE COULD KILL BOTH OF US!

244
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:52,000
- I KNOW I CAN DO THIS.
I'M LISTENING TO MY FD,

245
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,416
AND SHE'S TELLING' ME I CAN!

246
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,833
♪ A DIAMOND LIFE
IS JUST WHAT I NEED ♪

247
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,458

248
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,208

249
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,416

PAIN TOGETHER ♪

253
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,291
- THE FD WON!

254
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,791
- KEISUKE TAKAHASHI KICKS ASS!

255
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,250
I GOTTA TELL YOU, I AM JUST
SO IMPRESSED WITH HIS DRIVING!

256
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,333
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT
I'VE EVER FOUND MYSELF

257
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,000
INSPIRED BY WATCHING
ANY OTHER RACERS.

258
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,083
STANDING HERE AND
WATCHING A RACE LIKE THAT

259
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,625
HAS MADE ME MORE
RESTLESS THAN EVER.

260
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,000
- YOU MAY HAVE WON THIS ONE,
BUT IT'S CUZ YOU GOT LUCKY.

261
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,458
- YOU'RE WRONG.
THAT WAS SKILL, DUDE.

262
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,958
- YEAH, RIGHT.

263
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,791
- IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE,
THE LAST CORNER OF THE RACE

264
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,333
WAS ON THE DOWNHILL.

265
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,416
SO BEING WHO I AM I KNEW THAT
THAT CORNER WOULD COME DOWN

266
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,958
TO THE FRONT TIRES.

267
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,166
YOUR PROBLEM WAS, YOU COULDN'T
QUITE CONTROL THEM

268
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,708
CUZ THEY WERE TOO COMPRESSED.

269
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,958
I KEPT UP MY SPEED
AND IN DOING SO,

270
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,333
MAINTAINED MY TIRE PRESSURE
THROUGHOUT.

271
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,583
THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING YOU
IT WAS SKILL.

272
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,583
- WAY TO GO, KEISUKE!
YOU DID IT, MAN!

273
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,416
- SO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO
A DOWNHILL RACE?

274
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,583
- WE CAN'T KEEP RUNNING IN
THIS RAIN. IT'S TOO HEAVY.

275
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,958
- RIGHT.

276
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,458
- WAIT, KEISUKE, BEFORE YOU
DECIDE TO CALL IT OFF

277
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,583
FOR THE NIGHT, WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME RACE THE EIGHT-SIX?

278
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,958
- DO WHAT?

279
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,333
- THIS ISN'T AKAGI MAN,
THIS ISN'T HIS HOME COURSE,

280
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,458
SO I FIGURE AS FAR AS FAIR GOES,

281
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,041
THIS IS AS CLOSE AS
IT'S GONNA GET.

282
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,750
- HEY!
- YO, WHAT'S UP?

283
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,458
- WHO IS THAT GUY
TALKIN' TO KEISUKE?

284
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,000
- NO IDEA.

285
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,958
- IT'S KENTA!

286
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,125
AND YOU'RE TAKUMI FUJIWARA,
THAT RIGHT?

287
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,875
I AM KENTA NAKAMURA
OF THE RED SUNS.

288
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,458
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOU AND ME

289
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,250
TAKIN' A LITTLE
SPIN IN THIS RAIN?

290
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,541
- WE GOTTA RUN THIS
BY MY BROTHER FIRST.

291
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,916
- MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK
THE PEOPLE HERE, KEISUKE.

292
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,791
SEE WHAT THEY WANNA SEE.
HOW ABOUT IT, FOLKS?

293
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,875
WANNA SEE ME TAKE ON THIS GUY?
BATTLE IT OUT IN THE RAIN?

294
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,166
- Crowd: ( whooping ) YEAH!

295
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,500
- WELL, THIS KINDA SUCKS.

296
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,750
IT'S HARD TO SAY NO
TO A SCREAMING MOB.

297
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,666
- BUT HE'S RACING AGAINST
RYOSUKE LIKE NEXT WEEK.

298
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,375
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

299
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,708
DO WE JUST IGNORE THAT?

300
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,833
- I'M STANDING HERE NOW.
AND IF YOU CAN'T BEAT ME,

301
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,125
THEN THERE'S NO REASON
YOU SHOULD EVEN BOTHER

302
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,875
WASTING A SECOND OF
RYOSUKE'S TIME.

303
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,625
WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU IN?

304
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,250
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I LOVE RACIN' IN THE RAIN.

305
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,125
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE SCARED OF IT? ARE YA?

306
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,166
- NO, OF COURSE HE'S NOT.

307
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,416
HE'S JUST KINDA NOT BEEN
HIMSELF LATELY.

308
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,750
A LITTLE OUT OF SORTS.

309
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,416
SOMETIMES, IT'S LIKE
HE'S NOT EVEN HERE.

310
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,166
- SURE, WHY NOT. I'M IN.

311
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,166
- WOW!

312
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,458
- Crowd: ( cheering ) WHOA.

313
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,208
- HOLD IT.

314
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,750
- NO ONE CAN STOP IT NOW.
THE TRAIN'S LEFT THE STATION.

315
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,291
- BUT...
- GET OVER IT.

316
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,916
THAT EIGHT-SIX ISN'T ANYONE'S
PRIVATE TARGET TO TAKE DOWN.

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,708
HE'S THE TROPHY OF THE HOUR.

318
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,041
EVERY RACER WHO'S EVER HEARD
OF HIM WANTS A PIECE.

319
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:26,083
LIKE YOU. SHOULDN'T BE
SUCH AN ALIEN CONCEPT TO YOU.

320
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,750
- COOL, THEN,
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

321
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,416
WE'RE GOING DOWNHILL
IN THE RAIN,

322
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,291
AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT
THAT IS IT'LL MAKE IT A RACE

323
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,625
ABOUT PURE SKILL.

324
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,750
PUT YOUR KILLER EIGHT-SIX
RIGHT UP AGAINST MINE

325
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,208
AND SEE WHO COMES OUT ON TOP.

326
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,708
- LET'S GO, ITSUKI.
- I'M GOING WITH YOU?

327
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,916
IF I LEAVE YOU HERE,
THEN I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO

328
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,958
COME BACK UP AFTERWARDS,

329
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,958
AND I DON'T WANNA DO THAT.

330
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,916
SO COME WITH ME, WE'LL RACE,

331
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,458
AND THEN WE CAN GO STRAIGHT
HOME ONCE ITS OVER.

332
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,000
- SO, I GUESS I'M GOING?

333
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,583
- THAT'S THE PLAN.
BUT DO YOU MIND, UH...

334
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,416
COULD YOU SIT IN THE BACK
WHILE I RACE?

335
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,250
- WHAT? THE BACK?
YEAH, SURE, I GUESS.

336
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,250
IS THIS SOME KIND OF STRATEGY?

337
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,416
- I DUNNO. MAYBE IT IS
AND MAYBE IT ISN'T.

338
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,875
BUT, I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN
I FIND OUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

339
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,875
- ARE YOU TELLIN' ME YOU
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY

340
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,250
YOU GOT ME SITTIN' BACK HERE?

341
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,541
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HOLD STILL

342
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,666
WHILE YOU'RE DRIFTIN' ALL
OVER THE ROAD? HUH?

343
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,916
TELL ME THAT!

344
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,208
- OH, I'M SURE YOU'LL
FIGURE IT OUT.

345
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,750
- THANKS FOR THE
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

346
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,041
IT'S ONLY FROM HERE TO THE
BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN, MAN.

347
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,916
IT'S NOT LIKE WE GOT A ROAD TRIP
IN FRONT OF US.

348
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,458
- Man 1: DUDE 'IT'S NOT OVER!

349
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,041
THEY GOT ONE MORE
RACE STARTIN' UP.

350
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,541
- Man 2: YEAH, AND I HEAR ONE OF
THE CARS IS AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX!

351
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,583
- THIS IS IT. WE GOT NO ONCOMING
TRAFFIC. LET'S ROLL 'EM OUT!

352
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,041
- THIS IS SOMETHIN' I CERTAINLY
DIDN'T SEE COMIN' DOWN THE PIPE.

353
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,583
- YEAH. AND THERE'S NOT A DAMN
THING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

354
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,791
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME, KEISUKE.

355
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,250
REALLY, DRIVIN' IN THE RAIN
IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS.

356
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,125
BEFORE I JOINED UP WITH THE
TEAM I WAITED FOR RAINY DAYS

357
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,708
ON PURPOSE TO
PRACTICE MY DRIVING.

358
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,791
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE TIME
TO GET ON THE ROAD

359
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,208
AND WORK MY DRIFTING TECHNIQUE.

360
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,166
THE RAIN ACTUALLY DOES
A GOOD JOB OF KEEPIN' THE TIRES

361
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,416
FROM GETTING WORN OUT TOO FAST.

362
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,375
- IT'S GOOD YOU GOT
ALL THIS CONFIDENCE

363
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,708
BUT DON' TAKE THIS
RACE TOO LIGHTLY.

364
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,416
- I'M JUST SAYIN' I'M MOST
EXPERIENCED IN THE RAIN.

365
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,875
AND I SURE AS HELL KNOW
I'M BETTER THAN THIS SUCKER

366
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,250
IN THIS KINDA WEATHER.

367
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,583
KNOW WHY?
CUZ THIS RAINIS ON MY SIDE.

368
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,083
- HEY, UH TAKUMI. YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE READY FOR THIS.

369
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,625
YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA BE
COOL DOIN' YOUR THING

370
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,791
IN ALL THIS FREAKIN' RAIN?

371
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,416
I MEAN I NEVER SEEN
YOU DO IT BEFORE.

372
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,250
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
I CAN'T GO TOO FAST IN THE RAIN,

373
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,833
SO I GUESS I'LL JUST
DRIVE NORMALLY

374
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,250
TO START AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

375
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,083
I CAN'T SAY YET IF I'M GONNA BE
FAST OR SLOW OUT THERE

376
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,250
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

377
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,750
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I'M GONNA TAKE IT EASY,

378
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,208
CUZ IF I CRASHED THIS CAR,
MY DAD'S GONNA CUT OF MY HEAD

379
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,000
AND USE MY SKULL FOR AN ASHTRAY.

380
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,958
- YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.

381
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,000
- ( gasps ) BUT IF HE LOSES
THIS RACE, THEN IT'S ALL OVER!

382
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,625
HE'LL NEVER GET HIS CHANCE

383
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,250
TO RACE AGAINST THE GREAT
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

384
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,833
- HERE'S THE COUNTDOWN, BOYS!

385
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:57,541
FIVE! FOUR. THREE. TWO. ONE. GO!

386
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,208
- ( screaming )

387
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,625
THIS IS NOT NORMAL DRIVING!

388
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,541
- ( theme song playing )

389
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

390
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,541
- Announcer: YOU REALLY SEEM
CONFIDENT IN THIS RAIN, KENTA.

391
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,500
- Kenta: I SURE AM.
I'VE DONE IT A LOT.

392
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,333
AND I'LL WIN THIS CUZ I GOT
KEISUKE WATCHING ME.

393
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,000
- Announcer: BUT YOU'RE AWARE
THAT EVEN KEISUKE

394
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,166
LOST TO THIS EIGHT-SIX.

395
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,833
- Kenta: WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE.

396
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,541
I'M AVENGING THAT
LOSS FOR KEISUKE!

397
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,708
- Announcer: AND THIS IS YOUR
FIRST TIME ON THIS COURSE.

398
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:50,916
- Kenta: NO PROBLEM FOR ME.
I GOTTA GIVE IT MY BEST FOR HIM.

399
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,625
- Announcer: KENTA, DO YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF PENT UP FEELINGS

400
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:54,416
FOR KEISUKE?

401
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,583
- Kenta: I, UH...

402
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,875
NEXT ON INITIAL D,
"THE RAINY DOWNHILL!"

403
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,125
DON'T MISS IT!
