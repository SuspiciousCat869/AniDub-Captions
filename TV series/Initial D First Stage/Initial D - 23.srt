1
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,125
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,041
- HEY TAKUMI. YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE READY FOR THIS.

4
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,333
YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA BE
COOL DOIN' YOUR THING

5
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,458
IN ALL THIS FREAKIN' RAIN?

6
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,125
I MEAN I NEVER SEEN
YOU DO IT BEFORE.

7
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,750
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW? I CAN'T
GO TOO FAST IN THE RAIN,

8
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,083
SO I GUESS I'LL JUST
DRIVE NORMALLY TO START

9
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,500
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

10
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,916
I CAN'T SAY YET IF I'M GONNA BE
FAST OR SLOW OUT THERE

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

12
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,416
ALL I KNOW IS I'M GONNA TAKE IT
EASY CUZ IF I CRASHED THIS CAR

13
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,250
MY DAD'S GONNA
CUT OFF MY HEAD

14
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,416
AND USE MY SKULL FOR AN ASHTRAY.

15
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,833
- HERE'S THE COUNTDOWN BOYS!

16
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:18,458
FIVE! FOUR. THREE.
TWO. ONE. GO!

17
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,416
- THAT SUCKS. THE S-FOURTEEN
GOT OFF TO A FASTER START.

18
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,083
- IT'S NOT EVEN A TURBO.
HE'S GOT A TWO-LITER IN THERE.

19
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,416
- YEAH BUT IT'S NOT JUST
THE SIZE OF THE ENGINE.

20
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,625
IT'S THE CLUTCH TECHNIQUE
HE USED ON THE WET SURFACE.

21
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,708
NO WONDER HE'S
GOIN' INTO THIS RACE

22
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,875
WITH SO MUCH CONFIDENCE.

23
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,166
- THAT WASN'T THE
EIGHT-SIX'S BEST START,

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,583
BUT I THINK HE
MEANT IT THAT WAY.

25
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,000
HE KNOWS HE CAN MAKE
UP TIME LATER ON

26
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,458
SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF
RUSHIN' AT THE TOP?

27
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,666
- CRAP, HE TOOK THE LEAD!

28
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,458
HIS S-FOURTEEN'S GOT SOME
SERIOUS POWER

29
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,833
AND HE COULD TOTALLY

30
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,958
WIDEN THE LEAD TO THE POINT
THAT WE'DNEVER CATCH UP!

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,416
- DAMN, HE'S WAY BEHIND!

32
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,958
LOOKS LIKE THIS HILL'S
A BIT TOO MUCHFOR AN EIGHT-SIX!

33
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,416
- SURE BUT FROM HERE
TO THE FINISH, IT'S ALL DOWNHILL

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,416
AND THAT PUTS THE EIGHT-SIX
AT THE ADVANTAGE.

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,958
DUDE'S GOT SOME OF THE MOST
KILLER DOWNHILL TECHNIQUE

36
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:26,875
I'VE EVER SEEN.

37
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,166
SO DON'T COUNT HIM OUT JUST YET.

38
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,291
- (cell phone rings )

39
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,875
- YEAH, HELLO?
OH, HEY THERE BRO.

40
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,083
- Ryosuke: SO THE EIGHT-SIX
AND KENTA ARE BATTLING

41
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,250
IN THE RAIN, HUH?

42
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,916
- THEY SURE ARE.
YOU SHOULD SEE KENTA.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,208
HIS CONFIDENCE
IS THROUGH THE ROOF.

44
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,375
BUT THIS IS THE EIGHT-SIX, AND
I KNOW IT WON'T BE EASY FOR HIM.

45
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,750
- I WOULD AGREE.
NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT,

46
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,875
DRIFTING THROUGH
CORNERS AT LOW SPEED

47
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,583
IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL.

48
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,125
AT LEAST WHEN COMPARED
TO NORMAL RACE CONDITIONS.

49
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,166
- YEAH, I KNOW.
AND IT CAN GET REALLY TRICKY

50
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,958
WHEN YOU HAVE TO
FLOOR THE GAS PEDAL

51
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,958
TO FULLY COMPLETE THE DRIFT.

52
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,791
- WHILE YOU CAN
RELY ON TIRE GRIP

53
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,458
FOR COMPENSATION
ON A DRY SURFACE.

54
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,291
- IT'S SEVERELY LIMITED
WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING IN THE RAIN.

55
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,291
- YOU HAVE TO BE REAL CAREFUL
AND SHIFT THE CAR'S WEIGHT

56
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,000
WHILE USING PRECISE TIMING.

57
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,833
OTHERWISE YOU'LL LOSE CONTROL

58
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,583
AND FIND YOURSELF
WRAPPED AROUND A TREE.

59
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,666
- IT MAKES ME WONDER IF
THOSE TWO REALLY KNOW

60
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,083
WHAT THEY'RE IN FOR.

61
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,416
WET CONDITIONS CAN BE HELL
ON THE CAR AND THE DRIVER.

62
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,041
WE'LL SEE.

63
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,916
- THOSE TWO, HUH?
LIKE YOU REALLY EVEN CARE.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,750
THE ONLY THING YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN IS THE EIGHT-SIX.

65
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,500
NOT THAT I BLAME YOU.

66
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,416
- (screaming)

67
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,541
TAKUMI, PLEASE! LET ME
OUTTA THIS CAR!

68
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,625
I'M NOT READY TO DIE!

69
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,291
- DAMN IT, THE RAIN' IS REALLY
STARTIN' TO COME DOWN NOW.

70
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,875
THE GUY DRIVIN' FOR THE
RED SUNS IS FROM AKAGI.

71
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,041
MEANING NEITHER HE NOR TAKUMI

72
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,291
HAVE THE HOME TURF
ADVANTAGE TONIGHT.

73
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,375
THE BIG WILD CARD IS THE RAIN.

74
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:42,125
- HOLD ON. DOES HE EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DRIVE IN THE RAIN?

75
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,375
- Iketani: WELL,
I'M SURE HE KNOWS HOW.

76
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,625
I MEAN, HE MAKES
HIS DELIVERIES EVERY DAY.

77
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,208
THIS COULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME

78
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,250
HE'S EVER GOTTEN
BEHIND THE WHEEL

79
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,000
OF THAT CAR
WHEN IT'S BEEN RAININ'.

80
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,625
- DUH OF COURSE!
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE!

81
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,833
- WHICH MEANS
TAKUMI'S TECHNIQUE,

82
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,541
IT SHOULD BE JUST AS EFFECTIVE
IN THE RAIN.

83
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,750
- I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
CATCH UP WITH ME.

84
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,833
TIME TO WIDEN THE GAP SOME MORE.

85
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,166
I'M SO GOOD IN THE RAIN
I CAN OUTRACE SOME

86
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,541
OF THE BEST
TURBO-CHARGERS AROUND!

87
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,208
- ( audience cheering )

88
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,458
- WHOA! HE ALMOST
STARTED FISHTAILING!

89
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,166
- Boy 1: LOOKS LIKE
THE S-FOURTEEN'S RUNNIN' FAST

90
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,750
IN THESE WET CONDITIONS!

91
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,750
- ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO
DO IN AN FR IS CONTROLLING IT

92
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,875
WHEN IT'S WET OUT.

93
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,291
- THE ONLY PLACE IT
EVER WANTS TO SPIN

94
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,416
IS TO THE SIDE AND NOT FORWARD.

95
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,458
- LOOK! HERE COMES
THE EIGHT-SIX!

96
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,333
- WOW! THATS INCREDIBLE!

97
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,583
HE'S DRIFTIN' LIKE
IT'S NOT EVEN RAININ'!

98
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,000
- I DON'T BELIEVE
WHAT I JUST SAW.

99
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,583
- THAT DRIFT HE JUST MADE
WAS DOWNRIGHT SCARY.

100
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,375
- I GOT CHILLS RUNNIN' DOWN ME.

101
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,041
- IS THIS REALLY THE SAME DUDE
I'VE BEEN PLOTTING TO BREAK OUT

102
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,833
OF HIS DAYDREAMIN' FUNK?

103
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,916
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA
TAKE IT EASY ON ME,

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,416
NOT BEING STRAPPED IN BACK HERE,

105
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,750
BUT HE'S DRIVIN'
LIKE A FRIGGIN' MANIAC!

106
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,375
IS THIS HOW HE NORMALLY IS?

107
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,625
PLUS, I CAN'T SEE JACK
OUTTA THIS WINDOW

108
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,791
WITH ALL THE RAIN COMIN' DOWN,

109
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,458
SO HOW THE HELL
IS HE SEEIN' THE ROAD?

110
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,625
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE FLYIN' THROUGH
A BLACK HOLE OR SOMETHIN'!

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,666
- ( ringing )

112
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,666
- WHAT'S WITH THAT
GOD-AWFUL RINGING?

113
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,291
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!

114
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,125
I KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON.
HE ISN'T HUMAN.

115
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,583
HE'S A FRIGGIN' MONSTER!

116
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,541
THIS IS EPIC. MAN I'M FEELIN'
GOOD. I'M IN THE ZONE!

117
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,125
BEFORE THE NIGHT'S OVER,
I'M GONNA BE THE ONE

118
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,583
TO FINALLY DETHRONE
THE EIGHT-SIX

119
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,833
AND END HIS WINNING STREAK!

120
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,458
NOT RYOSUKE OR KEISUKE. BUT ME!

121
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,125
I'LL BE THE NEW KING!

122
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,541
WHAT THE?

123
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,500
THE EIGHT-SIX IS RIGHT ON
MY TAIL! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

124
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,666
SOMETHIN' WRONG WITH MY CAR?
I DON'T GET IT.

125
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,250
WE'VE ONLY GONE THROUGH
A COUPLE OF CORNERS

126
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,625
IN THE DOWNHILL,

127
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,375
SO HOW'D HE CATCH UP TO ME?
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

128
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,458
HE CAUGHT ME.
AND IT WAS NOTHIN' TO HIM!

129
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,500
IT'S AS IF THE RAIN
DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT ALL.

130
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,166

00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,666
INITIAL D!

143
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,250
- HE'S DOIN' IT!
HE'S PASSIN' THE S-FOURTEEN!

144
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,833
DID YOU SEE HOW EASY
HE MADE THAT LOOK?

145
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,375
- NO WAY. YOU'RE KIDDIN'!

146
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,458
- OH DUDE, THIS RACE WAS SO
WORTH WAITIN' IN THE RAIN FOR!

147
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,083
- TOTALLY!

148
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,083
- I CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP!

149
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,166
HE KEEPS INCREASIN' HIS LEAD
AFTER EVERY DAMN TURN!

150
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,166
I'M JUST NOT GETTING THAT KINDA
SPEED THROUGH THE CORNERS.

151
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,791
MY CAR'S SPECS BURY HIS
IN EVERY WAY!

152
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,333
SO WHAT'S MAKIN' THE DIFFERENCE?

153
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,458
I THOUGHT THE RAINY CONDITIONS
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

154
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,916
TO MY ADVANTAGE.

155
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,166
- GOT IT. KEEP ME POSTED

156
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,458
- I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM THE HALFWAY POINT.

157
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:24,166
THE EIGHT-SIX PASSED YOUR GUY
AND IS NOW IN THE LEAD.

158
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,000
- OKAY. I GUESS KENTA NEVER
REALLY STOOD A CHANCE AFTER ALL.

159
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,708
- BUT, YOUR GUY WASN'T
A COMPLETE DISASTER.

160
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,750
THE EIGHT-SIX IS UNSTOPPABLE

161
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,000
EVEN WHEN IT'S
POURING DOWN RAIN.

162
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,833
- IT WAS OBVIOUS
BEFORE THE RACE EVEN STARTED.

163
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,500
WEATHER CONDITIONS PLAY NO PART
IN GAINING THE ADVANTAGE ON HIM.

164
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,958
- NOW IT'S YOUR BROTHER'S CHANCE
AT DETHRONIN' THE NEW KING.

165
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,416
-Iketani: HOW YA DOIN' TODAY!
-Itsuki: WELCOME!

166
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,291
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

167
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,208
ANYWAY.

168
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,875
AT LEAST WE KNOW HE'S
JUST AS DOMINATING RACIN'

169
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,666
IN THE RAIN AS HE IS
WHEN IT'S DRY OUT.

170
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,166
- I'M TELLIN' YA DUDE,
THAT BOY'S BECOMIN'

171
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,791
MORE AND MORE LIKE A TRUE
RACER EVERY DAY.

172
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,541
YOU SAW HOW HE ACCEPTED
THE S-FOURTEEN'S CHALLENGE

173
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,416
LAST NIGHT LIKE IT WAS NOTHIN'.

174
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,708
- AND IT LOOKS LIKE HIS
DAYDREAMIN' PHASE

175
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,958
IS OVER FOR NOW.

176
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,750
I GUESS OUR OPERATION
WAS A SMASHIN' SUCCESS,

177
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,250
WOULDN'T YOU SAY FELLAS?

178
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,625
All: MM-HMM.

179
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,541
- I GOTTA ADMIT, ITSUKI, I'M A
LITTLE JEALOUS OF YOU,

180
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,291
YA LUCKY BASTARD.

181
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,916
BEING ABLE TO EXPERIENCE
A RAINY DOWNHILL BATTLE

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,958
FROM INSIDE HIS CAR
MUST'VE BEEN AWESOME.

183
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,708
- IT FLIPPED MY LID!

184
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,125
I MUST'VE HAD MY LIFE
FLASH BEFORE MY EYES

185
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,500
LIKE A MILLION TIMES!

186
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,000
PLUS HE TOLD ME
TO SIT IN THE BACK

187
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,291
SO I WAS BEING THROWN AROUND
LIKE A RAGDOLL!

188
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,375
- HE MADE YA SIT IN THE BACK?

189
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,791
- DID HE SAY WHY?

190
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,291
- NO. I DON'T THINK TAKUMI
EVEN KNEW WHY HE SAID IT.

191
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,375
HE WAS ACTIN' LOONEY
THE WHOLE NIGHT.

192
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,958
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

193
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,083
- WHOA WHOA. LET'S BACK UP.
YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG DUDE.

194
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,583
I KNOW WHY HE PUT YOU
BACK THERE.

195
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,375
- YOU DO? TELL US!
- YEAH, SPILL IT ALREADY!

196
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,625
- IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.

197
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,833
WELL, BECAUSE...

198
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,458
- Both: OUT WITH IT!

199
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,625
- ITSUKI'S ANNOYING.

200
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,000
IT'S GOTTA BE FRUSTRATIN'
AS HELL HAVIN' ITSUKI WHININ'

201
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,208
AND CRYIN' NEXT TO YA

202
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,833
WHILE YOU'RE TRYIN'
TO FOCUS ON THE ROAD.

203
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,375
- I CAN TOTALLY SEE
THAT HAPPENIN'!

204
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,083
- ALRIGHT! LAY OFF!

205
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,791
- ( all laughing)

206
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,250
- GEEZ, TALK ABOUT
A COUPLE OF BONEHEADS.

207
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,166
THAT'S NOT THE REASON WHY.

208
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,416
HE HAD ITSUKI SIT IN THE BACK
BECAUSE HE WAS HOPING TO GET

209
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,166
SOME EXTRA TIRE TRACTION.

210
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,208
AND KNOWING TAKUMI, HE
PROBABLY KNEW THAT INTUITIVELY.

211
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,416
HE DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS THE KIND
OF KID TO READ THAT IN A BOOK.

212
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,833
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

213
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,375
- THAT BOY. THERE IS JUST
NO TELLING HOW MUCH BETTER

214
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,125
HE'LL GET OVER TIME.

215
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,500
- Natsuki: TAKUMI!

216
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,666
- ( bell ringing )

217
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,875
- WHO IS THAT?

218
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:22,958
- LOOKS FAMILIAR.

219
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,708
- IT'S TAKUMI'S GIRLFRIEND.

220
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,458
- Both: HIS GIRLFRIEND?

221
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,708
- SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A REASON FOR COMING BY.

222
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,833
I WAS JUST RIDING AROUND IN
THE AREA AND DECIDED TO STOP.

223
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,958
- YEAH?

224
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,791
- IS THIS A BAD TIME?

225
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,125
- UH, NO.

226
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,083
- HE LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE PUPPY
IN LOVE!

227
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,375
- THIS ISN'T GOOD.

228
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,583
( thuds)

229
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,125
- WELL YOU PROBABLY
HAVE STUFF YOU'VE GOTTA DO,

230
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,583
SO I BETTER HEAD OUT.

231
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,250
- OH, SURE.

232
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,083
- NO! YOU GUYS.

233
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,416
WHAT IF HE STARTS DAYDREAMIN'
ABOUT HER AGAIN!

234
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,333
HIS RACIN' CAREER
WILL BE TOTALLY SCREWED!

235
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,791
- YOU BETTER DO SOMETHIN'
ABOUT IT.

236
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,291
- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?

237
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,000
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A BUNCH
OF OTHER RACES LINED UP

238
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,333
FOR US TO CHECK OUT.

239
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,750
- WELL WE SURE AS HELL CAN'T
HAVE HIM SPACIN' OUT

240
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,208
WHEN THE BIG SHOWDOWN
AGAINST RYOSUKE IS NEXT WEEK.

241
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,708
WE NEED HIS FOCUS
ON THE RACE.

242
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,916
- YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT?

243
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,375
HEY, TAKUMI! HOW 'BOUT YOU AND I
GO FOR A SPIN AT AKINA TONIGHT?

244
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,958
- WHAT A MESS. MUST BE
FROM ALL THE RAIN LAST NIGHT.

245
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:24,583
- ( pop song playing )

246
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

247
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,250
- ( phone ringing )

248
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,083
- TOFU SHOP.

249
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,458
YEAH. I'M SORRY, WHO IS THIS?

250
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,625
- Mr. Tsuchiya: IT'S ME.
BEEN AWHILE, HASN'T IT BUNTA?

251
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,708
- HEY. TSUCHIYA. SURE HAS.

252
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,083
SO WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

253
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,291
LET ME GUESS, YOU'RE
IN THE HOSPITAL

254
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,458
AFTER ONE OF YOUR CRASHES?

255
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,916
- DON'T YOU WISH.

256
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,500
HEY, SO I'VE BEEN HEARING
A LOT OF CHATTER RECENTLY

257
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,625
ABOUT YOUR SON.

258
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,458
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
QUITE THE PRODIGY.

259
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,166
KNOW ANYTHING 'BOUT THAT?

260
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,416
- WHAT? THIS SATURDAY?

261
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,166
AND IT'S AGAINST
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI?

262
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,500
SHOULD I KNOW WHO THAT IS?

263
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,958
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
EVEN MY PEOPLE KNOW WHO HE IS.

264
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:54,708
WORD IS HE'S THE BEST
STREET RACER IN ALL OF GUNMA.

265
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,500
- Bunta: AND HE'S RACING
MY SON, HUH?

266
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,916
- SO LET'S HEAR IT.
WHO DO YOU THINK'S GONNA WIN?

267
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,291
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

268
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,041
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT
SATURDAY WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

269
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,291
- ( laughs ) YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

270
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,625
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE THIS DRIFT
YOUR SON GOT FROM YOU.

271
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,375
IT'S ALL I HEAR ABOUT.

272
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,875
YOU KNOW YOU
SCARRED ME FOR LIFE

273
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,750
WITH THOSE MONSTROUS DRIFTS
YOU USED TO PULL.

274
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,500
I STILL CAN'T SLEEP
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

275
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,833
- THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

276
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,583
- Woman: MR TSUCHIYA,
WE NEED YOU.

277
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,416
- Tsuchiya: BE RIGHT THERE!
GOTTA RUN, BUNTA.

278
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,041
- YA KNOW, ITSUKI, YOU'VE ONLY
BEEN DRIVIN' A FEW MINUTES

279
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,458
AND I CAN ALREADY
TELL YOU'VE IMPROVED.

280
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,583
- NO WAY! YOU REALLY THINK SO?
THANKS DUDE!

281
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,041
THAT MEANS A
WHOLE HELLUVA A LOT

282
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,916
COMING FROM A CHAMPION
LIKE YOU, TAKUMI.

283
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,625
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE YET

284
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,083
BUT I'VE BEEN WORKIN'
ON MY 'GRIP RUN'.

285
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,416
IT'S BADASS.

286
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,958
HERE'S A TECHNIQUE I CAME UP
WITH ALL ON MY OWN.

287
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,916
IT'S TAKEN COUNTLESS HOURS
OF PRACTICE TO MASTER IT

288
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,625
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I'M WILLIN' TO SHOW.

289
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,791
- HUH?

290
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,625
- HERE IT IS! ILLUSIONARY
HELL AND TEAR!

291
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,250
WHOOPS, SORRY! THAT'S MY BAD!

292
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,250
FUNNY, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE
AT ALL WITH IT YESTERDAY.

293
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,291
ALRIGHT, LETS TRY THAT AGAIN!

294
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,041
THAT ONE WAS
'INCREDIBLE BRAKING'!

295
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,500
- Takumi: WAIT, ITSUKI.
LET'S TAKE A BREAK OK?

296
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,541
- I'M SO GLAD I CAN RELAX NOW
THAT YOU'RE OUT OF

297
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,083
YOUR SILLY DAYDREAMIN' CRAP.

298
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,583
I JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T COME
BACK, KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

299
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,916
- HOLD ON A SECOND!
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

300
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,458
I WASN'T DAYDREAMING.

301
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,041
- WELL WHATEVER IT WAS
YOU WERE DOIN'

302
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,583
YOU WERE ACTIN' ALL, WHATEVER.

303
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,416
- HUH?

304
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,791
- DON'T YOU GET
WHAT I'M SAYING, MAN?

305
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,208
OR DO I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT?

306
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,125
- BETTER SPELL IT OUT. SERIOUSLY
IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME.

307
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,791
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY
NEED AFTER THE RACE

308
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,000
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT?

309
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,000
FACT IS YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

310
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,583
YOU'RE ALREADY FAST AS IT IS

311
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,833
SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PROVE YOURSELF AGAIN.

312
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,000
- DUDE, I'M NOT THAT FAST.

313
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,208
- ARE YOU CRAZY? YES YOU ARE!

314
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,833
REMEMBER, YOU'RE STILL
UNDEFEATED,

315
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,791
I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY FAST.

316
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,000
- I DON'T KNOW.

317
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,625
ALL I KNOW IS' MY WHOLE
FUTURE IS IN FRONT OF ME

318
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,708
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE I'M HEADING.

319
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,291
- TAKUMI, YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME.

320
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,166
CAN'T YOU JUST FOCUS ON THE RACE
FOR NOW AND FORGET THE FUTURE?

321
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,458
THE RACE IS GONNA BE
HERE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, DUDE.

322
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,166
- RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

323
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,291
- ( theme song playing )

324
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

325
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,166
- RYOSUKE, WE'RE COMING UP
ON THE MOMENT OF TRUTH

326
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,708
FOR YOUR FASTEST
RACER THEORY.

327
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,333
- Ryosuke: YES, AND I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY

328
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,333
OF PROVING IT RIGHT.

329
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,791
- SO, WHAT EXACTLY IS THE
THEORY?

330
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,041
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT FOR US?

331
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,833
- I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL
FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM

332
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,833
E EQUALS M-C-SQUARED, RIGHT?

333
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,583
IT'S KNOWN AS EINSTEIN'S
THEORY OF RELATIVITY.

334
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:52,916
I'VE TAKEN THAT PREMISE AND
ADDED MY OWN SUB-THEORY TO IT.

335
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,625
E SYMBOLIZES THE
OPPONENT'S AVERAGE SPEED

336
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,000
THROUGHOUT THE RACE
FROM BEGINNING TO END,

337
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:00,291
Announcer: NEXT ON INITIAL D.
AKAGI'S WHITE COMET.

338
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,625
DON'T MISS IT!
