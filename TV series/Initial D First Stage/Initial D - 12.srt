- HE'S GOT SOME FURIOUS
SPEED IN THAT RIDE.

40
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,083
WHY'S HE FIRING HIS BRAKES?

41
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,333
NO WAY HE SHOULD BE HITTIN' 'EM

42
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,875
WHILE HE'S CORNERING AT
THAT SPEED. DAMN!

43
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,125
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THIS GUY.

44
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,291
HIS ENDURANCE IS
OUTTA MY LEAGUE.

45
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,750
I HATE TO SAY IT BUT
THAT EG-SIX MAY BE FASTER

46
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,291
THAN TAKUMI'S RIDE.

47
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,583
BUT WHO'S BEHIND THE WHEEL?

48
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,791
- ( tires screeching )

49
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,541
- ( cars honking )

50
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,208
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

51
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,000
- YEAH. IT REALLY TICKED ME OFF,
Y'KNOW?

52
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,416
- SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME HE WAS
BRAKING WHILE HE WAS CORNERING.

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,875
AND HE WAS GOING EVEN FASTER
THAN YOU WERE?

54
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,583
- I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT BEFORE.

55
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,625
NOT IN THE MAGAZINES,
VIDEOS, NOWHERE.

56
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,875
- YOU HADN'T SEEN THAT?
EVERYBODY DOES IT,

57
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,916
HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE
SEEN THAT, DUDE?

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,125
I DON'T THINK I'VE DRIVEN
A DAY SINCE I'VE HAD MY LICENSE

59
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,166
WHERE I DIDN'T PUMP
THE BRAKE IN A CORNER.

60
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,958
- ( mimics driving noises )

61
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,583
UH-OH, I'M GOIN' TOO FAST HERE,
BETTER HIT THAT BRAKE.

62
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,125
AH, AH. THERE WE GO.

63
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,958
- NOT DRIVING SCHOOL BRAKING
TECHNIQUES, YOU MORON.

64
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,125
THIS EG-SIX CLEARED THOSE
CORNERS AT SPEEDS

65
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,500
YOU HAVEN'T RUN IN ANY CAR

66
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,166
THAT YOU'VE EVER BEEN
BEHIND THE WHEEL OF.

67
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,458
- SOMEONE WANNA TELL ME
WHAT AN EG-SIX IS?

68
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,583
- A HONDA CIVIC. GET WITH IT.

69
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,083
- OKAY.

70
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,625
SO WHY DON'T YOU GUYS JUST
CALL THE THING A HONDA CIVIC.

71
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,916
- WAKE UP, BRO. THE CIVIC IS
QUITE THE POPULAR RIDE

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,333
AMONG STREET RACERS, EVEN
THOUGH IT'S AN FF.

73
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,083
IT'S A NON-TURBO ONE POINT SIX
LITER LIKE YOUR EIGHT-SIX,

74
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,416
BUT ITS V-TEC ENGINE
HAS A BOATLOAD MORE POWER.

75
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,625
KINDA LIKE COMPARING
A FREIGHT TRAIN TO,

76
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,208
WELL TO A LESS POWERFUL TRAIN.

77
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,958
IT'S BEEN THE CHIEF
RIVAL OF THE TRUENO

78
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,250
AND THE LEVIN FOR YEARS NOW.

79
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,916
TALK ABOUT YOUR
GRUDGE MATCHES.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,083
YOU DRIVE AN EIGHT-SIX,
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL YOU

81
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,750
ABOUT THE CIVIC, YOU SHOULD
KNOW IT ALREADY!

82
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,958
I MAY ONLY DRIVE A LOWLY LEVIN,

83
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,833
BUT I REFUSE TO LET A CIVIC
GET PAST ME!

84
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,625
( laughs )

85
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,416
- MY POINT IS, THE
SPEED IT HAD GOING

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
INTO THAT CORNER WAS RIDICULOUS.

87
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,583
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
THEN IT BRAKED.

88
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,125
THE WHOLE INCIDENT THREW ME OFF.

89
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,583
- YEAH. THAT'S A MOVE CALLED
LEFT FOOT BRAKING.

90
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,583
IT'S A FAIRLY WELL
KNOWN TECHNIQUE.

91
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,250
- LEFT FOOT BRAKING, REALLY?

92
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,791
- YEAH. YOU DON'T KNOW IT,

93
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,916
'CAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU
WOULD USUALLY USE IN AN FR.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,625
IT'S WHERE YOU BRAKE WITH THE
LEFT FOOT TO STABILIZE THE CAR

95
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,208
WHILE YOU'RE TRAVELING AT
EXTREMELY HIGH SPEEDS.

96
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,291
WITH AN FF LIKE THE EG-SIX,

97
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,625
YOU NEED YOUR RIGHT FOOT
ON THE GAS PEDAL CONSTANTLY

98
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,833
TO AVOID UNDERSTEERING.

99
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,541
SO YOU BRAKE WITH
YOUR LEFT FOOT

100
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,791
THAT TAKES THE WEIGHT OFF
THE REAR TIRES,

101
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,875
GIVING THE WHOLE BODY
A SHARPER TURN.

102
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,250
HE MUST BE A HIGHLY
EXPERIENCED FF DRIVER

103
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,458
TO TURN THAT TECHNIQUE.

104
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,458
HARDLY SURPRISING
THAT HE'S FAST, TOO.

105
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,416
- FASTER THAN I THOUGHT
ANYONE UP THERE'D BE.

106
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,166
IT BLEW MY MIND.

107
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,166
THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T
CRASH IS BECAUSE

108
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,750
I JUST PRACTICED SPINNING
WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.

109
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,875
IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT,

110
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,208
HE WOULD'VE PUT ME IN
THE GUARD RAIL.

111
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,875
I TELL YA, MAN, I'M GONNA
MAKE THAT EG-SIX PAY FOR THIS.

112
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,166
- Takumi: HEY, I'M HOME.

113
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,208
- YEAH. OH, SOMEONE CALLED
FOR YOU EARLIER.

114
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,833
- WHO?
- HMM...

115
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,708
- WELL. IT SURE SOUNDED LIKE
A PRETTY GIRL.

116
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,333
SAID SHE'D CALL BACK.

117
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,083
- HOW COULD YOU TELL IF
THIS GIRL WAS PRETTY

118
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,916
JUST BY HEARING HER
VOICE ON THE PHONE?

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,916
- I'VE LEARNED A LOT
OVER THE YEARS, BOY.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,750
AND WITH WOMEN,
JUST LIKE WITH CARS,

121
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,041
EVERYTHING COMES DOWN
TO EXPERIENCE AND INTUITION.

122
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,916
BEST OF LUCK WITH
BOTH OF 'EM.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,500
- YEAH, YEAH.

124
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,791
- ( sighs ) I GUESS I OUGHT TO
BE HEADING OFF TO MY MEETING.

125
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,041
- ( phone ringing )

126
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,750
- ( yawning )

127
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,750
- Takumi: FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

128
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,000
- Natsuki: TAKUMI? IS THAT YOU?

129
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,791
- YEAH.

130
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,208
- HOPE I DIDN'T WAKE YOU.

131
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,875
REMEMBER THAT LITTLE CHAT YOU
AND I HAD THE OTHER DAY?

132
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,833
- TAKUMI. THIS BETTER BE A
REAL DATE CUZ IF IT ISN'T,

133
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,083
I SWEAR ON MY LIFE,

134
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,666
I'LL STAB YOU WITH A SHOP-VAC,
DO YOU HEAR ME!

135
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,416
SHE'S REALLY BRINGING HER FRIEND
ALONG? AND SHE'S HOT TOO?

136
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,625
- I JUST KNOW NATSUKI SAID
SHE WAS BRINGING A FRIEND.

137
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,000
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT UP
AND STOP FREAKING YOURSELF OUT.

138
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,291
- WELL, SHE HAD BETTER BE CUTE.

139
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,000
( excitedly )
AND HAVE A REAL HOT BOD.

140
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:33,041
AND MAYBE SHE'LL FALL IN LOVE
WITH ME! EH? EH?

141
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,500
- LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS IT'S HER
FRIEND FROM JUNIOR HIGH.

142
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,041
THEY GO WAY BACK AND SHE'S NICE.

143
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,500
- I DON'T CARE IF
SHE'S A FREAKIN' SAINT

144
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,041
AS LONG AS SHE'S HOT.

145
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,250
BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW, AND I
GUESS BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS.

146
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,833
PAL 'O MINE.

147
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,916
I'M SO FLATTERED THAT YOU KEPT
YOUR PROMISE TO ME. YOU ROCK.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,875
WHO HAS THE BESTEST BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD?

149
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,500
I DO, THAT'S WHO!

150
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,125
- SERIOUSLY, BRO,
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

151
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,166
I'LL BE THE BEST RACER
ON ALL OF MOUNT AKINA,

152
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,625
AND I'LL HAVE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
BY MY SIDE!

153
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,833
( laughs )

154
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,458
( exclaims in horror )

155
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,666
CRAP ON ANYTHING ELSE,
BUT NOT ON MY LEVIN!

156
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,416
AW, YOU STUPID BIRD!

157
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,791
- I KINDA FIGURED THEY WOULD
HAVE BEEN HERE BY NOW.

158
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:10,916
- Natsuki: HEY!

159
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,541
I HOPE YOU WEREN'T WAITING LONG.

160
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,916
- WHAT'S WITH ALL THE VIOLENCE?

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,416
- HI.
- ITSUKI, THIS IS MY FRIEND.

162
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,625
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET SAORI.

163
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,458
SAORI, THIS IS ITSUKI
AND THIS IS TAKUMI.

164
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,041
- WHAT'S UP.

165
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,291
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOIN'?

166
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,791
- ( chuckles ) NOW, THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A WOMAN.

167
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,750
- SO, NATSUKI TELLS ME
YOU'RE A STREET RACER.

168
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,958
- THAT'S RIGHT, I BELONG
TO A TEAM OF RACERS

169
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,416
CALLED THE AKINA SPEED STARS.

170
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,208
WE PRETTY MUCH OWN THESE ROADS.

171
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,041
I'M LIKE THE THIRD OR
FOURTH FASTEST DRIVER

172
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,666
IN THE WHOLE GROUP.

173
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,291
I'M KIND OF A LOCAL
LEGEND, REALLY.

174
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,208
THEY CALL ME "THE
LEVIN OF AKINA."

175
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,625
- THAT'S SO AWESOME!

176
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,541
- WHAT'S A STREET RACER
DO ANYWAY?

177
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:02,375
- WAIT. WHAT? C'MON, YOU REALLY
DON'T KNOW? A STREET RACER...

178
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,291
- AW, YEAH! THIS CHICK IS WAY
COOLER THAN I THOUGHT SHE'D BE.

179
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,375
- ITSUKI! WATCH OUT!

180
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,708
- ( honking )

181
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,250
- ( screaming )

182
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,416
- ( tires screeching )

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,375
- DO YOU WANT ME TO
TAKE THE WHEEL?

184
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,416
- NO, NO, I GOT THIS.
SORRY' BOUT THAT.

185
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,458
JUST SOME BAD STREET RACER
HABITS COMING OUT.

186
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,833
- ARE YOU DOIN' OKAY?

187
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,750
- YEP. I'M JUST PERFECT.

188
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,041
- IT'S JUST THAT RIDING
IN A CAR WITH ITSUKI

189
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,541
CAN BE A LITTLE ROUGH.

190
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,333
- Itsuki: HEY GUYS!
TAKUMI! NATSUKI!

191
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,458
CHECK US OUT!
WHAT DO YA THINK?

192
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,291
- YOU SHOULD COME TAKE
A RIDE WITH US!

193
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,458
- ( laughs )

194
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,375
Y'KNOW. I NEVER WOULD
HAVE EXPECTED IT,

195
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,708
BUT THEY'RE KINDA CUTE TOGETHER.

196
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,833
- YEAH.

197
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,791
- INITIAL D.

198
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,583
- INITIAL D!

199
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,333
- SO, EITHER OF YOU
NEED A RIDE HOME?

200
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,875
- NO THANKS. SAORI AND I
HAVE A LOT TO CATCH UP ON,

201
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,625
SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA WALK
THE REST OF THE WAY.

202
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,250
- BYE, ITSUKI, I HAD A REALLY
GOOD TIME WITH YOU TODAY.

203
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,541
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,666
- SEE YA LATER.
- UH HUH.

205
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,958
- WAIT, SAORI.

206
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,125
TALK TO YA SOON! CALL ME!

207
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,875
( chuckling )

208
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,875
- ( engine revving )

209
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,375
- ( Itsuki humming )

210
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,708
( exclaiming excitedly )

211
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,791
- NOT BAD.
- THAT WAS FUN.

212
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,791
- SAORI'S ONE FINE CHICK.

213
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,375
I TELL YA SHE SENT AN
ELECTRIC CURRENT

214
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,791
SURGING THROUGH MY BODY. OH!

215
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,791
( whooping ) WOW! OH!

216
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,541
- DUDE. WOULD YOU MIND ACTUALLY
DRIVING THE CAR?

217
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,916
- CALM DOWN, YA
PANSY. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW

218
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,541
HOW TO THANK YOU FOR
SUCH A KILLER DAY!

219
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,083
"WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN."
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

220
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,416
AND HOPEFULLY WHEN WE DO,
IT'LL JUST BE THE TWO OF US.

221
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,541
- ( gasps ) DUDE, LIGHT!

222
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,416
- ( screaming )

223
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,791
- ( tires screeching )

224
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,125
- ( cars honking )

225
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,500
- ( engine starting )

226
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,750
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT.

227
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,250
- ( honking continues )

228
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,916
- ( engine starting )

229
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,958
- Both: THANK YOU
FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

230
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,416
- WHAT'S NEXT ON MY AGENDA?

231
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,625
- ( in sing song tone ) PETER
PIPER PICKED A PECK OF PETROL...

232
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,208
- 'SUP WITH HIM? HE'S IN
A PRETTY GOOD MOOD TODAY.

233
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,666
- DID HE MEET A GIRL
OR SOMETHIN'?

234
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,208
- YEAH.

235
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,125
- DAMN, NO WAY IS THAT IDIOT
GONNA BAG HIMSELF A GIRLFRIEND

236
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,541
BEFORE I DO.

237
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,875
OH, TAKUMI, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

238
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,083
- DO YOU WANNA DRIVE
MY S-THIRTEEN?

239
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,583
- DO WHAT?

240
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,791
- IT CAN BE KINDA REFRESHING
TO DRIVE A NEW CAR

241
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,208
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

242
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,875
- NO, THANKS. I'M OKAY, REALLY.
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.

243
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,875
BUT I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE
THAT CAR AND I WOULD HATE

244
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,250
TO SCREW IT UP OR SOMETHING.

245
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,958
- TAKUMI, DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH I CAN LEARN

246
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,208
FROM WATCHING
YOU DRIVE IT?

247
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,291
PLEASE, MAN, I'M BEGGING YOU.

248
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,916
- C'MON, SHINGO, YOU
CAN'T REALLY BE SERIOUS

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,166
'BOUT RACIN' AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX?

250
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,541
- ( chuckles ) YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO WAIT AND SEE, BRO.

251
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,333
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

252
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,625
( engine starting )

253
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,416
- ( laughs ) GET OUTTA THAT
HIDING SPOT OF YOURS, EIGHT-SIX.

254
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,000
YOU AND ME HAVE SOME
UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

255
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,375
- DO I REALLY HAVE TO DO THIS?

256
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,125
- PLEASE, DUDE! JUST DRIVE LIKE
IT'S ANY OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK.

257
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,500
IT'S LIKE A DRIVING CLASS,
EXCEPT I'LL BE PAYING ATTENTION.

258
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,625
MAN. I'LL OWE YOU MORE
THAN YOU'LL KNOW.

259
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,083
- WELL, TO TELL THE TRUTH,

260
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,750
I'M NOT REALLY VERY
GOOD BEHIND THE WHEELS

261
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,333
OF OTHER PEOPLES' CARS.

262
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,750
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE THE
KINDA HELP YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR.

263
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,125
- HE'S PRACTICALLY ON HIS KNEES.

264
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,458
CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE IN
TO THE GUY THIS ONE TIME?

265
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,958
- YEAH, IT'LL MEAN
THE WORLD TO HIM.

266
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,750
IS HE YOUR FRIEND OR ISN'T HE?

267
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,958
- FINE. ONLY THIS ONCE, OKAY?

268
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,208
JUST DON'T EXPECT IT
TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE OR ANYTHING.

269
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,125
- YOU WON'T REGRET IT. AWESOME!

270
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,875
- ( engine revving )

271
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,500
- OKAY, YOU'RE ALL SET, BUDDY.

272
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,541
JUST TRY NOT TO PASS OUT
THIS TIME OUT, HUH?

273
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,083
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
NOW GET AWAY FROM THE CAR.

274
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,833
TAKUMI, LET'S DO THIS THING.

275
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,291
- YEAH. COOL BY ME.

276
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,791
- SWEET!

277
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,416
- IS THERE ANY SPECIAL MOVE
YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU FIRST?

278
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,625
- UH, HOW ABOUT A BRAKING DRIFT?

279
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,750
- HERE WE GO.

280
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,583
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

281
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,125
WAIT. NOW? ON THE FIRST TURN?

282
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,000
THINK MAYBE WE'RE MOVIN'
A LITTLE TOO FAST?

283
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,333
WE COULD SLOW IT DOWN.

284
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,750
( exclaiming in fear )

285
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,708
( tires screeching )

286
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,666
- ♪ A DIAMOND LIFE
IS JUST WHAT I NEED ♪

287
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,333
♪ PLEASURE AND JOY FOREVER ♪

288
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,916
♪ GET WHAT I CAN GET
'COS LIFE IS A BET ♪

289
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,208
♪ NO PLEASURE AND
PAIN TOGETHER ♪

290
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,250
- I HOPE HE'S ALL RIGHT.
WHADDYA THINK, MAN?

291
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,791
- WELL, UH...

292
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,083
( screams ) I KNEW IT!

293
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,625
THE AGONIZED CRY OF
HIS LAST MOMENT

294
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,166
DURING THIS HORRIFYING DOWNHILL
ECHOED ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN!

295
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,541
POOR IKETANI,
IN THE THIRD CORNER.

296
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,125
( wincing )

297
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,541
TOTALLY PASSED OUT!

298
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,250
CONSIDERING WHAT HAPPENED LAST
TIME, I WOULD BE SURPRISED.

299
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,708
- ( screaming )

300
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,708
- HE'S NEVER DRIVEN
THIS CAR BEFORE

301
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,333
AND HE CAN DRIFT IT
SO EFFORTLESSLY.

302
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,208
I NEVER KNEW MY
CAR COULD DO THIS.

303
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,916
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS
CAPABLE OF THIS KINDA SPEED.

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,833
- YEAH, I CAN TELL IT HANDLES
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY

305
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,041
FROM MY EIGHT-SIX.

306
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,500
BUT I THINK I'M FINALLY
STARTING TO GET USED

307
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,833
TO ALL THE MINOR DETAILS.

308
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,000
- DID I PASS OUT AGAIN

309
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,416
OR HAVE WE ONLY GONE
THROUGH THREE TURNS?

310
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,916
- I'M READY FOR A DRIFT.
ARE YOU?

311
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,666
- DRIFT? THE HELL'S HE BEEN
DOIN' THIS WHOLE TIME?

312
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,041
( engine revving )

313
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,375
( screaming )

314
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,708
- ♪ GIVE ME LOVE AND MONEY ♪

315
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,416

324
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,458
- THAT ONE FELT
PRETTY GOOD TO ME.

325
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,708
I THINK I GOT IT RIGHT ON THE
MONEY AT THAT LAST CORNER.

326
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,458
- I HAVE TO OWN UP TO IT.

327
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,041
THIS IS TOO ADVANCED A TECHNIQUE
FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND.

328
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,166
( screaming )

329
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,875
- I WONDER HOW THE RUN WENT.

330
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,083
- ( groaning )

331
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,333
- ( mocking ) CONGRATULATIONS,
SISTER. YOU MADE IT.

332
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,958
- AND CONSCIOUS, NO LESS.

333
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,041
- WAS IT EVERYTHING YOU
HOPED IT'D BE?

334
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,000
DID YA GET A GOOD LOOK AT
TAKUMI'S BRAKING DRIFT

335
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,291
LIKE YOU WANTED?

336
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,916
- ( groans ) NO.
NO CLUE WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

337
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,375
- THEN WHAT WAS THE POINT?

338
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,541
WHY BOTHER BEGGING LIKE A JERK

339
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,458
IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA
PAY ATTENTION?

340
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,000
- Iketani: IT'S JUST THAT
HE MAKES IT LOOK SO SIMPLE.

341
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,250
THEN WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE,
I HAD THIS CRAZY EPIPHANY.

342
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,208
IT'S LIKE THIS.
WHILE I'M NOT EVEN CLOSE

343
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,583
TO UNDERSTANDING
HIS TECHNIQUE,

344
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,250
I FEEL LIKE I'M ALREADY
A BETTER STREET RACER.

345
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,416
BETTER THAN ANY OF YOU.

346
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,791
- ( cars approaching )

347
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,958
- HEY, THAT'S THE EG-SIX.

348
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,833
THE ONE THAT BUMPED ME.
WHY IS HE HERE?

349
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,291
- ( grunting ) JERK.

350
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,500
HEY, PUNK! WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOIN' UP HERE?

351
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,458
YOU HIT MY CAR.
LAST NIGHT, REMEMBER!

352
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,416
- YEAH? WHO ARE YOU?

353
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,416
- AND DON'T TRY TO TELL ME
YOU FORGOT.

354
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,833
YOU REALLY FORGOT
HITTING MY S-THIRTEEN?

355
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,083
- OH, OH YEAH!

356
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,125
- YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY,
YOU GOT THAT?

357
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,166
YOU COULD HAVE KILLED ME OUT
THERE, OR WORSE, WRECKED MY CAR.

358
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,916
- OH, SO THAT WAS MY FAULT?

359
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,958
IF YOU COULD HANDLE YOUR RIDE,
IT WOULDN'TA HAPPENED.

360
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,166
- Iketani: WHAT?

361
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,833
- I JUST KNEW THE CAR IN
FRONT OF ME WAS SLOW

362
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,916
AND I COULDN'T TAKE
FOLLOWING IT ANYMORE.

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,916
I DIDN'T THINK THINGS UP HERE
WENT THAT SLOW,

364
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,500
BUT WHADDYA GONNA DO.

365
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,750
I TRIED TO BRAKE, BUT I GUESS
I NUDGED YOU A BIT,

366
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,750
SUCKS TO BE YOU.

367
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,208
- YOU WANNA SAY THAT
TO ME AGAIN?

368
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,708
CALM DOWN, IKETANI.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

369
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,250
- AH, MAN. WHAT A DOUCHEBAG.

370
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,916
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S ACTING LIKE
TRYING TO MURDER IKETANI

371
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,291
WAS NO BIG DEAL.

372
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,750
- ( laughs ) I'LL TELL YA WHAT,
YOU WANNA SETTLE UP,

373
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,250
WE CAN RACE UNDER MY RULES.

374
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,541
AND IF YOU WIN, THEN I'LL
DROP TO MY FREAKIN' KNEES

375
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,250
AND BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS.

376
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOUR RULES?
WHY WOULD I AGREE TO THAT?

377
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,250
- IT COULD BE INTERESTING
FOR YOU.

378
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,125
WE CALL IT A GUM
TAPE DEATH MATCH

379
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,416
AND IT'S ONE WILD ASS TIME.

380
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,750
- GUM TAPE WHAT?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

381
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,791
- OH, WE JUST TAPE THE
RIGHT HAND OF EACH DRIVER

382
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,750
TO THE STEERING WHEEL
AND THEN WE RACE.

383
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,541
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE ONLY RULE.

384
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,916
THINK YOU'RE UP TO
HANDLIN' THAT, PRINCESS?

385
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,875
- WAIT, YOU TAPE YOUR HAND
TO THE STEERING WHEEL

386
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,750
AND THEN YOU RACE?
YOU'RE INSANE!

387
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,250
- HOW CAN YOU DRIVE
WITH JUST ONE HAND FREE?

388
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,958
- MY RIGHT HAND ON THE WHEEL.

389
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,916
BUT THEN YOU CAN'T SWITCH HANDS
TO MAKE ANY TURNS.

390
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,291
YOU CAN'T STEER
YOUR FREAKIN' CAR.

391
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,166
THAT'S TOO RISKY.

392
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,750
- ( scoffs ) FOR YOU,
I'D SAY DEFINITELY.

393
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,750
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
SPEED STAR'S EIGHT-SIX?

394
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:40,708
I HEAR THAT GUY'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A DOWNHILL SPECIALIST.

395
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,000
YOU GET HIM TO SHOW HIS FACE,

396
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,583
HE MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE
TO SAVE YOUR ASS.

397
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,458
TELL HIM I'LL BE WAITING
RIGHT HERE FOR HIM.

398
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,666
HE JUST NEEDS TO MEET
ME HERE NEXT SATURDAY

399
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,916
AT TEN O'CLOCK SHARP.

400
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,125
WE'LL HAVE ONE HELL OF A
GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH.

401
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,250
( laughs )

402
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,541
( sighs ) SEE YOU LOSERS THEN.
