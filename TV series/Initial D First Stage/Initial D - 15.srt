THERE ARE ONLY A FEW HAIRPINS
TO GO BEFORE IT'S OVER.

I JUST GOTTA HOLD HIM OFF

I'M NOT GIVING YOU
THE INSIDE THAT EASY!

THAT CORNERING! SOMEHOW HE
SLIPPED THROUGH THE INSIDE.

91
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,291
BASTARD PASSED ME.

92
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,083

96
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,208
- HE'S MADE IT THIS FAR
WITHOUT CRASHING.

97
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,583
WHICH MEANS HE'S ALREADY
ADAPTED TO THE SITUATION.

98
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,750
AND KNOWING TAKUMI
HE'S PROBABLY EVEN GOT

99
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,375
A HUGE LEAD ON THE EG-SIX.

100

- JUST COME DOWN. MOVE IT!

158
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,375
WOULD YOU MIND
EXPLAINING THIS TO ME?

159
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,166
YOU RACED LAST NIGHT AND YOUR
EMOTIONS GOT THE BEST OF YOU.

160
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,250
I COUNT THREE
SCRATCHES THAT WERE MADE

161
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,666
BY SWIPING THE GUARDRAILS.

162
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,000
- WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME
IF I TOLD YOU I DON'T REMEMBER?

163
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,333
MAYBE YOU DID IT.

164
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,875
- I DIDN'T DRIVE THE DAMN CAR
AT ALL YESTERDAY!

165
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,583
YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE WHO HAD IT! SEE?

166
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,458
WOULD I HAVE SCRATCHED
THE BUMPER AND FENDERS?

167
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,416
- HUH?

168
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,000
YOU AREN'T KIDDING! WHAT THE?

169
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,291
HOW THE HELL COULD
THIS'VE HAPPENED.

170
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,875
- YOU dTELL ME!

171
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,958
- OW. WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

172
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,250
- GOT SOMETHIN' TO SAY?

173
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,833
- IT'S COMING BACK TO ME.

174
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,250
I THINK I MAY REMEMBER BUMPING
IT A LITTLE BIT ON MOUNT AKINA.

175
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,625
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, SON?

176
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,250
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE
LOSING YOUR MEMORY ALREADY.

177
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,500
- LAST NIGHT I, SORTA,

178
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,625
RACED AGAINST THIS JERK WHO
HAD CHALLENGED ME.

179
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,250
I GUESS I MUST HAVE.
LOST MY COOL.

180
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,458
BUT HE BUMPED ME FROM BEHIND.

181
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,833
AND ONCE I GOT HOME I
WAS SO FLUSTERED

182
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,375
I JUST WENT RIGHT TO BED.

183
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,500
- I WASN'T THERE, BUT SEEMS
TO ME. IT WAS AVOIDABLE.

184
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,291
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU
THAT YOU'RE STILL A BEGINNER.

185
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,625
IF I'D BEEN DRIVING, THAT
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED AT ALL.

186
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,416
SO HOW'D YOU DO?
DID YOU WIN OR WHAT?

187
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,208
- YEAH. YEAH, I WON.

188
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,625
- THAT'S MY BOY.

189
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,458
- ( grunting )

190
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,125
- TAKE IT EASY, HERCULES.

191
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,916
NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO BE
WORKING ON YOUR BICEPS.

192
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,166
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
THE DOC SAID I'M OKAY.

193
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,416
I'LL BE ABLE TO LEAVE
IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.

194
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,750
- I BROUGHT YOU SOME FLOWERS
TO SPRUCE UP THE ROOM WITH.

195
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,250
I'LL PUT 'EM IN SOME WATER.

196
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,291
- THANK YOU!

197
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,541
SO I HEARD THE BIG NEWS MAN!

198
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,000
ABOUT THE BIG GUM
TAPE DEATH MATCH!

199
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,541
YOU KICKED HIS BUTT!

200
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,625
- YEAH.

201
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,041
- ALL RIGHT! THAT'S AWESOME!
YOU RULE!

202
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,333
NOT ONLY DID YOU PUT
THAT JERK IN HIS PLACE,

203
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,583
YOU BEAT HIM IN AN FR!
THAT'S BEYOND EPIC!

204
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:57,000
- MAYBE SO. BUT I BARELY THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT CAR I WAS DRIVING,

205
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,375
I WAS TOO FOCUSED ON WINNING.

206
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,916
YEAH HE PISSED ME OFF
BUT THAT ISN'T WHAT DROVE ME.

207
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,458
IT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

208
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,083
I MEAN, ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS COMING IN FIRST PLACE.

209
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,583
IT WAS CRAZY, I'D NEVER FELT
THAT WAY DURING A RACE BEFORE.

210
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,750
- TAKUMI. YOU'RE
BECOMING MORE AND MORE

211
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,333
LIKE A STREET
RACER EVERY DAY.

212
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,416
- A STREET RACER? NO WAY, MAN.
YOU'RE GETTING' THE WRONG IDEA.

213
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,458
- AS SOON AS I GET OUTTA HERE I
CAN WORK ON MY DRIFTIN' SKILLS!

214
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,250
I'VE GOT TO STAY
ON TOP OF MY GAME

215
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,125
FOR OUR UNSTOPPABLE
LEVIN-TRUENO TEAM!

216
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,208
- WHAT ARE YOU BOYS
TALKING ABOUT?

217
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,583
- NOTHING. OH. AND BY THE WAY,
HOW'S SAORI DOIN'?

218
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,166
I WAS GETTING' A LITTLE WORRIED,

219
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,208
I HAVEN'T HEARD
ANYTHING FROM HER.

220
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,541
- OH, SHE'S FINE.

221
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,458
I ALMOST FORGOT, SHE
TOLD ME TO TELL YOU HI.

222
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,708
- AH. THAT'S COOL. YA KNOW.
ONCE I GET OUTTA HERE

223
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,291
THE FOUR OF US'LL HAVE TO
GET TOGETHER FOR A DRIVE!

224
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,416
- UH-HUH.

225
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,708
- I'M GLAD ITSUKI'S
FEELING ALL RIGHT.

226
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,000
- YEAH, ME TOO. AND HE SHOULD
BE GETTING HIS EIGHT-FIVE BACK

227
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,416
ANY DAY NOW.

228
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,416
- SO, I WASN'T TOTALLY HONEST
WITH HIM BACK THERE.

229
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,750
- HUH?

230
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,333
- SAORI WAS REALLY SHAKEN UP
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

231
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,125
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S STILL
NOT COMPLETELY OVER IT.

232
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,375
SHE TOLD ME SHE HASN'T SLEPT
A WINK EVER SINCE IT HAPPENED.

233
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,166
SHE SAID SHE HAD
A REALLY FUN TIME WITH HIM

234
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,125
AND THAT HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY
AND EVERYTHING,

235
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,041
BUT SHE DOESN'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK OUT.

236
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,500
- NO. I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S REALLY OVER BETWEEN US.

237
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,250
DAMN IT!

238
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:33,000
I DON'T CARE! STREET RACERS
DON'T NEED GIRLFRIENDS ANYWAY!

239
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,291
( sobbing )

240
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,291
- WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS.
WHAT BRINGS YOU BY HERE?

241
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,750
- THE ATM. PLUS I NEED
SOME SUPPLIES.

242
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,541
SO I THOUGHT I'D SWING BY

243
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,041
AND SEE WHAT YOUR UGLY MUG
WAS UP TO TONIGHT.

244
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,000
- TAKUMI SCRATCHED
THIS UP PRETTY GOOD.

245
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,791
OF COURSE THE WAY THE
OTHER GUY WAS DRIVING IT

246
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,125
WOULD'VE BEEN A MIRACLE

247
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,791
IF HE'D FINISHED
COMPLETELY UNSCATHED.

248
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,541
- THAT'S THE BREAKS, I GUESS.

249
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,708
ALTHOUGH HE HAS BEEN
GETTING BETTER.

250
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,208
- WHAT'RE YOU SMILING ABOUT?

251
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,083
YOUR SON, JUST BEAT THE LIVING
HELL OUT OF YOUR FENDER.

252
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,916
- HIS STYLE IS EVOLVING.

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,958
HE WAS GOOD BEFORE,
BUT THERE WAS

254
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,041
ALWAYS SOMETHING MISSING
FROM THE EQUATION.

255
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,833
LATELY HE'S BEEN GOING FASTER
THAN EVER. SEEING THE ROAD.

256
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,416
HE'S REALLY STEPPED
IT UP A NOTCH.

257
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,583
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
YOU NEVER WATCH HIM RACE.

258
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,625
- WHEN YOU SEE THIS EIGHT-SIX
DAY IN AND DAY OUT LIKE I DO,

259
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:31,083
YOU CAN TELL HOW HE'S DRIVING
BY HOW SHE FEELS.

260
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,833
- AH. I NEVER WOULDA
THOUGHT OF THAT.

261
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,625
- ( engine starting )

262
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,000
- WELL. I'M OUTTA HERE, BUT I'LL
COME BACK BY WHEN I'M DONE.

263
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,291
WE'LL GRAB A DRINK!

264
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,916
- ( tires screeching )

265
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,000
- I GUESS CRAZY RUNS
IN THE FAMILY.

266
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,041
TAKUMI NEVER EVEN
HAD A CHANCE. POOR KID.

267
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,458
( song playing on radio )

268
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
- I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

269
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,083
I'M SUCH A JUNKIE
WHEN IT COMES TO CARS.

270
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,250
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS PERSON

271
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,416
BUT I JUST CAN'T PASS BY A
MOTORIST IN NEED.

272
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,458
- ( clears throat )

273
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,625
HEY THERE. I'M NOT SOME CRAZY
SERIAL KILLER OR ANYTHING,

274
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,708
BUT I NOTICED YOU'RE HAVING
TROUBLE WITH YOUR CAR

275
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,041
AND THOUGHT MAYBE
I COULD GIVE YOU A HAND.

276
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,583
- I'M SURE YOU KNOW
MORE THAN I DO.

277
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,416
I CAN DRIVE 'EM
BUT NOT FIX 'EM.

278
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,291
I CAN'T GET IT STARTED. I TURN
THE KEY BUT NOTHING HAPPENS.

279
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,208
- I'M NOT PROMISIN' ANYTHING,

280
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,916
BUT I'LL TAKE A
LOOK AT IT FOR YA.

281
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,125
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

282
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,250
- IF I WERE TO GUESS IT'S
SOMETHING WITH THE ELECTRICAL.

283
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,541
LET'S SEE HERE.

284
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,458
- AN S-THIRTEEN.

285
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,375
SPEED STARS.

286
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,708
- OW!

287
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,166
- SO WHAT DO YA THINK?

288
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,375
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE I'VE BEEN

289
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:01,250
THIS CLOSE TO A WOMAN
THAT WASN'T MY MOM!

290
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,875
I THINK MY HEART'S
GONNA EXPLODE!

291
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,666
SHE'S SO FRIGGIN' CUTE!

292
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,625
SHE SMELLS AMAZING!

293
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:18,458
I NEVER KNEW THE SCENT OF A
GIRL COULD DRIVE ME THIS WILD!

294
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:24,333
OH, NO, I'M ALL SWEATY!
I HOPE I DON'T STINK!

295
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,666
- OKAY, I THINK I GOT IT.
GO AHEAD AND CRANK HER UP.

296
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,000
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

297
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,333
- ( engine starting )

298
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,958
- SWEET.

299
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,083
- IT'S WORKING!
YOU FIXED IT! WOW!

300
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,583
I'M SO GLAD YOU STOPPED!
THANK YOU. I OWE YOU ONE.

301
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,750
- NO, FORGET ABOUT IT.
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL, REALLY.

302
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,833
- THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

303
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,500
YOU KNOW. I'VE ALWAYS
HAD A THING FOR GUYS

304
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,000
WHO ARE GOOD AT FIXING THINGS.

305
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,541
I HAVE TO RUN, BUT I'D LOVE TO
THANK YOU AGAIN SOMETIME.

306
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,250
MIND IF I GET YOUR NUMBER?

307
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,875
