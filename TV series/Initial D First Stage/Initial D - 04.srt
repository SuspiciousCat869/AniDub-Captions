79
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,458

00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,916
YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL SICK
JUST LOOKING AT YOU.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,708

WE GOT A REGULAR STREET CAR
RUNNING UP YOUR WAY.

88
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,833
IT JUST PASSED US.

89
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,583
YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE TO
PASS THIS GUY DURING THE RACE.

90
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,666
SHOULD WE WAIT
'TIL IT REACHES THE TOP?

91
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,000
- IT'S A PUBLIC ROAD.
WHAT'S HE THINK IS GONNA HAPPEN?

92
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,416
PEOPLE ARE GONNA USE IT.

93
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,333
SO WHO CARES? COME ON,
LET'S START THIS FREAKIN' SHOW

94
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,333
AND WE'LL BLOW RIGHT PAST
THIS YOKEL... DAMN.

95
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,916
- NOT YET. CAN YOU
CALL BACK DOWN THERE

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,625
AND ASK HIM WHAT THE
MAKE OF THAT CAR WAS?

97
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,750
- HEY, WHAT WAS THE MAKE OF
THE CAR THAT JUST PASSED YOU?

98
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,000
- NOT SURE.
IT WENT BY PRETTY FAST,

99
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,916
BUT I DID NOTICE IT HAD
SOME FLIP-UP HEADLIGHTS.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,125
MAYBE AN EIGHT-SIX.
LIKE A TRUENO?

101
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,875
- GIMME THAT. THAT EIGHT-SIX
YOU SAW. WHAT COLOR WAS IT?

102
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,375
- Spotter: WHAT COLOR?

103
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,750
I DUNNO WHY IT MATTERS
SO MUCH TO YOU GUYS.

104
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,166
BUT IT WAS BLACK AND WHITE.

105
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,166
YEAH, A PANDA TRUENO.

106
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,750
- IT'S HIM.

107
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,833
- ( chuckling ) LIKE A LAMB

108
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,083
TO THE SLAUGHTER. I CAN'T
BELIEVE HE SHOWED UP.

109
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,083
- WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?
SHOULD WE START ANYWAY?

110
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,625
- LET'S JUST HOLD OFF
FOR A MINUTE,

111
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,750
WAIT UNTIL THAT EIGHT-SIX
FINALLY GETS HERE.

112
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,625
IF I RACE TONIGHT, IT WON'T
BE AGAINST THE DUMPY ONE-EIGHTY

113
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,541
WITH THE SWEATING MORON
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

114
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,041
MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

115
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,958
- IT DOES.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

116
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,166
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK, DUDE.
YOU CAN MOVE YOUR CAR.

117
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,500
- OH, THANK GOD.
IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME.

118
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,041
- WHAT'S YOUR DEAL, DUDE? YOU
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO CRY.

119
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,958
- DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE NOT RELIEVED, TOO!

120
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:56,083
- OF COURSE I'M RELIEVED. THIS
GUY ACTUALLY CAME THROUGH FOR US

121
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,625
SO WE'D BE ABLE TO
PROTECT THE PRIDE

WHICH IS MORE THAN I
COULD HOPE FOR.

124
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,458
I ALMOST DON'T EVEN CARE

- I WAS JUST THINKIN'.
HE'S GOT GOOD TECHNIQUE.

146
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,291

WAS A HELLUVA NICE TOUCH.

- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

150
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,416
TO ME, IT LOOKED LIKE ANY OTHER

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,833
WITH AN IDIOT BEHIND THE WHEEL.

00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,375
BUT WHEN YOU DO, YOU CAN TELL
BY THE AURA COMIN' OFF THE CAR.

155
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:33,250
RYOSUKE'S DRIVING, HIS CAR,
IT'S GOT THAT KIND OF AURA.

156
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,125
HIS KID BROTHER KEISUKE'S AURA
ISN'T AS STRONG BY A LONG SHOT.

157
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:41,125
BUT THAT EIGHT-SIX HAS
SOMETHING FIERCE COMING OFF IT.

158
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,083
IF HE'S UP HERE REPRESENTIN'
AKINA, THEN I DUNNO.

159
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,875
I'D SAY THE WINNER'S
A CRAPSHOOT AT THIS POINT.

160
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,833
- ♪ RUNNING LIKE
A BOMB IN THE AIR ♪

161
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,916
- ALMOST HERE.

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,458
THE FASTEST MAN TO EVER
RUN AKINA'S DOWNHILL

163
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,250
AND HE'S BACKING US TONIGHT.

164
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,333
THE MAN
WHO INVENTED TECHNIQUE!

165
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,666
TIME TO SHOW THOSE TAKAHASHI
BROTHERS THE REAL STRENGTH

166
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,750
THAT AKINA'S PACKIN'.

167
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,291
- Keisuke: HURRY UP, EIGHT-SIX.

168
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,291
I WANNA SEE THE GOON THAT GETS
OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT...

169
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,291
MAN, I HAVEN'T BEEN
THIS EXCITED TO RACE

170
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,083
SINCE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

171
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,375
- YOU'VE KEPT US
WAITING FOR A WHILE.

172
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,125
BUT DON'T THINK I'LL FALL
FOR A ROOKIE TACTIC LIKE THAT.

173
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,791
I'VE GOT MY EYE ON YOU.

174
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,250
- HERE IT COMES!

175
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,041
- Man 1: COME ON,
GIVE THE GUY SOME ROOM.

176
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,416
HE CAN'T RACE UNLESS
HE CAN FIND THE STARTING LINE!

177
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,291
- Man 2: WHAT'S THAT CAR
DOING HERE?

178
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,500
- THAT'S THE CAR
THEY BEEN WAITIN' ON?

179
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,916
- BUT IT'S JUST SOME
CRAPPY EIGHT-SIX?

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,416
- THIS SUCKS! WHERE DID ALL
THESE PEOPLE SWARM IN FROM?

181
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,916
THIS IS WHY
I DON'T GO TO CONCERTS.

182
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,416
- ( engine revving )

183
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,208
DO YA MIND,
I'M TRYIN' TO GET THROUGH!

184
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,375
HEY, THAT LOOKS
JUST LIKE TAKUMI'S EIGHT-SIX.

185
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,708
- TAKUMI?

186
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,625
- WHOA! IT IS HIM!

187
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,958
- THIS IS THE GUY?

188
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,125
- ( man reading )

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,416
- Initial D!

190
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,708
- TAKUMI!
WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON?

191
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,583
WHERE'S YOUR DAD?
WHY'RE YOU HERE?

192
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,333
- UH, THAT'S A LOTTA QUESTIONS.
BUT MY DAD IS BACK AT THE HOUSE.

193
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,166
- THANKS FOR BRINGING
THAT CAR UP THE MOUNTAIN,

194
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,458
BUT WITHOUT YOUR FATHER BEHIND
THE WHEEL, IT'S USELESS!

195
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,625
- YOU SAID I DIDN'T
HAVE TO DRIVE ANYMORE.

196
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,916
YOU AREN'T GONNA GO BACK
ON YOUR WORD, ARE YOU?

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,791
- MAN, I KNEW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME UP HERE.

198
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,041
DAMMIT, MY OLD MAN CAN REALLY
PISS ME OFF SOMETIMES.

199
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,916
- DID YOUR FATHER
SAY ANYTHING TO YOU, MAN?

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,750
DID HE GIVE YOU
ANY ADVICE AT ALL?

201
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,625
- ALL HE SAID WAS TO
COME UP TO AKINA TONIGHT,

202
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,416
FIND SOME PUNK
WHO DROVE AN FD

203
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,958
AND CLAIMS TO BE
THE FASTEST IN AKAGI

204
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,416
AND BEAT HIM ON THE DOWNHILL.

205
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,958
- WHAT?

206
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,458
HE SAID YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO DRIVE

207
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,291
AGAINST THIS
GUY IN THE FD?

208
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,416
- YEAH
- CAN YOU BEAT HIM?

209
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,875
IT'S THAT GUY,
KEISUKE TAKAHASHI.

210
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,833
- I DUNNO. WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY

211
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,458
UNTIL HE AND I GET ON THE
ROAD TOGETHER.

212
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,041
BUT IF IT MATTERS, I HAVE
ALREADY BEATEN HIM ONCE BEFORE.

213
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,375
- YOU RACED KEISUKE TAKAHASHI?
BUT...

214
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,500
- A FULL TANK OF GAS
IS RIDING ON THIS SO...

215
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,416
IF YOU LET ME OUT THERE,
I GUARANTEE I'LL BEAT THIS GUY.

216
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,250
- ( Men gasp )

217
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,833
- EXCUSE ME, PARDON ME.
COMIN' THROUGH, SORRY, GUYS.

218
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,791
TAKUMI! YOU IDIOT!

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,083
- ( groaning ) DUDE.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?

220
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,041
- I'M USED TO YOU ACTING STUPID,
BUT THIS TAKES THE CAKE.

221
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,541
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY IT,

222
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,583
BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL REALLY
EMBARRASSED FOR YOU RIGHT NOW!

223
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,583
MOVE YOUR CAR
OFF THE STARTING LINE!

224
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,625
DON'T SCREW THIS UP! GET IN
THAT EIGHT-SIX AND MOVE IT!

225
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,125
- ITSUKI CALM DOWN.
GET OFF HIS CASE.

226
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,500
- IKETANI! I'M SORRY.
BUT YOU KNOW TAKUMI.

227
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,000
HE CAN JUST BE
SO DUMB SOMETIMES.

228
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,416
DON'T BLAME HIM
FOR BEING SLOW,

229
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,333
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.
HE'S JUST LIKE THAT.

230
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,333
PLEASE FORGIVE HIM!

231
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,125
- TAKUMI. BY ANY CHANCE, WHEN
YOU WORK WITH YOUR FATHER,

232
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,625
DO YOU RUN AROUND DELIVERING
THE TOFU IN THIS CAR?

233
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,083
LIKE IN THE MORNINGS
TO THE HOTELS?

234
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,958
- NOWADAYS,
I DO ALL THE DELIVERIES.

235
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,500
I HAVE FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

236
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,375
- YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING
FOR FIVE YEARS?

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,666
I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE. ALL RIGHT.

238
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,458
TAKUMI. I'M GONNA
GO OUT ON A LIMB

239
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,000
AND PUT YOU IN THE LEAD
ON THE DOWNHILL.

240
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,041
- THAT KNOCK ON THE HEAD MUST'VE
BRUISED YOUR BRAIN, IKETANI.

241
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,166
IF YOU PUT A ROOKIE DRIVER
LIKE TAKUMI IN A BATTLE

242
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,708
ON THE AKINA DOWNHILL,

243
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,041
WE'LL BE LUCKY IF HE DOESN'T
FLIP HIS RIDE INTO THE CROWD!

244
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,500
- DON'T WORRY, ITSUKI.

245
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,416
JUST GET OUT OF THE WAY AND
WATCH THIS BAD BOY DRIVE.

246
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,500
I WANNA THANK YOU
FOR COMING UP HERE.

247
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,708
MEANS A LOT.
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU.

248
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,750
- COOL.

249
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,625
- SORRY FOR THE DELAY.
WE'RE READY.

250
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,291
- GOOD. I'M NOT
A BIG FAN OF WAITING.

251
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:24,250
YOU SEEM KINDA YOUNG. REAL
YOUNG. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

252
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,583
- IT'S TAKUMI,
TAKUMI FUJIWARA.

253
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,750
- OKAY, I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER
THAT. I'M KEISUKE TAKAHASHI.

254
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,041
AND I AM NOT GONNA MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE.

255
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,583
- YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

256
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,125
IT'S STUPID TO RACE
AN EIGHT-SIX AGAINST AN FD.

257
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,875
- THE DIFFERENCE
IN HORSEPOWER IS HUGE!

258
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,708
NOT TO MENTION THE FD IS THE
BEST DOMESTIC CORNERING CAR

259
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,041
ON THE MARKET.

260
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,750
THE EIGHT-SIX IS OUTCLASSED
IN THE STRAIGHTAWAYS

261
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,833
AND THE CORNERS.

262
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,708
WE'RE SCREWED
ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT!

263
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,708
- WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
HAVE FAITH IN OUR FRIEND.

264
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,916
- OKAY, STARTING
FOR REAL THIS TIME.

265
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,416
- Spotter 1: ROGER!
- Spotter 2: ROGER!

266
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,583
- ALL RIGHT! WE'RE GONNA START
ON THE COUNT OF TEN!

267
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,083
- ( engines revving )

268
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,583
- NINE! EIGHT! SEVEN!

269
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,541
SIX! FIVE! FOUR!

270
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,916
THREE! TWO! ONE! GO!

271
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,208
- Man: KEISUKE'S FD
IS ONE FAST MACHINE!

272
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,458
350 HORSES ARE NO JOKE.
AND HIS SHIFTING IS PERFECT.

273
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,083
- I WOULDN'T EVEN CALL
IT A COMPARISON

274
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,500
AGAINST THAT PANDA BEAR.

275
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,041
AT FULL SPEED THE
EIGHT-SIX LOOKED LIKE

276
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,041
IT WAS TREADING WATER.

277
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,875
- OH. NO.

278
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:10,416
- Ryosuke: THE EIGHT-SIX HAS
150 HORSEPOWER ON THE HIGH END.

279
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,416
LOWER COMING OFF THE LINE.

280
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,250
IT DOESN'T QUITE SEEM TO BE
THE MONSTER KEISUKE CLAIMED.

281
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,083
THE REASON WHY
IT CAN SHIFT SO FAST

282
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,875
IS THAT IT HAS TRANNY GEARS
FOR A RALLY CAR RACE.

283
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,666
THAT'S PERFECTLY SUITED FOR
ALL THE TIGHT HAIRPIN TURNS

284
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,041
ON AKINA.

285
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,833
STILL, THERE'S NO REASON I CAN
THINK OF THAT KEISUKE'S FD

286
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,083
WOULD BE BEAT OUT BY IT.

287
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,750
UNLESS THE MONSTER ISN'T UNDER
THE HOOD OF THE EIGHT-SIX,

288
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,333
BUT BEHIND THE WHEEL.

289
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,125
- IT'S GO TIME.

290
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,416
I DON'T LIKE USING THE
STRAIGHTAWAYS TO PULL AHEAD,

291
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,250
BUT THIS IS A TIMED RUN.

292
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:54,083
AFTER THIS, I WON'T SEE THAT
EIGHT-SIX IN MY REARVIEW AGAIN.

THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

299
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,875
THE EIGHT-SIX'S
LINE IS UNREAL!

I HAD NO IDEA HIS DAD
WAS A STREET RACER,

332
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,125
MUCH LESS LIKE THE BEST
ONE EVER FROM HERE.

333

GUY A COUPLE TIMES,

335
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,375
BUT HE SEEMED PRETTY NORMAL.

336
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,208
WELL, FOR A JADED OLD GUY
WHO RUNS A TOFU SHOP, I GUESS.

00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,083
- JUST SHOWS YA REALLY CAN'T
TELL MUCH ABOUT SOMEONE

BY HOW THEY LOOK.

339
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,250
MR. TACHIBANA TOLD ME THAT
HE'S STILL THE FASTEST

340
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,208
ON THE DOWNHILL IN AKINA THOUGH.

341
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,541
- ( moans )

342
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,750
- I SAY THAT IF TAKUMI'S DAD
SENT HIM DOWN HERE,

343
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,916
WE JUST NEED TO TRUST THAT
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

344
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
BESIDES, HE'S OUR PAL
AND HE NEEDS OUR SUPPORT.

345
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,875
- LOOK, ANYTHING'S BETTER
THAN IF I WAS OUT THERE

346
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,750
ON THE BLACKTOP.

347
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,291
- MAYBE NOT.

348
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,083
JUST 'CAUSE HIS DAD'S FAST, THAT
DOESN'T MEAN TAKUMI WILL BE!

349
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,666
- ( all agreeing )

350
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,750
- TAKUMI TOLD ME THAT HE
ALREADY BEAT KEISUKE ONCE

351
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,166
BEFORE HE CAME OUT HERE TONIGHT,

352
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,625
SO I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

353

OUR STUPID OL' TAKUMI BEAT
KEISUKE TAKAHASHI?

356
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,250
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

357
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,250
LAST WEEK, TAKUMI DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT AN EIGHT-SIX WAS.

358
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,333
SERIOUSLY! HE DOESN'T KNOW
SQUAT ABOUT RACING.

359
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,666
HOW'D HE BEAT KEISUKE?

360
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,291
- ( tires screeching )

361
