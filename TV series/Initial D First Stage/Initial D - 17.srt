- Iketani: COME ON, TAKUMI.

16
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,375
THERE'S NOT A CHANCE
I COULD BRING THIS UP

17
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,166
IN FRONT OF ANY
OF THE OTHER FELLAS.

18
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,541
BUT I KNEW IF I SAT DOWN
AND EXPLAINED IT TO YOU

19
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,875
THAT YOU'D UNDERSTAND
WHERE I'M COMING FROM.

20
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,250
- YEAH. BUT I DON'T
HAVE TO LIKE IT.

21
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,083
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT CHICK
BUGS ME.

22
00:01:56,166 --> 00:02:00,916
- I KNOW. BUT DON'T BE ANGRY
AT MAKO FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,666
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S LIKE.

24
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,958
- I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
THINK YOU HAVE TO DEFEND HER.

25
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,083
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
OWE HER ANYTHING.

26
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,083
SHE'S NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND
IS SHE?

27
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,333
- I'M BEGGING YOU.
PLEASE DO THIS!

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,416
- Itsuki: SO HEY, TAKUMI.

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,208
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T DRIVEN
ANY OTHER PASSES BESIDES AKINA,

30
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,250
BUT I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU
THOUGHT OF THIS ONE HERE?

31
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,666
SO TELL ME, COULD
YOU RACE HERE OR WHAT?

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,166
- I AM TELLING YOU, I DON'T
KNOW, I'D HAVE TO TRY IT FIRST.

33
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,750
FINE, YOU WIN.
I'LL RACE HER.

34
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,416
- YOU WILL? DUDE,
YOU'RE THE GREATEST!

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,750
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU AND
HER GOT GOING ON THE SIDE,

36
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,291
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
EXPECT TO GET OUT OF THIS,

37
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,833
BUT IT BETTER BE
WORTH MY EFFORT.

38
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,416
- OH, IT IS.

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,291
THEN I'LL GO OUT TO USUI.
AND I'LL TAKE THE EIGHT-SIX.

40
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,958
- YOU GOTTA BE MESSING
WITH MY HEAD, KENJI!

41
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,541
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT TAKUMI
WOULD HAVE AGREED TO RACE

42
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,000
AGAINST USUI'S SIL-EIGHTY!

43
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,083
THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF CRAZY!

44
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,875
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

45
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,791
- IT ISN'T LIKE HIM TO RUN OFF
TO ANOTHER PASS

46
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,833
AND HAVE A THROW-DOWN
WITH THE LOCALS THERE.

47
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,916
HE'S MORE OF A HOMEBODY.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,083
YOU HEAR ANYTHING
ABOUT HOW IKETANI

49
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,416
MIGHT'VE TALKED HIM
INTO DOING IT?

50
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,416
- BEATS THE LIVING'
CRAP OUTTA ME.

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,458
IKETANI WON'T GO INTO
ANY DETAIL ABOUT IT,

52
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,541
SO I'VE BEEN JUST LEFT TO
MY IMAGINATION.

53
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,791
YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS
BEFORE THOUGH.

54
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,166
REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID
WOULD PROBABLY HAPPEN

55
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,916
IF TAKUMI RACED AT ANOTHER PASS?

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,375
- YEAH.

57
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,125
- MAYBE IKETANI'S WANTING TO
SEE THAT BUSINESS GO DOWN.

58
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,708
CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF HIM.

59
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,125
- BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
RACE THE SIL-EIGHTY

60
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,291
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

61
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,875
THAT'S NUTS. HE NEEDS
TO WORK UP TO HER.

62
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,625
- TAKUMI'S RACING
IN USUI, IS HE?

63
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,458
- YEAH, IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

64
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,791
SO. THIS SIL-EIGHTY'S
GOOD ENOUGH

65
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,208
TO TAKE HIM ON HEAD TO HEAD?

66
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,416
- SHE'S BETTER THAN GOOD,
SHE'S A ROAD WARRIOR, MAN!

67
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,708
I WATCHED HER DRIFT
LEFT AND RIGHT,

68
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,125
FAKE MOVES ON A NARROW COURSE.

69
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,583
I THINK HE'S BIT OFF MORE THAN
HE CAN CHEW THIS TIME.

70
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,375
TAKUMI WAS WITH US. HE SAW
HER BLISTER UP THOSE TIRES.

71
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,875
HE KNOWS JUST HOW MUCH
OF A MONSTER SHE IS.

72
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,666
- SO WHAT?
HE'LL DESTROY THIS CHICK!

73
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,500
- I ENVY YOUR SIMPLE MIND.
GOT THE MEMORY OF A GOLDFISH.

74
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,375
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
THAT GAS PUMPER

75
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,333
TOLD US NO LOCAL HAD
EVER BEATEN HER?

76
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,500
- MAYBE THAT'S WHY THIS TIME.

77
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,750
IT ISN'T ABOUT WINNING
OR LOSING TO TAKUMI.

78
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,541
MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING MORE.

79
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,041
- WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
MORE IMPORTANT THAN WINNING?

80
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,666
- DAMMIT. OUT OF SMOKES
AGAIN. GUESS IT'S TIME

81
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,541
TO TAKE THE EIGHT-SIX
OUT FOR A LITTLE SPIN.

82
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,500
WHAT IN THE HOLY HELL?

83
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,750
MY EIGHT-SIX HAS BEEN
TURNED INTO AN EIGHT-FIVE.

84
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,333
- ( chuckling ) YOUR DAD MUST BE
SOILING HIS DRAWERS RIGHT NOW.

85
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,916
HIS EIGHT-SIX MAGICALLY
TRANSFORMING INTO AN EIGHT-FIVE.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,708
I BET IT BLEW
HIS FREAKING MIND!

87
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,500
- Kenji: HEY, IKETANI. I KINDA
GOTTA ASK YOU A QUESTION.

88
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,958
- WHAT IS IT?

89
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,791
I JUST... I WAS WONDERING
WHICH SIDE OF THE RACE

90
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,083
YOU WERE FALLING ON.

91
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,875
- WHAT DO YOU
MEAN, WHICH SIDE?

92
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,875
I'M NOT MAKING
THOSE KINDS OF CALLS.

93
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,250
ALL I DID WAS COORDINATE
THE RACE. OKAY?

94
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,583
- AM I REALLY
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT?

95
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,333
WHAT ABOUT TAKUMI?
ISN'T HE YOUR FRIEND FIRST?

96
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,125
'CAUSE IF YOU ASK
ME IT KINDA SEEMS LIKE

97
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,458
YOU'RE THROWING HIM
ON THE COALS

98
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,250
JUST TO LOOK GOOD TO THIS
CHICK YOU'RE DIGGING ON.

99
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,333
- DUDE,
THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.

100
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,583
- OH, YOU THINK SO?

101
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,833
THEN YOU MUST ALSO THINK
THAT TAKUMI ACTUALLY HAS

102
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,166
A CHANCE OF WINNING THIS RACE

103
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,625
INSTEAD OF LEAVING WITH A
MARK IN THE LOSS COLUMN.

104
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,708
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU GOT
MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THAT PAL.

105
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,583
TOO CLOSE TO HOME?

106
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,666
UH... I...

107
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,083
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PRAYER. THE
ONLY COURSE HE KNOWS IS AKINA.

108
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,625
AND USUI IS AN ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE COURSE

109
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,916
FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE DRIVEN
IT FOR YEARS,

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,750
SO YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT FIRST TIMERS.

111
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,041
I KNOW HE'S UNREAL WITH
HIS TECHNIQUE, BUT COME ON,

112
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,166
THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER TO
EVERY WIN ON EVERY COURSE

113
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,416
IN THE COUNTRY IS IT?

114
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,541
HE'S NEVER EVEN DRIVEN
ON THIS PASS, DUDE.

115
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,791
TAKUMI'S NOT A SUPERHERO,
AND WITHOUT A SINGLE PRACTICE.

116
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,916
THERE'S NO CHANCE HE'LL BE
ABLE TO HANDLE THIS COURSE.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,208
EVEN IN YOUR LITTLE LOVE FOG,

118
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,458
YOU HAD TO HAVE PUT
THAT TOGETHER.

119
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,416
- BUT. I CAN'T...

120
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,958
- I GET IT. DUDES LOSE
IT WHEN THEY FIND A CHICK

121
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,625
THEY DIG LIKE THIS.

122
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,333
- I WANT MY LAST RACE
TO BE SPECIAL,

123
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,666
SOMETHING
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

124
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,000
I WANNA RACE THE EIGHT-SIX
HERE ON MY HOME TURF.

125
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,416
- YOU LIKE HER. FINE.

126
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,791
BUT DON'T SELL OUT
YOUR FRIENDS FOR A GIRL.

127
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,625
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
HOW TAKUMI CAME TO YOUR RESCUE

128
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,625
AND DEFENDED OUR COURSE?

129
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,708
IT'S CAUSE OF THAT HE GOT TO
BE THE PRIDE OF MOUNT AKINA.

130
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,333
YOU BETTER CUT OUT
THIS BS, CAUSE...

131
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:19,000
MAN, IF YOU DON'T,
THIS FRIENDSHIP IS OVER.

132
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,958
- I KNOW IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT, KENJI.

133
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,375
- I'M SORRY. I KEEP THINGS
BOTTLED UP SOMETIMES.

134
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,875
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT ALL OF
THIS TO YOU, LIKE, FOREVER AGO,

135
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:50,083
I REALIZE THAT. BUT ANYWAY,
I JUST NEEDED TO LET YOU KNOW.

136
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,625
- YEAH, I STILL
DON'T GET IT, MAKO.

137
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,000
WHY YOU WOULD EVER
QUIT RACING?

138
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,083
- IT WAS FUN.

139
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,750
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN WE
FIRST STARTED RACING TOGETHER

140
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,625
I HAD A REALLY AMAZING TIME.

141
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,083
BACK WHEN ALL WE EVER WANTED
WAS TO BE THE FASTEST RACERS

142
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,666
IN THIS AREA.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,333
- BUT YOU ARE STILL HAVING FUN.
YOU ARE, AREN'T YOU?

144
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,750
- I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

145
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:19,208
I'M NOT AS INTO THIS AS I USED
TO BE. I DON'T KNOW WHY.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,458
WISH I DID.

147
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:26,958
I GUESS... I GUESS I FEEL LIKE
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO MOVE ON.

148
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,375
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT I'VE DONE ENOUGH.

149
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,291
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

150
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,875
SORRY, BUT I CAN'T GET ON BOARD

151
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,833
WITH THIS WHOLE
QUITTING BUSINESS.

152
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,458
- I WANNA HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

153
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,083
NOTHING SPECIAL, JUST A NORMAL
RELATIONSHIP, YOU KNOW?

154
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,958
- YOU CAN RACE
AND HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

155
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,833
IT'S NOT SOME GREAT
UNACHIEVABLE GOAL.

156
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,333
- NO, I CAN'T. I COULD TRY
ALL DAY BUT I DON'T THINK

157
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,583
I COULD MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND.

158
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,666
- OKAY. THIS ISN'T SOME
HYPOTHETICAL GUY, IS IT?

159
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,708
- ( yawning )
- ( gasps )

160
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,750
IF I'M BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

161
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,958
I'VE HAD SOMEONE IN MIND
FOR A WHILE NOW.

162
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,291
- OH? YOU DON'T SAY.

163
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,291
YOU'RE JUST SO GOOD
AT KEEPING SECRETS

164
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,250
I NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN.

165
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,791
- WELL, UH.

166
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,208
THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU COULD
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS GUY.

167
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,791
HE'S NOT EXACTLY
FROM AROUND HERE.

168
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,416
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I'VE BEEN
ADMIRING HIM FROM AFAR.

169
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,291
- OH, MAKO. THIS INNOCENT
LITTLE GIRL ROUTINE OF YOURS

170
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,416
IS GETTING KINDA OLD.

171
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,958
YOU'RE FREAKING 20.
SLUT IT UP SOME.

172
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,166
- BUT THAT ISN'T ME.
I LIKE THE WAY I AM.

173
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,875
I DON'T NEED THE INTIMACY
LIKE YOU DO.

174
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,416
- YOU SHOULD BE REALISTIC.

175
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,625
OR AT LEAST A LOT MORE
REALISTIC THAN THAT.

176
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,625
- YOU AND I HAVE SPENT
THE LAST TWO YEARS TOGETHER

177
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,875
PERFECTING AND HONING
OUR TECHNIQUE,

178
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,375
IT'S MEANT A LOT TO ME.

179
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,750
I THINK WE OWE OURSELVES ONE
LAST RACE BEFORE IT'S OVER.

180
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,833
- YOU MEAN LIKE A FINAL EXAM?

181
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,083
SOUNDS LIKE A DECENT
ENOUGH PLAN TO ME.

182
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,458
AS LONG AS WE GO UP
AGAINST A WORTHY OPPONENT.

183
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,875
- HE IS.

184
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,708
- THAT'S FINE. BUT LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING, MAKO.

185
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,833
IF WE'RE GONNA BE
RACING AT USUI PASS,

186
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,000
THEN WE HAVE TO WIN.

187
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,125
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO WE'RE UP AGAINST.

188
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,291
ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT
IS UNACCEPTABLE. PERIOD.

189
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,666
- I HEAR YA. WE DO THIS,

190
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,750
AND WE DON'T LET
ANYTHING STAND IN OUR WAY.

191
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,000
- EVEN IF WE'RE UP AGAINST
THE EIGHT-SIX.

192
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,958
- RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY.

193
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,125
- IF YOU'RE NOT INTO THIS,

194
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,958
THERE'S NO USE THROWING YOUR
REPUTATION ON THE LINE TO RACE.

195
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,916
IKETANI AND ME WILL LET THEM
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,458
- YOU DUDES SHOULD TURN AROUND
AND HEAD BACK.

197
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:00,583
- GET OUTTA HERE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

198
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,333
- Kenji: HE'S SERIOUS MAN.

199
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:06,041
- NOT SO FAST, GUYS. I'M...
I'M NOT GOING BACK.

200
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,750
- ( gasping ) YOU'RE NOT?

201
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,291
- NO, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO STICK AROUND.

202
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,541
I JUST CAN'T LEAVE
UNTIL I RACE THIS CHICK.

203
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,416
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
I CAME OUT HERE TO BEGIN WITH.

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,625
- TAKUMI.

205
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,250
- BUT DUDE, YOU SAW
WHAT MAKO IS CAPABLE OF.

206
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,041
SHE'LL SMOKE YOU
ON HER HOME COURSE.

207
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,416
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

208
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,916
LOOK, YOU SHOULD FACE IT,
BRO. SHE'S BETTER THAN YOU.

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,416
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.
I ALSO KNOW THIS RACE

210
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,041
ISN'T ABOUT WINNING
OR LOSING ANYMORE.

211
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,541
- HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT? YOU
DRIVE THE EIGHT-SIX OF AKINA!

212
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,416
YOU'RE FAMOUS NOW! HAVE
SOME PRIDE FOR GOD'S SAKE.

213
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,333
THIS IS YOUR LEGEND
ON THE LINE.

214
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,875
- AND I'M SUPPOSED TO CARE
WHAT A BUNCH OF STRANGERS

215
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:45,916
THINK ABOUT ME?

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,750
LOOK, I WON A FEW RACES.
LOCAL RACES.

217
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,666
THEN THE RUMORS
FLEW AROUND LIKE CRAZY,

218
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,583
MADE ME SOUND LIKE I WAS A
BIGGER DEAL THAN I REALLY AM.

219
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,416
I THINK I'D FEEL A LOT
BETTER ABOUT DRIVING

220
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,833
IF PEOPLE WOULD STOP TALKING
ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME.

221
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,208
- FOR REAL?
- YOU SERIOUS?

222
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,750
I'M GONNA DO THIS.
I WANNA ATTACK A NEW PASS.

00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,375
YOU NEED TO AVOID
WIDE-ANGLE DRIFTS

HEY, I GOT A GREAT IDEA.

271

USUI PASS IS NARROW, RIGHT?

272
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,958
AND THERE AREN'T ANY
STRAIGHT LINES. SO THEN...

273
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,916
YOU JUST BLOW PAST HER,
AND STAY THERE.

274

- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

275
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,416

278
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,458

IT WOULDN'T BE A FAIR RACE.

279
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,041
YOU KNOW THAT, MAN.

280
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,958
- OKAY. BUT IF YOU LET HER GET
AHEAD OF YOU THIS THING'S OVER.

281
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,125
- DUDE, I KNOW.

- ( groaning ) LOOK, WE NEED TO
COME UP WITH A PLAN TO WIN.

UBER FAMOUS, BIG, BAD EIGHT-SIX?

287
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,416
IS THIS LIKE A JOKE? HOW OLD
ARE YOU, LIKE SIX AND A HALF?

288
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,416
- IF YOU HAVE TO KNOW,
I'M EIGHTEEN.

289
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,458
- WHAT? COME ON.
HE'S IN HIGH SCHOOL.

290
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,750
- IT'S A TWO YEAR DIFFERENCE,
NOT LIKE THEY COULD BABYSIT HIM.

291
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,750
- AND BESIDES, THEY'RE CHICKS.

292

LET HIM WIN.

GOING HOME WITH JACK SQUAT.

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
PARAMETERS OF THE RACE.

295
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,416
ON THIS COURSE IT'S A
BAD IDEA FOR US TO START

296
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,958
SIDE-BY-SIDE OFF THE LINE

297
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,250
'CAUSE WHOEVER HAS A BETTER
START HAS THE CLEAR ADVANTAGE.

298
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,208
AND I DON'T WANNA ARGUE UNTIL
DAWN ONCE THE RACE IS CLOSED OUT

299
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,333
OR HAVE A STUPID REMATCH
BECAUSE SOMEONE THINKS

300
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,625
SOMEONE ELSE CHEATED
OR JUMPED THE GUN.

301
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,666
- CRAP, THERE GOES MY PLAN.

302
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,250
- THEN. WHAT DO WE DO?

303
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,000
- HOW ABOUT WE RUN A CAT AND
MOUSE RACE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN?

304
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,791
THEY'RE FUN.
IT'S BASICALLY A CHASE.

305
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,250
IF THE MOUSE GETS AWAY,
THE RACE IS OVER.

306
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,375
IF NOT, WE KEEP SWITCHING
POSITIONS UNTIL SOMEONE WINS.

307
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:36,666
THINK OF IT AS A 'SUDDEN DEATH,
DEATH MATCH.' COOL?

308
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,250
- YEAH, THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.

309
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,750
- SINCE WE'RE THE LOCALS HERE,
WE'RE GONNA LET YOU FELLAS

310
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,041
DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE

311
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,958
THE CAT OR THE
MOUSE FIRST, OKAY?

312
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,875
JUST MAKE THE CALL,
AND WE'LL GO.

313
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:52,708
- HUH.

314
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,583
WITH THIS KINDA SETUP,
I'M THINKING IT'LL BE BEST

315
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,958
IF YOU GO IN FRONT FIRST.

316
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,791
- HE'S RIGHT. 'CAUSE THERE'S
NO WAY THIS IS GONNA END

317
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,041
WITH JUST ONE RACE.

318
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,583
THAT WAY YOU AT LEAST
GET IN ONE PRACTICE RUN.

319
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,333
- THAT AND IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
TO LOSE IN THE SECOND RACE.

320
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,083
- I'LL BET YOU A TANK OF GAS
HE CHOOSES TO GO IN FRONT

321
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,583
ON THE FIRST RUN.

322
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,541
- ALL THAT MEANS IS THAT I'M
GONNA WIN THE SECOND RACE.

323
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,833
- I APPRECIATE THE ADVICE GUYS.
I HATE TO JUST IGNORE IT.

324
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,875
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
DOES MAKE SENSE.

325
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,375
BUT I DON'T THINK I
WANNA RUN IT LIKE THAT.

326
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,250
- I KNOW YOU'RE SLOW,
BUT THAT'S INSANE!

327
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,916
- I THINK I WANNA CHASE HER
ON THE FIRST RUN.

328
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,291
- Both: WHAT?

329
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,208
- YOU NEED TO THINK
THIS OVER, TAKUMI.

330
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,416
- SORRY, BUT THIS IS MY RACE
SO I'M GONNA RUN IT MY WAY.

331
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,125
- DUDE, HOLD UP.

332
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,958
- I'VE DECIDED TO CHASE FIRST.

333
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,666
- ( gasping )
YOU'RE GONNA WHAT NOW?

334
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,375
IS HE TRYING TO INSULT US
OR IS HE JUST PLAIN STUPID?

335
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,125
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL STILL SMOKE HIM.

336
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,333
- ( phone ringing )

337
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,083
- ( sighing ) OF COURSE.

338
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,458
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ME
COOKING DINNER.

339
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,083
HELLO. FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP.

340
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,666
- Yuuichi: HEY, BUNTA?

341
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,083
- IT'S YOU. I'M BUSY,
SO, JUST MAKE IT SNAPPY.

342
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,416
WHAT DO YOU NEED, PAL?

343
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,625
- LISTEN, I THOUGHT I SHOULD
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

344
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,541
IT'S ABOUT TAKUMI'S RACING.

345
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,333
- ARE WE GONNA LIGHT
THIS FUSE? LET'S GO!

346
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,666
- SO THE KID WENT UP TO USUI
FOR ANOTHER RACE. SO WHAT?

347
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,333
- SO WHAT? GREAT. THAT'S ALL YOU
CAN THINK TO SAY IS SO WHAT?

348
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,333
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR KID?

349
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,375
- NOT REALLY. I MEAN,
I THINK I RAISED HIM RIGHT.

350
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,333
- WE'LL KEEP IT PRETTY
SLOW AT FIRST

351
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,083
SO JUST STAY BEHIND US, OKAY?

352
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,958
AFTER THAT FIRST TURN, THOUGH,
HOLD ON TO YOUR PANTYHOSE,

353
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,833
'CAUSE WE'LL KICK IT UP
TO FULL THROTTLE.

354
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,708
THAT'LL BE WHERE
WE START THE RACE.

355
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,375
- SO THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?
THAT'S REALLY IT?

356
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,250
- YEAH, THAT'S IT. NOW, I'M
BUSY, SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,

357
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,958
STOP CALLING ME
ABOUT THIS NONSENSE.

358
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,500
- BUNTA? WHAT THE HELL?

359
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,250
- TAKUMI, I WAS AN IDIOT
TO ASK YOU TO DO THIS.

360
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,250
I REALIZE THAT NOW.

361
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,750
AND I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

362
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,250
SO, LOOK, I KNOW THE ONLY
REASON YOU AGREED TO THIS

363
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,666
IS TO SAVE MY EGO.

364
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,708
I'M REGRETTING IT NOW
MORE THAN YOU COULD EVEN KNOW.

365
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,041
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A JACKASS.

366
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,708
YOU'RE BEST RACER AKINA HAS,
MAYBE EVER.

367
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,666
YOU'RE THE PRIDE OF OUR REGION.

368
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,708
( sniffling ) IT WAS SUCH A HUGE
MISTAKE GETTING YOU OUT HERE.

369
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,375
I... I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU LOSE

370
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,041
BECAUSE OF MY STUPIDITY.

371
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,125
- QUIT SAYING HE'S GONNA LOSE!

372
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,000
- SO WHAT'S IT LIKE LIVING
IN COMPLETE DENIAL?

373
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,250
- IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
- YOU WUSS.

374
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,541
- IKETANI. YOU CAN QUIT
FREAKING OUT, OKAY?

375
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,333
I DECIDED TO BE THE CAT ON
THE FIRST RUN FOR A REASON.

376
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,958
I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE IF
I'M GONNA WIN THIS THING,

377
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,333
BUT I SURE AS ALL HELL DIDN'T
COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

378
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,291
TO LOSE. RIGHT?

379
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,916
- DO YOU HAVE
A PLAN OF ATTACK?

380
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,458
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN IT STARTS?

381
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,208
- I WOULDN'T CALL IT
A PLAN, EXACTLY.

382
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,833
BUT SOMETHING'S BOUNCING AROUND
IN MY HEAD. I DON'T KNOW.

383
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,375
I GUESS IT'S MORE
LIKE AN INSPIRATION.

384
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,250
- SHOOT, MAN, FILL US IN.
WHAT IS IT? HUH? TELL US!

385
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,833
- YEAH, IT SOUNDS AWESOME.

386
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,333
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT IT DOESN'T
MATTER HOW FAST THIS CHICK IS,

387
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,625
IT'S NOT LIKE HER CAR
CAN FLY OR ANYTHING.

388
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,833
SO IT'S AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD.

389
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,791
SHE'S ON FOUR WHEELS
JUST LIKE ME.

390
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,666
- ( all gasp )

391
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,333
THAT SAID. I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO TURN THESE CORNERS

392
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,958
AS FAST AND AS GOOD AS SHE CAN.

393
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,250
ESPECIALLY IF I KEEP
MY EYE ON HER MOVES.

394
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,250
HEY, SOUNDS LIKE I DO
HAVE A PLAN?

395
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,166
- HELL, YEAH! SWEET!

396
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,000
- SURE. I GUESS YOU HAVE
A POINT IN THEORY.

397
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,625
- YEAH, 'IN THEORY'
BUT IT'S CRAZY.

398
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,125
- Sayuki: LET'S ROLL OUT!

OKAY, ARE YOU READY? I WANT
THIS GUY KNOCKED OFF FAST.

402
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,875

415
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,791
AND THEY'RE ALREADY AT
FULL THROTTLE.

- THIS ROCKS.

420
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,291
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS THE FIRST
BATTLE WE'VE EVER SEEN

421
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,750
WHERE TAKUMI'S BEEN
AT A SERIOUS DISADVANTAGE.

422
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:21,291
- NO FEAR. NOT ME. 'CAUSE
I KNOW HE'S GONNA WIN!

423
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,583

WE'RE STREET RACERS

427
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:35,791
AND THIS IS OUR TURF.

00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,708
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T
LOSE HERE.

431
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,958
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ONCE MAKO QUITS RACING?

432
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,791
- Sayuki: WELL,
I'M NOT QUITTING!

433
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,000
- Mako: SAYUKI.

434
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,541
- Announcer: SO, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO RETIRE?

435
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,583

RACING AFTER MEN.

ARE ALL THE GOOD MEN ANYWAY,

438
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,541
HUH? WHERE ARE THEY?

439
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,125
