I GOTTA BE LOSIN' MY MIND!

18
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,458
- OK, GUYS,
THIS IS THE STRAIGHTAWAY

19
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,833
IN FRONT OF THE SKATING RINK.

20
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:11,375
THEY JUST FLEW BY! HE'S CHEWIN'
ON KEISUKE'S BUMPER!

21
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,500
KEISUKE'S FD HAS NEVER HAD
ANYONE KEEP UP WITH IT THIS FAR

22
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,666
OR THIS TIGHT!

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,125
- ( all gasping )

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,625
- OH, MAN, I'VE GOT GOOSEBUMPS.

25
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,166
- Spotter 1: THAT EIGHT-SIX IS
ONE AGGRESSIVE BEAST

26
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,250
ON THE ROAD.

27
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,541
IT WAS SOME KIND
OF KAMIKAZE TECHNIQUE.

28
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,083
THIS GUY'S GOT NO FEAR.

29
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,625
- I KNOW MY OLD MAN.

30
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,291
UNLESS I PASS THAT CAR, HE WON'T
ADMIT THAT I WON THIS RACE.

31
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,041
WHICH MEANS, I DON'T
HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF CHOICE.

32
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,416
GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO IT.

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,208
I MEAN I'VE GOT A FULL
TANK OF GAS RIDING ON THIS.

34
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,333
THE SETUP FOR THE OVERTAKE
IS GONNA BE SOMEWHERE

35
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,833
IN THE NEXT FIVE HAIRPIN TURNS.

36
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,541
- THIS SUCKS!

37
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,791
- ( engine revving )

38
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,250
- WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MY RIDE?
WHY'S MY FD FEELIN' SO SLOW?

39
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,750
WHAT CRAP TIMING.

40
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,083
I WONDER IF THE SECONDARY
TURBINE IS STILL WORKING?

41
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,083
- TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN HERE.
YOU READ ME?

42
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,083
- Boy 1: ( on walkie-talkie )
GOTCHA, RYOSUKE.

43
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,458
- PRETTY SOON THEY'RE
GONNA BE REACHING

44
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,625
THOSE FIVE CONSECUTIVE HAIRPINS.

45
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,458
I WANT THE PLAY
BY PLAY ON THAT.

46
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,166
GIVE ME AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU
CAN FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT.

47
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,750
- NO SWEAT. OKAY. OKAY.
THEY'RE GETTING CLOSE.

48
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,541
I CAN ALREADY HEAR
THEIR TIRES SQUEALIN'.

49
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,125
THEY'LL BE ON US IN NO TIME.

50
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,791
HERE THEY ARE! THE FD'S
LEADIN' THE EIGHT-SIX,

51
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,666
BUT THEY'RE TIGHT!

52
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,083
OH, THEY'RE ALL OVER EACH OTHER!

53
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,750
THE EIGHT-SIX IS KNOCKING OUT
SOME SICK MOVES!

54
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:40,583
IT DID A PERFECT BRAKING-DRIFT!
KEISUKE'S LOSIN' SERIOUS GROUND!

55
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,958
SWEET RECOVERY!

56
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,416
OH, HE'S CLOSER TO THE GUARDRAIL
THAN I'VE EVER SEEN!

57
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,708
GOIN' INTO THE
SECOND HAIRPIN NOW,

58
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,708
NOT A GAP BETWEEN
THE TWO OF 'EM!

59
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,833
( whooping ) THEY BOTH RECOVERED
AT THE SAME TIME!

60
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,458
THE FD SLIPPED A LITTLE
CLOSE TO THE OUTSIDE,

61
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,041
AND THE EIGHT-SIX IS-- WHOA!

62
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,791
- HE'S NOT BRAKING FOR THE NEXT
HAIRPIN. WHAT'S HE THINKING?

63
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,458
- Boy 1: ( on walkie-talkie )
OH. OH, THE EIGHT-SIX IS HEADING

64
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,791
STRAIGHT INTO THE CORNER, FAST.

65
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,708
REALLY FAST! IT'S LIKE HIS
FREAKIN' BRAKES ARE OUT!

66
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,583
- ( scraping )

67
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,166
- ( exclaims ) WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

68
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,708
- ( all gasping )

69
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,500
- Boy 1: HE PASSED
ON THE INSIDE.

70
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,083
HE MADE KEISUKE
LOOK LIKE A GRANDMA

71
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,833
DRIVING HOME FROM CHURCH.

72
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,458
- YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS.

73
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,083
WE ASKED FOR DETAILS, NOW TELL
US EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED!

74
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:47,083
- LOOK, DUDE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ELSE YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU.

75
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,416
ALL I KNOW IS A CAR SHOULDN'T
TURN LIKE THAT.

76
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,083
IT SHOULDN'T TURN
AT A SPEED FASTER

77
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,625
THAN THE TIRE'S GRIP WILL
LET IT, RIGHT?

78
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,083
BUT THE WAY THE EIGHT-SIX TURNED
WAS STRANGE.

79
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,500
LIKE A ROLLER COASTER.

80
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,250
HE EVEN MOVED THROUGH THAT
LINE ON THE INSIDE

81
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,750
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BAD.

82
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,583
I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT
THAT WAS ALL ABOUT.

83
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,500
IT MAKES NO FREAKIN' SENSE!

84
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,708
- I KNOW WHAT THE GUY DID.
NOT A HALF-BAD MOVE

85
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,916
FOR AN OLD EIGHT-SIX.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,333
IT'S RISKY, AND I BET THAT KID'S
THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO IT.

87
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,250
BELIEVE ME, YOU WON'T SEE
THAT TRICK AGAIN ANYWHERE

88
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,625
BUT MOUNT AKINA.

89
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,583
PROBABLY 'CAUSE THIS IS THE
ONLY PLACE YOU CAN FIND

90
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,625
A DRIVER THAT STUPID.

91
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,333
NOW I GOT SOMETHIN'
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

92
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,416
YOU MIGHT BE THE HOTTEST RACER
ON AKINA TONIGHT,

93
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,666
BUT SOON ENOUGH,
YOU'RE GONNA GET SMOKED.

94
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,583
BY ME, TAKESHI NAKAZATO
OF THE MYOGI NIGHT KIDS.

95
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,416
- Spotter 1: (on walkie-talkie)
FINISH LINE HERE!

96
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,916
I CAN HEAR THE ENGINES
GETTING CLOSE.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,041
THEY'RE RIGHT ON TOP OF US.

98
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,416
HERE THEY ARE.
WHO'S IN THE LEAD!

99
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,041

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!

100
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,416
KEISUKE'S PULLIN' UP THE REAR

101
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,583
BUT HE'S GOT TOO MUCH
GROUND TO COVER!

102
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,875

106
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,000
HOW'D I LET THAT HAPPEN?

107
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,375

THIS HAS GOTTA BE SOME KINDA
SCREWED UP NIGHTMARE!

120
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,375
HOW COULD I LOSE TWICE
TO THE SAME EIGHT-SIX?

121
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,291
- IF SOMEBODY AS DUMB AS TAKUMI
CAN BEAT KEISUKE,

122
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,750
THERE'S HOPE FOR ALL OF US!

123
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,375
- TOO COOL. DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER BEEN HAPPIER.

124
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:54,000
FEELS LIKE I'M GOING NUMB OR
MAYBE I'M JUST LOSING MY MIND.

125
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,916
- ( laughs ) NOPE, HE DID IT!

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
DON'T START CRYING
ON ME, IKETANI!

127
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,666
- I'M TRYIN' NOT TO, MAN,
BUT I'M HAPPY.

128
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,666
- YOU THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE
A FEW LESSONS FROM THE GUY?

129
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,666
WE COULD GET HIM
TO TEACH US DRIFT CONTROL

130
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,125
OR PICKING THE RIGHT LINE.

131
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,875
HOLD ON. LET'S PUT THE SPEED
STARS' STICKER ON HIS CAR.

132
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,541
- HEY! LET ME! LET ME!
I WANNA DO IT! CAN I?

133
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,708
- Iketani: COOL. THAT'S YOUR JOB
WHEN WE GET BACK.

134
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,291
ONLY 'CAUSE YOU BEGGED
LIKE A BITCH.

135
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,875
- TONIGHT WAS A CLEAR
LOSS FOR OUR TEAM.

136
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,625
LET'S OWN UP TO IT
WITH SOME CLASS.

137
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,541
- HOW ABOUT THE TIMED RUN FOR
THE UPHILL? WE STILL GOT THAT.

138
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,333
- THE UPHILL MEANS NOTHING
AT THIS POINT.

139
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,291
- BY TOMORROW, RUMORS ARE GOING
TO START SPREADING AROUND

140
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,166
ALL THE STREET
RACERS IN THE AREA.

141
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,833
IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE EVERYBODY KNOWS

142
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,583
THE UNDEFEATED REDSUNS LOST
TO AN EIGHT-SIX FROM AKINA.

143
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,750
- I GUESS THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO EVEN THE SCORE SOON.

144
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,166
AND WE'LL DO IT WITH MY FC.

00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,000
- I COULDN'T BE
HAPPIER THAT HE WON.

155
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,333
BUT I CAN'T SAY I'M
TOO SURPRISED.

156
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,208
THIS IS THE SPOT.

157
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,750
THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE
THAT PRICK PASSED ME.

158
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,083
I JUST DON'T GET IT, MAN.

159
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,250
HIS CAR SUCKS AT RIDING
THOSE INSIDE CORNERS.

160
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,916
HOW'D IT SLIP THROUGH
FASTER THAN MY FD?

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,541
JUST REMEMBERING IT
GETS UNDER MY SKIN.

162
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,000
I TELL YA, BRO, THIS GUY
HAS GOTTA BE SOME KINDA GHOST.

163
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,041
- HEY, KEISUKE,
TELL ME WHAT WENT DOWN

164
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,583
RIGHT WHEN HE PASSED YOU.

165
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,916
WAS THERE ANYTHING WEIRD
ABOUT THE WAY HE DID IT?

166
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,166
- COME TO THINK OF IT, I DID
HEAR A STRANGE SOUND.

167
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,291
LIKE SCRAPING.

168
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,833
A SCRAPING SOUND?

169
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:21,458
- ( chuckles ) I GET IT NOW...
- WHAT?

170
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,916
- SO DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
WHY YOU LOST?

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,666
BECAUSE I THINK
I HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

172
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,791
- INITIAL D!

173
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,458
- INITIAL D!

174
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,041
- HE MUST'VE USED THIS PART
OF THE ROAD RIGHT HERE.

175
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,458
- A DRAINAGE DITCH?

176
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,916
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,583
HE DROPPED HIS INSIDE TIRES
INTO THE DITCH ON PURPOSE.

178
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,750
BY HOOKING THE
EDGE OF THE ROAD,

179
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,125
HE RESISTED THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE.

180
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,666
THAT WAY IT WAS POSSIBLE
TO GAIN MORE CORNERING FORCE

181
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,458
THAN THE TIRES
COULD GRIP ON THEIR OWN.

182
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,916
IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE
AN AMATEURISH SOLUTION,

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,291
MAYBE EVEN
A LITTLE BIT RIDICULOUS.

184
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,458
AND IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING

185
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,583
THAT HE WOULD
HAVE FAILED MISERABLY

186
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,583
IF HE'D NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.

187
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,500
I ASSUME THAT HE PROBABLY
PRACTICES LIKE THIS

188
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,833
ALL THE TIME.

189
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,708
HE'D NEED YEARS OF
PRACTICE TO PULL THAT MOVE OFF

190
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,041
SO NONCHALANTLY DURING A RACE.

191
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,416
- THAT LITTLE PUNK!

192
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,458
- LOOK, PART OF
THE FUN OF RACING

193
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,583
IS THAT THIS KIND
OF THING HAPPEN.

194
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,416
AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

195
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,750
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN ABLE
TO GET EXCITED

196
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,333
ABOUT ANY OF OUR
POTENTIAL TARGETS.

197
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,583
WE'RE GOING TO CANCEL THE
EXPEDITION WE HAD PLANNED

198
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,416
FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

199
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,666
WE'RE NOT MOVING ON TO ANYTHING

200
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,291
UNTIL WE CAN LOCK DOWN A
COMPLETE VICTORY HERE.

201
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,791
I'M GOING TO BE THE ONE
TO BEAT THAT EIGHT-SIX.

202
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,083
"GREEN SHOPPING STREET"

203
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,416
- Yuuichi: YO, BUNTA!
YOU HERE? IT'S ME.

204
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,583
"CLOSED TODAY"

205
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,750
( sighs ) MAN, IT'S HOT.

206
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,416
- HEY, YUUICHI. PERFECT TIMING.

207
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,291
I HAVE A MEETING AT THE CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE I GOTTA GET TO.

208
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,500
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
CAN YOU GIVE ME A RIDE?

209
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,708
- COME ON.
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE TO YOU?

210
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,000
YOUR PERSONAL TAXI SERVICE?

211
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,166
- ( horns blaring )

212
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,583
- Yuuichi: I HEARD
TAKUMI REALLY KNOCKED IT

213
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,791
OUT OF THE PARK ON THE DOWNHILL.

214
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,791
IKETANI AND THE OTHERS
HAVE BEEN GIGGLING LIKE GIRLS.

215
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,750
- IT'S NOT LIKE HE MOVED
THE MOUNTAIN, YOU KNOW.

216
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,583
MAN, KIDS THESE DAYS ARE
IMPRESSED BY ALMOST ANYTHING.

217
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,083
- ( Yuuichi laughs )

218
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,125
- TAKUMI DOESN'T EVEN LIKE
DRIVING CARS. DID YOU KNOW THAT?

219
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,083
- YOU'RE YANKING MY CHAIN.
HE'S A TEENAGE BOY, RIGHT?

220
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,291
AND HE HAS INCREDIBLE TECHNIQUE
FOR SOMEONE HIS AGE.

221
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,750
- TO HIM, DRIVING HELPS OUT
WITH THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

222
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,958
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING GLAMOROUS
ABOUT IT.

223
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,125
I'VE FORCED HIM TO DO IT
SINCE HE WAS A KID.

224
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,458
WHAT'D YA EXPECT?

225
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,958
HE JUST CAN'T SEE
THE FUN IN IT.

226
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,583
- I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

227
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,541
- HE'S JUST CYNICAL
ABOUT DRIVING.

228
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,250
YOU KNOW,
TYPICAL REBEL TEENAGE BS.

229
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,375
BUT HE'LL HAVE TO GROW OUT
OF THAT SOONER OR LATER.

230
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,708
ALL HE NEEDS IS SOMETHING
TO GET HIS BLOOD BOILING,

231
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,333
AND THAT RACE LAST
NIGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

232
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,791
THE KICK IN THE PANTS HE NEEDS.

233
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,583
- SPEAKING OF WHICH, I ASSUME
HE TOOK THE EIGHT-SIX.

234
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,166
WHERE'D HE GO?

235
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,833
- NO IDEA.

236
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,791
BUT HE SCURRIED OFF SOMEWHERE
THIS MORNING IN A HURRY

237
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,083
AND IN A HELLUVA GOOD MOOD.

238
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,125
- ( chuckles )

239
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,541
( Natsuki giggling )

240
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,791
TAKUMI, YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

241
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,291
YOU'RE A GOOD DRIVER
A VERY GOOD ONE.

242
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,041
- OH. YOU THINK SO?

243
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,708
- TO TELL THE TRUTH,
USUALLY I GET CARSICK

244
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,416
WHEN I RIDE WITH SOMEONE.

245
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,833
SO I THOUGHT AHEAD THIS TIME

246
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,708
AND BROUGHT ALONG SOME
MEDICINE FOR THAT KINDA THING.

247
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,208
BUT I DIDN'T FEEL SICK ONE BIT

248
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,625
WHEN YOU WERE DRIVING US
OUT HERE. IT WAS COOL.

249
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,125
I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME

250
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,791
I RODE IN A CAR FOR
SUCH A LONG TIME

251
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,333
WITHOUT GETTING REALLY SICK.

252
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,083
- ARE YOU RIDING IN CARS A LOT
THESE DAYS?

253
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,208
- OH, NO. NOT THAT OFTEN.

254
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,833
YOU KNOW, JUST WHEN I'M
WITH MY FRIENDS.

255
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,291
OR LIKE WHEN MY FAMILY
GOES OUT FOR DINNER.

256
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,625
MY DAD DRIVES US AROUND,

257
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,958
BUT HE'S NOT AS GOOD A
DRIVER AS YOU. ( laughs )

258
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,625
- SHE'S A WEIRD ONE.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING SPECIAL,

259
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,083
JUST DROVE LIKE NORMAL.

260
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,916
MAKING SURE
I DON'T SPILL THE WATER.

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,208
EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T HAVE A CUP
WITH ME TODAY.

262
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,708
- ( car engine revving )

263
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,708
- THAT WAS MESSED UP YESTERDAY.

264
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,708
THAT CAR RUNNING IN FRONT OF ME
KEPT GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER,

265
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,916
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW,

266
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,583
I FOUND MYSELF GETTING A CHARGE
OUT OF CHASING IT.

267
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,291
- ( tires screeching )

268
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,875
- UNTIL YESTERDAY,

269
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,708
I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED THAT
DRIVING COULD BE FUN.

270
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,291
IT WAS ALWAYS WORK
BUT LAST NIGHT,

271
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,916
AND EVEN TODAY WHEN
I WAS DRIVING OUT HERE

272
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,750
WITH NATSUKI SITTING NEXT TO ME,

273
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,125
I HAD A LOT OF FUN.

274
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,000
DRIVING IS ACTUALLY KINDA COOL.

275
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,750
- ( waves splashing )

276
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:13,583
- Natsuki: HEY, TAKUMI?
HELL-OO? ARE YOU LISTENING?

277
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,666
YOU COMPLETELY SPACED OUT
JUST NOW. WHAT WAS THAT?

278
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,625
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

279
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,833
YOU'RE ACTING KINDA RUDE.
I HOPE YOU REALIZE THAT.

280
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,208
WHEN A GUY IS WITH A CUTE GIRL
IN A BATHING SUIT,

281
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,541
DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD
BE STANDING THERE

282
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,875
STARING OFF AT NOTHING
OR STARING AT HER?

283
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,750
- I'M SORRY, I GOT DISTRACTED.
WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?

284
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,083
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO ASK

285
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,958
IF THERE'S ANY GIRL
YOU LIKE RIGHT NOW.

286
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,625
- I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS NOT NOW.
NOBODY IN PARTICULAR.

287
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,250
THEN AGAIN, THERE
IS THIS ONE GIRL

288
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,875
I CAN'T HELP THINKING ABOUT.

289
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,833
- OOH!

290
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,125
- HOW ABOUT YOU? DO YOU HAVE
ANYBODY ON YOUR MIND?

291
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,916
- WELL, SORT OF.

292
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,750
I MEAN, THERE IS THIS ONE GUY
I THINK OF SOMETIMES.

293
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,083
- YOU KNOW, IF I DIDN'T
KNOW ANY BETTER,

294
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,291
I'D THINK YOU WERE
JUST COPYING ME.

295
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,333
- ( Natsuki laughs )

296
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,583
- Iketani: ( laughs ) MAN!

297
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,416
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY
TIMES THIS MORNING

298
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,708
I'VE BEEN ASKED THE
SAME QUESTION.

299
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,958
IT'S LIKE
AN ENDLESS BROKEN RECORD!

300
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,500
"WHO WAS THE GUY DRIVING
THAT EIGHT-SIX LAST NIGHT?"

301
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,750
- PEOPLE BEEN ASKIN' ME
THE SAME THING, TOO.

302
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,833
I JUST SAY, "WHO CARES.
HE BEAT KEISUKE TAKAHASHI."

303
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,166
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

304
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,083
IT'S NO SHOCK PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN BLABBIN' ABOUT IT.

305
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,583
- I MAY HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE
WORKED UP ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

306
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,541
I'VE BEEN TELLIN'
EVERYONE THAT THE EIGHT-SIX

307
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,750
IS THE SPEED STARS'
SECRET WEAPON.

308
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,958
WHICH MEANS WE
GOTTA FIGURE OUT

309
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,833
HOW TO GET TAKUMI
TO JOIN US NOW.

310
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,916
IF NOT, WE'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE
IDIOTS LATER.

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,458
- NO SWEAT! YOU LEAVE THAT
TO ME. I CAN CONVINCE HIM!

312
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,291
I'M THE GUY'S BEST FRIEND
AND CONFIDANT.

313
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,750
HE'LL LISTEN TO WHAT I GOTTA
SAY. I'LL MAKE HIM DO IT.

314
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,583
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN?

315
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,166
- I KNOW I CAN, MAN!

316
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,333
I KNOW ALL THE BUTTONS TO PUSH
ON THAT PARTICULAR MACHINE.

317
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:59,083
AND IN RETURN MAYBE YOU COULD
LET ME, UH, JOIN THE SPEEDSTARS?

318
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,916
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, KENJI?
SHOULD WE LET ITSUKI IN

319
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,416
IF HE GETS TAKUMI
TO JOIN THE TEAM?

320
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,833
- SURE.

321
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,916
- ( giggles ) HELL, YEAH!
I'M GONNA BE A SPEED STAR!

322
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,791
- BUT DON'T YOU KINDA,
I DON'T KNOW, NEED A CAR?

323
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,458
- I'M GLAD
YOU ASKED ME THAT, KENJI.

324
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,791
I'VE ALREADY GOT MY GAME PLAN
ALL MAPPED OUT!

325
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,875
- OH! YOU'VE SAVED UP THE CASH?

326
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,833
- I'M GONNA ASK MY DAD
TO SIGN FOR THE LOAN

327
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,541
SO I CAN GET ENOUGH MONEY
TO BUY MYSELF AN EIGHT-SIX!

328
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,666
TAKUMI HAS HIMSELF
A PANDA TRUENO,

329
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,291
SO I'M GOIN' IN FOR
THE RED OR BLACK LEVIN!

330
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,375
AND SOMEDAY WE'LL BE KNOWN AS
THE EIGHT-SIX DUO!

331
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,708
THE FASTEST DRIVERS IN AKINA!

332
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,291
- ( crowd cheering )

333
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,083
- ( Itsuki laughing )

334
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,583
- YEAH, BUT, ITSUKI, UM,

335
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,250
TAKUMI'S EIGHT-SIX IS
NOT NORMAL. YOU KNOW THAT.

336
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,708
PLEASE TELL ME YOU KNOW THAT.

337
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,916
- IT'S CRANKED UP.

338
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,458
FASTER THAN THE FD,
AND THAT'S 350 HORSES.

339
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,291
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TAKUMI DOES IT,

340
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,458
BUT I'M WILLIN' TO BET,

341
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,916
HE'S GOT A PRETTY SLICK
TUNING JOB INSIDE.

342
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,416
I TELL YA, THAT IS ONE HOOD
I'D LIKE TO GET UNDER

343
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,833
FOR A LONG TIME.

344
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,833
- INSTEAD OF THAT, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TAG ALONG WITH HIM?

345
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,333
I DON'T THINK HE'D MIND.

346
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,041
RIDE ALONG WHEN HE GOES
TO BREAK THE RECORD

347
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,416
FOR AKINA'S DOWNHILL.

348
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,291
- COULD BE PRETTY SWEET.
- OH! THAT'S A GENIUS IDEA!

349
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,916
- I WANNA GO, TOO!

350
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,541
- OKAY, DUDE. WE CAN
ALL GO WHERE NO ONE

351
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,750
HAS EVER GONE BEFORE.

352
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,875
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE IT, MAN.

353
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,375
- Kenji and Itsuki: YEAH!

354
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,125
- Iketani: I BET IT'S BETTER
THAN THE BEST ROLLER COASTER

355
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,375
YOU COULD FIND
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

356
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,500
- Kenji and Itsuki: YEAH!

357
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,166
- Itsuki: CRAP! I FORGOT!

358
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:32,375
TAKUMI'S OUT ON HIS DATE
RIGHT NOW! ( laughs )

359
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,541
- Natsuki: TAKUMI, HOLD ON!
WAIT UP A SECOND!

360
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,083
HI, EXCUSE ME! BUT WOULD MIND
TAKING OUR PICTURE?

361
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,208
- SURE.

362
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,250
( laughs )

363
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,916
- WHAT'RE YOU DOIN'? I LOOK LIKE
I'VE BEEN BURIED IN SAND.

364
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,083
- WE CAME ALL THIS WAY.

365
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,500
YOU BETTER BELIEVE WE'RE
GETTING A PICTURE

366
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,041
TO TAKE HOME. NOW QUIT
COMPLAINING AND SMILE.

367
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,500
- Man: HERE WE GO, YOU TWO!

368
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,125
- GREAT! WOULD YOU TAKE ONE
MORE? JUST ONE MORE, PLEASE.

369
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,500
- Takumi: THE GUY'S GOT
HIS FAMILY WITH HIM.

370
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,500
COME ON, LET HIM GO--

371
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,625
- OH, JUST SHUT UP
AND LOOK PRETTY.

372
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,500
- ( car tires screeching)

373
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,291
- ( tires screeching )

374
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,333
- Boy 2: THAT'S ONE
WICKED WHITE FC.

375
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,666
- THAT'S RYOSUKE TOCKAHASHI.
HE'S THE BEST DRIVER THEY GOT.

376
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,458
NO WONDER THEY HAVE HIM
RACING NEXT.

377
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,458
- WHAT WOULD THEY DO THAT FOR?

378
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,083
- I'M THINKING IT'S A RUN FOR
REVENGE, DUDE. THINK ABOUT IT,

379
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,750
WHY THE HELL ELSE
WOULD HE BE HERE?

380
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,583
- BUT THAT WAS JUST LAST NIGHT,
AND HE'S ALREADY HERE? WOW.

381
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,958
THAT GUY MUST BE
FREAKIN' PISSED

382
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,708
ABOUT BEING BEATEN
BY THE EIGHT-SIX.

383
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,791
- ( engine revving )

384
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,125
- Boy 2: I NEVER SEEN
THAT RIDE UP HERE BEFORE.

385
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:10,250
A BLACK THREE-TWO. SOMETHING
ABOUT IT FREAKS ME OUT.

386
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,916
WHO'S DRIVIN' THAT THING?

387

- HEY, YOU CAN'T
JUST BARGE IN HERE--

402
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,083
- HE WENT TO THE BEACH
WITH NATSUKI,

403
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,125
AND HE JUST LEFT HIS
BEST FRIEND, ME,

00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,541
HERE ALL ALONE!

405
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,541

406
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,458
AND ALL YOU WANTED WAS TO SEE
NATSUKI IN HER BATHING SUIT.

407

- OF COURSE I DID!

408
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,875
AND TAKUMI WAS ALONE WITH
HER THE WHOLE TIME!

409
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:55,083
HE DID SOMETHING WITH HER,
I KNOW IT! I KNOW THAT GUY!
