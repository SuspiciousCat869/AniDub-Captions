1
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

2
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,541
- Itsuki: MORNIN' TAKUMI!

3
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,291
WHAT'S UP WITH THE SLEEPY FACE?

4
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,916
- I DON'T KNOW MAN.
I GUESS I WAS BORN WITH IT.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,625
- HEY. IT'S GETTIN'
CLOSER YA KNOW.

6
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,083
- HUH?

7
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,583
- THE RACE AGAINST
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI, YOU DOPE!

8
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,291
MAN I'M SO FRIGGIN' PSYCHED
FOR THAT BATTLE.

9
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,250
HECK I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ABLE
TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL!

10
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,458
WE'RE TALKIN' RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI!

11
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,125
HE'S NOT ONLY THE MOST POPULAR
RACER IN ALL OF GUNMA,

12
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,791
BUT THE FASTEST AS WELL!

13
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,416
SO TELL ME, HAVE
YOU BEEN WORKIN' ON

14
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,791
ANY SUPER SPECIAL STRATEGIES
YOU WANNA USE ON HIM?

15
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,083
- NU-UH. I'M JUST NOT A
VERSATILE ENOUGH DRIVER

16
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,708
TO CHANGE MY STRATEGY BASED
ON WHOEVER I'M UP AGAINST.

17
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,333
- ( snarls )

18
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,083
- REALLY DOESN'T MAKE
THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE.

19
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,083
MY ONLY STRATEGY IS TO GO
AS FAST AS I POSSIBLY CAN

20
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,541
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN.

21
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,750
AND IF MY OPPONENT DRIVES
FASTER THAN ME, THEN I LOSE.

22
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,416
BUT IF I'M FASTER THEN I WIN.

23
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
- THAT ACTUALLY DOES
MAKE SOME SENSE.

24
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,708
JUST KNOW I'M COUNTIN' ON
YOU TO GO OUT THERE

25
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,125
AND KNOCK HIS SOCKS OFF.

26
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,125
THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES
IF YOU END UP BEATIN' HIM.

27
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:47,541
YES! THAT'D BE BRILLIANT!
I MIGHT EVEN PEE MY PANTS!

28
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,041
AWKWARD!

29
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,958
- Itsuki: HOW YA DOIN' TODAY?

30
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,500
- OH IT'S JUST YOU. WHAT'S UP?

31
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,791
- I HOLD IN MY HAND
SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING.

32
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,208
- OH NO WAY! DON'T TELL ME!

33
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,916
YOU BROUGHT ONE OF THOSE
NUDIE MOVIES?

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,583
AWESOME! LET'S WATCH IT!

35
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,541
- SORRY BUT THIS IS
A HELLUVA LOT MORE INTERESTING

36
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,583
THAN ANY SKIN FLICK.

37
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,458
- IS THAT POSSIBLE?

38
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,333
- HUH. IT JUST LOOKS
LIKE A STREET RACE.

39
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,250
- WHERE IS IT?
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AKINA.

40
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,791
- TRUST ME. JUST KEEP WATCHIN'.

41
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,333
- HOLD UP. BACK IT UP A FEW
SECONDS AND PUT IT IN SLO-MO.

42
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,958
- HOLY CRAP! THAT'S RYOSUKE!

43
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,250
LOOK AT HOW YOUNG HE IS THERE!

44
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,541
- THIS VIDEO WAS TAKEN
THREE YEARS AGO.

45
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,083
- DUDE, HOW DID YOU FIND THIS?

46
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,291
- SOME GUYS I KNOW ARE
DIE HARD FANS

47
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,708
AND THEY WOULD TAPE ALL HIS
RACES BACK THEN.

48
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,250
- Itsuki: WHAT A DRIFT!

49
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,708
- ANGLING INTO A CORNER FROM
THE OUTSIDE POSITION LIKE THAT.

50
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,916
IT'S A THING OF BEAUTY.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,250
- BADASS!

52
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,208
- I THOUGHT
THIS LOOKED FAMILIAR!

53
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,500
I WAS TOTALLY AT THAT RACE!

54
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,375
I CAN STILL REMEMBER IT.

55
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,625
BACK THEN TAKAHASHI
WAS A LONE WOLF.

56
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,500
HE DIDN'T BELONG
TO A TEAM LIKE HE DOES TODAY.

57
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,166
EVERYONE CALLED HIM
"AKAGI'S WHITE COMET."

58
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,166
- NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A NICKNAME.

59
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,291
THAT SOUNDS SO AWESOME
IT'S GIVIN' ME THE CHILLS!

60
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,083
WAIT, SO WHAT ABOUT THE REDSUNS?

61
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,833
- WELL. WHEN RYOSUKE DECIDED
TO FORM HIS OWN TEAM,

62
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,125
HE PERSONALLY HANDPICKED
SOME OF THE BEST

63
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,458
AND MOST VERSATILE STREET RACERS

64
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,666
AROUND WHETHER HE WAS
FRIENDS WITH THEM OR NOT.

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,541
THAT'S WHY HE HAS SUCH A HIGHER
QUALITY TEAM COMPARED TO US,

66
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:45,041
WHO ARE JUST A GROUP OF BUDDIES
WHO ARE REALLY INTO RACING.

67
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,791
NOWADAYS, HE AND HIS
YOUNGER BROTHER KEISUKE

68
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,375
ARE KNOWN AS "THE
ROTARY BROTHERS"

69
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,583
BECAUSE THEY BOTH LIKE TO DRIVE
CARS THAT HAVE ROTARY ENGINES.

70
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,750
IF YOU ASK ME, I DON'T CARE
MUCH FOR THE NEW NAME.

71
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,250
MAYBE CUZ I CAN'T SEE HIM
AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN

72
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,250
"AKAGI'S WHITE COMET."

73
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,375
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
WATCHING THERE? IS THAT A RACE?

74
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,958
- SORRY SIR! DUDE, QUICK,
TURN THAT CRAP OFF!

75
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,291
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
KEEP WATCHING, I DON'T MIND.

76
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,125
THAT'S SOME GOOD STUFF THERE.

77
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,833
SO THAT'S THE GUY TAKUMI'S
GOING UP AGAINST, HUH?

78
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:16,916
- YUP!

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,625
- OH MAN THE TURNOUT'S
GONNA BE HUGE.

80
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,041
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANNA BET
IT'LL BE THE BIGGEST CROWD

81
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,083
WE'VE EVER SEEN?

82
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,125
- TAKAHASHI'S A BORN SUPERSTAR.

83
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,166
AND NOW TAKUMI'S STARTIN' TO
MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF

84
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,583
ON THE SCENE AS
AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX.

85
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,958
- RIGHT! BY NOW
EVERYONE'S HEARD OF

86
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,291
THE MYSTERIOUS
DOWNHILL SPECIALIST

87
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,250
WHO'S BLOWN ALL OF AKINA
OUT OF THE WATER! OH BOY!

88
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,583
I'M SO FRIGGIN' EXCITED
FOR THIS RACE!

89
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,333
BUT SERIOUSLY GUYS. WHO DO
YOU THINK'S GONNA WIN THIS ONE?

90
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,125
TAKUMI? HUH?

91
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,250
- MAN, I HATE TO SAY THIS
BUT I DON'T THINK TAKUMI

92
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,083
STANDS A CHANCE IN HELL

93
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,208
OF BEATIN' THE WHITE COMET.

94
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,583
THE GUY IS UNREAL,
AND POSSIBLY UNBEATABLE.

95
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:55,916
- I'VE GOTTA AGREE WITH YOU.
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI'S FAST.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,333
RIDICULOUSLY FAST.

97
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,666
- REALLY? THAT'S NOT
GOOD AT ALL.

98
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,083
- YEAH. HE WAS THE FASTEST
WHEN THIS VIDEO WAS SHOT.

99
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,958
AND THE GUY'S ONLY
GOTTEN BETTER SINCE THEN.

100
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,833
NOT ONLY HAS HE COMPLETELY
DOMINATED STREET RACING

101
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:10,833
SINCE HE'S STARTED,

102
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,125
HE'S WON THE
GYMKHANA AS WELL AS

103
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,750
A BUNCH OF OTHER CIRCUIT
COMPETITIONS.

104
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,458
HE HOLDS COUNTLESS COURSE
RECORDS AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

105
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,916
HAS NEVER LOST A RACE.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,125
IN FACT HIS UNDEFEATED
STREAK IS THE LONGEST

107
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,583
ANY RACER HAS TO DATE.

108
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,625
I'VE HEARD FROM MORE THAN
ONE PERSON THAT EVEN THOUGH

109
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,958
NO ONE'S EVER BEATEN HIM

110
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,500
HE'S ADMITTED TO NEVER
GIVIN' A HUNDRED PERCENT.

111
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,000
- Iketani: HE'LL MAYBE GIVE
50% OF WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF

112
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,416
STILL WHOOPS EVERYONE
HE GOES UP AGAINST.

113
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,958
IT'S TRUE. AND AS CRAZY
AS IT SOUNDS

114
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,541
NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN
THE MAN GO ALL OUT

115
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,166
DURING A RACE BEFORE.

116
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,375
IF TAKUMI CAN STAY
WITHIN EYESIGHT OF HIM

117
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,708
IT'LL BE A JOB WELL DONE.

118
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,375
- BUT WHAT ABOUT...

119
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,666
- OH IKETANI,
THERE YOU GO AGAIN

120
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,333
WITH THAT NEGATIVE
ATTITUDE OF YOURS.

121
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,166
DON'T COUNT HIM OUT RIGHT AWAY.
CAN'T YOU BE MORE OPTIMISTIC?

122
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,333
- OKAY BOSS, THEN WHY DON'T
YOU TELL US HOW YOU FEEL?

123
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,458
WHO'S GONNA WIN?

124
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,791
- WE CAN'T FORGET TAKUMI'S
RECORD SO FAR!

125
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,375
HE BEAT KEISUKE PRETTY
EASILY AND HE WHOOPED TAKESHI

126
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,625
FROM THE NIGHT KIDS!

127
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,916
AND THEN THERE WAS
THE SIL-EIGHTY FROM USUI.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,250
AND THE GUM TAPE DEATH MATCH!

129
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,500
WHAT ABOUT
THE RACE IN THE RAIN?

130
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,583
I THINK HE'LL DO JUST FINE,
AND HE MAY EVEN WIN THIS THING.

131
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,416
- I THINK WE'VE ESTABLISHED
THAT RYOSUKE IS BY FAR

132
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,833
THE BEST RACER ON THE RED SUNS.

133
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:27,625
KEISUKE AND TAKESHI
DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE

134
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,333
TO HIS LEVEL OF ABILITY.

135
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,500
- IF I WERE IN CHARGE
OF PLACING BETS ON THIS RACE,

136
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,791
I'D PUT TAKUMI'S ODDS
AT MAYBE TEN TO ONE.

137
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,750
- WELL, ALL I WANT
IS FOR TAKUMI TO WIN.

138
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,541
I MEAN THE GUY'S MY BEST
FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

139
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,000
THE THING IS, I'M SO PROUD
OF OUR EIGHT-SIX.

140
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,166
I JUST WANT HIM TO
BEAT THAT DAMN FC!

141
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,958
- DON'T CRY DUDE.

142
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,875
- Natsuki: BOYS ARE OBSESSED
WITH CARS, AREN'T THEY?

143
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,125
- SURE.

144
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,125
- ARE THEY REALLY THAT EXCITING?

145
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,750
- YEAH, THEY REALLY ARE.

146
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:11,000
THEY GIVE YOU THE FREEDOM
TO GO ANYWHERE YOU WANNA GO.

147
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,666
- SO IF YOU HAD TO
MAKE A CHOICE

148
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,125
BETWEEN YOUR GIRLFRIEND
AND YOUR CAR,

149
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,916
WHICH WOULD YOU PICK? AND
BE HONEST, NO JOKIN' AROUND.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,750
- HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK
I CAN COMPARE THE TWO.

151
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,333
MY GIRLFRIEND IS ONE THING

152
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,833
BUT MY CAR IS SOMETHING
ELSE ENTIRELY.

153
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,333
RACING'S DEEP.
IT CAN BE VERY CEREBRAL.

154
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,916
LATELY I'VE BEEN DOIN'
A LOT OF THINKING

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,708
ON HOW I CAN IMPROVE MYSELF.

156
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,250
WHEN I THINK ABOUT RACING,
I DON'T KNOW,

157
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,166
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

158
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,416
- YOU KNOW, TAKUMI, YOU'RE...
- HUH?

159
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,583
- ...VERY SEXUAL.

160
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,166
- ( thuds )

161
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,583
- Takumi: MAN, THAT CAME
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE.

162
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,083
WHAT MADE YOU SAY THAT?

163
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,541
- OH. SORRY, IT JUST CAME OUT.
WOMEN'S INTUITION I GUESS.

164
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,583
I MEAN, THAT WAS IT, RIGHT?

165
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:57,375
I JUST GOT AN INSIDE PEAK
AT TAKUMI'S HIDDEN SEXUALITY!

166
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,333
- HUH? NATSUKI, WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU EVEN TALKIN' ABOUT?

167
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,000
SERIOUSLY YOU'RE
NOT MAKING SENSE!

168
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,625
- OH DON'T WORRY.
TRUST ME,

169
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,250
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND ANYWAY.

170
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,458
- OKAY.

171
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,791
- SO THIS BIG RACE COMIN' UP.
WHEN IS IT?

172
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:13,083
- UH, THE NIGHT AFTER TOMORROW.

173
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,958
- AND THIS GUY YOU'RE RACIN'
AGAINST. IS HE FAST?

174
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,500
- YEAH.

175
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,083
- I'D LIKE TO WATCH,
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

176
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,375
OR, MAYBE IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

177
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,458
WELL WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T CRASH.

178
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,291
LOSING IS OKAY.

179
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,708
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T GET HURT.

180
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,458
SO, DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

181
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,166
- HEY, RYOSUKE. YOU GOT ANOTHER
INVITE FROM A PRO TEAM.

182
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,541
THEY CALLED ME EARLIER TODAY,
FISHIN' FOR INFORMATION.

183
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,958
- ANOTHER OFFER? AWESOME!

184
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,833
- WHICH TEAM WAS IT THIS TIME?

185
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,375
- IT WAS THE ONE FROM HOSHIYA.

186
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,416
THEY'RE SAID THEY'RE LOOKIN'
FOR A YOUNG DRIVER WITH SKILLS

187
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,250
WHO'S HUNGRY FOR SOME BIG TIME
CIRCUIT RACING.

188
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,416
THEY ASKED ME TO
HAVE YOU CALL THEM ASAP.

189
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,875
TOLD ME THEY WE'RE WANTING
TO SET UP AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU.

190
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,958
- YOU'RE THE BEST DRIVER
GUNMA'S SEEN IN YEARS!

191
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,958
YOU'LL DO GREAT AS A PRO,
I KNOW IT!

192
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,791
MAN, THIS NEWS HAS GOT TO BE
EXCITING FOR YOU!

193
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,125
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YA KNOW YET?

194
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,000
- TELL THEM NO THANKS.

195
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,583
I'VE SAID THIS
MANY TIMES BEFORE.

196
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:40,041
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE
TO DRIVE PROFESSIONALLY.

197
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,833
- AND WASTE YOUR TALENT?

198
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,208
CAN'T YOU AT LEAST TALK TO THEM?

199
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,375
YOU NEVER KNOW,
YOU MAY LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR.

200
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,541
- RYOSUKE, YOUR BROTHER'S
GOT A POINT.

201
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,416
- LISTEN. THE
PROFESSIONAL RACING WORLD

202
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,750
DOESN'T INTEREST ME.

203
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,416
THE ONLY FORM OF RACING
THAT CAPTURES MY ATTENTION

204
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,583
IS THE STREETS.

205
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,458
WHERE ANYONE CAN EXPRESS
THEMSELVES FREELY.

206
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,416
I RACED IN THE GYMHKANA.

207
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,875
AND VARIOUS OTHER CIRCUIT
COMPETITIONS OVER THE YEARS.

208
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,375
IT'S THE PATH I CHOSE
IN ORDER TO MASTER

209
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,333
THE ART
OF STREET RACING.

210
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,958
NOW, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT'S ON MY MIND.

211
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,541
RACING THE EIGHT-SIX
THIS SATURDAY.

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,625
- HEY THERE. ARE YOU DONE YET?

213
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,625
HOW BOUT GOIN FOR A LITTLE SPIN?

214
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,250
- UH, WITH YOU?

215
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,250
- YEAH. I'VE READJUSTED THE CAR

216
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,875
AND WANTED TO TAKE IT
FOR AN EASY RIDE

217
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,666
TO MAKE SURE
IT'S WORKING ALRIGHT.

218
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,416
- AN EASY RIDE, HUH?

219
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,166
I HAVE A FEELING I'M GOING TO
REGRET THIS, BUT WHAT THE HELL.

220
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,083
- Yuuichi: HEY, BUNTA?
- YEAH?

221
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,916
- YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO READJUST
THE CAR FOR THE BIG BATTLE

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,583
COMING UP ON SATURDAY DID YOU?

223
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,291
- I DID. YUUICHI.

224
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,291
I'M GONNA SPEED
THINGS UP A BIT.

225
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,583
- ( spits )

226
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,125
YOU MEAN RIGHT NOW?

227
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,125
OKAY, I'M READY.
BUT DON'T OVERDO IT ALRIGHT?

228
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,625
- INITIAL D!

229
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,666
INITIAL D!

230
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,958
- OH CRAP!
HERE COMES THE CORNER!

231
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,541
THAT'S AMAZING ENTRY SPEED!

232
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,666
I CAN FEEL THE G-FORCES
DIAGONALLY BEHIND ME!

233
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,291
BUNTA! WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

234
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,916
- HUH? NOTHING. I'M JUST
IN THE MOOD FOR A SMOKE.

235
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
- THEN WHO'S STEERING THE CAR?

236
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,958
YOU'RE NOT EVEN WATCHING
THE ROAD! OH NO!

237
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,625
- NOT TOO BAD.

238
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,500
OKAY. TIME TO GET SERIOUS.

239
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,958
- LET ME OUTTA HERE!

240
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,750
- THE TIRES AND ENGINE HAVE ALL
BEEN ADJUSTED FOR THE RACE.

241
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,750
IT'S PERFECTLY TUNED
AND READY TO GO.

242
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,666
- SO AFTER THE ADJUSTMENTS HOW
MUCH HORSEPOWER DOES IT HAVE?

243
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,416
- WELL, NOW. IF I REALLY
PUSH IT UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS

244
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,791
WE'RE LOOKING AT
TWO-HUNDRED-SIXTY HORSEPOWER.

245
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,875
- ONLY TWO-HUNDRED-SIXTY?

246
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,000
THAT'S A HUGE DOWNGRADE!

247
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,375
YOU MUST'VE HAD
AT LEAST THREE-FIFTY BEFORE.

248
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,125
- THAT'S RIGHT.

249
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,375
- YOU WANT LESS HORSEPOWER.

250
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,208
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO MAKE YOUR CAR SLOWER?

251
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,541
- IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES

252
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,916
YOU CAN RUN FASTER USING
LESS HORSEPOWER.

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,416
THAT'S HOW COMPLICATED
STREET RACING CAN BE.

254
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,625
THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN A
DOWNHILL BATTLE ISN'T POWER,

255
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,000
BUT BALANCE.

256
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,083
I THOUGHT I HAD MADE THE
CORRECT ADJUSTMENTS TO MY FC

257
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,458
IN ORDER TO MAKE IT
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE

258
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,750
IN BOTH THE UPHILL AND
DOWNHILL PORTIONS.

259
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,541
I KNEW I COULD HANDLE
MORE POWER ON THE DOWNHILL

260
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,750
SO I UPGRADED THE TURBINE

261
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,250
AND RAISED THE FIRING SPEED
ON THE PISTONS.

262
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,958
BUT IN THE END I HAD TO
LOSE ALL THAT POWER.

263
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,458
NO MATTER WHAT REASONS
I HAD FOR THIS CHANGE,

264
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,333
THE DOWNGRADE
IS HUMILIATING TO ME.

265
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,708
I'VE BEEN FORCED TO THROW
MY PRIDE INTO THE WIND

266
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,708
FOR THIS RACE.

267
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,333
- IT'S AMAZING TO
ME THE EIGHT-SIX

268
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,750
IS ACTUALLY THAT
TOUGH AN OPPONENT.

269
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,458
- I FEEL LUCKY TO HAVE MET
AN EXTRAORDINARY DRIVER

270
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,250
WITH THAT MUCH NATURAL TALENT.

271
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,208
MY RACER'S BLOOD IS STARTING
TO BOIL IN ANTICIPATION.

272
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,125
LET'S GO.

273
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,291
- LESS POWER EQUALS MORE SPEED.

274
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,250
IT MUST BE DUE TO THE WAY
HE ENTERS HIS CORNERS.

275
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,708
THERE'S NO WAY MY
BROTHER WILL LOSE NOW.

276
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,541
HE'S JUST TOO DAMN SMART.

277
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:35,291
- RIGHT NOW, I AM NO LONGER
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI

278
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,583
OF THE RED SUNS.

279
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,958
I'M IN LONE WOLF MODE
AS AKAGI'S WHITE COMET.

280
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,708
THIS BATTLE WILL BE MINE.
HANDS DOWN.

281
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,458
- Itsuki: TAKUMI!

282
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,000
HEY! IT'S FINALLY HERE!

283
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,000
- THE DAY OF THE BIG SHOWDOWN!
- YEA, HUH.

284
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,833
- I SWEAR MAN, IT PISSES ME OFF.

285
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,625
EVERYONE'S MADE UP
THEIR MIND ALREADY

286
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,708
THAT TAKAHASHI'S GONNA
WHOOP YOUR ASS.

287
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,125
THEY KEEP COMPARING IT TO
AN AMATEUR BOXER

288
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,833
GOIN' UP AGAINST THE
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION.

289
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,541
DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU MAD?

290
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,750
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

291
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,958
YOU'RE GONNA GO FOR THE
BIG UPSET, RIGHT?

292
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,291
- LET'S SEE.

293
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,125
- ( gasps )

294
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,166
- NO.
- Ah!

295
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,125
- THOSE RACERS MUST BE
HEADED UP TO THE PASS.

296
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,750
NO TURNING BACK NOW.

297
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,541
- Iketani: HEY BOSS.
- HEY.

298
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,750
- I FINISHED CLEANING
EVERYTHING OUTSIDE.

299
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,375
I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNIN'.

300
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,708
- AH, THANK YOU.

301
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,500
SO, YOU'RE GONNA GO WATCH
THE RACE TONIGHT, RIGHT?

302
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,083
- YEAH.

303
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,583
- YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE
TAKUMI HAS A CHANCE

304
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,291
AT WINNING THIS THING, DO YOU?

305
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:01,333
- NO. TAKUMI'S ONE OF THE MOST
TALENTED RACERS I KNOW,

306
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,375
BUT HE'S STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

307
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,416
HE'S GOT NO EXPERIENCE
COMPARED TO TAKAHASHI.

308
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,333
NOT ONLY DO I THINK HE'LL LOSE,

309
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,541
I WONDER IF HE'LL EVEN FINISH
THE RACE IN ONE PIECE.

310
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,541
- I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

311
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,791
I THINK THE BOY HAS
A GOOD CHANCE AT AN UPSET.

312
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,666
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

313
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,000
- JUST A GUESS.

314
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,500
- HEY.

315
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,250
WELL WE'RE OFF TO THE PASS.
SEE YA LATER BOSS.

316
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,375
- SEE YA.

317
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,500
- THE ONLY REASON
I BELIEVE TAKUMI HAS A CHANCE

318
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,375
IS HE HAS BUNTA'S BLOOD
PUMPING THROUGH HIS VEINS.

319
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,416
AND BUNTA'S
ONE CRAZY SON-OF-A-BITCH.

320
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,791
- DID I CALL IT OR WHAT?
THIS CROWD IS FRIGGIN' GIGANTIC.

321
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,958
- IF I WERE IN TAKUMI'S
SHOES RIGHT NOW

322
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,250
I'D WANT TO RUN AWAY AND HIDE.

323
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,375
I'D BE DOWNRIGHT TERRIFIED
SHOWING UP TO A RACE

324
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,416
WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE
STARIN' AT ME.

325
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,625
- HEY. ISN'T THAT THE
SIL-EIGHTY FROM MOUNT USUIOOSI?

326
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,958
- NO WAY.

327
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,833
- IT SURE IS.

328
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,666
- DAMN, TALK ABOUT
A COUPLE OF BABES.

329
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,125
- YEAH.

330
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,583
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD SPOT.

331
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,208
THESE CORNERS LOOK WICKED

332
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,041
SO WE SHOULD SEE SOME
GOOD TECHNIQUE.

333
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,750
OH BY THE WAY, I WANTED
TO ASK YOU WHICH ONE

334
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,250
YOU'RE GONNA BE
ROOTING FOR TONIGHT.

335
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,250
- WHICH ONE?

336
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,333
- IT'S THE EIGHT-SIX RIGHT?

337
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,625
YEAH, I LIKE HIM TOO.

338
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,250
THE GUY HAS THIS MYSTERIOUS
AIR ABOUT HIM.

339
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,250
BUT IT'S ONLY SOMETHING
THAT PEOPLE

340
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,833
WHO HAVE ALREADY RACED HIM
CAN EVEN RECOGNIZE.

341
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,333
IT'S WEIRD, IT'S LIKE
YOU WANNA ROOT FOR HIM

342
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,375
EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEAT YOU.

343
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,541
BESIDES, IT ALSO DOESN'T
HURT THAT...

344
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,250
...HE'S A TOTAL HOTTIE! RIGHT?

345
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,500
- COME ON, SAYUKI.

346
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,666
- Itsuki: IT'S ALMOST
NINE-THIRTY.

347
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,000
IT'S GETTING CLOSE.

348
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,208
OH MAN, I'M SO FRIGGIN'
PUMPED RIGHT NOW!

349
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,666
- ( rap playing )

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,500
- OH, LOOK. REDSUNS ARE HERE.

351
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,166
- Boy 1: YES! THE TAKAHASHI
BROTHERS ARE SO BADASS!

352
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,291
- Boy 2: GO GET 'EM
OUT THERE, BOYS!

353
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,166
- RYOSUKE!

354
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,250
- AKAGI'S WHITE COMET
HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

355
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,291
- ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS WAIT
FOR TAKUMI TO SHOW HIS FACE.

356
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,958
- FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,
THE EIGHT-SIX ISN'T HERE YET.

357
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,583
- THAT'S NO SURPRISE.
HE LIKES TO DO THIS EVERY RACE.

358
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,291
SHOW UP AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE.

359
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,000
- HEY, KEISUKE, THERE'S
SOMETHING I WANTED TO RUN BY YOU

360
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,333
THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

361
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,875
WHEN THE DAY COMES THAT
I LOSE MY FIRST STREET RACE,

362
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,166
I'LL RETIRE.

363
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,625
- HUH? WHAT'RE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

364
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,458
YOU'LL NEVER LOSE! YOU'RE THE
BEST THE SPORT'S EVER SEEN!

365
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,250
- JUST HEAR ME OUT, OKAY?

366
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,375
BY RETIRE I DON'T MEAN
QUITTING RACING ALTOGETHER.

367
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,416
I'LL AGREE TO STEP DOWN
FROM THE NUMBER ONE SPOT, BUT...

368
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,583
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M JUST GOING
TO WALK AWAY FROM THE TEAM.

369
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,125
I STILL PLAN TO CONTRIBUTE.

370
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,291
- WHAT ABOUT OUR DREAM OF
BECOMING THE FASTEST IN KANTO?

371
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,041
ARE WE JUST SUPPOSED
TO SCRAP THAT?

372
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,208
YOU KNOW IT CAN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT
YOU! I STILL NEED YA BRO!

373
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,833
- DON'T MAKE
THAT FACE, KEISUKE.

374
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,083
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF LOSING ANYTIME SOON.

375
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,500
PUT THIS IN YOUR HEAD
AND DON'T FORGET IT FOR ME.

376
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,625
IT'S INEVITABLE THAT SOMEDAY
I WILL LOSE.

377
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,541
I CAN'T GO ON WINNING FOREVER.

378
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,750
BY THE WAY, THERE ARE
ONLY TWO RACERS ALIVE

379
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,125
WHO I FEEL HAVE A LEGITIMATE
CHANCE AT BEATING ME SOMEDAY.

380
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,041
AND THE FIRST ONE ON THAT LIST
HAS TO BE YOU, KEISUKE.

381
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,291
- REALLY?

382
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,958
- OH, YES. I SEE A RACING
GENIUS INSIDE OF YOU

383
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,125
WAITING TO GET OUT.

384
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,166
SOMEDAY, YOU'LL BE
EVEN FASTER THAN ME.

385
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,208
AND THE OTHER
WOULD HAVE TO BE...

386
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,666
- ( engine revving )

387
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,625
- HE'S HERE! HE'S REALLY HERE!

388
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,958
GO TAKUMI!

389
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,833
- BROTHER. YOU DIDN'T FINISH
YOUR THOUGHT.

390
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,416
THE OTHER ONE
IS THE EIGHT-SIX, ISN'T IT?

391
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,666
- I DON'T PLAN
ON LOSING JUST YET.

392
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,416
TONIGHT I'M ARMED AND READY
FOR AN ALL-OUT DRIFT WAR!

393
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,333
- ( theme song playing )

394
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

395
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,875
- Narrator: TAKUMI, IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

396
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,875
- Takumi: WELL, I'VE BEEN
ACCEPTING THESE CHALLENGES

397
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:36,916
AS THEY COME MY WAY,

398
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,500
BUT THIS RACE FEELS
A LOT DIFFERENT

399
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,375
FROM ANY OF THE OTHERS.

400
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,750
- YEAH? HOW SO?

401
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,958
- FOR ONE, MY HEART'S POUNDING,

402
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,791
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
I'M GOIN' TO DO.

403
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,166
- YEAH?

404
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,625
- I MEAN, I FIND RACING
TO BE AS FUN AND EXCITING

405
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:49,208
AS THE NEXT GUY.

406
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:52,083
I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW SUCCESSFUL
I'LL BE SHOULD I REACH A POINT

407
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,291
WHERE I'M NO LONGER COMFORTABLE.

408
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,791
- Narrator: THIS IS
A VERY DIFFERENT TAKUMI

409
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,958
THAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST
AND HE'S FIRED UP!

410
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,500
NEXT ON INITIAL D.
THE LAST BATTLE.

411
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,541
DON'T MISS IT!
