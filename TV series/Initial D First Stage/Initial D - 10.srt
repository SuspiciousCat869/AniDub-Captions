GO!

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,625
- Takeshi: I'VE BEEN
USING THE ABS HARD

19
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,166
AND FORCING THE
STEERING TO DO WHAT

20
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,041
I NEED IT TO DO. PROBLEM IS IT'S
MAKING THE LOAD ON THE FRONT

21
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,916
TIRES A LOT HEAVIER
THAN I'D HOPED.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,958
THIS RACE JUST GOT
A WHOLE LOT HARDER!

23
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,541
THE FIVE HAIRPINS
ARE COMING UP SOON.

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,833
IT'S THE EXACT SAME SPOT WHERE
HE LEFT YOU IN THE DUST.

25
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,541
AND HE'S ABOUT TO DO
THE SAME THING TO TAKESHI.

26
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,958
( tires screeching )

27
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,833
Boy 1: WHOA! HE'S RIGHT
ON HIS TAIL!

28
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,791
THIS IS INSANE! HOW'S NAKAZATO
HAVING TROUBLE SHAKING OFF

29
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,750
A RUSTY OLD EIGHT-SIX?

30
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,083
Boy 2: THE EIGHT-SIX IS DOING
IT'S BRAKING DRIFT!

31
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,500
PHENOMENAL!

32
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,000
- THAT'S AN FC.

33
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,791
- DUDE, I THINK
THAT WAS RYOSUKE!

34
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,166
- I WATCHED KEISKUE TAKAHASHI
LOSE TO THIS KID ON THESE FIVE

35
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,250
HAIRPINS THAT ARE COMING UP
SOON. HE MADE THE PASS BY USING

36
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,750
THE SHOULDER ON EACH
OF THE TURNS.

37
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,333
MAN, LOOK AT THAT THREE-TWO!

38
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,125
HE ISN'T GIVING UP AN INCH ON
THAT INSIDE LINE.

39
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,125
- THAT IS HIS STYLE. WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO NOW, EIGHT-SIX?

40
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,458
All: WHOA!

41
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,291
WHAT THE HELL?
HE'S GOING TO THE OUTSIDE?

42
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,666
- HOLY CRAP!
- HE'S COMING RIGHT AT US!

43
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,333
MAKIN' A MOVE ON THE OUTSIDE.

44
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,708
WHAT DOES HE TAKE
ME FOR, A CHUMP?

45
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,750
Ryosuke: LOOK AT THE
THREE-TWO TAKE OFF.

46
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,500
ITS ACCELERATION
IS AMAZING.

47
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,583
YEAH, BUT HOW ABOUT THE
EIGHT-SIX? DUDE ALMOST PULLED

48
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,583
OFF AN IMPOSSIBLE MOVE WITH JUST
MILLIMETERS TO SPARE.

49
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,666
- ONLY THREE TURNS LEFT.

50
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,541
IF HE'S GONNA MAKE A MOVE
IT HAS TO BE NOW.

51
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,791
HE'S GOING OUTSIDE AGAIN?
NO WAY!

52
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,041
NOW I'M PISSED! KEEP PUSHIN' MY
BUTTONS AND YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF

53
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,500
FLYING OFF THE SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAIN!

54
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,916
LOOKS LIKE NAKAZATO'S BEGINNING
TO LOSE HIS PATIENCE. YOU CAN

55
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,250
SEE IT IN THE WAY HE TOOK THE
LAST CORNER SO AGGRESSIVELY.

56
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,458
NOW WATCH CLOSELY, KEISUKE. THE
KID IS ABOUT TO MAKE A MOVE.

57
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,916
- MAKE A MOVE? REALLY? THERE'S
NO ROOM ON THE INSIDE.

58
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,958
HOW DOES HE EXPECT TO PASS?

59
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,708
TAKUMI'S MAKIN' A MOVE FOR THE
LEAD? THAT IS SO AWESOME!

60
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,541
- COME ON!
- YEAH, TAKUMI!

61
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,833
THIS IS FREAKIN' HUMILIATING.
YOU'RE EITHER BRAVE OR STUPID

62
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,791
FOR TAUNTIN' ME FROM THE OUTSIDE
IN FRONT OF ALL THESE PEOPLE.

63
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,750
I CAN'T ATTACK THE CORNER,
BECAUSE I HAVE TO PROTECT THE

64
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,250
INSIDE. I NEED TO KEEP HIM FAR
ENOUGH AWAY TO MAKE THIS NEXT

65
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:36,708
TURN. ONE CAR LENGTH SHOULD BE
JUST ABOUT ENOUGH. THAT WAY I

66
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:40,125
CAN GO IN WITH AS
MUCH SPEED AS POSSIBLE!

67
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,291
OH, GOOD. IDIOT'S GOIN' OUTSIDE.

68
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,250
( heartbeat sounding )

69
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,875
- ( heartbeat increasing)

70
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,583
WAIT. WHERE'D HE GO?

71
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,875
IT CAN'T BE!

72
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,541
WHAT THE HELL?

73
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,916
DAMN IT! STUPID UNDERSTEER IS
ACTING UP ON ME!

74
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,916
HE FAKED GOING TO THE OUTSIDE
AND THEN CUT BACK IN DURING THE

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,708
BRAKE. ALL IN AN EIGHT-SIX?

76
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,916
HOW'S HE PULLING
TRICKS LIKE THAT?

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,875
BUT THE RACE ISN'T OVER YET. I
STILL HAVE TIME TO REGAIN THE

78
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,541
LEAD IF I BLAST PAST HIM IN
SECOND GEAR!

79
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,041

89
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,083
MYSELF START THINKING LIKE THAT.
IT'S MY FAULT. THE CAR DIDN'T

90
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:35,083
LOSE, I DID. I CAN'T BLAME THE
CAR FOR MY OWN MISTAKES.

91
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,375
I HAD NO IDEA WHO I WAS
GOING UP AGAINST.

92
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,833
SURE, I'M SHOCKED THAT I LOST.
BUT IN A STRANGE WAY, I FEEL

93
00:08:53,916 --> 00:09:00,416
SATISFIED. BECAUSE DEEP DOWN I
KNOW I GAVE IT ALL I HAD.

94
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,083
DOESN'T THAT JUST SUCK.

95
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:06,833
THIS'LL COST ME A COOL 70
THOUSAND YEN TO GET FIXED.

96
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,333
I GUESS ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR ME
TO DO IS TRAIN HARDER

97
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,375
AND HOPE FOR A REMATCH.

98
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,625
Itsuki: HE DID IT! TAKUMI WON!

99
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,291
( laughs )

100
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,333
MAN, HE KICKED THAT THREE-TWO
RIGHT IN THE BUTT! THAT'S TWO IN

101
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,166
A ROW, AND BOTH TIMES
HE WAS THE UNDERDOG!

102
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,000
WE GOTTA REAL WINNER
ON OUR HANDS!

103
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,583
- YEAH.
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

104
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,833
- THEY'RE SAYING THE EIGHT-SIX
PASSED THE THREE-TWO

105
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,541
ON THE FOURTH HAIRPIN!

106
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,958
- THE THREE-TWO LOST?
THAT'S INSANE!

107
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,000
( laughing )

108
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,125
THAT EIGHT-SIX LOOKED LIKE A
JUNKER. HOW COULD IT'VE WON?

109
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,666
IT'S CRAZY MAN.

110
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,958
- LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE RIGHT ON
THE MONEY, BUNTA. GOOD CALL.

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,416
OF ALL THE RIDES YOU
AND I HAVE BEEN ON,

112
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,416
I THINK THIS ONE WAS BY FAR THE
MOST. EDUCATIONAL.

113
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,708
YEAH. THAT MOVE HE PULLED.

114
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,416
WAS THE SMARTEST MOVE
I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE.

115
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,333
HE FAKED GOING OUTSIDE, THEN CUT
BACK IN WITH HIS FOOT SLAMMED ON

116
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:12,833
THE BRAKE, RIDING THE
SHOULDER THE WHOLE WAY.

117
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,916
HE MUST HAVE A KILLER
ABS ON THAT PUPPY

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,916
TO GET THAT KINDA MOVEMENT.

119
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,458
IF YOU DIDN'T LOOK SO SERIOUS,
I'D SWEAR YOU WERE MESSING WITH

120
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,833
ME. THE EIGHT-SIX
DOESN'T COME WITH ABS.

121
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,750
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
COMMON KNOWLEDGE.

122
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,250
- YOU SURE 'BOUT THAT?

123
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,291
- THE 8-6'S BRAKING
SYSTEM IS ITS DRIVER.

124
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,208
STREET RACERS WHO DRIVE CARS
WITH ABS EXCLUSIVELY CAN'T

125
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,583
DEVELOP THE SKILLS IT TAKES TO
MASTER STRICT PEDAL CONTROL,

126
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,125
WHICH YOU NEED IN ORDER TO STOP
JUST BEFORE THE BRAKES LOCK UP.

127
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,583
FACT IS, ABS CAN'T OUTPERFORM
THE SUBTLE NUANCES OF AN

128
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,791
EXPERIENCED DRIVER'S RIGHT FOOT.

129
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,750
A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS
THE KID IN THE EIGHT-SIX.

130
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,208
I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS INTO A RACE
IN A HELLUVA LONG TIME.

131
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,333
THAT EIGHT-SIX IS
AN IDEAL TARGET

132
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,750
FOR US TO SET OUR SIGHTS ON.

133
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,291
IT'LL GIVE US THE
RACE WE DESERVE.

134
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,791
( door opens )

135
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,958
- WHAT'CHA DOING OUT HERE?
HAVIN' A MOMENT WITH THE CAR?

136
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:36,416
- NO. WELL. KINDA.

137
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,625
UM. SO DAD. 'BOUT THE CAR.
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

138
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,208
- SPIT IT OUT, SON.

139
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,625
- FORGOT WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.
IT WASN'T IMPORTANT ANYWAY.

140
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,125
ALRIGHT, WELL I GUESS
I'M GOING TO BED.

141
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
- Narrator: INITIAL D.

142
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,291
- Narrator: INITIAL D.

143
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,250
( gasping )

144
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,916
- ( chuckles )

145
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,500
I BOUGHT MY VERY OWN EIGHT-SIX!
I WANTED TO KEEP IT A SECRET

146
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,916
'TILL IT GOT HERE, BUT MAN,
AIN'T SHE A BEAUT?

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,750
- Kenji: OOH, LOOKS LIKE IT'S
IN GOOD SHAPE.

148
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,333
- Iketani: SO YOU
FINALLY CONVINCED YOUR DAD

149
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,458
TO CO-SIGN FOR YOU!
THAT'S AWESOME!

150
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,500
- Itsuki: WELL. UM. THE GUYS
AT THE SHOP I BOUGHT IT FROM

151
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,083
WERE COOL AND THEY
GAVE ME A PRETTY SWEET DEAL.

152
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,083
MAN, I'M PUMPED TO HAVE
IT. IT'S SO SWEET!

153
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,166
- WHOEVER HAD IT BEFORE
TOOK GOOD CARE OF IT.

154
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,333
YOU'RE LUCKY, DUDE!

155
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,833
- I GOTTA SAY, ITSUKI. I'M
ACTUALLY A LITTLE SURPRISED

156
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,041
YOU WENT THROUGH WITH IT.

157
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,541
- IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I HAD TO DO.

158
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,125
YOU'VE SET THE BAR PRETTY HIGH,

159
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,000
SO GETTING MY OWN RIDE IS JUST
THE FIRST STEP TO MEETING YOU

160
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,500
THERE. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT I'LL
BE DRIFTIN' WITH YOU, MIGHT EVEN

161
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,250
GIVE YOU A RUN FOR
YOUR MONEY SOMEDAY.

162
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,375
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY GOT HIS
CONFIDENCE BACK.

163
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,458
- MAYBE SOME. DUDE,

164
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,791
I DIDN'T SLEEP A SINGLE
WINK LAST NIGHT.

165
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,291
I COULDN'T STOP OBSESSING
OVER MY NEW PIMP-MOBILE!

166
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,875
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

167
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,250
- I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT FEELS
LIKE, MAN. THE NIGHT BEFORE I

168
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,041
GOT MY S-THIRTEEN ALL I DID WAS
STARE AT THE CEILING AND SMILE.

169
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,458
- I OWN MY OWN CAR! I'VE BEEN
WAITING MY ENTIRE LIFE TO SAY

170
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,000
THOSE WORDS! IT'S ALL MINE.

171
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,416
IF I'M DREAMING RIGHT NOW, DON'T
ANYBODY WAKE ME UP!

172
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,333
- THAT'S BADASS MAN,

173
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,333
IT CAME WITH SEVENTIES TIRES
AND THE ORIGINAL HUBCAPS.

174
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,833
WHY DON'T YOU START
HER UP FOR US, ITSUKI?

175
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,750
WE WANNA HEAR IT PURR!

176
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,833
- NOW YOU'RE TALKIN'!

177
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,750
( exclaims happily )

178
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,583
DOES SOMETHING SOUND A LITTLE
OFF TO YOU?

179
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,041
- YEAH, I HEAR IT.

180
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,916
THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE ORIGINAL MUFFLER?

181
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,791
- I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
I'LL JUST PICK UP A NEW MUFFLER.

182
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,458
I WANT MINE TO SOUND LIKE A BIG,
BEEFY, FIRE-BREATHING DRAGON,

183
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,666
JUST LIKE TAKUMI'S TRUENO!

184
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,416
- YOU BETTER POP THE HOOD,
ISTUKI. I DON'T WANT

185
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,666
TO WORRY YOU, BUT SOMETHING
DOESN'T SOUND QUITE RIGHT.

186
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,250
- JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.
- WHAT, BOSS?

187
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,875
- PROMISE YOU WON'T FREAK
OUT ON ME. OKAY?

188
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,958
- WAIT. WHY WOULD I FREAK OUT?

189
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:42,416
- THIS IS NO EIGHT-SIX.
IT'S AN EIGHT-FIVE.

190
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,541
- THIS IS AN EIGHT-FIVE? WAIT,
DO YOU MEAN, THE AE-EIGHT-FIVE?

191
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,708
- WHAT?

192
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,583
( sniggering )

193
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,041
- ( all laughing )

194
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,583
YOUR CAR MIGHT LOOK LIKE AN 8-6-
BUT POP THE HOOD. I MEAN, IT'S

195
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:02,291
LIKE COMPARING. A HAWK AND A
DAMN HUMMINGBIRD!

196
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,708
THE EIGHT-SIX HAS A
DUAL OVERHEAD CAM

197
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,208
AND THE EIGHT-FIVE ONLY
HAS THE SINGLE!

198
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,416
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE DOHC AND
SOHC ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT?

199
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,375
- DIDN'T YOU CHECK THE ENGINE?

200
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,291
- DUMBASS!

201
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,583
- SORRY WE'RE LAUGHIN'
AT YOU MAN.

202
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,375
BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT, THAT IS
PRETTY FREAKIN' HILARIOUS!

203
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,791
- HOLY CRAP, I THINK
I'M GONNA FAINT!

204
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,541
- ITSUKI, WAIT!

205
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,583
( crying )

206
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,250
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
BE JERKS ABOUT IT.

207
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,208
TRY TO PUT YOURSELVES
IN HIS POSITION.

208
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,625
- WE'RE SORRY ABOUT THAT, BOSS.
- YEAH, SORRY 'BOUT THAT, DUDE.

209
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,458
- ITSUKI!

210
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,833
- LEAVE ME ALONE! I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

211
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,000
- I'M SORRY MAN.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

212
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,291
- I WOULD'VE BROUGHT YOU GUYS
ALONG TO HELP ME BUY IT BUT I

213
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,291
WANTED TO SURPRISE EVERYONE.
I'M SO STUPID.

214
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,916
I KNEW THE PRICE WAS TOO LOW FOR
IT TO BE A REAL EIGHT-SIX BUT I

215
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,166
WENT AHEAD AND
BOUGHT IT ANYWAY.

216
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,333
GOD, I'M SO EMBARRASSED
RIGHT NOW.

217
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,833
YOU GUYS MUST THINK I AM
SUCH AN IDIOT.

218
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,583
YOU MIGHT NOT BE LAUGHING RIGHT
NOW, BUT I KNOW YOU ARE INSIDE.

219
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,416
- DUDE, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

220
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,791
THE TRUTH IS. I ACTUALLY ENVY
YOU IN A LOTTA WAYS, ITSUKI.

221
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:34,083
- WHAT? YOU ENVY ME? HOW CAN YOU
LIE RIGHT TO MY FACE?

222
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,416
- I'M NOT LYING ABOUT ANYTHING.
YOU'RE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND

223
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,750
YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO GO
ANYWHERE YOU WANT IN YOUR OWN

224
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,833
CAR. DO YOU REALIZE
HOW AWESOME THAT IS?

225
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,416
- I GUESS THAT IS PRETTY SWEET.

226
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,916
- IT IS. AND WHO CARES IF IT'S
AN EIGHT-FIVE INSTEAD OF AN 8-6,

227
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,291
IT HAS AN ENGINE, FOUR TIRES AND
TWO CUP HOLDERS RIGHT?

228
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,791
IT MAY NOT HAVE A LOT OF POWER,
BUT WHEN YOU'RE GOING DOWNHILL

229
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,208
POWER DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

230
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,750
YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE TO
PRACTICE YOUR SKILLS.

231
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,375
JUST ENJOY YOUR CAR.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FOR.

232
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,625
- YOU'VE CHANGED LATELY,
Y'KNOW THAT?

233
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,166
- I HAVE?

234
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,333
- SURE. BEFORE YOU NEVER SEEMED
TO GIVE A CRAP ABOUT CARS.

235
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,916
YOU KNOW. I THINK I'M OKAY WITH
BUYING THE EIGHT-FIVE. I'M SORTA

236
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,500
PROUD OF IT EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T
QUITE WHAT I MEANT TO BUY. AND

237
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,416
MAYBE I'M NOT READY TO OWN AN
EIGHT-SIX JUST YET.

238
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,375
- MAYBE NOT.

239
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,833
- HEY, WATCH IT, I DIDN'T ASK
YOU TO AGREE WITH ME!

240
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,833
I JUST HAD A GREAT IDEA! I
SHOULD TAKE IT FOR A SPIN ON

241
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,041
MOUNT AKINA TONIGHT! MAYBE
WANNA. COME WITH ME?

242
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,458
- HELL YEAH. BUT ONLY IF
YOU LET ME RIDE SHOTGUN.

243
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,958
- WHENEVER YOU WANT.

244
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,750
( laughs )

245
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,000
I'LL SWING BY YOUR
HOUSE TONIGHT.

246
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,583
TEN O'CLOCK. SOUND GOOD TO YOU?

247
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,000
- SURE.

248
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,916
- AND DOWN SOME COFFEE, I DON'T
WANT YOU FALLING ASLEEP!

249
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,958
( tires screeching )

250
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,541
I DIDN'T GET TO
SEE THE EIGHT-SIX

251
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,833
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT.

252
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,083
- ME EITHER, BUT I DO WANNA
TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

253
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,583
- I DON'T SEE HOW AN EIGHT-SIX
COULD COME EVEN CLOSE TO BEATIN'

254
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,000
OUT A MONSTER LIKE
THE THREE-TWO.

255
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,541
THINK IT'S HIM?

256
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,458
YEAH! THAT RULED! I'M THE NEW
MASTER OF AKINA PASS!

257
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,875
IT'S PRETTY SLOW ON
THE STRAIGHTAWAYS

258
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,375
BUT IT SURE DOES TAKE THOSE

259
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,583
CORNERS LIKE THE REAL DEAL,
DOESN'T IT. ISN'T IT SWEET?

260
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,625
IT SURE IS.

261
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,458
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU
DOING, ITSUKI?

262
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,583
YA KNOW. I JUST NOTICED ONE OF
THE COOLEST THINGS ABOUT MY NEW

263
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,250
WHEELS IS THAT THE FARTHER
BACK FROM IT YOU STAND,

264
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,791
THE SEXIER IT GETS!

265
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,666
I LOVE MY LEVIN SO FREAKIN'
MUCH! HOLY CRAP. I'M SO GLAD I

266
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,125
BOUGHT IT! LEVINS ARE
SO DARN COOL!

267
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,458
YEP. I'M HAPPY
YOU'RE HAPPY, MAN.

268
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,500
- AW, GIMME A BREAK,
THEY'RE JUST KIDS.

269
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,125
- THERE'S NO WAY IT'S THEM.

270
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,708
- WE HEARD SOME DUDE BEAT A
THREE-TWO IN A BEAT UP OLD

271
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,416
EIGHT-SIX, BUT NO WAY
IT'S SOME KID.

272
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,541
- DUH.

273
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,625
- YEAH, HOW OLD ARE
YOU TWO SNOTS?

274
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,208
YOU BETTER HAVE A DRIVER'S

275
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,250
LICENSE ON YOU. OTHERWISE I'LL
HAVE TO CALL THE FUZZ UP HERE.

276
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,291
- I HAVE MINE WITH ME!
I KNOW I MAY LOOK YOUNG

277
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,583
BUT I SWEAR I'M
EIGHTEEN, SERIOUSLY!

278
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,208
- WHO THE HELL DO THESE
GUYS THINK THEY ARE?

279
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,416
- OKAY, I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH.
LEAVE 'EM ALONE.

280
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
- I AIN'T DONE WITH 'EM YET. I
CAN'T STAND THAT A LITTLE PUKE

281
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,958
LIKE THIS IS DRIVIN'
AN EIGHT-SIX,

282
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,791
PRETENDIN' TO BE A STREET RACER.

283
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,166
- I TAKE IT YOU TWO ARE FROM
AROUND HERE. WE'VE BEEN HEARING

284
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,458
RUMOURS ABOUT THE FAMOUS
'EIGHT-SIX OF MOUNT AKINA'.

285
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,708
THAT RING A BELL?

286
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,291
- DON'T PLAY STUPID WITH
US BOOSTER-SEAT,

287
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,875
WE KNOW YOU'VE HEARD OF IT.

288
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,166
- THAT EIGHT-SIX. YEAH, SURE, OF
COURSE WE'VE HEARD OF IT BEFORE,

289
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,083
BUT HE PROBABLY WON'T BE COMING
UP HERE TONIGHT. SORRY.

290
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,333
- WELL, ISN'T THAT GREAT. WE
CAME ALL THIS WAY FOR NOTHIN'.

291
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,916
- LET'S JET.

292
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,833
LISTEN KID. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE HERE. IF YOU WANNA

293
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,041
PRETEND TO BE A STREET RACER
THEN THE LEAST YOU CAN DO

294
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,708
IS START LOOKIN' LIKE ONE.

295
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,791
I MEAN LOOK AT THIS PILE YOU'RE
DRIVIN'. SURE IT'S AN EIGHT-SIX

296
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,291
BUT IT'S NOTHIN' SPECIAL.

297
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,958
YOU DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
TO PUT NEW TIRES ON.

298
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,000
IT'S A PITIFUL RIDE. AND DUDE,
CHANGE THE MUFFLER WHILE YOU'RE

299
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,875
AT IT 'CAUSE IT
SOUNDS PUSSIFIED.

300
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,791
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU
KNOW A DAMN THING

301
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,791
ABOUT THE EIGHT-SIX. DUMBASS.

302
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,708
- WELL. TECHNICALLY THIS ISN'T
EVEN AN EIGHT-SIX. IT'S ACTUALLY

303
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,041
JUST A REGULAR OLD EIGHT-FIVE.
SO. I'M NOT SURE A NEW MUFFLER

304
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,250
WOULD MAKE THAT MUCH OF A
DIFFERENCE. BUT I HAVE BEEN

305
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,833
THINKIN' ABOUT PICKIN'
ONE UP PRETTY SOON.

306
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,750
- WAIT, THAT'S AN EIGHT-FIVE?

307
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,250
( laughing )

308
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,625
ONLY PLACE YOU'LL FIND A MUFFLER
FOR AN EIGHT-FIVE IS IN A

309
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:50,708
JUNKYARD. THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE
'EM FOR THE AFTERMARKET ANYMORE.

310
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,083
TOUGH LUCK DUDE!

311
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,166
- OH MAN THAT IS HYSTERICAL!
YOU GOTTA BE PRETTY HARD

312
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,000
UP TO BE DRIVIN' AN
EIGHT-FIVE NOWADAYS!

313
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,916
- IT'S PERFECT FOR YOU, KID.
SUITS YOUR PERSONALITY.

314
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,958
- C'MON, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
THANKS FOR THE LAUGHS KID.

315
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,083
-APPRECIATE IT.

316
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,416
- CAREFUL ON YOUR WAY BACK DOWN.

317
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,500
DON'T WANNA GET YOUR ASS
HANDED TO YOU BY A SCOOTER.

318
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,750
- THAT'S ENOUGH. NOW I'M GONNA
MAKE THOSE JERKS PAY. I HOPE YOU

319
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,375
DON'T MIND IF I DRIVE YOUR CAR.
JUMP IN THE PASSENGER SEAT!

320
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,416
- WHAT?

321
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,791
- DUDE, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME TO ARGUE!

322
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,375
HURRY UP AND GET IN! COME ON!

323
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,125

DOING, DUDE? CHASIN' EM? DON'T

324
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,416
FORGET, THIS ISN'T YOUR RIDE.
IT'S JUST AN EIGHT-FIVE WITH

325
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,000
LOOSE SUSPENSION AND
TIRES FROM THE SEVENTIES!

326
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,541
- DOES IT LOOK LIKE I CARE?

327
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,666
- WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS,
TAKUMI! I MEAN, THIS CAR DOESN'T

328
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,250
EVEN HAVE LIMITED
SLIP DIFFERENTIAL!

329
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,541
- SHUT UP, I CAN BARELY THINK!
YOU'RE GONNA WANNA BUCKLE UP.

330
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,791
I HAVE TO WARN YOU, IT MAY SEEM
LIKE I'M BEING ROUGH WITH YOUR

331
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,250
CAR- BUT IT WON'T BE ANYTHING
SHE CAN'T HANDLE. I PROMISE NO

332
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:07,416
MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WON'T
WRECK YOUR NEW WHEELS, TRUST ME?

333
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,375
LET'S GO!

334
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,458

335
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,583
- TAKUMI, WAIT!

336
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,583
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS!
DON'T YOU DO THIS, THIS IS

337
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:26,208
