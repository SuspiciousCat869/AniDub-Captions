1
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:12,666
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,125
♪ BREAK INTO THE NIGHT
IT'S THE TIME ♪

4
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,708
- Yuuichi: THEY'RE FOR YOU, KID.

5
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,625
- WAIT, WHO'S SENDING ME
FLOWERS AT WORK?

6
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,166
- RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

7
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,458
- RYOSUKE.

8
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,583
- TAKAHASHI.

9
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,708
- LESS POWER EQUALS MORE SPEED.

10
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,958
IT MUST BE DUE TO THE
WAY HE ENTERS HIS CORNERS.

11
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,458
THERE'S NO WAY
MY BROTHER WILL LOSE NOW.

12
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,958
HE'S JUST TOO DAMN SMART.

13
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,583
- A BATTLE?

14
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,750
- MM-HMM.

15
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,375
- SO. LIKE A FISTFIGHT?

16
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,625
- NO. A BATTLE IS A RACE.

17
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,541
TWO DRIVERS GOING UP
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

18
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,583
- IF YOU DON'T WANNA RACE,
JUST BLOW HIM OFF.

19
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,250
- NAH, IT'S NOT LIKE
I DON'T WANNA RACE THE GUY.

20
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,708
I MEAN, I MIGHT
EVEN LOSE TO HIM.

21
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,416
BUT I DON'T
WANNA NOT RACE HIM.

22
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,416
- YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE
TAKUMI HAS A CHANCE

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,750
AT WINNING THIS THING, DO YOU?

24
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,041
- NO. HE'S ONE OF THE MOST
TALENTED RACERS I KNOW,

25
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,291
BUT HE'S STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

26
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,791
NOT ONLY DO I THINK
HE'LL LOSE THE RACE,

27
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,250
I WONDER IF HE'LL
FINISH IN ONE PIECE.

28
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:40,250
- THE ONLY REASON I BELIEVE
TAKUMI HAS A CHANCE IS

29
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:44,000
HE HAS BUNTA'S BLOOD
PUMPING THROUGH HIS VEINS.

30
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,958
AND BUNTA'S ONE CRAZY
SON-OF-A-BITCH.

31
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,541
- KEISUKE. THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANTED TO RUN BY YOU

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,833
THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

33
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,208
WHEN THE DAY COMES THAT I
LOSE MY FIRST STREET RACE,

34
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,625
I'LL RETIRE.

35
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,916
BY THE WAY, THERE ARE ONLY
TWO RACERS ALIVE WHO I FEEL

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,041
HAVE A LEGITIMATE CHANCE
AT BEATING ME SOMEDAY.

37
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,750
AND THE FIRST ONE ON THAT LIST
HAS TO BE YOU, KEISUKE.

38
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,875
- REALLY?

39
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,291
- AND THE OTHER
WOULD HAVE TO BE...

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,166
- ( car approaching )

41
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,583
- TAKUMI!

42
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,583
- GOOD LUCK OUT THERE, BUDDY.

43
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,458
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I BELIEVE IN YOU!

44
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,250
YOU CAN TAKE THIS GUY, DUDE!

45
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,500
AFTER YOU PUT RYOSUKE
IN HIS PLACE

46
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,666
YOU'LL BECOME THE FASTEST RACER
IN ALL OF GUNMA!

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,083
TAKUMI! TAKUMI!

48
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,166
- Iketani: OKAY, ITSUKI,
I THINK HE GETS THE GIST.

49
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,041
NOW GIVE HIM SOME
BREATHIN' ROOM ALREADY!

50
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,333
- Keisuke: YOU'RE LATE.

51
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,916
YOU'RE STILL AS IGNORANT
AS THE DAY I RACED YA.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,125
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
HERE BY TEN.

53
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,291
- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

54
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,583
I FIND IT IMPRESSIVE THAT YOU'VE
BEEN ABLE TO LEARN SO MANY

55
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,833
ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

56
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,166
IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME,

57
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,750
GIVEN OF COURSE THAT
YOU'RE STILL A TEENAGER.

58
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,958
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL. I'VE
PROBABLY DRIVEN AKINA PASS

59
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,875
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE SO I'M
JUST REALLY USED TO IT.

60
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,416
I DON'T KNOW ANY SPECIAL
TECHNIQUES OR ANYTHING.

61
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,166
I JUST LIKE TO DRIVE.

62
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,083
HONESTLY, I THINK YOU'RE
OVERESTIMATING

63
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,375
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

64
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,791
THE FACT IS, I'M NOT AS GOOD
AS YOU THINK I AM.

65
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,208
- ( scoffs )

66
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,375
THAT'S AN INTERESTING WAY
OF LOOKING AT IT.

67
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,125
EITHER YOU'RE EXTREMELY MODEST
OR YOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

68
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,125
THE EXTENT
OF YOUR OWN POTENTIAL.

69
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,416
YOU ARE QUITE A UNIQUE KID.

70
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,166
MAYBE SOMEDAY YOU AND I
CAN CHEW THE FAT TOGETHER.

71
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,958
- WE'RE DOIN' THIS?

72
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,125
- LET'S GET THIS RACE STARTED.

73
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,166
IT SHOULD BE
A FUN EVENING FOR US.

74
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,958
- Keisuke: ALRIGHT!
GET THESE CARS OFF THE ROAD!

75
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,291
- ( engines starting )

76
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,625
- ( engines revving )

77
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,000
- IS IT COOL WITH YOU IF THE
RED SUNS OVERSEE THE RACE?

78
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,166
- Iketani: SURE.

79
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,541
- Keisuke: LET'S GET SOME GUYS
FROM THE SPEED STARS

80
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,750
TO BE OFFICIALS TOO.

81
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,041
- Iketani: SOUNDS GOOD.

82
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,333
- Boy 1: IKETANI.
I'LL BE AT THE FINISH.

83
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,708
- Iketani: COOL.
BE AWAKE DOWN THERE.

84
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,916
- Boy 2: KEISUKE. I'LL SET UP
AT THE FIVE HAIRPINS.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,500
- Keisuke: OKAY.

86
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,666
- Boy 3: RYOSUKE'S GONNA BLOW
THIS KID OUTTA THE WATER, RIGHT?

87
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,250
WE'RE GONNA GET THIS GUY!

88
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,416
- Keisuke: OF COURSE WE ARE.
I DON'T CARE HOW FAST HE IS,

89
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,375
THERE'S NOT A PERSON ON THIS
PLANET WHO CAN BEAT MY BROTHER.

90
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,458
- Boy 3: I HEAR YA.
ALRIGHT, I'M OFF!

91
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,958
- ( phone rings )

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,625
- ( grunts )

93
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,250
HELLO? FUJIWARA TOFU.

94
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,416
OH HEY,
IT'S YOU, ISN'T IT?

95
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,833
- YEAH, BUNTA, IT'S ME.

96
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,916
I JUST GOT TO AKINA
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,333
YOU'D BE AMAZED AT HOW MANY
PEOPLE ARE HERE TONIGHT.

98
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,625
IT'S CRAZY!

99
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,958
- YEAH? SO, IS THAT IT?

100
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,333
- SO. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

101
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,541
CAN TAKUMI PULL OUT
A WIN TONIGHT?

102
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,500
PEOPLE ARE SAYING HIS OPPONENT
IS A STREET RACING KING,

103
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,583
THE FASTEST IN ALL OF GUNMA!

104
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,083
- WHO GIVES A CRAP?

105
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,000
IF THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
YOU BOTHERED CALLING,

106
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,416
THEN I'M GONNA HANG UP.

107
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,708
- NO NO WAIT, DON'T HANG UP YET!
I'M NOT DONE TALKING!

108
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,916
- ( phone hangs up )

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
- DAMN IT, I TOLD YOU
NOT TO HANG UP!

110
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,125
- ( panting )

111
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,291
- ALRIGHT EVERYONE,
CHECK IN FROM YOUR POSTS.

112
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,458
HOW'RE THE CORNERS
LOOKIN'OUT THERE?

113
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,541
- Boy 1: COPY THAT. WE'RE ALL
GOOD HERE AT THE FIRST CORNER.

114
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,958
READY WHEN YOU ARE.

115
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,416
- Boy 2: SKATE CENTER
CHECKIN' IN.

116
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,458
THE STRAIGHTAWAY
IS LOOKIN' NICE AND CLEAR.

117
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,875
- Boy 3: SAME GOES FOR
THE SEVENTEENTH HAIRPIN.

118
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,416
WE'RE ALL SET.

119
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,166
- Boy 4: FIVE HAIRPINS HERE.
THERE'S NOT A CAR IN SIGHT.

120
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,833
WE'RE READY AND WAITIN'.

121
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,625
- Boy 5: THIS IS NUMBER SIX.

122
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,833
THE SPECTATORS'
CARS'VE BEEN CLEARED

123
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,541
FROM THE ROAD. JUST
WAITIN' FOR THE START.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,416
- MAN. I'M SO NERVOUS!

125
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,750
MY THROAT'S TOTALLY DRY
AND MY HEART FEELS

126
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,541
LIKE IT'S GONNA BEAT
OUTTA MY CHEST!

127
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,208
- I'VE NEVER SEEN A CROWD ACT
THIS ANXIOUS BEFORE A RACE.

128
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,583
YOU COULD CUT THE
TENSION WITH A KNIFE!

129
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:08,166
- Itsuki: YEAH. I WONDER
IF TAKUMI'S FEELIN' NERVOUS.

130
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,916
- TAKUMI. YOU'RE RACING
AGAINST THE BEST OF THE BEST.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,041
WHETHER YOU WIN OR NOT
DOESN'T MATTER,

132
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,541
JUST DRIVE YOUR HEART OUT.

133
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,875
- COME ON, TAKUMI!
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS!

134
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,458
BRING HOME A WIN
FOR THE SPEED STARS!

135
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,083
- I'M CONFIDENT MY BROTHER'S
GONNA WIN TONIGHT.

136
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,000
BUT WHENEVER THE EIGHT-SIX
IS ON THIS PASS,

137
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,208
SOMETHING UNEXPECTED
ALWAYS TENDS TO HAPPEN.

138
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,000
I JUST HOPE
IT'S IN OUR FAVOR.

139
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,083
- HEY THERE. DID I MISS IT?

140
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,583
- UH-UH. HASN'T STARTED YET.

141
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,458
- REALLY? GOOD. THANKS!

142
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,083
- WE'RE READY HERE
AT THE STARTING LINE.

143
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,166
HOW ARE YOU GUYS LOOKIN'
DOWN THERE AT THE FINISH?

144
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,166
- WE'RE GOOD. ROAD'S CLEAR
AND WE'RE JUST WAITIN' AROUND.

145
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,791
- 'OKAY, LET'S DO THIS. I'M
GONNA START THE COUNTDOWN.

146
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,125
- Keisuke: HOLD UP!

147
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,875
I KNOW IT'S USUALLY YOUR THING

148
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,291
BUT LET ME DO THE
COUNTDOWN THIS TIME.

149
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,458
YOU DON'T MIND, RIGHT?
JUST FOR THIS RACE?

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,250
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

151
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,125
BUT I HAVE TO BE RIGHT UP
FRONT WHEN THEY START.

152
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,625
START YOUR ENGINES!

153
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,000
- ( both engines revving )

154
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,708
- FIVE! FOUR! THREE!

155
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,125
TWO! ONE! GO!

156
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,791
- All: DO IT. TAKUMI!

157
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,291
- ( dance music playing )

158
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:58,041
- DAMN, LOOK AT HIM GO! HE'S
ABOUT TO FLY RIGHT PAST RYOSUKE!

159
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,250
HELL YEAH! TAKUMI JUST
TOOK THE LEAD!

160
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,583
DON'T LET UP!
BEAT HIS ASS, DUDE!

161
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,208
- I SEE MY BRO'S GOIN'
WITH HIS USUAL STRATEGY.

162
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,375
LET THE OPPONENT
TAKE THE EARLY LEAD

163
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,666
SO HE CAN STUDY THEIR MOVEMENTS,

164
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,375
THEN PASS HIM LATE IN THE RACE.

165
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,416
THAT'S THE WAY HE'S BEEN
WINNIN' RACES SINCE DAY ONE.

166
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,166
HIS "FASTEST RACER" THEORY
IS UNSTOPPABLE.

SEE HOW CLOSE THEY'RE DRIFTIN'
WITH EACH OTHER?

177
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,875
- THOSE DRIFTS
THEY'RE TAKIN' ARE HUGE!

178
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,041
THAT AIN'T RYOSUKE'S
STYLE AT ALL!

179
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,708
I WONDER IF HE'S
STARTIN' TO FEEL THE HEAT!

180
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,541
- MAN THE RACE JUST STARTED

181
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,041
AND THEY'RE ALREADY
PUTTIN' ON A SHOW!

- INITIAL D!

183

Announcer: INITIAL D!

184
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,500
- Boy 1: IT'S DRIFT
VERSUS DRIFT!

185
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,541
EVEN RYOSUKE DRIFTED THROUGH
THE FIRST CORNER!

186
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,083
THAT'S UNHEARD OF!

187
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,583
- Itsuki: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I BET HE WANTS TO BEAT TAKUMI

188
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,250
AT HIS OWN GAME BY USING THE
SAME TECHNIQUE.

189
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,583
THAT WAY, IF HE WINS, HE'LL BE
THE UNDISPUTED CHAMPION.

190
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,375
- Boy 1: TAKUMI'S DRIVIN'
A HELLUVA RACE THOUGH.

191
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,375
THIS IS GONNA BE
AN AMAZING FINISH!

192
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,208
- YOU GOTTA WIN THIS, TAKUMI!

193
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,416
DO IT FOR THE SPEED STARS!
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, IKETANI?

194
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,291
- UH YEAH. I GUESS SO.

195
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,708
- ( dance music playing )

196
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,416
- I'M IMPRESSED ONCE AGAIN.

197
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,083
THE EIGHT-SIX HAS NEVER
DRIVEN LIKE THIS BEFORE.

198
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,041
I KNEW IT. HE HAS IMPROVED
SINCE I SAW HIM LAST.

199
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,833
HE BARELY USES
ANY COUNTER-STEERING

200
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:50,375
AS HE STABILIZES DURING THE
FINAL MOMENTS OF HIS DRIFT.

201
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,458
THAT HASN'T CHANGED
SINCE LAST TIME,

202
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,458
BUT HE'S USING LESS
COUNTER-STEER

203
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,750
RIGHT AFTER A
TURN-IN MANEUVER.

204
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:59,791
I DON'T GET IT. IT HASN'T BEEN
VERY LONG SINCE HIS LAST RACE

205
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,291
AND YET HIS WEAKNESS IS GONE,
AS IF IT HAD NEVER EVEN EXISTED.

206
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,958
IT'S AS IF HE IMPROVES
WITH EVERY RUN.

207
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,083
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ALTER
MY ORIGINAL STRATEGY A BIT

208
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,250
BUT THAT'S ALL IT SHOULD TAKE.

209
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,125
THE END RESULT WILL BE THE SAME.

210
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,000
MY "FASTEST RACER" THEORY
IS INVINCIBLE.

211
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,750
- Shingo: HEY, TAKESHI.

212
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,000
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
I DIDN'T PARK HERE

213
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,083
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO WATCH THE RACE

214
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,666
IN THE SAME SPOT AS YOU.

215
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,583
DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IDEA OR ANYTHING.

216
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,291
I WAS PLANNING TO SET UP HERE

217
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,083
BEFORE THE RACE
EVEN GOT STARTED.

218
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,083
SO YEAH,
FIND ANOTHER SPOT.

219
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,041
DON'T THINK SO. I'M NOT STUPID.

220
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,416
I KNOW THIS IS THE BEST VANTAGE
POINT TO WATCH THE RACE FROM.

221
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,208
AND I WAS HERE FIRST,
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A HIKE?

222
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,875
USUALLY ALL THE NEWBIES
AND FANS WANT TO WATCH

223
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,416
FROM THE MOST OBVIOUS PLACES.

224
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,083
THE FIVE HAIRPINS
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.

225
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:02,166
- THAT'S TRUE, BUT RACES ARE
NEVER DECIDED IN THOSE SPOTS.

226
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,666
THIS TURN IS THE ONLY PLACE TO
MAKE A SOLID MOVE FOR THE WIN.

227
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,083
- GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE.

228
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,958
I'M IMPRESSED SHINGO,
DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD IT IN YA.

229
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,541
- HUH. BACK AT YA.

230
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,833
- THIS PLACE IS DEAD.

231
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,458
WE'RE OUT HERE IN THE
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, AREN'T WE?

232
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,375
- PROBLEM IS IF ANYONE DRIVES BY

233
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,458
AND SEES US STANDIN'
HERE TOGETHER

234
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,583
THEY'RE GONNA START THINKIN'

235
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,916
WE'RE ACTUALLY FRIENDS
OR SOMETHIN'.

236
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,666
- Both: SHOOT. CAN'T HAVE THAT!

237
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,375
- ( dance music playing )

238
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,125
- I CAN HEAR 'EM COMING!

239
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,916
- Boy 1: WHOA!

240
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,083
LOOK HOW CLOSE THEY'RE GETTING'
TO THE GUARDRAIL!

241
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,958
- HOLY CRAP! THAT WAS AMAZING!

242
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,416
UH, WHAT THE HELL
AM I WAITING FOR?

243
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,958
I'D BETTER GIVE BUNTA
ANOTHER CALL.

244
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,083
- ( phone rings )

245
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,958
- UGH, NOW WHAT?

246
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,208
HELLO? FUJIWARA.

247
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,083
- HEY BUNTA! IT'S ME AGAIN!

248
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,250
- OH GREAT, WHAT IS IT NOW?

249
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,083
- JUST LISTEN!
YOU GOTTA HEAR THIS!

250
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,250
SO I'M STILL HERE AT THE RACE

251
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,791
AND THEY JUST PASSED
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

252
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,541
THEY WERE BOTH USING
SOME OF THE HEAVIEST DRIFT

253
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,750
I'VE EVER SEEN
THROUGH THIS TURN!

254
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,125
TAKUMI'S EIGHT-SIX
WAS IN THE LEAD

255
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,000
BUT THE FC
WAS RIGHT ON HIS TAIL.

256
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,333
SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE
MISSING ONE HELLUVA RACE!

257
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,125
- YOU SAID TAKUMI WAS
IN THE LEAD, RIGHT?

258
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,000
WELL THAT'S NOT VERY
PROMISING NEWS.

259
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOUR SON'S IN THE LEAD.

260
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,250
- YOU KNOW YOU'RE STARTING TO
SOUND LIKE A NEWBIE, YUUICHI.

261
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,166
IT'S COMMON RACING
KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DRIVER

262
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,708
DOING THE CHASING
HAS A BETTER CHANCE

263
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,291
OF BEING AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE
HE'S NOT ON THE DEFENSIVE.

264
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,416
- HE'S RIGHT.

265
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,291
- Bunta: WHILE BOTH RACERS
CAN STUDY THE COURSE,

266
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,541
THE DRIVER IN THE BACK

267
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,458
CAN ALSO MONITOR
THE RHYTHM OF THE LEAD DRIVER.

268
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,791
IF HE'S GOOD ENOUGH,

269
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,333
HE CAN ALSO COPY THE DRIVING
STYLE OF THE LEADER.

270
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,833
- Yuuichi: BUT WHOEVER'S IN
FRONT CAN ALWAYS JUST DRIVE OFF

271
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,791
AND INCREASE THEIR LEAD.

272
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,166
- THAT'S NOT EASY.

273
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,000
THE DRIVER IN THE LEAD IS UNDER
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE

274
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,583
TO HOLD OFF HIS OPPONENT.

275
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,416
TRYING TO RACE WHILE ANOTHER
CAR IS FOLLOWING YOU

276
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,958
AT THE SAME SPEED CAN PUSH
YOU INTO A MENTAL CORNER

277
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,583
THAT'S VERY HARD
TO GET OUT OF.

278
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,500
AS THE RACE PROGRESSES
WITH YOUR OPPONENT ON YOUR SIX,

279
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,416
THE HARDER YOU TRY
TO INCREASE YOUR LEAD,

280
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,041
THE MORE THREATENING
YOUR OPPONENT WILL SEEM.

281
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,375
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
TAKUMI IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW

282
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,750
TO THESE ADVANCED
RACING TACTICS.

283
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,541
I'D HAVE TO IMAGINE HE'S
REALLY STARTING TO SWEAT

284
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,416
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

285
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,041
- YOU THINK SO?

286
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,000
WELL I'LL GIVE YOU
A CALL WHEN IT'S OVER

287
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,791
AND LET YOU KNOW
HOW YOUR BOY FINISHED.

288
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,125
- FINE.

289
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,708
- MY BOY.
WILL YOU LOSE YOUR COOL?

290
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,208
NAH.

291

ONTO THIS PACE,

308
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,458
THEY'LL BOTH BREAK
THE EIGHT-SIX'S PREVIOUS RECORD

309
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,958
BY AT LEAST SEVEN OR EIGHT
SECONDS, IF NOT MORE!

310
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:57,458
THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT. I'LL CHECK
BACK IN IF I HEAR ANYTHING MORE.

311
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,166
- THEY'RE RUNNIN' SEVEN
OR EIGHT SECONDS FASTER

312
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,666
THAN WHEN I RACED HIM?

313
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,250
GIMME A FREAKIN' BREAK!

314
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,791
SO THIS IS WHAT MY
BROTHER IS CAPABLE OF

315
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,583
WHEN HE GETS IN THE ZONE.

316
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,208
IT'S ALMOST SCARY.

317
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,625
MAN, THIS RACE
IS GONNA BE LEGENDARY.

318
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,750
- SWEET! IT SOUNDS LIKE
TAKUMI'S STILL IN THE LEAD!

319
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,333
- YES! HE'S REALLY GONNA
PULL THIS OFF.

320
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:24,166
- MAYBE SO.
BUT CAN HE KEEP THIS UP?

321
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,500
- REMEMBER. HE'S GOING UP
AGAINST GUNMA'S FASTEST.

322
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,333
SO...

323
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,625
I'LL BE SATISFIED
IF HE CAN FINISH THE RACE...

324
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,333
...WITHOUT CRASHING.
