IS WRONG WITH YOU?

00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,750
OH, NO! KID, YOU ALRIGHT?

23
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,083
JUST HANG IN THERE!
I'LL GET YOU SOME HELP!

24
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,583
- I'M SORRY.
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

25
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,583
I'M SO...

26
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,375
- JUST KEEP IT
TOGETHER, OKAY?

27
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,291
I'M CALLING AN AMBULANCE
RIGHT NOW!

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,541
- ( screams ) WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IKETANI WRECKED HIS CAR?

29
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,125
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

30
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,208
- LAST NIGHT. HE SLAMMED INTO A
GUARDRAIL DOING A DOWNHILL RUN.

31
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,708
- THAT SUCKS. WAS HE HURT?

32
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,666
- YEAH, BUT HE'LL PULL THROUGH.
CUTS AND BRUISES.

33
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,708
MINOR CASE OF WHIPLASH.
YOU KNOW, THE USUAL,

34
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,291
BUT MAINLY, HE'S JUST
REALLY PISSED OFF

35
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,333
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

36
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,000
I HADN'T SEEN IT, BUT I HEARD
HIS CAR GOT PRETTY JACKED UP.

37
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,083
- BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BATTLE
ON SATURDAY?

38
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,708
HE'S SUPPOSED TO
ANCHOR THE RACE.

39
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,083
- WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S IN THE TOILET.

40
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,041
WE GOTTA FIND A SUB-IN FOR HIM
NOW. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO.

41
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,583
- WELCOME, SIR. OH, IKETANI?

42
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,416
HEY, ARE YOU SURE YOU SHOULD
BE UP AND WALKING AROUND?

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,083
- YEAH, DOC SAID IT'S OKAY.

44
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,583
SO HOW'S MY CAR DOIN'?

45
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,666
- STILL IN THE BACK GARAGE.

46
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,291
WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING TO HER YET.

47
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,666
OUR HANDS ARE TIED UNTIL
ALL THE PARTS ARE SHIPPED.

48
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,416
- EXCUSE ME? CAN I GET
SOME FRIED TOFU PLEASE?

49
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,375
- Bunta: SURE. BE RIGHT THERE.

50
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,541
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

51
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,250
- JUST A LITTLE ACCIDENT.

52
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,458
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BATTLE HERE PRETTY SOON.

53
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,125
WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING?

54
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,458
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

55
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,583
I WANTED TO ASK YOU FOR A FAVOR.

56
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,375
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

57
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,208
THE BATTLE'S ON SATURDAY.

58
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,250
I'D LIKE FOR YOU
TO DRIVE IN MY PLACE.

59
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,666
I'M BEGGING YOU.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

60
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,458
( grunting )

61
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,833
MY FREAKIN' NECK, MAN!

62
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,750
- DON'T DIE HERE.

63
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,916
- MR. FUJIWARA, YOU REMEMBER
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,541
TO BE A STREET RACER.

65
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,250
YOU KNOW I CAN'T LET THOSE
OUTSIDERS BEAT US HERE.

66
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,833
- OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND.

67
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,500
BUT IF SOME OLD GEEZER LIKE ME
SHOWED UP WITH ALL THOSE KIDS,

68
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,583
THEY'D THINK I WAS SENILE.

69
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,708
- I'VE SPENT MY LIFE RACING
THOSE CURVES ON AKINA.

70
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,958
RIGHT NOW THE RED SUNS
ARE MAKING ALL OF OUR DRIVERS

71
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,750
LOOK LIKE UNLICENSED
SCHOOL KIDS.

72
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,250
IT'S PISSIN' ME OFF!
I CAN'T LET THIS GO ON!

73
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,458
I WANNA SHOW THEM THAT
AKINA'S GOT MORE THAN THAT!

74
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,666
THAT WE'VE GOT
DRIVERS UP HERE

75
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,875
WITH SKILLS LIKE
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN!

76
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,750
YOU CAN DO THAT! YOU'VE
ALREADY DEFEATED THEIR FASTEST,

77
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,333
THE YOUNGER TAKAHASHI BROTHER.

78
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,000
THIS'D BE NOTHIN' FOR YOU.

79
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,875
I DON'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE
TO TURN TO!

80
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,333
- ( car honks )

81
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,125
- CAN'T YOU SEE THE LIGHTS
ARE OFF. WE'RE ALREADY CLOSED!

82
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,166
- AH, SHUT UP GREASE MONKEY.

83
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,833
FILL HER UP WITH HIGH OCTANE.

84
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,083
- YOU'RE CRAZY IF YOU THINK
I'LL DUMP GOOD HIGH OCTANE

85
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,041
IN THIS OLD EIGHT-SIX!

86
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,416
- HAD TO BE YOU.

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,166
WHO ELSE WOULD'VE TOLD THAT KID
ALL THOSE OLD STORIES ABOUT ME?

88
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,416
- YEAH, IT WAS ME.

89
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,083
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
I WAS LYING ABOUT IT.

90
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,291
I JUST COULDN'T SEE
THE HARM IN TELLING HIM.

91
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,125
- HE CAME INTO MY STORE TODAY
WITH A BANDAGE AROUND HIS HEAD

92
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,666
AND A NECK BRACE ON

93
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,458
ASKING ME TO DRIVE IN HIS PLACE
AT A BATTLE SATURDAY NIGHT.

94
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,125
GOTTA SAY, I WAS
ACTUALLY A LITTLE FLATTERED.

95
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,583
- IF YOU WERE FLATTERED,
THEN GO FOR IT.

96
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,625
NOT LIKE YOU'VE GOT OTHER PLANS.

97
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,500
I KNOW THE KID.
HE'S GOOD PEOPLE.

98
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,250
- NO, THANKS.

99
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,083
STICKING YOUR NOSE
INTO THESE KIDDIE FIGHTS

100
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,833
IS A GOOD WAY
TO GET IT KNOCKED OFF.

101
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,750
ANYWAY THAT'S NOT MY STYLE.

102
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,875
- SO... THEN IT WOULDN'T BE A
PROBLEM IF ANOTHER KID SHOWED UP

103
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,333
FOR THE KIDDIE FIGHT?

104
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,166
- WHAT... YOU MEAN TAKUMI?

105
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.

106
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,625
THE KID'S DEVELOPING
SOME REAL SKILL.

107
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,041
- YEAH, BUT HE'S STILL GOT
A WAYS TO GO.

108
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,250
IF IT'S AKINA'S DOWNHILL
HE'S RACING ON,

109
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,041
THEN IT'S FOR DAMN SURE
HE WOULDN'T LOSE TO ANYONE.

110
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,500
WELL, ANYONE EXCEPT ME.

111
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,541
- ALWAYS THE COMPETITIVE SPIRIT.

112
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,333
- TAKUMI'S THE SAME WAY. BUT HE
WON'T GET OUT THERE AND RACE

113
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,166
UNLESS HE WANTS
TO DO IT FOR HIMSELF,

114
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,083
AND HE SURE AS HELL WON'T GO
IF I SAY I WANT HIM TO.

115
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,666
BUT SEEING IKETANI ALL BEAT
UP MADE ME FEEL BAD

116
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,958
FOR SOME REASON.

117
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,583
MIGHT BE WORTH TRYING.

118
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,250
- ( news report playing )

119
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,625
- THIS COUNTS AS A VERBAL
CONTRACT, I HOPE YOU REALIZE.

120
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,208
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I HATE MORE THAN SMOKERS,

121
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,291
AND I HATE SMOKERS,

122
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,625
IT'S PEOPLE WHO CAN'T
KEEP THEIR WORD.

123
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,125
- HEY, DAD. I WAS THINKING I'D
TAKE THE CAR OUT THIS SUNDAY

124
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,541
IF IT'S COOL BY YOU.

125
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,000
- NOPE. NOT THIS
SUNDAY YOU CAN'T.

126
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,416
- WHY NOT?

127
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,625
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE MORNING
DELIVERY AND EVERYTHING,

128
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,875
JUST LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

129
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,000
- OH, I KNOW YOU WILL.
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.

130
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,708
I GOTTA USE THE CAR TO GO TO A
TOWN MEETING I HAVE ON SUNDAY.

131
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,875
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

132
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,750
YOUR TIMING SUCKS.

133
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,708
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH
I NEEDED THE CAR THIS WEEKEND.

134
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,583
- ( grunts )

135
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,291
MUST BE ABOUT A GIRL, HUH?

136
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,916
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,625
COME ON. QUIT BEING SUCH A PAIN
AND LET ME TAKE IT OUT.

138
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,041
IT'S JUST
A CRAPPY OLD CAR ANYWAY.

139
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,750
AND I'LL TAKE IT IF I WANT TO.

140
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,083
- THAT CAR ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE
WITHOUT A KEY.

141
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,083
AND THAT KEY IS GONNA BE
ON A STRING AROUND MY NECK.

142
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,666
- WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?

143
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,375
- FINE. YOU WANT IT THAT BAD,
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

144
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,666
- THANKS, DAD.
- ON JUST ONE CONDITION.

145
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,250
- WHAT'S THAT?

146
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,791
- GO TO AKINA THIS SATURDAY,

147
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,375
FIND SOME PUNK IN AN FD PEOPLE
SAY IS THE FASTEST ON AKAGI.

148
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,375
AND BEAT THE FIRE OUT OF HIM.

149
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,916
- HOLD ON, YOU WANT ME TO...
WHAT?

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
- DO THAT, AND I'LL LET YOU TAKE
THE CAR OUT, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

151
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,333
I'LL EVEN PUT A FULL TANK
OF GAS IN HER FOR YOU.

152
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,125
- A FULL TANK OF GAS?

153
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,250
WOW, A FULL TANK.

154
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,916
THAT'S TOO GOOD AN OFFER
TO WALK AWAY FROM.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,166
AFTER ALL, I AM DEAD BROKE.

156
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,166
- SO? WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

157
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,166
I'M GONNA NEED A FEW MINUTES
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

158
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,791
- YOU TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED TO, BUDDY.

159
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,916
- ( sighs )

160
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,916
- ( knocking on door )

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
- I'M COMING IN.

162
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,583
- KEISUKE, PERFECT TIMING.

163
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,833
I HAD A QUESTION I WANTED
TO ASK YOU.

164
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,791
- YEAH, SURE.
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

165
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,375
- THE EIGHT-SIX
THAT YOU RAN INTO

166
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,791
WHEN YOU WERE DRIVING ON AKINA.

167
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,833
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD DESCRIBE
THE SPEED OF THE CAR,

168
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,000
THEORETICALLY SPEAKING?

169
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,541
- SERIOUSLY? COME ON, GIMME A
BREAK, BRO... I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

170
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,083
I CAN'T RATTLE THAT KINDA CRAP
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

171
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,250
- LIKE I'VE ALWAYS SAID,
THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT

172
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,791
WHEN IT COMES TO DRIVING
TECHNIQUE IS RIGHT HERE.

173
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,708
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHENEVER
YOU'RE BATTLING SOMEONE

174
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,291
YOU CAN LEARN PRETTY
MUCH WHATEVER YOU NEED

175
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,000
BY DRIVING BEHIND 'EM.

176
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,750
YOU CAN GET A GOOD GAUGE ON
THEIR HABITS, THEIR WEAKNESSES.

177
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,583
EVEN HOW THEIR
SUSPENSION IS SET UP.

178
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,291
HOW YOU GET ALL THAT STUFF OUT
OF YOUR COMPUTER SIMULATIONS,

179
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,041
I'LL NEVER KNOW.

180
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,083
- IN MY OPINION, THE FACT
YOU CAN GET OUT THERE

181
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,500
AND DRIVE THE WAY YOU DO

182
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,875
WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
AND STILL KEEP UP WITH ME

183
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,500
MAKES YOU THE SCARY ONE.

184
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,000
IF YOU COULD JUST APPLY
THEORIES TO YOUR SKILLS,

185
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,583
YOU'D BE THE PERFECT
DRIVER.

186
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,208
- I ONLY LOST BECAUSE
I WAS CARELESS

187
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,166
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THE ROAD.

188
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,583
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

189
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,208
I'VE NEVER BEEN EMBARRASSED
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

190
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,750
I'M TELLING YOU, THAT EIGHT-SIX
HAS SOME KIND OF A MONSTER

191
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,916
UNDER THE HOOD.

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,791
- A MONSTER, YOU SAY?

193
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,541
THIS GETS MORE INTERESTING
BY THE SECOND.

194
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,291
MAYBE I ACTUALLY SHOULD SHOW UP
AND SEE HOW THE BATTLE GOES.

195
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,833
- ( bells chiming )

196
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,333
- TAKUMI!

197
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,750
( laughs )

198
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,875
IT'S SATURDAY!
THE BIG DAY IS HERE!

199
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,291
- OKAY, WHAT'S TODAY?

200
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,791
- ( groans )

201
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,083
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT'S TODAY?
IT'S THE DAY OF THE BATTLE

202
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,750
BETWEEN THE AKAGI RED SUNS AND
THE AKINA SPEED STARS!

203
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,500
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
BORROW THE EIGHT-SIX

204
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,541
SO WE COULD WATCH 'EM
THROW DOWN, REMEMBER!

205
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,166
- WELL... I WANTED TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT THAT. IT'S JUST

206
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,416
THAT IT'S GOTTEN A LITTLE
MORE COMPLICATED.

207
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,916
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,416
YOU HAD BETTER NOT BE
TELLIN' ME THAT

209
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,250
YOU'RE GONNA BAIL ON ME 'CAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME!

210
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,000
- TIME DOESN'T HAVE
A THING TO DO WITH IT.

211
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,750
LIKE I SAID, IT'S COMPLICATED.

212
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,541
- YOU BACK OUT ON ME AND
I'M STUCK HERE TONIGHT,

213
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,916
YOU CAN KISS OUR
FRIENDSHIP GOODBYE!

214
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,375
I'VE COUNTED THE DAYS, HOURS,
AND MINUTES UNTIL THIS RACE.

215
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,416
I CAN'T WAIT.
I'M CHOMPIN' AT THE BIT HERE!

216
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,708
- REALLY, I COULDN'T TELL.

217
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,041
- SHOPOWNER!
BOX OF FRIED TOFU.

218
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,958
- WELL, WHADDYA KNOW, IT'S THE
RETURN OF THE MUMMY...

219
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,250
YOU SURE ARE A PERSISTENT ONE,
AREN'T YOU?

220
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,666
- I STILL HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ON
TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU

221
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,166
TO RACE FOR ME TONIGHT.

222
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,458
- I THOUGHT IT OVER AND I MIGHT
RACE FOR YOU.

223
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,916
- YOU HEARD ME SAY MIGHT, AND
THAT'S ALL YOU HEARD ME SAY,

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,291
I MIGHT RACE FOR YOU.

225
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,083
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA REGRET THIS!

226
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,416
( groans ) MY NECK, AGAIN...

227
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,416
- REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
ABOUT DYING IN MY SHOP.

228
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,000
- WAIT... SO YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
SHOW UP TONIGHT?

229
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,208
- I'M NOT MAKING YOU A
PINKY-SWEAR...

230
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,500
BUT YOU CAN COUNT ON ABOUT
A FIFTY-FIFTY CHANCE

231
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,125
OF ME SHOWING UP...

232
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,000
WHAT TIME DOES
THIS PARTY KICK OFF?

233
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,500
- EVERYBODY SHOWS UP
ABOUT EIGHT.

234
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,500
BUT THE TIME ATTACK STARTS AT
TEN ON THE NOSE.

235
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,750
- TEN O'CLOCK SHARP.

236
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,125
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE
EIGHT-SIX SHOW BY TEN,

237
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,291
YOU CAN STOP WAITING.

238
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,208
ANY LATER THAN THAT AND
IT'LL BE UP TO YOU

239
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,000
TO CLINCH THE WIN FOR AKINA.

240
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,541
- UNTIL THEN, I'LL BE
WAITING ON YOU, SIR.

241
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,166
I GOT ALL THE FAITH IN THE
WORLD THAT YOU'LL SHOW UP.

242
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,083
- IT'S NOT FOR SURE, KID.
I SAID FIFTY-FIFTY.

243
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,416
- THAT'S WRONG.

244
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,958
I CAN TELL YOU'VE ALREADY
DECIDED YOU'LL BE THERE.

245
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,458
AND OUR TEAM WILL BE THERE TO
CHEER YOU ON THE WHOLE WAY.

246
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,875
SO, MR. FUJIWARA, GUESS WE'LL BE
SEEING YOU AT THE TOP OF AKINA

247
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,250
AT TEN O'CLOCK SHARP.

248
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,750
( door closes )

249
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,416
- I CAN'T FIND IT IN ME TO
BE MEAN TO SUCH AN EAGER KID...

250
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,291
I WONDER IF I SHOULD GO
UP THERE IF TAKUMI WON'T...

251
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,500
NAH, I'LL STAY HERE. I'M JUST
EXCITED FOR 'EM.

252
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,666
- INITIAL D!

253
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,458
- INITIAL D!

254
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,291
- ( car honking )

255
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,625
- The Man : YOU HAVE A GOOD
DAY TODAY, SWEETHEART?

256
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,041
YOU SEEM... DIFFERENT. BRIGHTER.

257
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:07,583
- REALLY? I DO? I THOUGHT I WAS
ALWAYS CHEERFUL AROUND YOU?

258
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,750
- THERE'S SOMETHING MORE,
I CAN TELL.

259
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,000
- ACTUALLY, I'M SUPPOSED
TO TAKE

260
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,875
A ROAD TRIP TO THE BEACH WITH
A FRIEND OF MINE TOMORROW.

261
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,958
I'M REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

262
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,250
- FRIEND, EH? IS IT A BOY?

263
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,750
- WHAT? NO. IT'S JUST
A GIRLFRIEND OF MINE.

264
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,166
I'VE KNOWN HER FOR YEARS.

265
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,083
- OH. WELL, IN THAT CASE, WHY
DON'T WE GO TO THE MALL?

266
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,958
WE CAN GET YOU A NEW BATHING
SUIT TO SHOW YOU OFF.

267
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,916
- OH, NO, THAT'S ALRIGHT.
I ALREADY HAVE ONE BATHING SUIT.

268
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,083
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY
I WOULD NEED TWO OF 'EM.

269
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,166
- BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY A
FEW OF THEM ON, AT LEAST.

270
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,333
- YOU'RE FUNNY, YOU KNOW?

271
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,916
YOU'VE SEEN ME IN A
BATHING SUIT BEFORE.

272
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,625
YOU'VE GOT A ONE TRACK
MIND, DON'T YOU?

273
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,916
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, ITSUKI?
IS IT GONNA BE SUNNY TOMORROW?

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,500
- WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE?
THE WEATHERMAN?

275
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,791
DON'T ASK ME
STUPID CRAP LIKE THAT.

276
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,333
THE WEATHER'S
GREAT THIS TIME OF YEAR.

277
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,083
WHY? YOU PLANNING ON
GOIN' SOMEWHERE?

278
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,208
- YEAH, TO THE BEACH.

279
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,583
- THE BEACH?

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,458
WHAT?

281
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,958
I WANNA GO TO THE BEACH!

282
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,000
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME TO
GO WITH YOU? HUH?

283
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:06,000
WAIT... YOU'RE GOING WITH A
CHICK AREN'T YOU? JERK!

284
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,458
- YEAH, KINDA.

285
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,291
- WHO IS IT? DO I KNOW HER?

286
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,750
IS SHE CUTE?
DOES SHE HAVE BIG KNOCKERS

287
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,250
OR MAYBE A HOT AVAILABLE
SISTER?

288
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,833
- NO SISTER, BUT SHE'S CUTE.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,083
- NO... NOT NATSUKI?

290
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,583
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

291
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,750
- SORRY, BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE KIND OF SITUATION

292
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,000
WHERE I COULD HAVE
INVITED A FRIEND,

293
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:27,916
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,791
MAYBE NEXT
TIME, OKAY?

295
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,083
- ( crying )

296
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,333
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CRY ABOUT IT.

297
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,166
- SO WHATTYA THINK'S
GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT?

298
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,041
I HEARD THE RED SUNS HAVE
NEVER LOST A BATTLE,

299
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,500
AT HOME OR ON THE ROAD.

300
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,958
DOESN'T SOUND TOO GOOD FOR
THESE SPEED STAR CHARACTERS.

301
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,458
- NOT LIKE THERE'S
ANY BIG MYSTERY

302
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,666
ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

303
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,666
AKINA'S GOING DOWN.

304
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,083
IT'S PRETTY MUCH
COMMON KNOWLEDGE

305
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,791
THAT THE FASTEST TEAM IN GOONMA
ISN'T THE DAMN RED SUNS,

306
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,958
IT'S THE ME-OH-GEE NIGHT KIDS.

307
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,250
- IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME, TAKESHI.

308
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,041
- THEN LET'S GO.

309
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,125
THIS CAR WAS DESIGNED
FOR PURE SPEED.

310
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,750
A REAL THOROUGHBRED.

311
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,791
THE R32.

312
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,958
AKAGI'S ROTARIES
DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,416
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT.

314
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,375
THE MOUNTAIN'S LIT UP
LIKE NEW YEAR'S TONIGHT.

315
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,000
RUMORS ABOUT THIS BATTLE
BETWEEN IKETANI'S TEAM

316
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,916
AND THIS TEAM THAT'S
CALLING THEMSELVES

317
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,708
THE FASTEST ON MOUNT AKAGI

318
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,041
SEEM TO HAVE
SPREAD FROM COAST TO COAST.

319
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,458
WONDER WHO'S TAKING
HOME THE GOLD?

320
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,541
I MEAN, TAKUMI'S EIGHT-SIX IS
ACTUALLY BUNTA'S EIGHT-SIX.

321
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,583
AND BUNTA'S
EIGHT-SIX CAN'T LOSE.

322
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,250
IT FEELS GOOD TO BE EXCITED
ABOUT A RACE AGAIN.

323
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,458
- ( tires screeching )

324
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,541
- WOW, THERE'S SO
MANY PEOPLE UP HERE.

325
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,875
- I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS SIZE A
GALLERY HERE IN MY LIFE.

326
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,458
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

327
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,916
- THE RED SUNS BROUGHT 'EM OUT
HERE TO SHOW OFF, INTIMIDATE US,

328
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,791
FORCE US INTO A MISTAKE.

329
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,125
WE LOSE TONIGHT,

330
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,458
WE'LL LOOK LIKE THE BIGGEST
BUNCH OF BONEHEADS.

331
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,958
- SO, UH, IKETANI, THAT EIGHT-
SIX YOU WERE TELLIN' US ABOUT...

332
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,250
DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S GONNA SHOW UP?

333
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,416
- YES!

334
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,916
- ALL I KNOW IS IF
I WAS THAT EIGHT-SIX,

335
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,458
I'D STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS
PLACE AS I COULD.

336
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,125
I HEARD KEISUKE'S FD THREE-S

337
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,083
IS ONLY LIGHTLY TUNED
FOR MOUNTAIN DRIVING.

338
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,791
NOT LIKE IT MATTERS
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD,

339
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,041
'CAUSE EVERYONE SAYS
IT'S KICKIN' OUT

340
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,208
LIKE OVER THREE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY HP.

341
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,416
THERE'S TOO MUCH OF A POWER
DIFFERENCE.

342
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,916
- EVEN ON THE DOWNHILL,

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,208
THE EIGHT-SIX COULD NEVER
COMPETE WITH THAT KINDA POWER.

344
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,875
HOW HARD YOU'D SMACK YOUR HEAD
WHEN YOU WRECKED ANYWAY, MAN?

345
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,916
- AN EIGHT-SIX IS JUST AN
EIGHT-SIX, YEAH.

346
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,625
BUT THIS ONE'S NOT NORMAL.

347
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,166
KEISUKE SAID IT HIMSELF.

348
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,708
ON THE OUTSIDE, THE THING'S
A NORMAL PANDA TRUENO,

349
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,250
BUT ON THE INSIDE, IT'S A BEAST
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN.

350
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,041
TRUST ME, GUYS. HE'LL SHOW.

351
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,416
- AND IF HE DOESN'T?
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO THEN?

352
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,541
- THERE'RE MORE PEOPLE UP HERE
WATCHING THAN I'VE EVER SEEN

353
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,666
WATCH ANYTHING AND I CAN'T HAVE
THEM SAYIN' WE BACKED OUT...

354
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,541
- BUT IF HE DOESN'T SHOW...
- THAT'S WHAT I ASKED...

355
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,791
- I WANT YOU TO REPRESENT US

356
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,458
AND DRIVE LIKE YOUR LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT, GOT ME?

357
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,500
- YOU GOTTA BE OUTTA
YOUR FREAKIN' MIND, DUDE!

358
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,750
- HEY, I THINK I HEAR
'EM COMING NOW!

359
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,791
- YEAH, THOSE ROTARIES
ARE KICKIN' HARD, AREN'T THEY?

360
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,708
- ( engines sounding )

361
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,708
- THE RED SUNS ARE HERE!

362
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,083
- THIS NIGHT'S ABOUT
TO GET PRETTY WILD, MAN!

363
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,125
- TOOK 'EM LONG ENOUGH.

364
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,750
- ( engines revving loudly )

365
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,958
- ( crowd cheering wildly )

366
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,708
- I NEVER REALIZED HOW POPULAR
THE TAKAHASHI BROTHERS ARE.

367
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,458
- YEAH, I HEARD THEIR DAD OWNS A
BIG HOSPITAL IN TAKASAKI,

368
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,333
SO YOU KNOW THEY GOT
CASH TO BURN.

369
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,750
- WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST RICH GUYS...

370
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,708
OTHER THAN TIME SPENT
BEHIND THE WHEEL,

371
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,458
DRIVING SKILL IS BASED
ON NOTHING MORE

372
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,791
THAN HOW MUCH DOUGH YOU CAN DROP
ON GASOLINE AND TIRES.

373
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,125
- ( dog howling )

374
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,083
- WHAT'S TAKING TAKUMI
SO LONG?

375
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,458
THE BATTLE IS PROBABLY
STARTING AS WE SPEAK.

376
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,250
HE KNOWS WHERE TO PICK ME UP AND
WHAT TIME I'D BE HERE!

377
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,541
WHAT AN ASS! I HATE THAT GUY!

378
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,333
I'M GONNA KICK HIM SQUARE IN
THE NUTS WHEN I SEE HIM!

379
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,125
I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE!
I GOTTA GO!

380
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,041
I'LL JUST TAKE MY
STUPID SCOOTER IF I HAVE TO!

381
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,666
- LET'S BEGIN THE TIME ATTACK
AT TEN O'CLOCK,

382
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,958
ACCORDING
TO THE SCHEDULE.

383
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,166
IT'LL BE LATE ENOUGH
SO THERE SHOULD BE

384
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,375
FEWER CONVENTIONAL
CARS ON THE ROAD.

385
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,833
WE'LL USE RADIOS AT THE START
AND AT THE FINISH LINE SO WE CAN

386
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,000
COORDINATE AND TIME THE RUNS.

387
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,041
ALSO IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE
DRIVERS TO CUT LOOSE

388
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,416
AND GO AS FAST AS THEY WANT,

389
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,750
WE'LL PUT OFFICIALS
AT ALL OF THE BLIND CORNERS.

390
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,375
IN THE EVENT OF ANY
ONCOMING TRAFFIC,

391
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,375
WE'LL USE LIGHTS TO SIGNAL
THE DRIVERS.

392
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,833
- SOUND LIKE A PLAN?
- WORKS FOR ME.

393
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,041
- I'M GETTING' THE FEELIN'
THEY'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

394
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,166
- NO JOKE. THEY PROB'LY RUN THIS
TIME ATTACK GAMBIT

395
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,625
ALL OVER THE REGION.

396
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,416
- NOW WE'VE GOTTEN ALL OF THE
PROTOCOL OUT OF THE WAY,

397
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,541
LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
TIME AND ENJOY SOME FREE RUNS

398
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,000
UNTIL TEN O'CLOCK HITS.

399
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,125
THE GALLERIES ARE PACKED.

400
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,416
- ( cars starting )

401
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,708
- WHERE'S THE EIGHT-SIX?
I FIGURED IT'D BE HERE.

402
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,250
- I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF THEY WERE TRYING

403
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,916
TO KEEP THEIR SECRET
WEAPON UNDER WRAPS

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,791
UNTIL THE BIG
REVEAL AT THE START.

405
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,458
- WHAT'S UP? THINKING ABOUT
HEADING UP THERE?

406
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,125
- NAH, I'M THINKIN' I DON'T
REALLY WANNA GO.

407
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,125
- WHY NOT? THINK YOU'LL LOSE?

408
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,375
'CAUSE IF SO, JUST LOOSEN UP,
DRIVE LIKE YOU USUALLY DO.

409
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,000
YOU'LL DO FINE.

410
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,875

431
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,041
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
HAVE THE DRIVING SKILLS

432

449
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,833
- YOU DON'T NEED IT. THERE'S
NOT ANY TOFU IN BACK,

450
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,791

- FINE. I'LL SEE YOU
