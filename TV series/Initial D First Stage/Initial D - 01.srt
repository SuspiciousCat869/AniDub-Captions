- Itsuki: EVEN THE '91 MODEL
RUNS 1.3 MILLION YEN.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,750
CRAP, MAN, THIS S-THIRTEEN IS
TOO EXPENSIVE.

35
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,083
LIKE I FIGURED, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GO WITH THE EIGHT-SIX.

36
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,166
THAT BABY'S THE ONLY REAL
POSSIBILITY. CUZ NO MATTER WHAT,

37
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,500
IT'S GOTTA BE AN FR. RIGHT,
TAKUMI? TAKUMI!

38
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,083
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?

39
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,958
- OF COURSE I'M LISTENING
TO YOU, ITSUKI...

40
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,416
YOU WERE ABOUT TO TELL ME
HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST

41
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,416
TO GET THAT EIGHT-SIX
YOU'VE BEEN STARING AT.

42
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,166
- THIS ONE'S MARKED
AT 300 THOUSAND

43
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,833
BUT IT HASN'T PASSED INSPECTION.

44
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,416
- AND HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU
HAVE SOCKED AWAY SO FAR?

45
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,833
- LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND.
- LONG WAY TO GO.

46
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,708
- I KNOW. IT'S DEPRESSING.

47
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,250
THERE'S GOTTA BE A
WAY TO MAKE A QUICK

48
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,708
BUCK AROUND HERE! EVEN IF WE
KICKED IT UP TO FULL TIME AT THE

49
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,875
GAS STATION DURING THE SUMMER
BREAK, WE'D STILL ONLY MAKE LIKE

50
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,708
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY
THOUSAND YEN AT MOST.

51
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,916
THERE'S GOTTA BE A BETTER
JOB AROUND HERE.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,291
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS
HAD PART TIME JOBS.

53
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,125
- NATSUKI...

54
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,250
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ACT SO SHOCKED.

55
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,583
IS IT THAT WEIRD THAT
I'D TALK TO YOU?

56
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,250
- NO, NOT REALLY.

57
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,875
- SO YOU WERE SAYIN' YOU'D ONLY
MAKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

58
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,291
THOUSAND YEN WORKING
FULL TIME THIS SUMMER?

59
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,541
HOW MANY HOURS A DAY IS THAT?

60
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,166
- LIKE TWELVE. OR MORE!

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,625
- ( gasps )

62
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,125
A FULL MONTH'S WORTH OF WORK

63
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,291
AND THAT'S ALL YOU'RE
WALKING AWAY WITH?

64
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,000
- COULD BE WORSE.
LEAST WE GOT JOBS.

65
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,416
- WE'RE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

66
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,750
WE GET PAID LIKE CRAP 'CUZ
THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT.

67
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,000
- I WOULDN'T KNOW...

68
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,833
I'VE NEVER WORKED A
PART-TIME JOB BEFORE.

69
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,041
I'VE NEVER HAD TO.

70
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,041
- ( bell chiming )

71
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,875
- HEY, GOOD LUCK WITH
YOUR SUMMER JOBS, YOU GUYS...

72
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,458
ALL OF US

73
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,041
SHOULD REALLY GET TOGETHER AND
HANG OUT ONCE FINALS ARE OVER.

74
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:06,250
- YEAH! DUDE, DID YOU HEAR
THAT? SHE WANTS TO GET TOGETHER!

75
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,916
ME OUT ON A DATE WITH
NATSUKI! SUH-WEET!

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,625
THAT'D BE SO COOL!

77
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,583
HEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME SHE
DUG ME SO HARD? YOU NEVER EVEN

78
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,750
BOTHERED TO MENTION TO ME THAT
THE TWO OF YOU WERE SUCH TIGHT

79
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,750
BUDDIES. I FIGURED YOU AND I
WERE CLOSER THAN THAT.

80
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,041
- PROB'LY BECAUSE SHE AND I
HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED TO EACH

81
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,125
OTHER IN ABOUT A YEAR OR SO...
WE USED TO BELONG TO THE SAME

82
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,250
AFTER-SCHOOL CLUB. UP UNTIL
SOMETIME LAST SUMMER WE WERE

83
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,333
PRETTY MUCH STILL FRIENDS,
I THOUGHT.

84
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,750
- WHAT ARE YOU BABBLING
ON ABOUT BUDDY?

85
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,750
I MEAN, REALLY, NO ONE CARES...

86
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,208
OH, NATSUKI THE HOTTIE! I'VE HAD
MY EYE ON YOU FOR AS LONG AS

87
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:36,125
YOU'VE BEEN STRUTTIN' YOUR STUFF
AND BABY, ITSUKI'S READY FOR YA!

88
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,208
TAKUMI!

89
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,041
BACK TO PLANET EARTH, MAN!
WE'RE GONNA GET BUSTED

90
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,583
IF WE DON'T GET
TO GRAMMAR, FAST!

91
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,625
- THAT TEST IS IN
LIKE TWO MINUTES!

92
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:53,583
- CRAP, WAIT UP!

93
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,500
- I GOT AN IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU
AND I GO IN ON THE EIGHT-SIX

94
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,875
TOGETHER?
WE POOL OUR MONEY

95
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,958
AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO AFFORD
THE LOAN PAYMENTS EASY.

96
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,166
- THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA. WHY DO
YOU WANT A CAR THAT MUCH ANYWAY?

97
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,625
DOESN'T YOUR FAMILY
ALREADY HAVE ONE?

98
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,625
JUST USE THEIRS IF YOU
NEED IT SO BAD.

99
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,875
- THAT PIECE IS
NO FREAKIN' GOOD.

100
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,458
MY OLD MAN'S BEEN DRIVING THAT

101
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,958
AUTOMATIC FRONT WHEEL DRIVE INTO
THE GROUND FOR A DECADE PLUS.

102
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,916
NOT TO MENTION IT'S DIESEL.
THE THING SUCKS OUT LOUD.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,583
CALLING IT A CAR IS AN INSULT
TO CARS EVERYWHERE...

104
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,125
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

105
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,750
- IF IT HAS FOUR TIRES
AND GETS YOU

106
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,750
FROM POINT A TO POINT B
THEN IT'S A CAR.

107
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,583
- YOU DON'T GET IT, MAN.

108
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,208
I WOULDN'T CONSIDER
ANYTHING A CAR

109
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,291
THAT DOESN'T DELIVER A GOOD
TIME ON THE MOUNTAIN.

110
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,583
- WHAT SO MUCH FUN DRIVING
ON THE MOUNTAIN?

111
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,375
- WHATCHA THINK, DOOFUS!
YOU DRIVE AS FAST AS YOU CAN,

112
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,583
CHALLENGING THE CORNERS!

113
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,083
- THE CORNERS?

114
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,583
THAT'S REALLY THE KIND OF THING
YOU DO FOR FUN?

115
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,958
- I WOULDN'T BE DO IT IF IT WAS
BORING. LOOK, YOU'RE A DUDE,

116
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,750
RIGHT? AND YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU
DON'T FEEL THE UNQUENCHABLE

117
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,416
DESIRE TO TACKLE
THOSE RAGING HAIRPINS?

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,625
- Takumi: I DON'T KNOW MAYBE
I'M JUST BURNED OUT

119
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,625
ON THAT KIND OF STUFF.

120
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,833
- HOW COULD YOU BE BURNED OUT?

121
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,250
WE JUST GOT OUR LICENSES
LAST MONTH?

122
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,208
WE'RE BABIES
IN THE DRIVING WORLD!

123
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,208
- Man: LOOKING CUTE, SWEETHEART.

124
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,416
I ALWAYS LOVE THE WAY
YOU WEAR THAT OUTFIT.

125
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,041
- THANKS...
IT'S JUST MY SCHOOL UNIFORM.

126
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,875
I WAS TALKING WITH THIS FRIEND
OF MINE AT SCHOOL AND HE WAS

127
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,208
TELLING ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THE JOB HE'S GOT LINED UP

128
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,583
FOR THE SUMMER BREAK...

129
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,416
HE SAID AFTER WORKING
THE ENTIRE SUMMER,

130
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,083
SOMETIMES WITH SHIFTS THAT ARE
OVER TWELVE HOURS A DAY, HE'S

131
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,791
PROBABLY ONLY GONNA
END UP BRINGING IN

132
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,500
LIKE A HUNDRED AND
TWENTY THOUSAND YEN.

133
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,958
- ( man laughs )

134
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,625
Man: YES, THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

135
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,541
GUESS IT'S A LOT HARDER TO
EARN MONEY THAN I THOUGHT.

136
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,958
I SHOULD BE MORE CONSIDERATE...

137
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,958
I'VE SEEN YOU SPEND MORE
THAN THAT ON ME

138
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,041
IN A MONTH WITHOUT EVEN
BLINKING AN EYE.

139
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,083
IT MAKES ME FEEL KINDA BAD.

140
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,541
ARE YOU REALLY OKAY WITH
SPENDING THAT MUCH ON ME?

141
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,791
- Man: OF COURSE I AM,
SWEETHEART. YOU'RE WORTH IT.

142
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,625
- Natsuki: I AM?
MAYBE I JUST DON'T GET IT.

143
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,458
- Takumi and Itsuki:
THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS!

144
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,708
- TAKUMI, I REALLY WANT YOU
TO PUT A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT

145
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,583
INTO GOING IN ON THE
EIGHT-SIX WITH ME.

146
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,916
DUDE, I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'D BE SERIOUSLY AWESOME!

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,708
- LET THE EIGHT-SIX GO!

148
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,208
- DIDN'T REALIZE YOU GUYS
HAD SUCH GOOD TASTE.

149
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,750
THE EIGHT-SIX IS A
TRULY DECENT RIDE.

150
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,500
- SEE? LISTEN TO IKETANI.

151
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,875
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING
ABOUT AND HE SAYS I'M A GENIUS.

152
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,541
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT. I SAID
THE EIGHT-SIX IS A GOOD CAR.

153
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,000
- YA HEAR THAT?
- YEAH I HEARD IT...

154
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,000
BUT IF I'M BEING
COMPLETELY HONEST,

155
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,041
I DON'T THINK I COULD PICK AN
EIGHT-SIX OUT OF A LINE UP.

156
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,083
WHO MAKES THAT THING ANYWAY?

157
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,125
- WHY DON'T YOU DRINK SOME
OF THIS HIGH OCTANE?

158
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,958
PUT SOME CAR POWER IN YOUR HEAD!

159
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,666
- HOW CAN YOU WORK HERE AND
NOT KNOW WHAT AN EIGHT-SIX IS?

160
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,708
DON'T YOU EVER OPEN
YOUR EYES AT WORK?

161
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,708
- Iketani: I DUNNO.
I GUESS I'M NOT SURPRISED.

162
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,416
YOU TWO WERE IN...

163
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,000
WHAT, SECOND
OR THIRD GRADE

164
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,916
WHEN THE NINE-TWO
MODEL CAME OUT?

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,750
ONLY CAR I KNOW IS THE OLD ONE
WE USE FOR DELIVERIES.

166
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,000
- WHICH IS A JUNKER! EVEN
IF AN EIGHT-SIX IS OLD,

167
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,666
IT'S NOT REALLY OLD,
IT'S 'VINTAGE'.

168
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,333
- Itsuki: SO, IKETANI,
WHEN WE BUY OUR EIGHT-SIX

169
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,083
YOU THINK YOU'D LET
US JOIN YOUR TEAM?

170
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,000
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF
BEING ON THE AKINA SPEED STARS.

171
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,041
- YEAH, SURE.
OH, SPEAKING OF...

172
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,541
IT'S SATURDAY SO THE
TEAM'S GONNA MEET UP

173
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,125
AT MOUNT AKINA TONIGHT

174
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,791
FOR A COUPLE PRACTICE RUNS...
YOU GUYS SHOULD COME ALONG, TOO.

175
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,000
- YOU MEAN WE'RE
ACTUALLY INVITED?

176
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,083
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A
CAR TO GET US THERE.

177
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,416
- I CAN GIVE YOU A RIDE, STUPID.

178
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,458
- ( exclaims happily )

179
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,041
YOU'LL LET US RIDE IN
YOUR S-THIRTEEN?

180
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,583
I'M IN! I AM IN!

181
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,958
I AM SO TOTALLY FREAKIN' IN!
AND YOU'RE GOIN' TOO, TAKUMI!

182
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,583
I MEAN, THIS KINDA
THING DOESN'T JUST...

183
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,208
- DON'T KNOW WHY
HE'S SO EXCITED.

184
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,500
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT WANTING TO GO.

185
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,708
- WE'RE OUTTA HERE, IKETANI!

186
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,375
- COOL. PICK YOU DUDES UP
AT THE BUS STOP AROUND EIGHT.

187
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,791
- Itsuki: SEE YA THEN!

188
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,833
- YOU'RE TAKING THEM, HUH?
WHICH MOUNTAIN YOU GOING TO?

189
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,625
- C'MON, BOSS.
YOU KNOW MOUNT AKINA'S

190
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,875
THE ONLY MOUNTAIN AROUND HERE
WORTH RACING ON...

191
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,791
AND THE SPEED STARS ARE THE
FASTEST TEAM ON AKINA ANYWAY.

192
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,416
WE GOTTA DEFEND OUR TERRITORY.

193
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,208
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
GUYS I'VE HEARD AROUND HERE

194
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,916
SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW.

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,750
BACK WHEN I WAS STILL RACING,
THERE WAS THIS ONE FELLA,

196
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,416
EVERYONE KNEW THAT HE
WAS THE FASTEST.

197
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,166
UNDISPUTED, COULDN'T BE BEAT.

198
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,500
AND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
HE STILL DRIVES MOUNT AKINA.

199
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,041
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME...

200
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,500
I KNOW EVERY LAST DRIVER WHO
GOES UP AND DOWN THAT COURSE,

201
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,291
AND, NO OFFENSE, BUT NOT
A SINGLE ONE OF THEM

202
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,708
IS AN OLD TIMER.

203
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,416
- HE JUST DRIVES DURING A
DIFFERENT TIME OF THE DAY

204
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,125
THAN YOU AND ALL YOUR BUDDIES...

205
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,416
AND HE'S GOT A GOOD REASON...
HE HAPPENS TO OWN A TOFU SHOP.

206
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,458
- ( gasps )

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,666
- AT AROUND FOUR AM, HE ALWAYS
LEAVES ON HIS DELIVERIES.

208
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,541
HE HAS TO MAKE HIS
ROUNDS TAKING TOFU

209
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,583
TO ALL THE HOTELS AT LAKE AKINA.

210
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,458
THAT GUY'S DOWNHILL SPEED IS
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS WORLD.

211
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,041
AND BECAUSE THIS
IS HIS BUSINESS,

212
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,208
THE GUY'S OUT THERE EVERY DAY,
RAIN OR SNOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

213
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,083
HE KNOWS THE SMALLEST STAIN
ON THE ASPHALT OF THAT ROAD.

214
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,750
MARK MY WORDS, IKETANI,
THE FASTEST DOWNHILL CAR

215
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,875
IN AKINA IS AN EIGHT-SIX
THAT DELIVERS TOFU.

216
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,875
- THE TOFU SHOP EIGHT-SIX?

217
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,750
- WHADDYA THINK YOU'RE DOING?
SNEAKING OUT?

218
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,208
- GOT PLANS WITH ITSUKI.

219
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,541
WE'RE GONNA JUST
HANG OUT AND STUFF.

220
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,083
- DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO.

221
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,250
JUST DON'T MAKE ME DRAG YOUR
ASS OUTTA BED IN THE MORNING.

222
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,000
- AFTER THE LAST TIME, I DON'T
THINK YOU NEED TO REMIND ME.

223
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,500
- SEE YA IN THE MORNING...
YEAH?

224
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,541
- YEAH.

225
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,750
- ( screaming )

226
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,541
- SLAM A CORK IN IT, TAKUMI!

227
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,833
YOU'RE TOTALLY BLOWING
IKETANI'S CONCENTRATION!

228
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,375
- YOU THINK I CARE...

229
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,583
I'LL SCREAM ALL I WANT, I'M
SCARED FOR MY FREAKIN' LIFE!

230
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,541
- I'M USED TO IT, MAN.
PEOPLE TEND TO GET SCARED

231
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,750
FIRST TIME THEY
RIDE WITH A REAL STREET RACER.

232
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,958
HERE GOES A HAIRPIN
TURN IN SECOND.

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
- ( screaming )

234
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,000
- TAKUMI, WOULD YOU
PLEASE SHUT THE HELL UP!

235
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,125
- TONIGHT I'M GONNA
CUT LOOSE OUT THERE.

236
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,958
FOR REAL, MAN. I'M SICK OF
KEEPING EVERYTHING BOTTLED UP...

237
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,083
- YOU OKAY, BUDDY?
YOU LOOK KINDA SICK.

238
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,666
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D
FREAK LIKE THAT.

239
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,125
I'S JUST IN THE MOOD
TO PUSH THE CAR

240
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,458
SO I MAY HAVE DONE IT A
LITTLE HARD FOR YOUR TASTE.

241
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,416
- YOU'RE SUCH A FREAKIN'
BABY, TAKUMI!

242
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,416
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

243
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,666
I BET YOU'D SCREAM
FOR YOUR LIFE

244
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,208
ON A ROLLER COASTER AT THE PARK.

245
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,333
- I LIKE ROLLER COASTERS,
ITSUKI. YOU KNOW THAT.

246
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,000
THIS IS SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

247
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,791
SOMETHING I DON'T THINK YOU
COULD POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND...

248
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,125
AND EVEN IF I COULD EXPLAIN IT,
YOU COULDN'T WRAP

249
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,083
YOUR HEAD AROUND THIS
CRAZY FEAR I HAVE INSIDE.

250
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,625
- I DON'T GET IT MYSELF.
- HUH?

251
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,833
- ( humming )

252
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,958
- ( car zooming )

253
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,750
- NEVER SEEN THESE GUYS BEFORE.

254
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,583
AND IF THEY'RE HEADED UP TO
AKINA AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT...

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,958
SOMETHING MUST BE GOIN'
DOWN ON THE MOUNTAIN.

256
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,375
- LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
SOME COMPANY, BOYS.

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,416
- WHY ARE THE RED SUNS HERE?

258
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,500
I'VE HEARD THOSE GUYS ARE
THE FASTEST DRIVERS IN AKAGI.

259
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,583
- INITIAL D!

260
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,625
- INITIAL D!

261
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,291
- ALRIGHT, LISTEN UP, WE'RE
THE AKAGI RED SUNS.

262
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,916
MAYBE YOU HEARD ABOUT US...

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,250
I DON'T WANNA START OFF SOUNDING
LIKE A PRICK BUT THE ONLY

264
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,083
THING I WANNA KNOW IS
WHO THE FASTEST TEAM

265
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,250
OR THE FASTEST DRIVER IS
ON THIS MOUNTAIN.

266
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,083
ANYONE WANNA CLAIM THAT?

267
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,583
- ( chattering )

268
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,666
- WE'RE THE AKINA SPEED STARS

269
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,166
AND IF YOU CAME UP HERE LOOKIN'
FOR THE FASTEST DRIVERS

270
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,416
ON THIS MOUNTAIN...

271
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,375
WELL, YOU'RE STARIN'
AT 'EM, HOT SHOT. -

272
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,500
THAT WAS EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE...

273
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,666
HOW ABOUT WE HOLD A PRACTICE
BETWEEN OUR TEAMS...

274
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,458
WE COULD DO IT RIGHT
HERE ON AKINA, COULD BE FUN.

275
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,000
- THIS IS NUTS...

276
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,791
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE IN FOR.

277
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,250
- I KNEW THIS'D BE A
SWEET FRIDAY NIGHT!

278
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,958
- WHATTYA SAY GUYS...

279
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,208
WE'VE BEEN GOING UP AGAINST THE
SAME PEOPLE OVER AND OVER,

280
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,375
IT'S GOTTEN TO BE A LITTLE TOO
ROUTINE FOR OUR TASTE.

281
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,708
WE WANNA MIX IT UP.

282
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:32,958
RUNNING AGAINST NEW TEAMS
WILL GIVE US THE CHANCE

283
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,541
TO FACE A NEW CHALLENGE.

284
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,583
WE CAN EXCHANGE SOME IDEAS AND
MAYBE EVEN MAKE SOME FRIENDS.

285
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,625
SURE, WE'LL PROB'LY LET A FEW

286
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,458
TEAM SECRETS SLIP
HERE AND THERE,

287
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,666
BUT IN THE LONG RUN, I THINK
WE'LL ALL BE ABLE TO IMPROVE...

288
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,250
FIRST, LET'S DO A RUN TOGETHER.

289
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,041
AFTER THAT, EACH TEAM SENDS
ONE DRIVER HEAD TO HEAD

290
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,583
IN BOTH AN UPHILL AND DOWNHILL.

291
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,916
DOESN'T MATTER WHO WINS,

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,958
LET'S JUST BUILD SOME
SOLIDARITY BETWEEN TEAMS.

293
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,666
- IF HE'S GONNA PUT IT
SO DAMN POLITELY,

294
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,208
HOW ARE WE S'POSED TO SAY NO?

295
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,625
- ALRIGHT... WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
MEET UP NEXT SATURDAY,

296
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,875
RIGHT HERE, AT TEN O'CLOCK?

297
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,500
- SURE...
YOU GOT IT PAL.

298
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,291
- I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE
IT EASY ON THE RUNS TONIGHT,

299
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,708
IF THAT'S COOL WITH YOU GUYS.

300
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,625
- I TOLD YOU THIS WAS
GONNA BE AWESOME, DIDN'T I?

301
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,958
- IF THOSE PUNKS THINK
THEY CAN INTIMIDATE US,

302
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,916
THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER
THING COMIN'.

303
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,958
- All: YEAH!

304
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,416
- WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, IKETANI?

305
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,208
- I'M GONNA KEEP MY EYE ON
THE TAKAHASHI BROTHERS.

306
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,375
SEE WHY PEOPLE CALL
THEM THE FASTEST IN AKAGI.

307
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,916
- THE TAKAHASHI BROTHERS?

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,541
YOU MEAN THE DUDES WHO'VE
BEEN IN ALL THE MAGAZINES

309
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,541
WITH ALL THE PICTURES

310
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,041
AND ALL THE CRAZY HOT CHICKS?

311
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,291
- YEAH, THOSE'RE THE ONES.

312
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,666
THEY'RE ALSO KNOWN AS
"THE ROTARY BROTHERS."

313
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,750
- WHAT ABOUT US?
CAN WE COME WITH YOU?

314
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,916
- SORRY, ITSUKI.
WHEN I MAKE A SERIOUS RUN,

315
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I DON'T LIKE TO GO AT IT
WITH PASSENGERS IN THE CAR...

316
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,250
YOU TWO WAIT HERE. I'LL PICK
YOU UP IN A LITTLE BIT.

317
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,375
- OH... THIS IS SO
FREAKIN' EMBARRASSING, MAN!

318
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,750
WHY ARE WE THE ONLY TWO LOSERS
UP HERE WITHOUT A CAR?

319
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,875
- HEY... ITSUKI...

320
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:20,375
IS IT REALLY AS MUCH FUN AS YOU
SAY IT IS TO BE A STREET RACER?

321
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,416
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. EVERYBODY
SEEMS SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.

322
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,625
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

323
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,500
- NO, I'M THE ONE WHO
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

324
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,541
YOU CAN HEAR THOSE CARS

325
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,083
SQUEALING AROUND
THE CORNERS, RIGHT?

326
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,916
TRYING DESPERATELY TO
CATCH UP WITH EACH OTHER,

327
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,125
PUSHING THE LIMITS,

328
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,500
AND THAT DOESN'T GET
YOU WORKED UP AT ALL?

329
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,083
- THAT SHOULD GET ME WORKED UP?

330
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,916
- ( phone rings )

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,041
- Bunta: FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

332
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,458
WELL, WHAT A SURPRISE...

333
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,708
YOURS WAS ABOUT THE LAST
VOICE I EXPECTED TO HEAR.

334
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,916
- IT'S GOOD TO TALK TO YOU, TOO.

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,291
IS THAT HOW YOU
GREET AN OLD FRIEND

336
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,916
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO IN AGES?

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,291
YOU KNOW THE OTHER DAY...

338
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,416
YOU PASSED ME ON YOUR WAY
BACK FROM A DELIVERY...

339
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,708
I SIGNALED YOU, BUT YOU BLEW
RIGHT BY ME LIKE I WAS NOBODY.

340
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,875
REAL SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU...
BUT THAT WASN'T ME.

341
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,291
- HAD TO BE.
IT WAS YOUR EIGHT-SIX.

342
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,833
- OKAY...
YOU CAUGHT ME...

343
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,458
IT WAS MY CAR THAT YOU SAW,

344
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,125
BUT I WASN'T THE ONE
DRIVING IT AT THE TIME.

345
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,166
MY SON TAKUMI'S DELIVERING
TOFU TO THE HOTELS NOW.

346
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,250
- ( coughing )

347
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,375
WAIT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

348
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,083
SINCE WHEN?

349
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,750
- I GUESS ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW.

350
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,500
- THAT KID'S BEEN RUNNING
DELIVERIES FOR YOU

351
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,791
SINCE HE WAS IN THE
SEVENTH GRADE?

352
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,916
- DAMN! I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH THESE GUYS AT ALL!

353
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,583
THE RED SUNS ARE FASTER
THAN I THOUGHT!

354
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:57,458
I'M PUSHING MY LIMITS HERE,
AND I STILL CAN'T KEEP UP!

355
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,750
- SO, BROTHER, WHAT
ARE YA THINKIN'?

356
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,208
- I THINK IF THAT'S THE BEST
COMPETITION THEY CAN OFFER,

357
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,833
WE COULD BEAT THEM
WITHOUT A PRACTICE RUN...

358
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,000
WE'LL LEAVE OUR TOP DRIVERS
AT HOME NEXT WEEK.

359
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,000
I'M EVEN GONNA PASS ON THE RACE.

360
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,000
- WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT RACIN',

361
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,625
THEN I'M NOT GONNA
BOTHER EITHER.

362
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,083
- NO, YOU NEED TO DO IT.

363
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,250
I WANT YOU TO SET A RECORD
FOR THIS COURSE.

364
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,875
SOMETHING THESE LOCALS WILL
NEVER BE ABLE TO BREAK,

365
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,916
NOT EVEN ON THEIR BEST DAY.

366
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,041
WE DON'T DO THAT- THE NAME
OF THE AKAGI RED SUNS

367
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,458
WON'T EVER BECOME LEGENDARY.

368
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,125
- Keisuke: GOTCHA.

369
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,333
- FIRST THING WE DO IS SET NEW
RECORDS FOR EVERY SINGLE COURSE

370
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,708
IN THIS PREFECTURE.

371
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,791
THEN WE HIT SAITAMA,
CON-A-GAWA, TOKYO, AND CHEEBA.

372
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,500
AFTER THAT, WE'LL HAVE EVERY
RECORD IN THE CON-TOE REGION.

373
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,375
WHEN WE DO, WE'LL BE LEGENDS.

374
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,750
THEN WE CAN BASICALLY
KICK BACK AND RETIRE.

375
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,000
THAT'S MY PLAN FOR THE RED SUNS.

376
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,916
I CALL IT THE 'FASTEST
IN CON-TOE PROJECT'.

377
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,125
- THEY'RE PRETTY AWESOME.

378
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,666
AND THEIR STYLE IS COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT FROM OURS.

379
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,666
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW BADLY WE GOT BEAT

380
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,375
ON OUR OWN HOME TURF.
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

381
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,500
- THEY PUT SOME CASH INTO
THEIR SUSPENSIONS...

382
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,000
AND THEIR HORSEPOWER...

383
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,083
NO WAY WE CAN COMPETE WITH
THE RED SUNS, I'M TELLIN' YA.

384
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,416
- BUT WE CAN'T JUST
SAY 'NO,' EITHER.

385
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,083
- HE'S RIGHT. WE'LL LOOK LIKE
TOTAL COWARDS IF WE WALK NOW.

386
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,333
- I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, 

387
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,375
BUT GUTS ALONE AREN'T
GONNA BEAT THESE GUYS.

388
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,416
- I KNOW THAT.
WE NEED SOMETHING MORE.

389
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,916
IT'S GETTIN' LATE GUYS.
LET'S GO AHEAD AND BAIL.

390
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,125
WE'LL GET TOGETHER TOMORROW
AND FIGURE THIS MESS OUT.

391
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,916
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW, STREET
RACERS DON'T LIKE LOSING...

392
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,958
SOMETIMES WE GET WAY TOO
SERIOUS ABOUT OUR CHALLENGES.

393
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,916
AND THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING

394
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,458
THAT CAN HAPPEN IS TO
LOSE TO AN OUTSIDER

395
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,750
ON YOUR HOME COURSE.

396
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,125
IT'S AN UNWRITTEN LAW
OF STREET RACING.

397
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,583
- HEY, KEISUKE...
WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?

398
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,000
- OH... HE WENT HOME.
BEEN GONE A WHILE.

399
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,416
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
STILL LEFT UP HERE.

400
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,750
- LOOKS LIKE THE SUN IS
ABOUT TO START COMING UP.

401
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,791
- MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR US
TO START HEADING BACK TOO.

402
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,833
- IF I JUST STAY ON
TOP OF MY GAME,

403
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,958
I'LL BE DRIVING THE RED
SUNS ANCHOR POSITION

404
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,583
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

405
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,250
THEY'RE FINALLY CATCHIN' UP.

406
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,166
THAT'S NOT ONE OF OUR GUYS.

407
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,333
IS THAT AN MR-TWO OR
A ONE-EIGHTY?
