TIMES THE PEOPLE

17
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,291
THAT SHOWED UP FOR THE FD RUN.

18
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,958
- LOOKS LIKE WORD ABOUT THE RACE
BETWEEN TAKUMI AND NAKAZATO

19
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,625
GOT A HELLUVA LOT OF PLAY
ALONG THE GRAPEVINE, DIDN'T IT?

20
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,291
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

21
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,750
THIS IS GONNA BE THE WORST NIGHT
OF MY LIFE, I KNOW IT WILL!

22
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,083
- ( sighs ) MAN. IT'S TOO LATE
FOR US TO BACK OUT NOW, ITSUKI.

23
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,125
YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THAT.

24
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,708
WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO SUCK IT UP.

25
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,250
- ( screams ) TAKUMI!

26
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,375
PLEASE JUST GET HERE!

27
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,458
( crying )

28
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,916
- DAMN IT. COME ON, OLD MAN.
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,666
YEAH, BUT COULD YOU WIN AGAINST
ONE? I MEAN IN A DOWNHILL?

30
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,250
- OF COURSE.

31
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,458
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY CAR THAT I
COULDN'T BEAT, THREE-TWO OR NOT.

32
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,291
- HOW ABOUT ME? DO YOU
THINK I COULD WIN?

33
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,625
- YOU GOT PRESSURED INTO
ACCEPTING THIS BATTLE

34
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,916
EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T
REALLY WANT TO.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,083
ITSUKI RAN HIS MOUTH AND
TOLD THE GUY YOU'D RACE.

36
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,583
LOOK, TAKUMI. YOUR OPPONENT'S
DRIVING A 3-2.

37
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,916
NOT A MAN I KNOW WOULD CALL YOU
A COWARD FOR BACKING OUT.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,250
- A COWARD?

39
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,791
- ( crowd exclaiming )

40
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,458
- DUDE, CHECK IT OUT
IT'S THE NIGHT KIDS!

41
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,291
THAT'S NAKAZATO'S THREE-TWO!

42
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,958
- ( crowd cheering )

43
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,916
- GENTLEMEN, THE R THREE-TWO.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,125
THE FINEST PIECE OF MACHINERY
TO EVER LEAVE STREAKS

45
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:41,916
ON THE PAVEMENT.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,291
I GUARAN-FRIGGIN'-TEE IT.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,583
- HERE THEY COME, GUYS.
HANG TOUGH.

48
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,833
DAMN, THEY COME WITH
A BIG ENOUGH ENTOURAGE?

49
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,958
- HEY, KENJI. WHADDYA THINK?

50
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,291
SHOULD WE GO OVER AND
APOLOGIZE TO 'EM NOW?

51
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,750
DUDE, NO WAY

52
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,791
- Iketani: FORTY-FIVE
MINUTES 'TIL.

53
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,166
IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR US
TO GO AND TALK TO HIM, YOU KNOW.

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,583
- ( gasping )

55
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,083
- C'MON, WE CAN'T DRAG TAKUMI
INTO THIS NOW.

56
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,458
EVEN IF HE'D GO FOR IT

57
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,000
HE DOESN'T STAND A
SNOWBALL'S CHANCE IN HELL

58
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,583
AGAINST THESE GUYS.

59
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,333
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT, KENJI.
NONE OF US WILL UNTIL THEY RACE.

60
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,250
- HOW CAN YOU BE SO OPTIMISTIC?

61
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,416
COME ON, BRO- IF YOU'D PULL
YOUR HEAD OUT FOR A SEC,

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,083
YOU'D SEE HE'D BE UP AGAINST
THE THREE-TWO!

63
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:29,041
WE'RE TALKIN' A 4 WHEEL DRIVE
ATTESA E-TS VERSUS AN EIGHT-SIX!

64
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,916
- I DUNNO. I THOUGHT THE
SAME THING AT FIRST, BUT

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,875
SOMEHOW SEEIN' THEIR RIDE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US

66
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,916
MAKES ME THINK HE
DOES HAVE A CHANCE.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,208
GRANTED IF THIS WAS A
CIRCUIT RACE YOU'D BE RIGHT,

68
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,250
THE EIGHT-SIX'D BE USELESS.

69
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:45,041
BUT THIS IS ANOTHER STORY
ALTOGETHER.

70
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,166
IT'S A MOUNTAIN PASS THAT
TAKUMI'S BEEN RUNNIN'

71
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,375
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

72
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,291
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

73
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,791
THAT DINKY LITTLE EIGHT-SIX
BECOMES MORE THAN AN EIGHT-SIX

74
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,125
THE MOMENT HE GETS
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

75
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,625
I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT, DUDE.

76
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,333
IT'S LIKE HE AND THAT
CAR BECOME ONE.

77
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,250
SOUNDS LIKE I'M JUST
BLOWIN' HOT AIR, I KNOW.

78
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,125
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA TAKE
MY WORD FOR IT.

79
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,416
TAKUMI'S DRIVING IS
SOMETHIN' ELSE.

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,791
TRUST ME, I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND
WHAT'S HE'S CAPABLE OF.

81
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,333
- AH! YOU MEAN THAT TIME
YOU PASSED OUT

82
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,958
ON THAT THIRD CORNER
OF THE DOWNHILL?

83
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,833
THAT TIME EVERYONE ON AKINA
COULD HEAR YOU SCREAMIN'

84
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,166
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL?

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,416
- THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU
WHAT WE'RE DEALIN' WITH HERE!

86
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,583
IT'S NOT LIKE I SCARE EASILY.

87
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,208
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
ON THIS MOUNTAIN

88
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,541
WHO'S BEEN SCHOOLED BY
TAKUMI'S EIGHT-SIX.

89
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,750
- WAIT. WHO ELSE HAS?
WHADDYA MEAN?

90
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,208
- ONE OTHER DRIVER'S HAD AN
UP-CLOSE-AND-PERSONAL TASTE

91
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,125
OF WHAT HE CAN DO.

92
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,208
AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

93
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,375
- OH, YOU MEAN...

94
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,458
- THAT'S RIGHT.

95
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,958
KEISUKE TAKAHASHI OF
THE AKAGI RED SUNS.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,833
- HERE COME THE
TAKEHASHI BROTHERS!

97
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,916
- GUESS IT'S TIME TO
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS!

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
- HELL YEAH!

99
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,041
- HEY! HEY, I LOVE YOU!

100
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,750
- THEY'RE BOTH SO HOT!

101
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,250
- KEISUKE!

102
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,083
- MAN, SINCE WHEN
DO SERIOUS RACERS

103
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,666
NEED SKANKTIFIED GROUPIES?

104
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,000
- YEAH, WITH REAL DRIVERS IT'S
THEIR SKILL, NOT THEIR HAIR.

105
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,000
- ( exclaims )

106
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,291
- Both: DUDE, WE'RE PATHETIC.

107
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,583
- STUPID RICH PEOPLE.

108
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,625
- I HAD A FEELING THESE GUYS
WERE GONNA SHOW UP.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,625
- BEEN LOOKIN' FORWARD TO THIS
RACE. IT OUGHTA BE INTERESTING.

110
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,458
- JUST WATCH. I'LL
SHOW YOU PRETTY BOYS

111
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,750
WHO THE FASTEST RACER IN
GUNMA REALLY IS.

112
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,458
NOT THE TAKAHASHI BROTHERS.
NOT SOME EIGHT-SIX.

113
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,875
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

114
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,000
SORRY TO RAIN ON YOUR PARADE,

115
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,875
BUT THAT'S JUST HOW
IT'S GONNA BE.

116
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,166
- BASTARD.

117
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,625
- THE EIGHT-SIX
IS GONNA HAVE TO SHOW

118
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,875
BEFORE YOU
CAN BACK THAT UP.

119
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,458
- DAMN. WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE.

120
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,166
THERE'S TOO MUCH RIDING ON THIS,
TAKUMI'S GOTTA RACE!

121
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

122
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:12,958
- ITSUKI.

123
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,458
- ( engine starting )

124
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,708
WHAT'S WRONG? COME ON, LET'S GO.

125
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,500
- YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKIN'
MAYBE THAT I SHOULD STAY HERE.

126
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,791
DUDE, I'M SORRY.
I JUST CAN'T FACE HIM RIGHT NOW.

127
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,416
- ALRIGHT. JUST STAY HERE UNTIL
THE LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE.

128
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,666
I SWEAR WE'LL BRING TAKUMI BACK,
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

129
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,958
- HE'LL SHOW UP NO QUESTION.

130
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,208
BUT IF HE DOESN'T...

131
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,375
( laughs )

132
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,416
I CAN THINK OF A LOT OF
WORSE WAYS TO SPEND AN EVENING.

133
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,083
- ( people cheering )

134
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,291
- I COULD DIE A HAPPY MAN
RIGHT NOW.

135
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,083
- ( crowd exclaiming excitedly )

136
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,916
- ( exclaims ) RYOSUKE!

137
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

138
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,708
IT'S LIKE I'M SUFFOCATING
I'M SO TENSE.

139
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,541
MT AKINA IS CALLING MY NAME.

140
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,541
I'VE NEVER WANTED TO
GET BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THAT CAR

141
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,083
SO MUCH IN MY LIFE.

142
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,375
AM I LOSING MY MIND?

143
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,625
NO ONE KNOWS
THAT PASS LIKE I DO.

144
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,083
I'VE DRIVEN THAT THING
RAIN OR SHINE EVERY DAY

145
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,375
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

146
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,750
IT'S BECOME A PART
OF ME.

147
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,208
I KNOW I'VE ONLY
SCRATCHED THE SURFACE

148
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,250
OF WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF, THOUGH.

149
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,833
THAT'S JUST IT.

150
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,416
EVERYBODY'S TALKIN' UP THAT GT-R
LIKE IT'S GOD'S GIFT TO THE ROAD

151
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,375
BUT I WANNA SEE FOR MYSELF.

152
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,583
I WANNA SEE HOW IT
STACKS UP TO ME.

153
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,916
I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS
ABOUT ANYTHING.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,791
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT
NOT BEING ABLE TO DRIVE,

155
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,541
THE MORE I WANT TO.

156
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,791
THE MORE I HAVE TO.

157
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,625
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

158
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,541
COME ON, DAD.

159
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,708
WHAT THE HELL IS
TAKING YOU SO LONG?

160
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,791
- ( tires screeching )

161
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,666
- GOOD, YOU'RE HOME!

162
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,875
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOIN' HERE?

163
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,958
- DUDE, YOU'RE KIDDIN' ME!

164
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,541
YOU'RE DAD'S SERIOUSLY
TAKEN THE CAR

165
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,416
AND YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA WHEN
HE'S COMIN' BACK.

166
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,333
- YEAH.

167
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,541
- COME ON, DUDE. YOU GOTTA AT
LEAST KNOW WHERE HE MIGHT BE.

168
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,625
- WELL I FIGURED HE'D BE
AT SOME BAR, BUT,

169
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,083
I SWEAR I CALLED
AROUND TO EVERY

170
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,083
BAR, PUB, AND TAVERN IN TOWN.

171
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,958
- DID YOU CHECK
ALL THE DIVE BARS?

172
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,833
- MMM-HMM.

173
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,458
- THAT DOES IT. WE'RE TOAST.

174
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,208
IF THE EIGHT-SIX ISN'T PART OF
THE EQUATION,

175
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,958
THERE'S NO POINT EVEN
GOIN' BACK.

176
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,958
- DAMN IT! OF ALL THE NIGHTS
FOR YOUR DAD TO LEAVE YOU

177
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,125
WITHOUT YOUR RIDE!

178
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,666
- HEY IKETANI. YOU
GUYS DIDN'T COME OVER

179
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,750
TO TRY AND GET ME
TO RACE, DID YOU?

180
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,250
- KIND OF. YOU SHOULD
SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE

181
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,416
ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,208
- EVEN THE TAKAHASHI
BROTHERS SHOWED UP

183
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,708
TO BUST NAKAZATO'S CHOPS.

184
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,958
THE CROWD'S TOTALLY
EATING IT UP.

185
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,583
- YEAH, AND YOU'RE
THE STAR ATTRACTION.

186
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,333
EVERYBODY CAME OUT TO SEE YOU.

187
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,333
DUDE, TAKE IT EASY.
I FEEL BAD ALREADY.

188
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,416
I'M FRIGGIN' STRANDED HERE.
THAT'S PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

189
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,750
- SO THEN, YOU WOULD RACE
IF YOU HAD THE EIGHT-SIX?

190
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,500
- YEAH, YOU BETTER
BELIEVE I WOULD.

191
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,750
I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO ABLE
TO RACE RIGHT NOW. ANYTHING.

192
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,375
- Both: SERIOUSLY?

193
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,791
WELL, YEAH. BUT LIKE YOU SAID,

194
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,208
WITHOUT MY EIGHT-SIX WHAT
WOULD BE THE POINT, RIGHT?

195
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,083
I WAS DEPRESSED BEFORE
YOU GUYS SHOWED UP.

196
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,583
NOW I WANNA HANG MYSELF.

197
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,125
- ( grunting )
- WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO US?

198
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,083
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS! WITHOUT
THE EIGHT-SIX WE'RE SCREWED.

199
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,708
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA DO?

200
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,750
WAIT A SEC! I'VE GOT AN IDEA!

201
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,583
YOU COULD TOTALLY RUN THIS
RACE BEHIND THE WHEEL

202
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,041
OF KENJI'S ONE-EIGHTY!

203
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,583
- HEY, YEAH!
IT'S THE SAME AS THE FD.

204
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,250
HELL IT'S EVEN GOT TURBO
FOR EXTRA PUNCH, DUDE!

205
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,541
- YOU'D EAT 'IM ALIVE
IN THAT RIDE!

206
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,250
- SORRY, GUYS,
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

207
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,041
- WHY NOT?

208
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,916
- BECAUSE IT'S
SOMEONE ELSE'S RIDE.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,458
I JUST CAN'T DO THAT.

210
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,875
IF I'M GONNA RACE IT HAS
TO BE IN A CAR I KNOW

211
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,083
LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND.

212
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,500
- YEAH, I GUESS YOU
DO HAVE A POINT.

213
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,041
- WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKIN'?

214
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,041
OF COURSE WE CAN'T EXPECT
YOU TO RUN THE DOWNHILL

215
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,208
IN ANYONE'S BABY BUY YOUR OWN.

216
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,208
- YEAH, WELL. LOOKS LIKE ALL
I CAN DO RIGHT NOW IS WAIT.

217
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,041
IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE GOT
MUCH OF AN OPTION.

218
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:29,958
- OH MAN, IT'S NINE FORTY-FIVE.
IT'S OVER. I KNEW IT.

219
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,833
- WHO THE HELL IS HE?

220
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:35,958
- Iketani: WHAT TIME IS IT?

221
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,583
- Kenji: ALMOST TEN!

222
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,541
THIS IS NOT LOOKING
GOOD, FELLAS.

223
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,083
- PLEASE, DAD. OUR BACKS ARE
AGAINST THE WALL HERE.

224
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,291
COME HOME.
TIME IS NOT ON MY SIDE.

225
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,791
- ( car approaching )

226
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,125
- ( engine revving )

227
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,625
- THERE HE IS!

228
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,916
I JUST HEARD HIM TURNING
OFF THE HIGHWAY.

229
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,458
HE ALWAYS GIVES THE ENGINE A
DOUBLE PUMP. I KNOW THAT SOUND.

230
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,125
- ( engine revving )

231
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,833
- HE'S ABOUT TWO MINUTES AWAY.

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,041
INITIAL D.

233
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,958
INITIAL D.

234
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,833
- ( car approaching )

235
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,000
- YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE
THAT'S THE EIGHT-SIX?

236
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,000
- YEAH, THAT COULD BE
ALMOST ANY CAR, MAN.

237
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,750
- TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
I'D KNOW THAT SOUND ANYWHERE.

238
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,750
- DUDE, THE TAKAHASHI BROTHERS
ARE HERE?

239
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,250
- I KNOW. AND THEY SEEM PRETTY
ANXIOUS ABOUT THE RACE.

240
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,208
THOSE BASTARDS ALL
BUT TOLD ME TO MY FACE

241
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,250
I WAS GONNA GET DUSTED TONIGHT.

242
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,416
RYOSUKE IS AN IDIOT.

243
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,875
THINKS HE CAN CALL THIS BATTLE
FROM THE SIDELINES.

244
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,916
AFTER I'VE GIVEN THE EIGHT-SIX
A LESSON IN STREET CRED,

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,250
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
TO THAT SMIRK OF HIS.

246
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,166
- TOOK THE WORDS
RIGHT OUTTA MY MOUTH.

247
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,083
HEY, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IF YOU BEAT THE EIGHT-SIX

248
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,375
THEN YOU'VE BASICALLY KICKED
KEISUKE'S ASS IN THE BARGAIN,

249
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,791
SINCE THE POOR GUY LOST TO IT
JUST THE OTHER NIGHT.

250
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,833
- AND IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY
PUT THE RED SUNS IN THEIR PLACE!

251
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,083
- YEAH, I KNOW. THIS IS THE
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

252
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,416
FOR ME TO DRIVE HOME A POINT

253
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,666
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO MAKE
FOR A WHILE NOW.

254
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,458
WHEN YOU REALLY
BREAK IT ALL DOWN,

255
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,666
GRIP IS WHAT SEPARATES THE
MEN FROM THE BOYS, NOT DRIFTING.

256
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,750
- HELL YEAH! THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

257
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,041
THE TAKESHI CATCH-PHRASE
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE!

258
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,291
- DUDE SHUT UP.
ANY DECENT DRIVER KNOWS

259
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,583
DRIFTING'S ONLY GOOD
FOR RILING UP THE CROWD.

260
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,166
IT'S AN AMATEUR TECHNIQUE
THAT DOES NOTHING FOR SPEED.

261
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,875
- AND LIKE YOU SAID,
YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONE

262
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,041
TO DRIVE THE POINT
HOME TONIGHT, MY MAN!

263
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,375
- BACK WHEN I WAS TOOLIN' AROUND
IN THE S-THIRTEEN,

264
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,333
I USED TO THINK DRIFTING
WAS THE END-ALL BE-ALL,

265
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,666
BUT WHAT DID I KNOW?

266
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,250
THE WHOLE POINT OF GETTIN'
DRIFT UNDER YOUR BELT

267
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,666
IN THE FIRST PLACE

268
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,541
IS SO YOU CAN MOVE ON TO
BETTER THINGS LIKE THE GRIP RUN.

269
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,916
- YEAH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
HAD IT BRANDED ON YOUR FOREHEAD

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,708
AFTER GETTIN' YOUR ASS BEAT
BY THE THREE TWO.

271
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,375
CRAP. I KINDA CROSSED
A LINE THERE, HUH?

272
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,458
- ( scoffs )

273
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,916
I'M NOT THE PERSON I WAS
'CAUSE OF THAT RACE.

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,125
IT'S WHY I DRIVE
A THREE-TWO NOW.

275
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,666
HELL, 'CUZ OF THAT RACE
I'M DRIVING BETTER THAN EVER.

276
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,208
YOU'VE GOT NO RIGHT TO
CALL YOURSELF A RACER

277
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,958
UNLESS YOU GET BACK UP
WHEN YOU FALL.

278
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,083
AND YOU'VE GOT NO RIGHT
TO CALL YOURSELF A RACER

279
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,416
IF THE BEST THING YOU'VE GOT
IN YOUR BAG OF TRICKS IS DRIFT.

280
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,000
- Takeshi: THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU BASTARD.

281
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,750
AMATEUR TECHNIQUE IS ONLY GONNA
WOW THESE IDIOTS FOR SO LONG.

282
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,416
I'LL MAKE DAMN SURE OF THAT.

283
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,166
- AS USUAL, LOOKS LIKE
OUR BOY'S GONNA WAIT

284
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,416
'TIL THE LAST MINUTE TO SHOW UP.

285
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,250
- IF HE SHOWS UP AT ALL.

286
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,666
DIDN'T HE TELL YOU HE
HAD NO INTENTION

287
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,125
OF BEING PART OF THIS RACE?

288
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,750
- HE'LL BE HERE.
YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

289
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,958
KID WOULDN'T MISS A CHANCE
LIKE THIS FOR THE WORLD.

290
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,125
YOU'LL SEE.

291
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,791
- (engine revving )

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,500
- I'LL SEE YA LATER.

293
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,416
THANKS FOR BEIN' SO COOL WITH
ME TAKIN' THE CAR OUT TONIGHT.

294
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,625
I OWE YOU.

295
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,541
- TAKUMI. WE BETTER PUT
THE PEDAL TO METAL.

296
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,875
WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE
LOT OF TIME LEFT.

297
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,708
- SORRY FOR WHISKIN' HIM
AWAY LIKE THIS.

298
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,583
WHEN WE BRING HIM
BACK LATER I'M GONNA BUY

299
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,833
LIKE TEN OF YOUR FRIED
TOFUS, I SWEAR.

300
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,375
- YEAH. WITH THE MIXED VEGGIES.

301
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,625
- WHAT THE... DUDE, WAIT FOR US!

302
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,333
- SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT
ABOUT YOU TONIGHT, KIDDO.

303
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,458
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.
I WONDER WHAT'S GOIN' DOWN.

304
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,791
( yawning )

305
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,208
EH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

306
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,916
WITH THOSE SETTINGS, YOU
SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,083
ANYTHING THEY THROW AT YOU.

308
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,750
- WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO THE PASS.

309
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,875
I WONDER IF YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
CATCH UP WITH HIM.

310
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,541
- WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING?
OF COURSE I WILL.

311
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,875
HIS CAR IS A NON-TURBO
ONE POINT SIX.

312
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,833
THIS BABY'S A TWO-LITER TURBO.

313
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,916
SO GO AHEAD,
TRASH-TALK ALL YOU WANT.

314
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,333
THE DOWNHILL'S ONE THING,

315
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,375
BUT I'M THE GUY WITH THE MOST
LEVERAGE ON THE UPHILL.

316
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,375
BESIDES, YOU FORGET
WHO YOU'RE TALKIN' TO?

317
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,166
I AM A TOP THREE DRIVER
FOR THE AKINA SPEED STARS!

318
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,625
WHAT THE HELL?

319
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,208
YEAH, WELL TWO CAN
PLAY AT THAT GAME!

320
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,958
COME ON!

321
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,916
- Iketani: HOLY...

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,708
- Kenji: I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
HE FREAKIN' VANISHED!

323
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,416
- ( music playing )

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,041
- ( giggles )

325
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,916
OH TAKUMI, YOU'RE STARING
OFF INTO SPACE

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,083
FOR ALMOST EVERY PICTURE.

327
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,583
HOW CUTE.

328
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,541
- THEY'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT,
IT'S PRACTICALLY TEN NOW.

329
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,666
- ( sighs )

330
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,000
THEY PROBABLY
COULDN'T TALK HIM INTO

331
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,125
GOING THROUGH WITH IT ANYWAY.

332
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,583
( gasps ) TIME TO BE A MAN.

333
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,625
REAL MEN KNOW
HOW TO APOLOGIZE.

334
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:16,250
NO! IKETANI TOLD ME TO WAIT 'TIL
THE LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE.

335
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,750
REAL MEN KNOW HOW TO DO RIGHT
BY THEIR FRIENDS, TOO.

336
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,125
BUT THIS WHOLE MESS
IS MY FAULT, ISN'T IT?

337
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,125
THE SPEED STARS GOT ROPED IN
TRYING TO COVER FOR ME.

338
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,583
I SHOULD JUST BUCK UP AND
ACCEPT MY PUNISHMENT.

339
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,375
OH CRAP, THERE'S SO
MANY OF THEM!

340
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,083
I'M GONNA GET MY ASS
ROYALLY KICKED!

341
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,333
HANG IN THERE, ITSUKI.
REAL MEN DON'T RUN.

342
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,916
THEY WON'T BE HAPPY
WHEN YOU TELL THEM

343
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,166
THE EIGHT-SIX ISN'T SHOWIN',

344
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,541
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU GET.

345
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,750
WHAT AM I DOING?

346
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,791
I'M DEAD MEAT
IF I TELL THEM THE TRUTH!

347
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,916
MOM. DAD. GOD. ANYBODY, HELP!

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,833
I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE!

349
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,583
AND I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN
A NAKED GIRL IN PERSON!

350
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,125
I CAN'T DIE A VIRGIN,
I'M TOO CUTE!

351
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,625
- Man 1: HEADS UP, THERE HE IS!

352
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,958
- Man 2: WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

353
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,625
- IT'S TOO LATE!
THEY'VE LOCKED IN ON ME!

354
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,625
THERE'S NOWHERE FOR ME
TO HIDE NOW.

355
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,333
GOODBYE, CRUEL WORLD.

356
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,166
- ( car approaching )

357
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,000
- HEY ITSUKI. WHAT'S GOING ON?

358
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,875
YOU MIND GETTIN' OUT OF THE WAY
OR DO I HAVE TO RUN OVER YA?

359
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,583
- ( gasps) YOU. CAME!

360
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,458
- DUDE, SERIOUSLY.
COME ON GET OUT OF THE WAY.

361
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,333
YOU WANT TO DIE?

362
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,583
( laughs )

363
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,458
- TAKUMI! I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HERE!

364
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:11,833
- YEAH. MY BAD. I'M LATE.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

365
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,416
- THAT'S OKAY! I'M...

366
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,666
- IT'S LIKE YOU SAID.

367
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,666
I'M A STREET RACER AND
I'VE BEEN CHALLENGED.

368
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,750
SO, THIS IS WHERE I'M
SUPPOSED TO BE. RIGHT?

369
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,250
- THANK YOU. TAKUMI!

370
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,041
( crying )

371
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,416
- HEY, DON'T SNOT ALL OVER ME!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

372
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,708
GET OFF ME!
I'M NOT PLAYIN' AROUND!

373
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,458
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO SEE.

374
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,791
- ( phone ringing )
- Bunta: FUJIWARA TOFU SHOP.

375
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,291
OH. HEY, YUUICHI.

376
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,250
I'M WILLING TO BET
I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

377
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,041
THAT LOOK IN TAKUMI'S EYE
TOLD ME THERE WAS A RACE.

378
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,291
I GUESS A DOWNHILL CHALLENGE
WAS JUST TOO MUCH FUN

379
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,375
FOR HIM TO PASS UP.

380
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,708
- LIKE FATHER LIKE SON.
IT'S UNCANNY.

381
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,041
BUT HE'S AN AMATEUR. HE'S FACIN'
OFF AGAINST A GT-R TONIGHT.

382
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,250
THINK HE'S GOT WHAT IT TAKES?
LEVEL WITH ME HERE.

383
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,500
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW, KEISUKE,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

384
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,208
LOOKS LIKE HE DECIDED
TO GRACE EVERYONE

385
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,625
WITH HIS PRESENCE AFTER ALL.

386
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,166
- TOLD YOU.

387
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,708
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
TRY TO HELP HIM OUT

388
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,916
AT ALL NOW, ARE YOU?

389
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,458
WITH EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE SOFT SPOT

390
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,125
IN THE THREE-TWO'S
ARMOR, I MEAN.

391
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,833
- I INTENDED TO AT FIRST,
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

392
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,583
SEEING HIM SITTIN'
THERE IN THAT EIGHT-SIX

393
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,333
JUST MAKES ME WANNA PUNCH HIM.

394
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,750
THAT DUDE FRIGGIN'
HUMILIATED ME.

395
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,083
BESIDES,

396
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,000
WITH OR WITHOUT MY HELP, IT'S A
GIVEN HE'S GONNA WIN THIS THING.

397
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,541
NO DOUBT.

398
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,541
- Yuuichi: DID YOU GIVE HIM
ANY ADVICE?

399
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,708
- NO, NOT REALLY HE DIDN'T ASK.

400
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,666
BUT THE GT-R'S WEAK
SPOT IS MORE THAN

401
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,166
JUST A LITTLE OBVIOUS
IF YOU ASK ME.

402
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,250
ASSUMING HE KNOWS
WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

403
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,250
- HIS ONLY ADVANTAGE
WILL BE BODY WEIGHT.

404
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,750
- IT'S SO FRONT-HEAVY
THE UNDERSTEER

405
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,291
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL.

406
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,833
EVEN WHEN YOU
FINE-TUNE THE PEDAL,

407
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,750
THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH BULK FOR
TECHNIQUE TO OFFSET.

408
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,833
ON A DOWNHILL LIKE THIS, THOSE
BRAKES ARE PROBABLY GOING

409
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,708
TO WEAR OUT BEFORE THE TIRES DO.

410
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,791
AND THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.

411
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,416
- Bunta: NOT A LOT
HIS OPPONENT CAN DO.

412
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,833
BY THE TIME THEY REACH THE
BOTTOM OF THE DOWNHILL,

413
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,750
THE UNDERSTEER WILL
FIGHT HIM TOOTH AND NAIL

414
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,375
GOIN' INTO THAT HAIRPIN TURN,
JUST YOU WATCH.

415
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,416
THAT'S TAKUMI'S IN RIGHT THERE,

416
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,916
ALL O' THOSE TIGHT
CORNERS AT THE END.

417
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,625
- IF HE CAN KEEP
UP UNTIL THEN,

418
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,250
AND THAT'S A VERY
SUBSTANTIAL IF, I REALIZE.

419
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,958
HE'S GOT A FAIR SHOT
AT WINNING THIS RACE.

420
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,250
- Bunta: I DID CHANGE
THE EIGHT-SIX'S DRIFT SETTINGS

421
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,333
A LITTLE, THOUGH. YOU,
KNOW, JUST IN CASE.

422
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,458
- Yuuichi: THE DRIFT SETTINGS?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

423
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,291
- WELL WHEN HE PUNCHES THE GAS,
THE UNDERSTEER'S GONNA BE HEAVY.

424
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,208
- ARE YOU NUTS? UNDERSTEER
WHEN HE PUNCHES THE GAS?

425
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,500
HIS TECHNIQUE HINGES ON
BEIN' ABLE TO DRIFT!

426
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,166
WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU
DO A THING LIKE THAT?

427
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,750
HE CAN'T RACE AGAINST A GT-R

428
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,875
WITH THAT KIND OF
HANDICAP, CAN HE?

429
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,500
- COURSE HE CAN.
IF HE'S GOOD ENOUGH.

430
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,250
WITH THOSE SETTINGS, YOU CAN GET
AN FR TO PULL SOME SERIOUS G'S

431
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,875
OUT OF THOSE HAIRPIN TURNS.

432
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,500
THAT'S WHY I USUALLY KEEP
IT SET LOWER FOR DELIVERY RUNS,

433
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:00,291
SO THE TOFU DOESN'T GET TOSSED
AROUND ON THE WAY DOWN.

434
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,500
BUT THE NAME OF THE GAME AGAINST
A GT-R IS ENDURANCE.

435
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,041
RUNNING AT FULL TILT FOR
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

436
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,750
IT'S NOT EASY TO PULL OFF, SURE.

437
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,958
BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME
TAKUMI'S UP TO IT.

438
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,625

451

- THE HELL KIND OF

452

QUESTION YOUR THREE-TWO'S

AN ABSOLUTE DEMON,

454
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,458
BUT RYOSUKE TOCKAHASHI
DID SAY...

455
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,708
- Takeshi: RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI HAS
HAD HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS

456
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,250
SINCE HIS DUMBASS BROTHER
GOT SERVED.

457
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,666
HE MAY COME OFF ALL SAGE
LIKE TO POSERS LIKE YOU,

458
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,333
BUT DEEP DOWN
HE'S JUST TOO PROUD

459
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:50,416
AND TOO SCARED TO ADMIT

460
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,333
I'M THE FASTEST RACER IN GUNMA!

461
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:54,250
- NOT HIS BROTHER. NOT HIM.
- OKAY, JUST SETTLE DOWN!

462
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,916
GRIP BEATS DRIFT ANY DAY. GET
THAT THROUGH YOU THICK SKULLS!

463
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,750
NEXT TIME, ON INITIAL D,
"BATTLE TO THE LIMIT!"

464
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,416
- Takeshi: DAMN RIGHT!
- DON'T MISS IT!
