1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,958
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,125
- ♪ BREAK INTO THE NIGHT,
IT'S THE TIME ♪

4
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,958
- ( people chattering )

5
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,333
- AH, MAN. I'M SO GLAD WE CAME
OUT HERE. EVERYONE'S SO HOT!

6
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:09,625
- ITSUKI, MY FRIEND, THIS PLACE
IS PARADISE ON EARTH.

7
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,541
- Sayuki: HEY, TAKUMI!

8
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,833
GET YOUR CUTE BUTT OVER HERE!

9
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,083
ARE YOU GONNA GO SWIMMING
WITH US OR WHAT?

10
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,708
- UM, NO THANKS. I'M COOL.

11
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,833
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS?
WE CAME HERE TO SWIM.

12
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,166
- Kenji: BE RIGHT THERE.

13
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,041
- I AM SO GLAD WE CAME.
THIS IS AWESOME!

14
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,166
- ME, TOO, MAN.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,375
- YOU'RE COMING WITH US TOO,
AREN'T YOU, IKETANI?

16
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,416
- HEY, WHAT'S WRONG, BRO? YOU
ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME, RIGHT?

17
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,625
- YEAH, SURE.
THE TIME OF MY LIFE.

18
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,750
- LET'S GO HIT THE SUPER SLIDE.
IT LOOKS LIKE A BLAST.

19
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,875
- ACTUALLY I THINK I'LL JUST
HANG AROUND HERE IF THAT'S OKAY.

20
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,500
- THAT'S OUR TAKUMI.
ALWAYS HANGIN' AROUND'.

21
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,083
- MIND IF WE JOIN YOU
ON A TRIP DOWN THE SLIDE?

22
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,250
- COURSE YOU GUYS CAN COME.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ALL HERE.

23
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,500
- Both: YES! THAT'S DEFINITELY
WHY WE'RE HERE, ALRIGHT.

24
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,958
- COOL, LET'S GO!

25
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,500
- NOW, GET YOUR BUTT
IN GEAR, DUDE.

26
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,750
- IT'S JUST THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN
REALLY GREAT WITH SLIDES.

27
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,333
- Sayuki: COMPARED
TO YOUR SUPER DRIFT,

28
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,875
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS SLIDE
SHOULD BE CAKE.

29
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,916
- SHE'S ALWAYS PUSHING
EVERYONE AROUND.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,875
KINDA USED TO GETTING HER WAY.

31
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,166
- WELL, I GUESS IF THAT'S
THE WAY SHE IS,

32
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,166
I'M JUST GLAD THEY'RE
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

33
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,291
- SO WAS IT REALLY OKAY FOR YOU
TO TAKE TODAY OFF?

34
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,250
I KNOW WORK'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.

35
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,041
- I HAD TO USE A SICK DAY,

36
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,541
SO MY BOSS WASN'T TOO THRILLED
ABOUT IT, BUT IT'LL BE FINE.

37
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,791
- SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

38
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,375
MY HEART FEELS LIKE IT MIGHT
BEAT RIGHT OUT OF MY CHEST,

39
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,125
AND SEEING HER
IN HER BATHING SUIT

40
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,958
IS THE BEST SUMMER MEMORY
I COULD HAVE HOPED FOR.

41
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,541
SHE'S LIKE AN ANGEL.

42
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,291
YOU NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME

43
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,625
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
STARING AT AN ANGEL.

44
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,083
BUT THIS MEMORY IS ALL
I'LL EVER HAVE.

45
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,125
SHE'S WAY OUTTA MY LEAGUE.

46
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,333
- Iketani.

47
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,541
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING

48
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,250
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.
- OH, NO NEED.

49
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,583
- I DON'T THINK YOU GET WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE IN MY SHOES.

50
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,791
I LEARNED A WHOLE LOT ABOUT
MYSELF THE OTHER NIGHT.

51
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,500
THINGS I NEVER EXPECTED.

52
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,875
- THAT'S GREAT.

53
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,416
- I'M SORRY THAT I DRAGGED YOU
INTO ALL THIS.

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,041
ESPECIALLY NOW I'VE DECIDED
TO CONTINUE RACING.

55
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,708
- THAT'S COOL.
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

56
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,500
I WAS HOPING THAT YOU WEREN'T
JUST GONNA THROW IN THE TOWEL.

57
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,750
- I BECAME SO FULL OF MYSELF
OVER TIME.

58
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,500
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN PEOPLE START CALLING YOU

59
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,791
THE FASTEST IN USUI.

60
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,333
- ( tires screeching )

61
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,166
- MAKO, CHILL IT OUT!
YOU'RE GOIN' IN TOO SHARP.

62
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,250
- FACING TAKUMI FORCED ME
TO REALIZE

63
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,750
THAT TECHNIQUE IS A MORE
IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN DRIVING

64
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,708
THAN I HAD ALLOWED
MYSELF TO BELIEVE.

65
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:09,875
AND IF I WERE TO QUIT NOW,
I'D FEEL LIKE MY OWN DRIVING WAS

66
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,208
I DON'T KNOW, UNFINISHED.

67
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,500
- I'M GLAD YOU GOT
SOMETHING OUT OF IT.

68
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,416
AT LEAST WHAT I DID WAS
USEFUL TO YOU SOMEHOW.

69
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,583
- HERE GOES.

70
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,416
YOU REMEMBER THE
PROMISE I MADE.

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,250
THAT TIME WHEN WE WERE OUT
BY THE LAKE, DON'T YOU?

72
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,958
I THINK IT MAY HAVE
COME OUT WRONG,

73
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,083
OR YOU MAY HAVE
MISUNDERSTOOD ME.

74
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,208
BUT EITHER WAY
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

75
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,000
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO
GET THE IMPRESSION

76
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,166
I ONLY WANTED TO CUT A DEAL.

77
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,083
I DON'T.

78
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,208
I JUST WANT YOU.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,250
- ( stuttering )

80
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:55,000
- MEET ME AT 8, AT THE KAMAMESHI
BILLBOARD WHERE WE MET.

81
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,541
I'LL BE THERE.

82
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,375
( Sayuki squealing )

83
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,583
- IS THERE ANY WAY
WE CAN SLOW DOWN?

84
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,083
- ( laughs ) YOU'RE SO CUTE!

85
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,458
- MY BACK'S PRESSED RIGHT UP
AGAINST HER BOOBS!

86
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,041
- ( whooping )

87
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,500
- THIS IS NOT WHAT I IMAGINED!

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,958
- I HATE MY LIFE!

89
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,958
- ( crying )

90
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,208
- Sayuki: Ah, crap!

91
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,666
MAKO. TOSS THE BALL BACK!

92
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,375
- HELP US OUT!
- OVER HERE!

93
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,458
- Iketani: RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI!

94
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,458
- Mako: READY, SAYUKI?

95
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,625
- Sayuki: YEAH, C'MON!
- Itsuki: THANK YOU!

96
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,250
- Sayuki: YOU THROW LIKE A GIRL!

97
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,583
- Mako: SORRY, MY ARM STINKS.

98
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,625
( laughs )

99
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,208
THAT WAS AN AWFUL THROW.

100
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,666
- I DON'T GET IT. WHY DOES SHE
CARRY HIS PICTURE AROUND?

101
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,083
- SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?

102
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,333
- OH. IT'S NOTHING.

103
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,750
I WAS WONDERING...

104
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,500
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

105
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,916
- OF COURSE.

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,500
- YOU SAID...

107
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,916
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP BEFORE.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,708
- YEAH.

109
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,708
- WHAT ABOUT A CRUSH?

110
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,000
YOU HAD TO HAVE LIKED
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

111
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,041
- SURE. I GUESS.

112
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,166
- WHAT I'M GETTIN' AT IS
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER

113
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,583
GO OUT WITH THAT GUY
IF YOU LIKED HIM?

114
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,000
MOST GUYS I KNOW WOULD
KILL THEIR BEST FRIEND

115
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,416
TO GET A SHOT AT GOING OUT
WITH SOMEONE AS HOT AS YOU.

116
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,166
- OH, WELL. THANK YOU.

117
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,583
THAT'S FLATTERING, BUT I'M NOT
SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

118
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,458
- SO, WHAT DOES THIS GUY DO?

119
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,458
- HE'S A STREET RACER.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,250
IT WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO,
I GUESS.

121
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,208
I WAS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

122
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,583
A FEW OF US FROM SCHOOL WENT UP
TO THE MOUNTAIN TO SEE A RACE.

123
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,333
I DIDN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT
STREET RACING BACK THEN.

124
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,083
TOTALLY IGNORANT.

125
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,708
BUT THERE WAS THIS ONE CAR THAT
LEFT A HUGE IMPRESSION ON ME.

126
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,291
EVEN I COULD SEE THAT THIS
GUY HAD SOME KIND OF

127
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,458
CRAZY TALENT FOR RACING.

128
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,791
FROM THAT POINT ON I WAS
ABSOLUTELY HOOKED

129
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,583
ON THE WHOLE IDEA
OF STREET RACING.

130
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,166
IT FASCINATED ME.

131
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,625
I GOT MY LICENSE.
I MANAGED TO BUY A CAR.

132
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,541
I PRACTICED EVERY SECOND OF THE
DAY MY SCHEDULE WOULD ALLOW.

133
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,083
I THOUGHT I'D FEEL CLOSER TO HIM
IF I DID THOSE THINGS.

134
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,416
IF I GOT BETTER, MAYBE IT
WASN'T THE PERFECT MOTIVATION.

135
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,250
I WENT TO WATCH HIM RACE
ALL THE TIME.

136
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,291
IT WAS LIKE GOING TO THE MOVIES.

137
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:49,125
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I NEVER EVEN TALKED TO THE GUY.

138
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,583
I never had the nerve.
It was just an infatuation.

139
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,416
A fleeting attraction. It isn't
like it was very meaningful.

140
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,458
I WAS PROBABLY MORE ATTRACTED
TO HIS TECHNIQUE THAN ANYTHING.

141
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,375
- NO WAY. YOU HAD TO HAVE
LIKED HIM.

142
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,125
- YEAH, I GUESS I DID LIKE HIM.
A LOT.

143
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:13,166
- WHAT A JOKE. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE EVEN ASKED.

144
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,416
THIS THING BLEW UP
RIGHT IN MY FACE.

145
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,125
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
SHE FEELS SO DISTANT.

146
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
SHE WAS CRAZY ABOUT
A SUPERSTAR. A LEGEND.

147
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,500
THE NUMBER ONE DRIVER
IN ALL OF GUNMA.

148
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,291
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

149
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,250
EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE NOW.

150
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,291
NOW I GET WHY SHE
DIGS FC'S SO MUCH.

151
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,625
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY
COMPETE WITH HIM?

152
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,333
- Initial D.

153
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,583
- Initial D!

154
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,000
- ( engine starting )

155
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,875
- THIS IS IT. HE'S FINALLY
READY TO GO HEAD TO HEAD

156
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,416
WITH THE EIGHT-SIX.

157
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,250
- HOP IN. YOU AND ME ARE
GOING FOR A RIDE.

158
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,583
I'LL GIVE YOU A FIRST HAND LOOK
AT MY FASTEST RACER THEORY.

159
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,458
- OKAY.

160
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,250
- THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST TIMES
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

161
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,666
GOING TO THE WATERPARK IS
WAY COOLER WITH CHICKS,

162
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,916
I HAD SO MUCH FUN.
DID YOU, TAKUMI?

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,416
- YEAH, BUT NOT AS MUCH
AS YOU AND KENJI HAD

164
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,125
SPENDING THE DAY TOGETHER.

165
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,958
MAKO AND SAYUKI ARE LIKE
THE COOLEST CHICKS ALIVE,

166
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,166
DON'T YOU THINK, KENJI?

167
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,250
- YOU BOUNCE BACK FASTER
THAN ANYBODY I KNOW.

168
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,875
WASN'T IT LIKE TWO DAYS
AGO YOU WERE GOIN' ON

169
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,708
ABOUT HOW STREET RACERS
DON'T NEED GIRLS?

170
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,083
- WELL, YEAH. BUT THEY'RE WOMEN!

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,250
- Both: HI, ITSUKI!

172
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,833
- MY BRAIN IS TOTALLY
BLANK OTHER THAN THE IMAGE

173
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,541
OF THOSE TWO
IN THEIR BIKINIS.

174
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,208
LIKE A BLINDING LIGHT.

175
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,041
- SAYUKI'S GOT A RACK YOU
WANNA CURL UP AND SLEEP ON.

176
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,541
BUT MAKO'S BODY, DAMN.
THE THING'S A FREAKIN' MIRACLE.

177
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,500
Don'tcha think so?

178
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,916
- YEAH, SURE. I GUESS.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,041
- YOU GUESS MAKO'S GOT
A SLAMMIN' BODY?

180
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,666
WHAT THE HELL'S UP
YOUR BUTT, DUDE?

181
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,791
WHAT, DID THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE A FIGHT OR SOMETHING?

182
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,291
- NO, WE DIDN'T HAVE A FIGHT.

183
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,375
- I'M JUST TIRED. THAT'S ALL.

184
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,208
- ( car door closing )

185
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,166
- ( footsteps approaching )

186
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,166
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
MR. SICK DAY?

187
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,083
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT, BOSS,
I WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY.

188
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,625
- JUST GIVING YOU A HARD TIME.
YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE.

189
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,125
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TIME TO
ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.

190
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,375
I'D BE MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOU
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND

191
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,208
AND THE ONLY THING YOU CARED
ABOUT WERE CARS AND RACING

192
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,666
AND THE DUDES YOU PUMP GAS WITH.

193
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,000
- REALLY?
- WELL, BEST OF LUCK.

194
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,083
THIS GIRL'S NAME IS MAKO RIGHT?

195
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,166
I'LL BET SHE'S CUTE.
HOW'RE THINGS GOING?

196
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,833
- TO BE HONEST,

197
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,416
I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S
LOOKIN' TOO GOOD, BOSS.

198
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,541
WHAT CAN I SAY, I SCREWED UP
AND GOT INTERESTED

199
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,416
IN ONE OF THOSE CHICKS WHO'S
JUST TOO GOOD FOR ME.

200
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,375
- DON'T BE SO PESSIMISTIC,
IKETANI.

201
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,041
WOMEN DON'T WANT A GUY
WHO'S NEGATIVE ALL THE TIME.

202
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,166
- HEY, I'M JUST BEING REALISTIC.

203
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,375
TRUST ME. I DON'T HAVE
A CHANCE ON EARTH.

204
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,500
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH
SOMEONE LIKE RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI.

205
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,000
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

206
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,666
- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
I CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH HIM.

207
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,000
I KNOW HE HASN'T JACKED
WITH HIS FC. SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

208
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,208
- WITH EVERY NEW BIT
OF DATA THAT I GATHER,

209
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,583
MY THEORY EVOLVES.

210
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,583
BE PATIENT, EIGHT-SIX.

211
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,000
WHEN IT'S COMPLETE, YOU'LL BE
NOTHING BUT ANOTHER NAME

212
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,291
TO CHECK OFF OF MY
DEFEATED LIST.

213
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,500
- ( car door opening )

214
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,250
- GUESS I GOT HERE FIRST.

215
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,416
WOW. MY HEART'S BEATING SO FAST
I CAN HARDLY CATCH MY BREATH.

216
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,750
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT JUST
FALL OVER AND DIE

217
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,500
WHEN IKETANI GETS HERE.

218
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,625
- Yuuichi: WHAT?

219
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,416
YOU'RE EVEN DUMBER
THAN YOU LOOK!

220
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
REALLY IT'S LIKE YOU'VE NEVER
MET A WOMAN BEFORE.

221
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,958
LIKE IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY.

222
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,250
NOW LISTEN TO ME. SHE WASN'T
ACTUALLY DATING THIS GUY.

223
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,958
SHE LIKED HIM FROM A DISTANCE.
IT'S JUST INFATUATION.

224
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,166
EVERY TEENAGE GIRL HAS A CRUSH
ON AN OLDER GUY AT SOME POINT.

225
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,125
IT'S WHAT THEY DO!

226
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,291
NO DIFFERENT THAN IF SHE THOUGHT

227
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,666
SOME GUY FROM SOME
TV SHOW WAS CUTE.

228
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,125
- TV?

229
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,125
- STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A MINUTE, OKAY?

230
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,166
THE GIRL DECIDED TO OPEN UP
TO YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING

231
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,416
BECAUSE SHE CHOSE
YOU OVER SOME GUY

232
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,208
SHE'S NEVER EVEN TALKED
TO BEFORE IN HER LIFE.

233
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,666
AND SHE TOLD YOU ALL OF THIS
STUFF BECAUSE SHE TRUSTS YOU.

234
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,750
BECAUSE SHE'S INVESTING HERSELF
IN YOU. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

235
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,875
YOU GOTTA GET OVER THIS
PATHETIC INFERIORITY COMPLEX

236
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,125
YOU'VE GOT GOING ON.

237
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,500
BEING IN LOVE MEANS THAT
YOU ACCEPT EVERYTHING

238
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,583
ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON
THE WAY THEY ARE!

239
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,625
IF NO ONE'S TOLD YOU BEFORE,

240
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,250
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
LOVE'S ALL ABOUT!

241
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,833
DID YOU SAY EIGHT O'CLOCK?

242
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,750
IT'S ALREADY HALF PAST,
YOU IDIOT!

243
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,833
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

244
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,500
- I DON'T THINK I'LL MAKE IT.

245
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,625
IT'LL TAKE AT LEAST AN HOUR
TO GET ALL THE WAY

246
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,041
TO YOKOKAWA FROM HERE.

247
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,416
NO WAY SHE'LL STILL BE
WAITIN' ON ME AFTER THAT LONG.

248
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,750
- GET OUTTA HERE!

249
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,375
YOU WON'T KNOW ANY
OF THAT FOR SURE

250
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,958
UNTIL YOU GET THERE WILL YA.

251
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,166
GO OR YOU'RE FIRED!

252
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,583
IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A RACER

253
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,416
THEN YOU WON'T LET
UP ON THE GAS.

254
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,458
YOU'D BETTER DRIVE THAT CAR
LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.

255
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:22,416
I TRULY HATE TO SAY IT, BUT HE
PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT IN TIME.

256
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,291
WELL, DISAPPOINTMENT'S
A PART OF GROWING UP.

257
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,458
- ( pop music playing )

258
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:40,375
- BOSS IS RIGHT. I'M SO STUPID.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

259
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,750
IF I LIVE ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS,

260
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,000
I'LL NEVER MEET ANYONE
LIKE HER AGAIN.

261
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,583
WHY COULDN'T I BE MORE
HONEST WITH HER?

262
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,541
- THANKS AGAIN. I'M MAKO SATO.
CALL ME SOMETIME!

263
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:05,541
IF THAT'S WHAT IT'LL TAKE,

264
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,750
MEET ME AT EIGHT, AT THE
KAMAMESHI BILLBOARD

265
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,750
WHERE WE MET.

266
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,375
I'LL BE THERE.

267
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,000
- SHE WAS ALWAYS
STRAIGHT UP WITH ME,

268
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,416
BUT I COULDN'T DO IT BACK.

269
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,625

MY FEET ARE KILLING ME.

274
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,458
I HATE HEELS.

275
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,500
- MAKO, I DON'T NEED TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE RUN OFF

276
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,875
TO A HOTEL WITH YOU.

277
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,416
I MEAN, YEAH, I WANT TO, SURE.
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO.

278
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,750
WHAT AM I SAYIN'?
I JUST WANNA SEE YOUR FACE.

279
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,500
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT!

280
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,291
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE,
JUST ONE MORE CHANCE.

281

THAT'S ALL I'M ASKIN'.

282
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,875
JUST DON'T TAKE THIS
ANGEL AWAY FROM ME.

283
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:42,625
There's an accident? Now?
Oh, please, not now!
