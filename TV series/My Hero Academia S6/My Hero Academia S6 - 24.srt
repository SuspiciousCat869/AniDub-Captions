1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,260
If Deku returns,

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,640
everyone taking shelter
here will be in danger.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,810
[NEZU] I'll figure out a way
to make them understand.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,850
You see, when we were preparing
for the last school festival,

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,150
we reinforced the U Barrier.
We didn't end up needing

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,360
the extra security. So this is
our chance to test it out.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,610
Don't forget. All Might grew up
in this school, too,

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,660
and we survived.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,580
Go ahead, students.
Bring your classmate back.

10
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,920
[TENYA] Principal Nezu. You
mentioned that the UA Barrier

11
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,970
was upgraded.
Will you elaborate?

12
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,300
We're here because we
understand Midoriya's concerns

13
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,180
and why he left us.
If campus defenses are strong,

14
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,930
that might help us
convince him to come back.

15
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,270
We need evidence that his return

16
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,810
won't bring harm to
anyone at the school.

17
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,980
That's why, initially,
we were just planning

18
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,650
to fight with him
in the streets.

19
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,240
I didn't suggest he
come back out of pity.

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,240
Practically speaking,
Midoriya is an invaluable asset

21
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,030
in our fight against the League.

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,320
We want to keep him safe,
which means we should

23
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,500
protect him in a
state-of-the-art facility.

24
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,580
Luckily, UA was able
to buy the country's

25
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,040
latest security tech
on the cheap.

26
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,130
In fact, our defense
systems are comparable

27
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,840
to what you might
find at Tartarus.

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,010
This sounds impressive, sir.
But those systems

29
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,880
were no match against
Shigaraki's forces.

30
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,810
[NEZU] Correct. However, since
UA was infiltrated last year,

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,180
I've stayed focused on
the threat Shigaraki poses.

32
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,730
So when it was time to
reinforce the barrier,

33
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,150
I went ahead and added
my own personal improvements

34
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,360
to the plans.

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,400
Our school's better
protected than a prison?

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,280
[NEZU]
It caused quite a stir.

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,780
Let me be blunt.
If an army of villains

38
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,700
were trying to invade UA
at this very moment,

39
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,200
no harm would come to the
evacuees or the students.

40
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,080
Frankly, the attackers
wouldn't stand a chance.

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,380
You see, the UA Barrier
is more than a stationary

42
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,170
defensive wall.
This whole campus can move!

43
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,420
[NEZU] The grounds have
been divided into a grid,

44
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,550
every part of which
is independently mobile.

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,310
In the event of an emergency,
sections can be lowered

46
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,470
to become an
underground shelter.

47
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,890
These shelters are then able
to move along various paths.

48
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,690
All powered by
the magic of science.

49
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,730
That's some mecha anime tech!

50
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,530
Of course, if the system
were to break down,

51
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,820
our careful planning will
have been for nothing.

52
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,570
Which is why there are also

53
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,120
3,000 layers of reinforced
plates underground.

54
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,780
If we detect anything abnormal,

55
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,750
the interception
system activates.

56
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,000
This unlocks the supports

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,460
so the defensive plates
can move as needed.

58
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,170
As such, we can delay any
especially troublesome attacks.

59
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,760
In the meantime, the shelters
would travel along safe routes,

60
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,470
eventually stopping at
another secure stronghold.

61
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,890
Shiketsu, for example, recently
bolstered their defenses.

62
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,890
There'll be no more
imposters for them.

63
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,180
And of course, there are other
similar hero high schools

64
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,390
out there, too.

65
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,520
Shiketsu? But their
campus is so far away!

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,900
[KATSUKI] UA in East.
Shiketsu in the West.

67
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,530
[BOTH]
Oh, right, Shiketsu. Those guys.

68
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,650
If I'm not mistaken,
these plans have Shigaraki's

69
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,160
upgraded Quirk in mind. But at
the time of the school festival,

70
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,200
we didn't know that Decay was
going to become supercharged.

71
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,580
You're right,
I had no real evidence.

72
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,330
Just a gut feeling.

73
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,960
That's why I paid for
the extra measures myself!

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,710
And what did that set you back,
a few 100,000,000?

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,840
If you weren't aware,
the principal supports

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,760
Quirk morality education.

77
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,090
His passion is
recognized globally.

78
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,010
His contributions in this
crisis have been vital.

79
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,890
Ignorance. Intolerance.

80
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,480
Some people refuse
to take that extra step

81
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,440
to try and understand others.

82
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,940
Many even group together
and act out of fear.

83
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,650
This prevents progress.

84
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,200
Putting in the work is
the more difficult path.

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,410
Anyway, it would be both
logical and beneficial

86
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,410
for Midoriya to come back.

87
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,080
You kids get out there
and give it your all.

88
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,420
[EVACUEE 137E] No way!
Send him somewhere else.

89
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,920
[CITIZEN 136A]
You're out of your minds!

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,840
We won't let him in! Leave!

91
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,250
[CITIZEN 136AA]
Shigaraki will come!

92
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,460
[EVACUEE 137A] Wasn't UA
supposed to guarantee our safety

93
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,550
and peace of mind?

94
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,590
[EVACUEE 137AB]
Don't let him in!

95
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,880
[EVACUEE 137B]
Send him away!

96
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,180
If he's got multiple
Quirks, he's a Nomu!

97
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,010
Izuku!

98
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,430
No, it's too dangerous!

99
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,940
[EVACUEE 137C]
You're scaring people.

100
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,730
[EVACUEE 137D] If you wanna
fight, do it somewhere else!

101
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,650
[EVACUEE 137B] What else
are you lying about, huh?

102
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,070
[CITIZEN 136AA] Yeah, start
talking. We want answers!

103
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,070
The principal couldn't
convince them?

104
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,030
At first, there were people
who acted as though

105
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,570
they understood the
situation we're in.

106
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,790
But speculation leads to unease,

107
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,160
and it can be
difficult for reason

108
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,910
to overcome
fear and rumors.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,080
Dial back the volume, will ya?

110
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,460
[BEST JEANIST] I'm not sure
they're going to listen

111
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,550
to teachers. They came
here because of me.

112
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,170
Perhaps I can sway them.

113
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,380
You got it, Jeany.

114
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,630
Best Jeanist! The only
reason we came here

115
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,800
is because we believed
what you said!

116
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,640
[BEST JEANIST] Yes. And I
stand by that sentiment.

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,230
As the principal explained,
this is the safest place

118
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,400
for you to be. Your
lives are the priority.

119
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,230
In order to prevent
further violence,

120
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,770
our plan was to use
Izuku Midoriya as bait

121
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,320
to find the villains.

122
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,990
Unfortunately, our search
was fruitless.

123
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,070
We have little to show for it.

124
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,700
While the boy is a target
of the villains,

125
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,960
he is also our most
valuable asset.

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,170
To allow him to wear
himself down any more

127
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,960
could prove fatal.
This may not be ideal,

128
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,380
but we're doing the best we can.

129
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,220
We understand some among you
feel anxious about this.

130
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,680
But we hope you'll let him
rest here, in this stronghold.

131
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,680
If we want him to
fight for our futures,

132
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,600
we need him to be
healthy and strong.

133
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,990
Wait. Are you kidding me?

134
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,150
You know how things
got this bad?

135
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,080
You losers failed and turned
Japan into a lawless country.

136
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,660
And now that you've
screwed everything up,

137
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,000
you want us to pay
the price for it.

138
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,500
That's what you're
asking, right?

139
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,300
What the hell is that about?

140
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,210
[EVACUEE 137F]
Yeah, he's right!

141
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,340
[EVACUEES]
Keep him out!

And you call yourselves heroes?

143
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,970

You call yourselves heroes?

Give us a break!

147
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,360

to be able to live in peace.

If we don't do something...

will turn into a mob.

That's our girl!

156
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,230
Dek--Izuku Midoriya has
a very important power.

157
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,230
So what? That just makes him
even more dangerous.

158
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,400
He'll get us all killed
because he wants to take a nap!

159
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,070
You're wrong! He left UA

160
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,820
because he didn't want to
cause trouble for anybody!

161
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,910
We're the ones who
made him come back!

162
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,780
What is she doing?

163
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,410
[OCHACO] His ability
is special, a power created

164
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,500
to beat All For One! That's why
the villains are after him!

165
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,960
Why he's been fighting
this whole time.

166
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,290
And he's been doing it alone!

167
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,920
He left to protect
every one of us,

168
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,090
but I want you
to look at him now.

169
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,010
[OCHACO] He wants to change our
situation more than anybody,

170
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,310
and he's put himself
in harm's way to do it.

171
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,730
Do you see what
that's done to him?

172
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,440
Just because someone
has a special power,

173
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,650
that doesn't mean they're
a special person!

174
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,210
[IZUKU] Leave her to me.
You can go now. I've got this.

175
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,840
That hero. He's the one
who rescued me.

176
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,880
There's a fancy system in place
to protect these idiots.

177
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,600
And still, they're scared
out of their minds.

178
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,680
But don't worry, we'll clean up
any messes you can't handle.

179
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,520
[NEZU] Putting in the work
is the more difficult path.

180
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,190
But it's worth it.
Once someone is able

181
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,950
to take that extra step forward,
it will clear a path

182
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,490
for the person who will become
the best hero we've known.

183
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,370
One who surpasses
even All Might.

184
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,840
[OCHACO] I've always liked
to see people happy.

185
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,630
Growing up, my parents
looked so worried, though.

186
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,550
It made me feel worried, too.

187
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,970
The first time I saw
someone doing hero work,

188
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,060
I couldn't help but watch
the faces of those around me.

189
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,940
It was amazing to see
everyone overcome with joy.

190
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,740
[EVACUEE 137J]
Look at him.

191
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,360
[EVACUEE 137EA]
Poor kid.

192
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,200
He must have kept fighting.

193
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,530
That boy went out
of his way to save me,

194
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,620
then ran off to help others.

195
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,500
We looked at him.
Happy now? Let me guess.

196
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,540
You want us to get
beat up like that, too?

197
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,090
You wanna see us broken down
and covered in mud?

198
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,130
The heroes are the ones
who are getting dirty!

199
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,380
They're the people who'll
have to wash away the stain.

200
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,430
Ochaco.

201
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,610
You get it, right? She's up
there fighting. For all of us.

202
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,110
She wants to see everyone smile.

203
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,820
Especially you.

204
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,950
Uraraka.

205
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,540
[OCHACO] I wish I could reassure
everybody here, but I can't.

206
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,380
And I'm sorry about
that, really, I am.

207
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,050
The truth is, we're all scared.

208
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,340
We're just like you!

209
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,510
We care about our friends
and neighbors, too!

210
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,220
[OCHACO] Watching him trying
to save people so desperately

211
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,390
got me thinking.

212
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,020
When a hero is in pain...

213
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,440
When heroes are suffering...

214
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,440
...the ones who will
protect them are...

215
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,320
[OCHACO'S DAD]
Ochaco. You're missing it.

216
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,320
The hero is over there!

217
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,540
[CITIZEN 137A]
Hey! Eel-Boy!

Eel-Boy! Eel-Boy! Eel-Boy!

221
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,050
[OCHACO]
The people who will protect them

222
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,430
are the ones they fight for.

223
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,890
[inhales]

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,770
So please. Lend him your
support! Help him fight for us!

225
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,560
[OCHACO]
Search your hearts.

226
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,400
Will you allow him
to rest at your side?

227
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,900
Will you give him time
to prepare for his battle

228
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,200
to protect you?

229
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,320
Izuku Midoriya is carrying
the burden of his power

230
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,950
and trying to keep us safe.

231
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:10,870
But he still has a lot
to learn. He's just a kid.

232
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,250
Yeah, but--

233
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,090
[OCHACO]
I'm begging you!

234
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,760
Let UA...

235
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,850
[OCHACO ...continue to be
his hero academy!

236

[sobbing]

237
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:48,870
[NEZU] A single step is all it
takes to start down a new path.

238
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,540
[gasps] Come back!

239
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,960
[MANDALAY] So? Which pair
of shoes did you pick out?

240
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,920
[KOTA]
Those! It's gotta be them!

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,510
The red ones!

242
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,680
[IZUKU]
This is the story

243
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,810
of how I became the
world's greatest hero. Sure.

244
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,190
But not just me. It's the story

245
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,110
of how we all became
the greatest of heroes.

246
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,710
Midoriya.

247
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,500
We can't just sit here!

248
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,420
[TENYA]
It shouldn't be us this time.

249
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,970
[TENYA]
You've got this, Uraraka.

250
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,760
Mr. Deku, I'm sorry!

251
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,350
Forgive me!

252
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:55,980
I was too afraid to say anything
before. I'm sorry. But--

253
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,020
That girl was trying so hard
to get everyone to let you stay,

254
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,860
and I knew I had
to do something!

255
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,780
Because I want
to be like you!

256
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,580
[KOTA]
And that's why I'm here!

257
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,750
So you don't have to cry
anymore! Everything'll be okay!

258
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,580
Wow. Kota.

259
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,590
I take it you're
a UA student?

260
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,090
[IZUKU]
Yes.

261
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,430
A bunch of the shelters
turned me away.

262
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,600
They said they weren't letting
any heteromorphs inside.

263
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,560
UA was the only refuge
that would welcome me.

264
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,770
But you know, I got to see
you again, so I'm happy.

265
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,270
Thanks for what you did
back then, crybaby hero.

266
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,330
Maybe before we start
getting hysterical,

267
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,330
we listen to what the
young hero has to say.

268
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,920
He just wants to rest.
It's not like he's planning

269
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,340
to stay here permanently.
The city's short on resources

270
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,180
and pros, so where else
can he recover safely?

271
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,930
Don't you think
he deserves a break?

272
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,930
That's what you teachers were
trying to explain, right?

273
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,430
Yes.

274
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,020
Can't he go to Shiketsu? They've
got a secure campus, too!

275
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,520
He could.

276
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,030
But this same thing would
probably happen to him there.

277
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,530
To be honest, I've had to
face some hard truths lately.

278
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,490
Before things got bad,
I felt like the pros

279
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,000
were just performers
on a stage.

280
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,330
We watched an extraordinary
man named All Might

281
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,460
show us what a “hero”
really was.

282
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,880
We applauded him,
and wanted to be him.

283
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,510
And somewhere along the way,
we forgot that he was a person.

284
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,180
But the stage has
been destroyed.

285
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,060
The script was thrown out.

286
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,230
There's no more money
or fame for the pros,

287
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,940
and plenty of them
have called it quits.

288
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,070
Given all that, you gotta
wonder why the rest of them

289
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,190
still bother fighting for us!

290
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,360
If we reject those who are
trying to help us even now,

291
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,240
what do we have worth saving?

292
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,200
How can we expect
to get our lives back?

293
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,120
I know this is tough.
But come on!

294
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,880
We can't keep acting like
a bunch of spectators!

about a young man in rags
who could use multiple Quirks.

297

Some said he was working
with the villains,

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,270
[ECTOPLASM]
You should go on inside.

308
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,990
Things are settling down.
For the moment, at least.

309
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,420
[ENDEAVOR] In the end,
our actions made Deku suffer

310
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,510
even more, didn't they?
We've made no headway.

311
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,670
We should've sent him here
from the beginning.

312
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,100
No, I think what we're seeing
right now is big progress.

313
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,020
One For All is a
crystallization of power

314
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,810
that can link people together.

315
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,230
It connects hearts. It bound
All Might to Midoriya.

316
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,190
Then Class A planted
their feet at his side.

317
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,580
And now, Uravity has pulled
the citizens into the mix.

318
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Take a sec to look around.

319
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,460
[HAWKS] If these people can
unite and think about others

320
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,300
instead of themselves, we might
just see a bright future

321
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,170
where everybody has
a smile on their face

322
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,180
and heroes really do have
too much time on their hands!

323
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,310
Hey, Dad.

324
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,600
We're in this together.

325
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,020
[ENDEAVOR]
Yes.

326
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,070
[NEZU]
I couldn't make them see.

327
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,450
But then, your kids got them
to open their eyes, Aizawa.

328
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,950
They sure did. Tell the class
rep he's done a good job.

329
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,540
[NEZU]
How's the leg?

330
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,130
[AIZAWA] I won't be out-jumping
Mirko any time soon.

331
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,040
What about Kurogiri?

332
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,760
[AIZAWA]
I try talking to him every day.

333
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,800
Unfortunately, there's
been no change.

334
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,550
[NEZU] After he responded to you
and Mic calling out to him,

335
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,810
I was hoping we'd
see some improvement.

336
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,600
That's why he was secretly
transported to Central Hospital

337
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,350
for restoration research.

338
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,770
Mirko crushed the Nomu
with his Quirk in the lab.

339
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,530
But if you hadn't been able
to break through to Shirakumo,

340
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,230
at least a little bit,
we wouldn't have

341
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
any strongholds today.

342
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,740
[NEZU] It's not much, but we
were able to spin a thread

343
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,370
of hope that helped
us turn the tables.

344
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,960
[AIZAWA] We're continuing
to watch for Toga?

345
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,710
[NEZU] Yes. We figured out
the amount of blood she needs

346
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,920
to ingest and the duration
of her transformations.

347
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,170
That's why evacuees
can only enter campus

348
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,970
after a period of isolation.

349
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,970
[AIZAWA]
UA is our stronghold.

350
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,600
It's time for our next move.

351
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,140
[NEZU]
Yes, it is.

352
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,060
[ECTOPLASM]
Where are you headed?

353
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,900
[ALL MIGHT] Check on those
hero-hating groups.

354
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,860
They still refuse to
take shelter with us.

355
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,410
[ALL MIGHT]
I could try to stop you,

356
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,370
but I know your
mind is made up.

357
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,830
Well, even if you
don't want my help,

358
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,090
I won't let you do
this alone, understand?

359
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,340
[IZUKU] That's why
you don't have to worry.

360
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,680
One more thing!

361
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,620
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

362
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,200
After returning to UA, I make
a new vow with my peers--

363
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,710
No, my friends from Class A.

364
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,710
We swear to take back
everything we've lost.

365
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,550
From now on, we'll work together

366
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,970
until everyone is
able to smile again.

367
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,850
Next time,
"No Man Is an Island."

368
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,180
The heroes connect.
And the heroes disperse.

369
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,430
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
