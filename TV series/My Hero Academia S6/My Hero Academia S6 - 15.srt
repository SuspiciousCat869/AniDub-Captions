1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,140
[IZUKU] The Counter-Quirk
Maximum Security Special Prison,

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,010
also known as "Tartarus."

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,190
[IZUKU] It's a facility
built on the open sea

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,400
about five kilometers off
the coast of the mainland.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,730
To the public it's just
another out-of-sight place

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,020
to lock up villains.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,070
But in reality, it's a dumping
ground where the government

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,820
can monitor those they deem a
serious threat to public safety.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,910
Those imprisoned here
have terrifying Quirks.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,170
[IZUKU] Inmates are split among
six cellblocks that reflect

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,420
how severe a criminal's
offenses were

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,170
and the danger their
abilities pose.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,880
The more dangerous the person,

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,300
the deeper underwater
they're held.

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,220
It's said that no one sent
here will ever leave alive.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,350
This is the dark side of
our super-powered society.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,020
[ALL FOR ONE]
I feel it.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,810
Events didn't play out exactly
to plan, but we have momentum.

19
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,950
[SHIGARAKI, ALL FOR ONE] Those
poor fools like to think that

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,910
tomorrow will bring them hope.

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,290
But I'm not giving the
world time to recover.

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,250
It's my turn now.
My turn forever.

23
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,040
Listen well, my tireless Nomu.

24
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,550
It's time to give you
an important task.

25
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,760
Free my real body.

26
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,240
[GYGES] So, Brother,
you hear that Endeavor

27
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,610
let Tomura Shigaraki escape?

28
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,790
[BRIAREOS] Yeah. Word is
him and 132 members

29
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,790
of the Paranormal Liberation
Front are on the run now

30
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,330
along with seven
of those Nomu things.

31
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,790
[GYGES] Raid teams got
their butts handed to 'em.

32
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,210
[BRIAREOS]
A hundred and forty-five pros

33
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,830
are in the hospital,
including Endeavor.

34
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,460
Word has it Midnight
and Majestic are dead.

35
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,890
Some other big names, too.

36
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,060
[GYGES]
Damn it.

37
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,050
If only we could've
been there to help.

38
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,560
[BRIAREOS]
Don't get worked up.

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,980
Guarding this place is an
important, honorable duty.

40
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,770
Best thing we can do
is keep a strong front here.

41
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,480
[GYGES]
Yeah, yeah, I know.

42
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,150
[BRIAREOS]
What set those off?

43
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,610
[GYGES]
Control room, come in!

44
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,940
Look there!

45
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,990
[GYGES]
Are those Nomu?

46
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,280
[BRIAREOS]
Shoot them!

47
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,330
[GYGES]
What the...?

48
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,260
What's going on?
Briareos! Gyges?

49
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,260
Control room here!
Give us a status report.

50
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,430
Come in? Hello?
Can you hear me?

51
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,260
[GYGES]
This is Gyges.

52
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,390
We've got Nomu out here.

53
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,190
Not sure how many, but I think
they killed my brother.

54
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,980
This is a code red.

55
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,190
No time. Authorize
counter protocols!

56
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,080
[SHIGARAKI, ALL FOR ONE]
Such feeble resistance.

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,890
[PRISON STAFF 128B]
Sounds like they expect

58
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,510
that giant city crusher
tomorrow morning.

59
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,340
[PRISON STAFF 128C]
Gigantomachia.

60
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,850
He's 'ol scarface's
flunky, right?

61
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,270
[PRISON STAFF 128B] Yeah.
They're having to copter him in.

62
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,190
[PRISON STAFF 128C] Should have
killed him in the field.

63
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,060
[PRISON STAFF 128B] How would
you propose they do that?

64
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,990
Hit him with a missile?
We don't just blow people up.

65
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,650
I mean, they guy's still human.

66
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,980
How do you call him that
with a straight face?

67
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,160
He's a beast. Just a
walking monstrosity.

68
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,160
Same as the other
deranged animals

69
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,620
we've got caged up in here.

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
[PRISON STAFF 128B]
Stop talking like that.

71
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,210
You know everything you're
saying is being recorded.

72
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,210
The Hearts and Mind Party
is defunct now,

73
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,670
but there'll be others.

74
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,880
We already get enough flak

75
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,300
about human rights
violations as it is.

76
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,170
Last thing we need's a
conversation like this to leak.

77
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,550
Watch yourself.

78
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,880
I'm just speaking the truth.

79
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,260
They may look like
you and me on the surface.

80
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,690
Mostly. But we only
call them human

81
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,150
because Quirks warped
our perceptions so badly.

82
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,020
In truth...

83
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,060
...they're fundamentally
different from us normal people.

84
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,830
[SYSTEM VOICE 128A] Intruder
alert. Code Red. I repeat.

85
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,040
This is a Code Red
security alert.

86
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,000
Floors and exits
have been sealed off.

87
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,620
All staff should
be on high alert.

88
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,630
[PRISON STAFF 128D] We've
got multiple Nomu incoming.

89
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,090
They've already managed to
break through the Bronze Gate.

90
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:21,760
Nomu? They're attacking here,
now of all times? Don't tell me.

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
They came straight
from the big battle!

92
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,680
Is this payback?

93
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,800
[PRISON STAFF 128D] Severing our
connection to the mainland.

94
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,020
[PRISON STAFF 128B]
The bridge is going under

95
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,140
starting with section A01!

96
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,700
You're struggling in vain.

97
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,280
[PRISON STAFF 128C]
Attention Cottus Troops,

98
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,320
you have permission
to fire at will.

99
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,040
Capture targets dead or alive.

100
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,040
I repeat, permission
granted to use

101
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
any and all modes
of suppression.

102
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,880
[SHIGARAKI]
I told you before, Master.

103
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,270
This is my body, not yours.

104
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,060
[ALL FOR ONE] Ah, you're awake.
But you should keep resting.

105
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,520
Your Super Regeneration
isn't ready,

106
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,060
and I need your body
in tip top shape.

107
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,530
[SHIGARAKI]
So what am I doing out here?

108
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,950
You're sending me
into battle again.

109
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,240
[ALL FOR ONE]
No, just a simple task.

110
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,660
[SHIGARAKI]
Give me back control.

111
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,370
[ALL FOR ONE] You're the one
who wanted my power, Tomura.

112
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
You abhor this cruel world

113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,500
that didn't reach out
a hand to help you.

114
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,010
And I've given you the ability
to manifest your hatred.

115
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,510
What's important now is the
passion that fuels your ire.

116
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,340
Our success is the
result of your will.

117
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,970
I will not be your pawn.

118
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,400
My dear boy, you have
the wrong idea.

119
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,280
You're a treasure in my eyes,
someone I seek to lift up.

120
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,490
You are the next me.

121
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,000
[PRISON STAFF gasp]

122
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,170
[PRISON STAFF 128B]
Tower Two is down!

123
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,800
It's Shigaraki, he's here.

124
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,260
[PRISON STAFF] The decay is
spreading like it did in Jaku!

125
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,390
[PRISON STAFF 128C]
Start evacuating the staff!

126
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,640
[ALL FOR ONE]
Hm... I've found my location

127
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,690
thanks to the
Search Quirk I stole.

128
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,730
In the deepest corner,
500 meters below sea level.

129
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,740
Even if you used Decay on the
building while sparing my body,

130
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,530
the water pressure
would kill me.

131
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,490
And I have doubts
that you're currently

132
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,330
up to the task anyway.

133
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,410
What I need now
is more villains.

134
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,590
It's a terrible fortress
they've built.

135
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,840
Machia would barely
help in this situation.

136
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,720
We'd be hard-pressed
to overcome their forces.

137
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,100
I'd say the same thing
if your body were complete.

138
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,230
Tartarus is all but impenetrable
from the outside.

139
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,060
Of course, there is
always a way.

140
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,740
[PRISON STAFF 128D]
Power is fluctuating.

141
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,660
[PRISON STAFF 128B] The whole
surveillance system is down!

142
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,490
I think we suffered
an EMP attack!

143
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,450
We've still got
emergency security!

144
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,370
Get the sensers back on
before the prisoners

145
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,490
realize what's happening.

146
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,130
Rebooting in three, two...

147
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,210
The attack came from
the inside this time!

148
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,090
[PRISON STAFF 128C]
Surveillance can't be restored!

149
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,010
Crap! Security's offline.

150
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,300
[PRISON STAFF 128B]
That means...

151
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,050
[PRISON STAFF 128C]
An inmate used their Quirk

152
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,300
inside the facility!

153
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,810
[PRISON STAFF 128B]
No, it couldn't be!

154

308
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,870
Dire times.

309
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,710
[MOB shouting]

310
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,010
Just try to ignore 'em.

311
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,510
I'm sure things will work out.

312
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,260
We know you, Todoroki.

313
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,680
So we know what
a good person you are.

314
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,350
You'll brave this.

315
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,150
[REPORTER 128A]
Did you know about your brother?

316
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,510
[REPORTER 128AA] What's
Endeavor's current condition?

317
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,060
Is he going to pull through?

318
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,640
[REPORTER 128A] Does he have
any idea the disastrous state

319
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,310
Japan is in thanks to him?

320
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,780
Come on, talk!

321
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,990
Everyone wants to know more
about the Todoroki family.

322
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,070
[REPORTER 128AA] When will your
father have a press conference?

323
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,030
Our viewers are scared!
We want answers!

324
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,030
[STARSERVANT]
Him! He's the source!

325
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
The fire he gives off
blinds you!

326
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,200
He will be the demise
of our world!

327
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,470
[DABI]
Hey now, don't be rude.

328
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,930
You're acting like
we've never met.

329
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,390
Call me Toya.

330
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,810
After all, it's the name
you and mom gave me.

331
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,770
Enji Todoroki!

332
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,810
Let's fall together.

333
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,270
Come and dance with me
in hell, won't you?

334
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,940
[TODOROKI]
His heat was so intense.

335
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,440
Stronger than my
old man's. Too strong.

336
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,990
Flames of hatred.
That's what they were.

337
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,870
[TODOROKI] He's been
watching this whole time.

338
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,330
Waiting to see Endeavor fall.

339
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,620
Ruining his body and the
lives of anyone in his path,

340
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,050
just to make our father suffer.

341
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,930
[TODOROKI]
Toya is me.

342
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,800
[TODOROKI] The reason
I picked a fight with you

343
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,020
was to show my old man
what I was capable of doing.

344
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,520
Without having to rely
on his damned fire Quirk.

345
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,060
I'm going to show him
that I reject his power

346
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,570
and I can take first place
without using it.

347
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,860
[TODOROKI] I was burning
with hate until that day.

348
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,410
Same as him.

349
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,450
Our father can't stop Toya.

350
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,290
I have to be the one
to handle my brother.

351
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,370
Shoto.

352
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,590
Hello!

353
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,920
Whoa. You're Todoroki's
brother and sister!

354
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,960
I'm afraid his throat
suffered minor burns,

355
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,340
so he isn't speaking.

356
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,960
[FUYUMI]
Yes, of course.

357
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,720
The doctored explained
his condition to us earlier.

358
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,840
[NATSUO]
You don't have to talk, Shoto.

359
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,180
Just listen.

360
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,480
[SATO]
I told you not to get up!

361
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,350
You could die!

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,770
[MINETA]
Just stop!

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,400
You're the worst patient.

364

We're not supposed
to let ya leave your room.

365
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,030
Shut up!

366
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,150
Make me fight you and I'll be
even more likely to drop dead.

367
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,040
Why do you have to be so
stubborn about everything, dude?

368
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
There's nothing you can do
to help right now.

369
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,330
Didn't you hear
a word Sero said?

370
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,580
[SERO]
I'll tell you, 'kay?

371
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,580
But you gotta stay calm.

372
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,760
Todoroki's burned bad and

373
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,370
Mr. Aizawa has some
serious injuries,

374
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,920
but they'll both pull through.

375
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,100
Everyone else has regained
consciousness except...

376
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,640
[SERO] The doctors said
Midoriya hasn't shown

377
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,510
any signs of waking up.

378
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,020
[KATSUKI] That bastard.
If he dies, I'll kill him.

379
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,830
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

380
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,660
Prisons across Japan
have been cracked open

381
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,380
and the villains once contained
are now running wild.

382
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,500
As the country
falls into a panic,

383
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,750
citizens stop relying on heroes

384
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,300
and fight the
criminals themselves.

385
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,470
Most of the anger is aimed
at one man, Endeavor.

386
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,140
Next time, "The Hellish
Todoroki Family, Part 2."

387
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,720
This is when we ask ourselves
what it means to be a hero.

388
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,980
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
