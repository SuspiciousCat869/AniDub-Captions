00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,970
Please keep this channel open!

160
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,060
[KATSUKI]
I'll crush the scumbag!

161
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,780
[IZUKU]
Follow me. I'm the one you want!

162
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,090
[ENDEAVOR] Why would Shigaraki
be coming after you?

163
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,510
Explain yourself now!

164
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,800
[IZUKU]
It'll have to wait.

165
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,390
I'm too far away
to have eyes on him,

166
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,470
especially given all
the dust in the air.

167
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,190
If it looks like he's
changing directions,

168
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,270
can you give me a heads up?

169
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,350
I don't like being in the dark.

170
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,940
[SHIGARAKI]
I can access the data

171
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,070
this Quirk's previous
user accumulated.

172
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,280
And they saw One For All right
before their power was stolen.

173
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,110
Lucky me.

174
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,330
He's down!

175
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,420
[ENDEAVOR] New course!
He's moving to the southwest!

176
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,710
Yeah. Pretty much
what I expected!

177
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,430
I can buy you more time.

178
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,140
You evacuate the civilians!

179
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,350
[ENDEAVOR]
What?!

180
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,680
[SHIGARAKI]
Their communicators are a pain.

181
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,350
I'm sure I can get rid of them.

182
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,560
Okay, heads up!

183
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,600
Shigaraki is now
heading southwest!

184
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,980
He has super
regeneration somehow!

185
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,860
Nobody underestimate him.

186
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,900
[ENDEAVOR]
Targeting Midoriya? Why?

187
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,580
I don't understand,
but he did take the bait.

188
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,410
I have to catch up.

189
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,370
I won't leave him on his own.

190
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,780
Right! He said
he's following us.

191
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,080
I heard!

192
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,080
You're the one
who's not listening!

193
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,630
That creep has leveled-up
into a final boss!

194
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,920
You better make damn sure
you don't get caught.

195
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,430
Um, Kacchan, why are
you following me?

196
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,470
Y'wanna die?

197
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,800
[IZUKU]
What?

198
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,640
[KATSUKI] There's no time
to explain the situation

199
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,560
so I'm the only one who
gets what's happening!

200
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,680
I had to come!

201
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,810
Wow! Thank you!

202
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,480
[KATSUKI] You idiot.
I am not doing it for you.

203
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,610
Don't think you're the main
character on the battlefield.

204
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,570
I just owe that piece a' crap
villain a beat down.

205
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,320
[SHIGARAKI] Will you join
the League of Villains?

206
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,120
Oh! You must've been scared.
But you stayed strong.

207
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,420
[KATSUKI]
It's my fault All Might

208
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,130
had to hang up his
costume and retire.

209
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,760
You can act as bait.

210
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,260
And once he gets close, I'll
have revenge for what happened!

211
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,020
I will defeat him.

212
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,020
And I'll prove that I'm a hero.

213
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,730
Just don't let your guard down
or get in my way, got it?

214
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,780
[IZUKU]
Yeah, I got it.

215
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,950
[KATSUKI] Deku can
consistently use Full Cowling

216
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,080
at 30 percent without
hurting himself.

217
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,080
In order to keep his body
from getting wrecked,

218
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,250
he only brings it up to 45
percent at the moment of impact.

219
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,500
His time at Endeavor's agency.

220
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,540
All Might's special training.

221
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,840
Every time Deku improves,

222
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,670
I have to grit my teeth
and try to match him.

223
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,930
That's not a problem at
this 30-percent speed.

224
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,590
But as he gets stronger...

225
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,100
Well, I can do the
exact same thing

226
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,980
and keep getting better myself.

227
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,020
I'll go higher than
even you, chosen one.

228
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,560
I won't lose to a damn nerd.

229
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,120
And there's no way I'm gonna
give up when I'm still behind.

230
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,830
[SHIGARAKI]
Let's see. This should work.

231
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,830
[gasps]

232
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:24,390
[SHIGARAKI] The Air Blast from
earlier, plus Radio Waves.

233
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,220
Sorry, Number One.

234
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,550
I don't have time
to play with you.

235
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,390
[ENDEAVOR groans]

236
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,780
Why is my comm on the fritz?

237
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,740
[OPERATOR 114AA]
Emergency!

238
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,450
Our audio's down. We've lost
contact with Team Endeavor.

239
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,410
What's happening over there?

240
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,450
[OPERATOR 114AA] I don't know.
Some new interference!

241
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,640
[KATSUKI]
Hey. Deku!

242
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,390
You feel that?

243
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,640
[IZUKU]
Yeah. I feel it.

244
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,650
[IZUKU]
I've felt it before.

245
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,650
[gasps]

246
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,290
[SHIGARAKI]
This echo in my brain.

247
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,580
I know what it wants.

248
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,250
[IZUKU]
It's the same omen of death

249
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,670
I had that summer
night in Camino.

250
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,130
Izuku Midoriya.

251
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,210
Give me One For All.

252
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,350
Gran Torino!

253
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,890
After I heard "One For All"
over the radio,

254
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,360
I was afraid he would
track you down.

255
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,900
Were you two planning to
fight him by yourselves?

256
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,860
Nonsense.

257
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,030
Shigaraki's Decay destroys
everything it touches!

258
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,700
The smallest piece of debris
could kill you on contact.

259
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,620
He's not someone you can
handle on your own.

260
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,950
Well, we can try.

261
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,750
[GRAN TORINO] Don't forget,
the pro heroes aren't dead yet!

262
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,420
[GRAN TORINO] Those of us
left will handle him.

263
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,430
[AIZAWA] Gran Torino just
grabbed two people.

264
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,190
Looked like Midoriya and Bakugo?

265
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,440
Why are they here?

266
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Was he chasing after them?

267
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,570
[AIZAWA]
Crust, our number-six hero.

268
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,900
Your sacrifice saved me.

269
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,870
[AIZAWA]
While I draw breath...

270
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,620
My Quirk...

271
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,790
My life...

272
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,580
...has one purpose.

273
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,800
To take you down.

274
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,260
I will not let you lay
a finger on my students!

275
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,590
Wow.

276
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,520
You're still pretty cool,
aren't you, Eraser Head?

277
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,560
Kill everyone you see
on the surface.

278
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,480
Now, Kido!

279
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
[KIDO] Figured you might
need an adjustment.

280
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,650
[PRESENT MIC]
Endeavor's sidekick, Kido!

281
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,990
Quirk: Traject.

282
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,450
He can change a
moving object's path!

283
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,700
[KIDO]
Go!

284
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,000
Guess we should've found
a hiding spot first.

285
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,040
[MANUAL]
But we couldn't risk him

286
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,410
touching the ground
again, right?

287
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,540
[AIZAWA]
Thank you, Manual.

288
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,420
No problem. If I go overboard,

289
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,050
the water's gonna force you
to blink, I'm afraid.

290
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,460
We'll work together.

291
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,930
[ENDEAVOR] Tomura Shigaraki.
This is the end for you.

292
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,570
[SHIGARAKI]
Uh-oh.

293
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,490
[ENDEAVOR roars]

294
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,910
That hurt!

295
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,620
[AIZAWA]
I haven't released Erasure yet.

296
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,450
[ENDEAVOR]
He should be powerless!

297
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,820
Was that his physical strength?

298
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,040
And the jump from before.

299
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,420
He can fly through the air with
a simple swing of his arms.

300
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,750
I've seen abilities like this.

301
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,720
[DOCTOR] Even though
he's got tremendous power,

302
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,550
he's still not as strong as All
Might in his prime, I'm afraid.

303
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,300
I focused on altering his brain

304
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,560
instead of
overpowering his body.

305
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,140
What kinda monstrosity
did you create?

306
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,850
[AIZAWA]
He has a bioengineered physique.

307
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,820
It's almost like
he's the perfect Nomu.

308
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,280
[MANUAL]
Strength is great,

309
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,900
but the number one and number
ten heroes can take him.

310
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,160
You're an atrocity!

311
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,330
[ENDEAVOR] His movements are
getting even faster.

312
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,580
That was a nice warmup.

313
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,790
[GRAN TORINO]
You should be safe here.

314
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,630
His power. Erasure took
it just now, right?

315
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,550
[GRAN TORINO] Yes.
He's weakened, if only slightly.

316
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,630
What, did you get tired?

317
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,430
Why are we still
so close to him?

318
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,140
I trust Gran Torino.

319
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,220
[GRAN TORINO] So, Bakugo
knows your secret, right?

320
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,770
Toshinori told me.

321
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,520
We can't go much further.

322
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Shigaraki's moving faster than
anyone could have expected.

323
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,320
Few will be able to follow him.

324
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,570
And now that our comms
have gone down,

325
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,610
if he chases you too far out,
no one will be able to catch up.

326
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,450
You stopped him temporarily.

327
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,490
Got him away from the civilians

328
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,170
and put him within
Eraser's field of vision.

329
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,210
Those are quite
the accomplishments.

330
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,920
I'll go back and keep
your teacher on the move.

331
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,340
Wait, are you saying we're
just supposed to hide?

332
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,670
[GRAN TORINO]
All For One's Quirks

333
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,180
were transplanted
into Shigaraki.

334
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,180
That's what Present Mic
said, anyway.

335
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,350
So that means that he can...

336
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,930
"All For One."

337
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,770
It allowed its user to
take Quirks from others.

338
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,940
Then the user could
keep the Quirks for himself

339
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,110
or give them to someone else.

340
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,070
I can't imagine a worse scenario
than him stealing One For All.

341
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,000
Who could defeat him then?

342
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,450
Right now,

343
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,960
he's just one person.

344
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,920
If we can't stop him,
then what's the point

345
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,750
of there being so many
heroes in this world?

346
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,800
Are those--?

347
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,220
[NOMU DOG 119A growls]

348
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,220
[NOMU 119A screeches]

349
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,470
[IZUKU]
No!

350
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,770
[KATSUKI]
Where did they come from?

351
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,940
The whole lab should've crumbled
to dust in that Decay wave!

352
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,270
So how are there Nomu here?

353
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,370
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

354
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,410
Shigaraki is
approaching full power

355
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,160
and his goal is to steal
One For All from me.

356
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,460
Meanwhile, in order
to stop Gigantomachia,

357
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,210
pros and students
alike are thrown

358
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,590
into a deadly defensive battle.

359
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,670
The fighting continues
with no end in sight.

360
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,180
Next time: "Disaster Walker."

361
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,010
Do Class A and
Class B have enough

362
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,810
combined strength to succeed?

363
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,020
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
