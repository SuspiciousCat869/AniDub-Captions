00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,780
this new power
that I manifested.

162
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,490
Y'mean Blackwhip? You're
gettin' the hang of it.

163
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,780
Also, what's with the hair?

164
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,790
About that.
Kacchan's been amazing

165
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,330
and agreed to let me
chase after him

166
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,040
as a form of training, which I
have not done very well at.

167
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,590
I thought you might have
some guidance for me

168
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,170
given your abilities.

169
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,790
My ultimate goal is to be able
to capture super-fast targets.

170
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,920
But why did he explode you?

171
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,550
Jeez, Bakugo. Can't you
be nice for a change?

172
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,680
[KATSUKI]
Deku's the one who wanted it

173
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
to be like a real battle!

174
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,390
Well, you can
count on me to help!

175
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,510
Although, I'm pretty
new at using my wires.

176
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,560
Isn't Mr. Aizawa the master
of capture techniques?

177
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,070
Well, Young Uraraka,

178
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,190
I'd like you to teach him
how to control his body

179
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,700
when he brakes in midair.

180
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,320
But he doesn't stop,
he's always jumping around.

181
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,240
Yeah, he's a hopper for sure.

182
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,820
[ALL MIGHT]
As his power increases,

183
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,790
he's gonna be able to
stay in the air longer.

184
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,290
[OCHACO]
Ooh!

185
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,710
[ALL MIGHT] He needs to be able
to move around more freely

186
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,880
when his feet aren't
on the ground.

187
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,500
And as for your
homeroom teacher,

188
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,210
I'm afraid he's
busy at the moment.

189
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,510
I've been studying the moves
you and Mr. Aizawa use.

190
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,760
I'm pretty sure
I have them memorized.

191
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,550
But what would really help
is if you can tell me

192
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,060
how they make your body feel.

193
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,520
[OCHACO] Try to imagine that
you're swimming through the air.

194
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,980
Use your arms
and legs to balance.

195
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,140
Know what I mean?

196
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,360
Like swimming.
Yeah, that makes sense.

197
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,690
And then I can use
Air Force for propulsion!

198
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,450
[OCHACO]
Look at you! Nice moves!

199
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,240
Why don't you add in
some Blackwhip training

200
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,820
while you're up there?

201
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,910
[IZUKU]
Right!

202
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,740
[KATSUKI]
Well, he's getting it.

203
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,170
[ALL MIGHT]
Float is a power that allows him

204
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,590
to stop in midair.

205
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,130
It's basically
like Zero Gravity.

206
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,710
If he can train for my
master's Quirk in advance,

207
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,260
maybe it won't
activate randomly.

208
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,180
He can unlock it
when it's necessary.

209
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,600
No surprises.

210
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,020
[KATSUKI]
Hey.

211
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,390
What's up?

212
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
[KATSUKI]
I don't think you'll be able

213
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,440
to hide the truth much longer.

214
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,690
[KATSUKI]
This is totally different

215
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,980
from when he just
had super strength.

216
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,780
People will ask questions.

217
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,240
Which is why we
won't let them see

218
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,280
any new Quirks from now on.

219
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,000
The trick will be making sure
he doesn't go out of control.

220
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,540
Like with Blackwhip.

221
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,000
That night we spoke,

222
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,540
you seemed to understand
the situation.

223
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,220
Before we share
this with others,

224
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,420
we have to think
about it carefully.

225
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,790
What are the ramifications?

226
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,800
Would we be putting
others at risk?

227
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,980
The villains of this world

228
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,390
aren't the only ones
who seek power.

229
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,280
[KATSUKI]
Deku has complete faith in you.

230
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,320
But I still have some questions.

231
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,280
Why didn't you tell him
more about the fourth user?

232
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,200
We know how numbers
five-through-seven died,

233
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,240
but you avoided him. Why?

234
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,670
Before, when I asked you
the same question,

235
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,340
something kept you from
being honest with us.

236
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,630
So talk.

237
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,880
Did you realize something
you wanted to hide?

238
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,000
Is One For All a--

239
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,260
I can't. I'm not certain yet.

240
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,010
And I won't tell him something
I don't know for sure.

241
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,850
Frankly,

242
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,430
I'm concerned about
Young Midoria.

243
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,230
Just like you are.

244
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,110
The thing is, he doesn't
think about himself.

245
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,150
He never has.

246
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,870
Even now, with everything he can
do, that still hasn't changed.

247
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,700
It always freaked me out.

248
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,210
That's why I pushed him away.

249
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,000
But as a kid, I didn't
recognize my own weakness.

250
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,720
So I bullied him.

251
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,010
Which is the reason
you're always so quick

252
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,340
to help him train,

253
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,020
so you can make up for
your actions in the past.

254
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,190
Like a penance.

255
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,720
I don't think he feels
you have anything

256
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,480
to atone for, though.

257
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,730
Before, when I said
you were like Endeavor,

258
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,100
I meant that
you've both changed.

259
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,980
He only has hindsight.

260
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,660
My weakened state
was his catalyst.

261
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,870
I'm sure you'll
have another chance

262
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,160
to talk things over
with Young Midoriya.

263
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,950
Though I'm not a great role
model in that department.

264
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,760
[IZUKU]
Smash!

265
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,130
[IZUKU]
I'm punching at 100 percent

266
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,840
and he's still smiling.

267
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,800
Although his body's not
healing as fast as it was!

268
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,260
He's taking damage!

269
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,890
[IZUKU]
My left arm's a mess after

270
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,760
the two full-power
shots I got in.

271
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,390
But One For All has been
cultivated over generations

272
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,320
specifically to
defeat All For One!

273
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,360
Which means I'm the one
who has to stop Shigaraki.

274
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,570
Right here. Right now!

275
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,360
[IZUKU] Using every ounce
of strength in my body!

276
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,660
No matter what happens to me!

277
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,710
[DOCTOR 46A] If you sustain
this type of injury,

278
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,540
even just two or
three more times,

279
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,470
I don't think you'll be able
to move your arms anymore.

280
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,310
[IZUKU]
Three hits, one after the other!

281
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,310
[IZUKU]
Detroit Smash!

282
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,430
[SHIGARAKI groans]

283
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,480
[IZUKU]
Wyoming Smash!

284
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,150
[SHIGARAKI] I'm getting hurt
faster than I can heal.

285
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,860
He'll beat me if I
don't focus on defense.

286
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,900
St. Louis Smash!

287
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,200
[SHIGARAKI] If the heroes
hadn't pushed me

288
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,490
past my limit earlier...

289
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,540
No. Even if my body
wasn't incomplete.

290
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,300
This boy... This power...

291
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,380
You are holding me back
from my dream.

292
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,970
That's exactly why I'm here.

293
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,560
Texas Smash!

294
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,360
[SHIGARAKI]
What do I have?

295
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,730
Which Quirk can stop him?

296
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,070
Come on.

297
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,330
[MANUAL]
He's seriously just a student?

298
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,940
[KATSUKI] Yeah, but if the idiot
keeps this up, he's dead.

299
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,370
[MANUAL]
Huh?

300
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,040
He's using his legs and
Air Force to maneuver around.

301
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,710
Controlling multiple Quirks
at the same time.

302
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,210
Every skill he's ever
learned is in play here.

303
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,960
He's hellbent on
keeping Shigaraki

304
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,790
from touching the ground again.

305
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,050
But his power attacks
didn't stop the bastard.

306
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,220
So now it's an issue of who
can hold out the longest.

307
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,510
Deku's body is busted,
he won't be able to outlast

308
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,270
someone who can regenerate.

309
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,230
Soon, his Quirk is gonna
be stolen from him,

310
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,020
and he'll be nothing but dust.

311
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,480
Todoroki. You done
with the first aid?

312
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,850
Yes. What do you nee--

313
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,230
[KATSUKI]
Shut up and grab ahold a' me!

314
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,490
Endeavor, save your strength

315
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,660
and let me get the
three of us into the air!

316
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,490
You. Keep your old man cool.

317
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,990
We're gonna need him
to pull this off.

318
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,070
You want me to use
maximum firepower.

319
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,370
To end this fight
with a single blast.

320
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,090
I can do that.

321
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,380
They're just children.

322
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,380
[TODOROKI] You take care
of things down here.

323
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,630
[LOCKLOCK] No, I can't
think of 'em that way.

324
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,850
After all,

325
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,840
I recognized Deku as a hero
a long time ago.

326
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,270
You got it. Leave 'em to me!

327
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,470
Strike when Blackwhip
is fully stretched out.

328
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,100
Once I'm in range,
you two beat it, quickly.

329
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,940
The blast is deadly.

330
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,150
[TODOROKI]
Hang in there, Midoriya.

331
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,320
[ALL MIGHT]
I'm not certain yet.

332
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,360
And I won't tell him something
I don't know for sure.

333
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,490
[KATSUKI]
This passed-on ability

334
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,830
originally came
from All For One.

335
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,000
He's got control over
multiple Quirks, too.

336
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,250
I see it now.

337
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,330
You're basically
the same as him.

338
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,050
Even if Deku's Quirk is
some kinda cursed power.

339
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,100
[KATSUKI]
It's still our only hope!

340
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,480
[IZUKU]
You can call me Deku.

341
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,940
But I'm not the same helpless,
defenseless kid anymore!

342
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,270
You hear me? I've changed.

343
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,780
[IZUKU] From now on,
Deku is the name of a hero!

344
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,200
[groans]

345
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
[KATSUKI]
Now!

346
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,670
--What?
--[ENDEAVOR] Back, Deku!

347
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,880
You!

348
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,680
Plus Ultra. Prominence Burn!

349
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:09,350
[SHIGARAKI screaming]

350
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,030
[ALL FOR ONE]
Tomura. Lend me your body.

351
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,730
[BOTH]
Endeavor!

352
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,400
Why won't you die?

353
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,080
[SHIGARAKI, ALL FOR ONE]
Little Brother.

354
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,710
[KATSUKI]
In that moment...

355
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,670
[KATSUKI]
...I didn't plan or think.

356
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,840
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

357
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:54,440
[KATSUKI]
My body just moved on its own.

358
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,000
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

359
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,830
After Kacchan is impaled,

360
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,700
I lose myself to anger

361
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,750
and go after the king
of villains even harder.

362
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,500
But, things change
in an instant.

363
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,260
And I find myself standing off
against Tomura Shigaraki

364
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:48,510
and All For One in the world of
One For All and its past users.

365
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,060
Next time: "The Ones Within Us."

366
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,430
Who could have foreseen this?

367
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,110
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
