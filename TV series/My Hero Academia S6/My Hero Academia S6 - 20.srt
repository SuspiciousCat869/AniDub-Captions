[BEST JEANIST] As usual,
there's nothing connecting

158
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,800
these escapees to
our actual target.

159
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,630
You'd think we would've
been able to get some intel

160
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,050
by this point in the search.

161
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,050
We'll double down our efforts.

162
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,970
[CITIZEN 133A]
Disgraces! Get out of here!

163
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,100
[CITIZEN 133B] We don't want
your so-called help.

164
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,940
If you'd caught Shigaraki
and the others

165
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,440
and when you were supposed to,

166
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,860
these criminals would still
be locked in their prisons.

167
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,400
Take a good look at this town.
You turned it into hell!

168
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,900
[HAWKS]
Endeavor? Let's go.

169
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,200
[CITIZEN 133C] I've been
following reports on the news.

170
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,830
They say Shigaraki was after
someone other than you!

171
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,580
Which means you're still
hiding things from us.

172
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,330
We can't trust you!

173
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,960
You cowards!

174
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,000
[CITIZEN 133C] The families
of the people Dabi murdered

175
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,960
were on TV! Did you see them?

176
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,130
[CITIZEN 133AA]
You created a monster!

177
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,800
[CITIZEN 133A]
Stay away from us!

178
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,180
[CITIZEN 133B]
Seeing your face makes me sick.

179
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,550
[CITIZEN 133AA]
Fake hero!

180
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,550
[CITIZEN 133D] Don't you
ever show up here again.

181
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,060
[HAWKS]
Is that so? I see.

182
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,440
Yeah. Understood.

183
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,610
Maybe someone from the

184
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,520
Paranormal Liberation
Front will crack.

185
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,480
Thanks, Edge Shot.

186
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,360
[BEST JEANIST]
No progress, I take it.

187
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,240
If we keep driving in this
direction, we'll catch up

188
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,120
with Midoriya before long.

189
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,660
Would it be better
if no one figured out

190
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,990
we're working together?

191
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,370
People might start throwing
things at him, too.

192
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,580
Right. Let's put some
distance between us.

193
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,550
[ENDEAVOR] Deku has enough
of a burden to carry as it is.

194
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,630
Even if he's the one who
chose this solitary path,

195
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,300
we're still using him as bait
to draw out the League.

196
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,600
The least we can do is not
make things worse for him.

197
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,480
[HAWKS] Our enemies are doing
too well at laying low.

198
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,390
Meanwhile, the supervillains
who were locked up

199
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,690
in Tartarus are acting up.

200
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,400
And they're almost
certainly taking orders

201
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,360
from you-know-who now.

202
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,190
The League's being smart.

203
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,450
They'll hide behind the chaos
and confusion and use it

204
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,280
as a cover to steal One For All
when the time's right.

205
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,830
[BEST JEANIST]
Meanwhile, the country's heroes

206
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,120
continue to unravel.

207
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,410
If I were All For One,
I'd go on the offensive.

208
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,540
[ENDEAVOR] Right now,
his priority is taking over

209
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,290
Shigaraki's body,
like Deku said.

210
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,630
After losing to All Might,
he couldn't survive

211
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,840
without a labyrinth of
tubes and machinery.

212
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,010
So he's strengthening
his protégé's body

213
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,930
in order to make
that his new home.

214
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,980
[HAWKS] According to Garaki's
post-raid interrogation,

215
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,770
Shigaraki was brought
back online

216
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,610
before his upgrades could
be fully completed.

217
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,980
I don't know how All For One
plans to move into

218
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,450
his new digs, but it's
clear the boy's body

219
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,950
needs to be perfected
before he does.

220
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,320
[ENDEAVOR]
And once that's accomplished,

221
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,160
he'll focus on his next goal.

222
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,450
Taking One For All
by any means necessary.

223
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,080
There's still something
bothering me about that.

224
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,540
[BEST JEANIST]
What?

225
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,420
[HAWKS] Based on what
Midoriya and All Might said,

226
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,340
you have to have a strong body
to steal One For All.

227
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,670
Got it. Cool.

228
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,720
That's where Shigaraki's
younger, enhanced physique

229
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,430
comes into play.

230
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,260
My question is,
why is Shigaraki's hatred

231
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,470
such an important
component in this?

232
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,020
[BEST JEANIST] The force
of that feeling is vital.

233
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,680
With eight people's
minds fighting back

234
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,400
inside One For All, you'd need a
powerful will to overcome them.

235
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,280
But All For One has been
chasing One For All,

236
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,360
his younger brother,
for generations at this point.

237
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,950
Sounds pretty intense to me.

238
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,120
You'd think he'd be carrying
around more than enough

239
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,080
hatred for the
successors already.

240
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,660
Not to mention,

241
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,750
All Might's the reason he ended
up weak and imprisoned, right?

242
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,840
[BEST JEANIST] It would appear
his spite simply isn't enough.

243
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,420
[HAWKS] Or maybe
he just doesn't have any.

244
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,010
I'm going off my
gut here, but...

245
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,430
Despite everything,
doesn't it seem like

246
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,430
the guy's always laughing?

247
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,930
Perhaps his heart is just empty.

248
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,100
[BEST JEANIST]
Whatever the case,

249
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,690
no villain we've found
has information.

250
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,610
And the League is dormant.

251
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,230
They're trying to avoid a fight,

252
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,900
so let's use that
to our advantage.

253
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,070
We should start
expanding our search,

254
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,160
even though that will mean
fewer heroes on the streets,

255
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,410
maintaining order.

256
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,540
[HAWKS]
I don't know, man.

257
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,330
Things get much worse out there,

258
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,080
and the public is going to
turn against us even more.

259
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,580
It'll be harder for us
to rally support.

260
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,790
[BEST JEANIST]
Cut away too much fabric,

261
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
and the design falls apart.

262
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,970
[ALL MIGHT]
He's still on the move.

263
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,510
Have you gotten any
rest at all, young man?

264
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,640
I recommend a
solid night's sleep

265
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,690
on a sublime mattress.

266

Not good.

His GPS signal disappeared!

Damn it!

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm her target!

Right. This is it!

Don't move a muscle

[IZUKU] This sniper was

286
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,430
[HAWKS]
From what I'm told,

287
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,390
you should be able to hold your
own given the power you have.

288
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,980
But I'm still concerned.

289
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,810
All For One and
Shigaraki can't steal

290
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,020
this cultivated ability
from you yet.

291
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,610
And in the last fight,

292
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,030
we confiscated every scrap
of Garaki's tech we could find.

293
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,780
Without that, they don't have
a way to store a Quirk Factor

294
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,070
to be transplanted later.

295
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,370
So, the best choice
for the League

296
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,500
would be to take you in alive.

297
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,080
Thankfully most of the escapees

298
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,670
wouldn't stand a
chance against you.

299
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,840
But... there's one woman
we should be worried about.

300
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,300
[IZUKU]
Is that her?

301
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,800
[HAWKS]
We were basically colleagues,

302
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,510
though she was my senior.

303
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,890
Of course, I'm trying to
track her down her, as well.

304
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,970
But, Deku.

305
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,390
If the two of you
ever cross paths,

306
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,730
run like hell.

307
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,850
Fast as you can.

[IZUKU]
There's no mistake! It's her!

312
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,500
A former public safety
commission hero.

313
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,420
Lady Nagant!

314
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,050
She destroyed my
secure communicator!

315
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,380
That'll signal All Might, Hawks,
and the others that something

316
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,760
is wrong, but I have
no way of warning them

317
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,930
that she's the one
behind this attack.

318
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,510
If they rush in, they'll be
in her line of fire.

319
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,760
What do I do?

320
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,350
Try to escape like
Hawks said to?

321
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,230
Why bother running
when you're already mine?

322
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,820
[IZUKU]
High-angle fire?

323
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,320
[IZUKU]
Analyze the trajectory.

324
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
[LADY NAGANT]
Now I get it.

325
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,120
Huh. That's why he wants you.

326
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,910
[IZUKU grunts]

327
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,670
[SNIPE]
Oh, her? She's insane.

328
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,000
If she weren't around, I'd be
the best long-range shooter

329
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,050
in Japan, no contest.

330
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,550
My Quirk, Homing,
lets me hit any target

331
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,840
I can see within 600 meters.

332
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,600
Can't choose where the shot hits
and it don't pack much punch,

333
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,850
but not too shabby, right?

334
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,060
Her, though.

335
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,230
She can hit the same
mark with skill alone,

336
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,600
and from a perch
three kilometers away!

337
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,360
She's taking away
all my business!

338
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
I'm gonna be sent
out to pasture!

339
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,150
The secret's in her bullets.

340
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,570
She has the ability to
make them into any shape

341
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,110
her heart desires.

342
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,410
See, her two-toned hair
gets mashed together

343
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,120
like epoxy putty, which then
hardens into her ammunition.

344
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,040
I'm talkin' curving bullets,
hollow-point bullets.

345
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,830
Sky's the limit.

346
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,250
Her Quirk is Rifle,
and she's the walking

347
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,710
personification of
a sniper rifle.

348
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,340
Everybody who shoots targets
is jealous of her right arm.

349
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,050
[IZUKU] Precision even
Mr. Snipe is jealous of.

350
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,220
And a good firing rate.

351
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,560
Without Danger Sense,
she woulda had me.

352
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,890
But thanks to the first shot
and the one just now,

353
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,690
I can tell where she is!

354
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,560
About one kilometer ahead!

355
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,190
Her range is triple that.

356
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,900
No point trying to evade
her bullets and outrun her.

357
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,320
Gotta get close!

358
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,240
That's the first time
someone's dodged

359
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,200
more than one bullet.

360
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,950
Where's Pops?
I need to hurry to him.

361
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,460
Right now.

362
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,130
[LADY NAGANT] Yeah, yeah.
After I'm finished with this.

363
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,710
It's time to hide.
The target'll see you.

364
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,470
I'm coming, Boss.

365
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,260
Just hang out
in here for a minute.

366
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,890
Ugh, great.

367
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,850
Maybe I should've
ditched him before.

368
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,690
[LADY NAGANT]
Come on. Walk faster!

369
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,440
Do you want to be
locked up again?

370
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,900
[CHISAKI]
Must find him.

371
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,570
What is wrong with this guy?

372
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,280
[ALL FOR ONE]
Ah, an erstwhile hero.

373
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,370
[ALL FOR ONE]
The lovely Lady Nagant.

374
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,410
It's an honor to meet you.

375
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,960
[LADY NAGANT]
All For One.

376
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,170
You know, not long ago,
you were my main target.

377
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,550
[ALL FOR ONE]
Yet here we are.

378
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,430
I have a favor to ask you.

379
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,930
You're not like the
rest of this rabble.

380
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,970
In the coming days,
a certain student from UA

381
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,940
will set out on his own.

382
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,560
My request is simple:

383
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,770
I would like you to
bring the boy to me.

384
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,730
[ALL FOR ONE]
A number of annoying guardians

385
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,190
will be watching
over him from afar.

386
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,870
It would be wise to get him
alone before you make your move.

387
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,540
[ALL FOR ONE] Perhaps you
could wait for a rainy night.

388
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,370
I find that atmosphere
to be quite--

389
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,080
Don't get ahead of yourself.

390
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,580
Did I say I agreed
to be your pawn?

391
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,960
You told the others to go wild.

392
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,340
So why am I the only one
whose freedom comes at a price?

393
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,140
Because you once killed
a hero. Heh. An ally.

394
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,970
You also desire the destruction
of this failed society.

395
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,890
But that will never come
to pass so long as the boy

396
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,650
is allowed to play
at being a hero.

397
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,070
Great. Another one
of those. Damn.

398
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,690
[CHISAKI]
Pops.

399
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,200
[ALL FOR ONE] The young head
of the Shie Hassaikai.

400
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,530
A friend of yours?

401
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,200
[LADY NAGANT]
No. Something's broken in him.

402
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,040
But I thought
he might be useful.

403
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,080
[ALL FOR ONE]
He is also a victim.

404
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,210
Driven to ruin by these
corrupt false heroes.

405
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:41,470
Let us seal their coffins shut.
Come. You're hired for the job.

406
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,640
[ALL FOR ONE]
Consider this power an advance.

407
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,520
[LADY NAGANT]
Air Walk. Nice.

408
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,480
[LADY NAGANT]
I have a mission to complete.

409
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,450
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

410
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,200
As my fierce fight
with Lady Nagant begins,

411
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,540
she channels the despair
and anger in her heart

412
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,790
into deadly bullets that
explode through the night sky.

413
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,300
I'll need all my wits
if I want to defeat her,

414
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,220
which means trusting in the
Quirks of the previous wielders.

415
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,260
Next time, "The Lovely
Lady Nagant."

416
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,350
The superhuman society
we admired

417
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,720
was more fragile
than anyone imagined.

418
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,810
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
