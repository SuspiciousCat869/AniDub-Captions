If you use One For All in anger,

What an extraordinary sight.

It's the talking corpse
of your grandmother,

the pitifully incompetent
Nana Shimura.

[IZUKU]
Transference?

94
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,430
[ALL FOR ONE] It's said,
when a person receives

95
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,980
an organ transplant,
their personality can change.

96
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,440
Some call this superstition,
but evidence suggests

97
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,110
some traits are passed on
through our cells.

98
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,080
Even I find myself having
the most peculiar dreams

99
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,910
every once in a while.

100
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,790
In them, the original owners of
Quirks I've stolen rage at me.

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,920
Afterward, I awake dejected,

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
closest I ever come to
feeling a sense of guilt.

103
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,420
Fortunately, once I
part with a Quirk,

104
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,810
the person I took it from
never haunts my dreams again.

105
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,130
I find that odd.

106
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,310
I'm not the type
to let anything go.

107
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,100
It wasn't until I met the Doctor
that I discovered the reason.

108
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,230
Just as memories and personality

109
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,310
can reside inside
transplanted viscera,

110
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,780
Quirk factors contain a piece
of the person who wields them,

111
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,610
even after they've
passed on to new users.

112
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,580
My ability to tamper with Quirks

113
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,790
makes me acutely aware
of these phantom souls.

114
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:03,040
Though I admit, I'm not certain
if this is a blessing or curse.

You coward.

116
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,840
I won't let you keep
disgracing Shimura's memory.

118
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,890

[SHIGARAKI]
What do you want?

123
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,150
Of course I'm not the only one
who has the ability

124
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,020
to meddle with powers here.

125
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,070
While I was capable
of manipulating Quirks,

126
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,000
someone close to me--
my younger brother--

127

had the power to gift
his to someone else.

128
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,370
When his Quirk mixed
with my stockpiling one,

129
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,920
it created something
truly unique.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,170
A purgatory of dead wielders

clinging onto a sad
sort of afterlife.

Ah, I'm sorry.

133
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,600
You two have so much
to catch up on.

134
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,810
So you're Kotaro's son.

135
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,310
[SHIGARAKI] And you're
someone I don't even know.

136
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,700
But rest assured, Grandmother.

[ALL FOR ONE] Good, Tomura!
Your hatred is breaking through!

141
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,470
Normally, One For All can only
be transferred by its owner,

142
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:34,470
but your anger opens a path
to take it by force. [laughs]

143
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,090
Oh, that's right.

144
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,770
You've decided to
hate me as well.

145
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,690
A fine development!

You are becoming the new
Symbol of Fear, aren't you?

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,900
I'm afraid your hatred
isn't strong enough, though.

148
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,580
My brother is quite
stubborn, like me.

149
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,240
Is he the next you?

150
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,000
We wouldn't be

if you'd surrendered, you know.

152

You won't be taking
this Quirk, Brother.

153
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,300
Because we've all chosen
to remain inside of this boy.

154
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,090
[SHIGARAKI]
They forced me back.

155
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,520
One For All screwed things up
for my master, and now for me.

156
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,390
What in the hell is this?

157
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,070
It is abject power, Tomura!

158
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,110
If we simply join forces
and combine our might,

[WOMAN 123B]
Please, I need a hero!

314
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,850
My poor husband's bedridden!

315
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,650
I can't get him outta
here by myself!

316
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,190
He's heavy, and I've
got a bad back.

317
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,370
Our place is right
around the corner.

318
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,120
Follow me!

319
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,370
You make sure they're safe
and I'll help her, kay?

320
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,370
Just be careful! I don't
want you getting hurt!

321
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,830
[OCHACO]
I'm good!

322
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,160
[OCHACO]
I have to help everyone I can!

323
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,540
[OCHACO]
It's just...

324
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,050
I can't help but think that
I could have done more.

325
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,590
I...

326
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,720
[WOMAN 123B]
I'm coming, Takeo!

327
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,770
[OCHACO]
That's one fast old lady!

328
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,810
There's no time to spare!
He must be so scared.

329
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,690
Our love is fueling my legs!

330
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,730
He'll be fine! I'll
protect him, I promise!

331
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,070
Oh, you're so nice!

332
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,620
No.

333
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,200
Himiko?

334
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,950
It's been forever, Ochaco.

335
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,500
[OCHACO]
Get back here!

336
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,810
[TOGA]
How sad.

337
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,990
I wanted to talk to you
and Tsu together.

338
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:39,450
How is my precious
little froggy friend? Hm?

339
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,740
And of course, I wanna
see Izuku real bad.

340
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,580
He's so cool when he gets
all bloody and beat up.

341
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,410
I love him like that, don't you?

342
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,800
[OCHACO] Sounds like she's
coming from every direction.

343
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,800
[TOGA] Don't worry, I love my
super-cute floaty friend, too.

344
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,840
In fact, I think
I want to be like you.

345
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,510
So be honest, Ochaco.

346
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,760

347
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:11,030
Hero. What do you
want to do to me?

348
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,940
Do you wanna kill me
like Jin was killed?

349
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,940
Will you murder me, too?

350
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,280
Start talking.

351
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,160
Exactly what are
your intentions?

352
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,120
[OCHACO] You pulled this whole
stunt just to ask me that?

353
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,290
Well it's important.

354
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,290
[OCHACO]
You think so?

355
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,960
Why don't you tell that to the
old lady whose blood you took.

356
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,670
You kill her to ask
a stupid question?

357
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
[TOGA]
Did you say "stupid"?

358
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,260
[OCHACO]
Okay, fine.

359
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,150
What I wanna do is save as
many people as I possibly can!

360
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,020
And you're in
my way, Himiko Toga!

361
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,770
So I'm gonna have
to stop you right now!

362
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,620
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

363
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,450
The battle is creeping
closer to its final stages,

364
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,710
but more surprises await.

365
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,710
As Gigantomachia finally joins
Shigaraki on the battlefield,

366
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,210
Dabi reveals a shocking truth
to us and the world.

367
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,970
Next time: "Dabi's Dance."

368
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,390
It's a cruel,
brutal performance.

369
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,100
Choreographed to
showcase the depths

370
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,600
of his bitterness
and undying hatred.

371
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,020
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
