00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,640
[MIDNIGHT] If this monster
stampedes through Jaku City,

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,310

unthinkable disaster!

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,390

Yes.

No one in our ranks can stop
that thing with force.

12

Ms. Midnight,
are you still there?

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,900
[YAOYOROZU]
Oh, Ms. Midnight, what do I do?

18
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,990
[ASHIDO gasps]
We can't just stand here!

00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,320
Everybody, be prepare to move!

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,080
It's been a year since
we enrolled at UA High.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,790
And in that brief
period of time,

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,660
our teachers taught us
that a real hero

23
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,500
never turns their back
or runs from an enemy.

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,750
[YAOYOROZU]
Together. As one.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,930
We'll take down this villain.

26
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,600
[YAOYOROZU]
We'll stand our ground

27
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,400
and end the villain's
rampage here.

28
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,320
From Tentacole's observations,

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,700
we know he stands
about 25 meters tall.

30
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,410
What's more, the blue
flames that shot

31
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,030
from his back earlier
looked like the ones

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,210
used by the man who
attacked Mr. Aizawa

33
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,290
at our summer training camp.

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,000
That means, it's likely
the League is with him.

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,870
They may be on his back.

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,130
According to Ms. Midnight,
the only way

37
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,300
we'll be able to subdue this
giant is to put him to sleep.

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,760
Normally, this tranquilizer
would be injected,

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,970
but given his size,
I estimate we'd need to pump

40
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,010
at least 30 liters in him.

41
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,310
Considering how quickly
he seems able to move,

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,140
an injection is impossible,

43
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,320
so I'm proposing we
administer the drug orally.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,650
These jars contain
undiluted doses

45
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,360
that should be enough
knock him out.

46
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,860
So we get one in his mouth
and that'll do it?

47
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,120
The big guy goes down
for a long sleep.

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,950
[YAOYOROZU] Mm-hm.
We'll set up a trap for him.

49
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,240
And when he goes down,
we move in.

50
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,260
[HONENUKI] Okay, if the reports
of his size are accurate,

51
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,420
this should be enough
mud to snare him.

52
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,430
Poor Ms. Midnight.
She's still alive, right?

53
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,350
There's no way she'd let
those losers kill her!

[ASHIDO]
I'm sure she's fine.
