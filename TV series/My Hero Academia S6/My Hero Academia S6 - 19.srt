[IZUKU] It's time for you
and the rest of our class

00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,800
to know everything.

00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,600
So I'm writing letters
to try and explain.

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,850
My Quirk is a power passed
on to me from All Might.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,320
It's a gift that Shigaraki and
All For One want to steal.

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,530
So they're coming after me.

00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,700
The last thing I want to do
is put others in danger,

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:36,370
and it's dangerous to be
near me, so I'm leaving UA.

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,160
Being in the hero course
and meeting everyone in Class A

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,090

I could've ever imagined.

The fight between heroes

As if that weren't bad
enough, after the battle,

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,030
tons of criminals were set free
from prisons around the country.

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,180
I can't get enough
of that feeling.

158
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,690
[IZUKU] Why not jump
straight to the roof?

159
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,810
[yells]

160
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,900
Let's not hold anything back.

161
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,740
Show me your blood!

162
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,070
[CITIZEN 132A]
What's going on?

163
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
This smoke! I can't see!

164
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,540
[IZUKU]
There you are. Perfect.

165
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Please take care of him.

166
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,040
Is he okay? Yo,
you're such an idiot.

167
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,760
[IZUKU]
Sorry I didn't get here sooner.

168
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,760
You should take him
to a doctor quick.

169
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,390
And abandon the building;
it's not safe.

170
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,720
I'll make sure nothing
else is damaged.

171
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,390
Got it.

172
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,560
[NAKAGAME] Hard to make him
out through the smoke.

173
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,810
But, there's something
familiar about his voice.

174
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,110
Who is he?

175
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,690
[IZUKU]
Was that overboard?

176
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,360
[EN] Yeah. Too much
of my Smokescreen.

177
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,320
You exceeded the
controllable limit.

178
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,910
[IZUKU]
Okay.

179
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,700
[EN] Careful not to let someone
use your own attack against you.

180
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,200
That's how you lose.

181
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,240
[IZUKU]
Right.

182
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,660
[EN]
Because of One For All's growth,

183
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,040
things've really
gotten out of control.

184
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,290
After eight generations,
it's a lot to harness.

185
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,840
And of course,
since you're the latest

186
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,090
on the chain of wielders,
that means it's going to be

187
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,090
hardest on you,
the ninth person to use it.

188
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,380
I'd recommend you
pull back a bit.

189
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,800
Don't forget that
most of our Quirks

190
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,930
aren't ultimate
moves on their own.

191
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,180
You're putting too much focus
on these individual powers

192
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,480
instead of the whole.

193
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,360
Think of Quirks as tools.

194
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,280
You can use them to build
a path that leads to victory.

195
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,610
[IZUKU]
Muscular.

196
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,570
The man who can withstand
a Smash at 100 percent.

197
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
I haven't forgotten you, either.

198
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,500
[IZUKU]
Seventh. Float!

199
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,670
[IZUKU]
Sixth. Smokescreen.

200
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,460
I'll use it to confuse him.

201
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,090
Think, Izuku.

202
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,180
Remember how your first
battle with him went.

203
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,640
Where the hell are you going?

204
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,510
[IZUKU] Fourth. Predict his
moves with Danger Sense.

205
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,350
Fifth. Blackwhip!

206
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,240
[MUSCULAR]
Enough playing games.

207
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,530
[IZUKU] Tell me where Shigaraki
and All For One are hiding.

208
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,070
I know they broke you out.

209
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,490
Who cares? They told me
I should go wild

210
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,410
and do whatever I want,
which is how live anyway.

211
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,830
This talking is so boring.
Like your dumb tricks.

212
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Let's cut to the good stuff.
I live for the adrenaline.

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,010
I want a full-power brawl
like we had that night.

214
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,880
No holding back!

215
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,100
[IZUKU] Why do you chase
after such extremes?

216
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,560
Cause I don't wanna have any
regrets when I finally die.

217
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,190
[IZUKU] Oh, yeah?
And what would you regret?

218
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,190
Not enjoying every thrill
life has to offer to the max.

219
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,610
[IZUKU] You don't think there
was another path for you,

220
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,150
Goto Imasuji?

221
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,410
Nope! Not a chance.

222
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,120
What? You trying
empathize with me?

223
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,700
Waste someone else's
time with that BS.

224
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,750
My heart beats with a thirst
for blood and battle!

225
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,540
Nothing else in this
whole wide world matters.

226
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,960
[IZUKU] I never found out why
they ended up becoming villains.

227
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,470
What caused all their anger.

228
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:44,140
If I had known, maybe things
would've been different.

229
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,310
Shigaraki killed
so many innocent people.

230
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,640
He hurt those I care about.

231
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,060
I wish there was a way
of reasoning with you.

232
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,270
But it sounds like
this is inevitable.

233
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,940
Give me your full
power, Midoriya!

234
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,610
[IZUKU]
If we have to fight,

235
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,030
at least I'll learn
something about him.

236
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,990
When did you turn
into a boring guy

237
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,950
who just stands around?

238
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,370
[IZUKU] There are spaces
between your muscles.

239
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,130
Whenever they've
reached their limits,

240
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,290
they peel back and disappear.

241
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,550
[IZUKU]
You want a head-on fight,

242
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,220
but you tried to
trap me at first.

243
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,930
Is it because you know
something's wrong

244
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,220
with your power?

245
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,850
You didn't realize how strong
Shindo's Vibrate truly is.

246
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,440
You think you're so clever?

247
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,770
[IZUKU]
One For All, Full Cowling.

248
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,030
Forty-five percent impact.

00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,910
[IZUKU]
Detroit Smash!

250

[IZUKU]
This is my full power at work.

251
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,260
[TOTEKI]
Where are Shindo and Nakagame?

Huh? That's the villain!

260
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,620
I didn't even get a chance
to say "thank you."

261
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:35,500
[CITIZEN 132A] Here. Use this.
It'll make carrying him easier.

Get the car!

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,340
[CITIZEN 132C]
And, up!

264
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,210
You're helping us?

265
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,380
It's not like we want anyone
to get hurt or anything.

266
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,850
I figure the least we can
do now is hear you out.

267
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:56,350
[SHINDO] That guy.
He was at the licensing exam.

268
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,980
But today, he fought like
a different person.

269
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,240
Was it really the same kid?

270
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,660
[ARMORED POLICE OFFICER 132A]
Freeze! What do you want?

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,910
[IZUKU]
You have any spare iron maidens?

272
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,080
[ARMORED POLICE OFFICER 132A]
Maidens? Wait, that's...

273
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,630
One of the escapees!

Please restrain him.

[ARMORED POLICE OFFICER 132A]
Ah! Hold on!

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,930
[IZUKU] Danger sense has calmed
down for the time being.

No. I'm good.

[IZUKU] Fine thanks
to the Mid-Gauntlets.

282
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,370
As far as compression
support items go,

283
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,500
they're super high quality.
Thanks again.

284
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,000
Glad you thought to order
them from the US

285
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,040
before travel and shipping
restrictions were imposed.

286
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,670
They're prototypes, but they
should boost your endurance.

287
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,170
Best of all, the support
affects your entire body.

288
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,470
They won't withstand your power

if you're at 100
percent, though.

290

Try not to go overboard
before your rematch, okay?

version of his ringtone.

295
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,030
It's me, hey.

296
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,200
[HAWKS]
All Might. Good to hear you.

297
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,450
Just wanted to check in.
How is Midoriya?

298
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,660
[ALL MIGHT]
Fine. He's here with me now.

299
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,710
[IZUKU]
Gotta go. Sorry.

300
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,170
[ALL MIGHT]
Or at least, he was.

301
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,500
Heh. Let me guess.
He ran off again.

302
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,090
He doesn't want any people
around if he gets attacked.

303
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,760
Pretty brave, actually.

304
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,220
He's chosen to
isolate and prepare,

305
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,180
not the worst idea in the world.

306
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,220
But if the people who stormed
Tartarus come at him

307
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,770
in full force,
it's over for all of us.

308
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,020
Like Midoriya said,
our best chance

309
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,860
is to track them down instead.

310
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,230
I know it's a hard
position for you,

311
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,610
but I'm glad you're there
to support him.

312
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,620
[DOCTOR 132A]
Let's see.

313
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,910
From what I understand, you
survived some serious injuries

314
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,830
in the past and were told
that further trauma

315
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,750
could cost you the
use of your arms.

316
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,290
Previously your injuries
were caused

317
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,710
by small explosions
inside your body.

318
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,760
Fortunately, this time, that
power surfaced and escaped.

319
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,800
Your scans suggest that
you used your Quirk

320
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,550
to reinforce your physique
from the inside out,

321
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,720
which is why your limbs

322
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,010
weren't completely
shattered like before.

323
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,140
In short, the injuries
are similar,

324
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,020
but your frame was more
prepared for them this time.

325
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,060
Nevertheless, your body
won't keep bouncing back.

326
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,860
You still need to be careful.

327
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,240
[IZUKU'S MOM] Will you explain
what's going on? Please?

328
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,330
[ALL MIGHT] Hope you're
sure about this, kid.

329
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,550
So, this power of his.

330
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,510
He can control it because
he was born Quirkless.

331
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,680
And now there are some bad
people who're after my son.

332
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,350
[IZUKU'S MOM]
What's going to happen to him?

333
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,230
We're still figuring out
the logistics,

334
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,480
but he should be
safe at the school.

335
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,690
[IZUKU]
I'm not going back to UA.

336
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,700
What do you mean?

337
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,620
Oh, kid.

338
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,370
[ALL MIGHT]
I thought he might say that.

339
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,500
No matter where I go,
Shigaraki will know my location.

340
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,960
He must be licking his wounds,

341
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,130
or else he'd be here
storming the hospital.

342
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,460
I don't want anyone
else to get hurt.

343
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,760
Especially not because of me.

344
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,880
And If the League is able
to reach their full power,

345
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,050
things will be even worse
than they are now.

346
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,510
That cannot happen.

347
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,350
I have to stop Shigaraki
and All For One.

348
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,890
You're here because you
couldn't beat those villains!

349
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,270
Don't throw your life away!

350
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,860
[IZUKU]
I'll get stronger.

351
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,900
[IZUKU'S MOM] I have loved
watching you grow into a hero.

352
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,700
But hearing this. It's too much.

353
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,830
When I was a kid,
you once smiled

354
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,330
and thanked me for saving you.

355
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,130
[IZUKU]
That made me so happy.

356
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,670
Oh, help me!

357
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,720
I am here!

358
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,180
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Wow! Thank you, All Might.

359
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,520
Hey, wait. Izuku?
It was my boy the whole time?

360
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,730
[IZUKU]
That's why... I have to go now.

361
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,110
Don't you worry.
I'll always come home to you.

362
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,030
[ALL MIGHT]
From now on.

363
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,570
Will you allow me to devote
myself to Young Izuku?

364
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,080
I beg you.

365
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,950
I swear to protect your son.
Even if it costs me my life.

366
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,460
[ALL MIGHT]
I could try to stop you.

367
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,250
But I know your mind is made up.

368
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,670
Well, even if you
don't want my help.

369
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,470
I won't let you do this
alone, understand?

370
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,810
[BEST JEANIST]
He's leaving UA?

371
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,270
No. I get it.

372
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,520
This works in our favor.

373
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,400
He's the only one with a
chance of pinning down

374
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,820
Shigaraki's whereabouts.

375
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,440
In fact, I already planned to
design our operation around him.

376
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,660
Right. We'll follow at an
appropriate distance.

377
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,240
Gotta be all cool even
on the phone, huh?

378
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:51,250
[GRAN TORINO] You don't say.
That's Shimura for you.

379
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,800
Even in the afterlife,
she's crying over our choices.

380
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,380
[GRAN TORINO]
I should've killed him

381
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,220
on the battlefield when
I had the chance.

382
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,930
I apologize.

383
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,480
Don't be too stubborn.

384
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Sometimes you have to kill a
person in order to save them.

385
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,650
Be sure to remember that.

386
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,740
Whatever you decide to do,
you make damn sure

387
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,780
you settle the score with
the League of Villains.

388
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,250
[IZUKU]
Hawks. Best Jeanist.

389
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,840
Endeavor and All Might.

390
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,880
We're teaming up to end this.

391
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,930
[IZUKU] Together we'll keep
anyone else from getting hurt.

392
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,060
[IZUKU]
We have to stop All For One.

393
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,570
[IZUKU]
I have to.

394
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,490
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

395
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,290
As I try to figure out where
Shigaraki could be hiding,

396
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,370
I take on every escaped prisoner
who crosses my path.

397
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
But a new obstacle awaits me,

398
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,380
a deadly assassin in
All For One's employ.

399
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,220
Her name is Lady Nagant.

400
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,510
Next time, "Hired Gun."

401
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,180
This sniper has
a complicated past

402
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,180
and now she's got me
in her crosshairs.

403
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,230
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
