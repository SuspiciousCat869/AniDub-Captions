00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,390
I'll protect Best Jeanist!

163
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,940
Power!

164
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,650
Let's hear it again! Power!

165
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,030
Lemillion?

166
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,260
Right when we needed you.
But how did you know?

167
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,680
[MIRIO] The pros at the villa
gave us a heads up,

168
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,800
so I rushed over
using Permeation.

169
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,730
The Nighteye Agency was scouting
a villain hideout nearby.

170
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,650
Dang, he's a big one, huh?

171
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,360
[MIRIO] It's been half a year
since I was in the field.

172
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,030
Woof. Gettin' kinda sappy here.

173
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,370
[MIRIO] Bubble Girl reached out
to me with the intel personally.

174
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
She says tomorrow there's
gonna be an operation

175
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,160
that'll wipe out villains
on a national scale.

176
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,080
And I want to do whatever I can.

177
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,000
These past two months,

178
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,370
Eri has done extensive
training with her power.

179
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,510
Using small amounts of energy
on lizards and bugs.

180
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,680
I've been by her side
the whole time.

181
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,840
I've seen the results.

182
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,050
Sorry, Eri.

183
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,670
I know I'm sorta,
kinda using you, but...

184
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Will you try Rewind on me?

185
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,350
So I can help them?

186
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,060
[ERI]
Don't apologize.

187
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,400
This is why I've been
practicing so hard.

188
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,660
[MIRIO]
Thank you, Eri.

189
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,320
You're too good to me.

190
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,460
Whoa not cool.

191
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,250
I wanted to end this fight fast,

192
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,120
but it's gonna take
way more than one punch.

193
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,510
Heya, somebody! Help!

194
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,770
[KATSUKI]
My explosions earlier...

195
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
[KATSUKI] ...were unlike
any I've unleashed before.

196
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,560
These were intense.

197
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,690
Strong, fast, distinct blasts.

198
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,450
[KATSUKI]
I've never felt such a rush.

199
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,610
[KATSUKI] This what happens
when you face death?

200
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,160
Whatever. I'll save everyone.

201
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,300
[yells]

202
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,470
[TENYA] I can't take my eyes
off you for a second!

203
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,640
Ground yourself!
You shouldn't be fighting!

204
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,430
Output at 100 percent.

205
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,730
Yo, Nejire!

206
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,890
Are you sure you're all right?

207
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,520
I'm peachy now that you're here.

208
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,110
Weird, huh?

209
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,230
[BEST JEANIST]
Your hero name is a wish.

210
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,530
How you want to be or how
you think you should be.

211
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,670
You haven't started looking
beyond yourself yet.

212
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,910
When you become a second year

213
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,330
and get your provisional
license, come back here.

214
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,760
I'll ask you for your
chosen name again.

215
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,680
[BEST JEANIST] Were you able
to look beyond yourself, Bakugo?

216
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,130
I chose a hero name.

217
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,010
I wanted you to hear it
in person first.

218
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,050
From now on call me...

219
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,600
...Great Explosion Murder God
Dynamight, got it?

220
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,430
[BEST JEANIST]
Child!

221
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,480
[TENYA]
So long!

222
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,480
[HADO]
Big yikes.

223
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,520
[MR. COMPRESS]
How crude!

224
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
[SPINNER]
Lame

225
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,980
[laughs] That's an
awesome hero name!

226
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,400
It's super funny.

227
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,690
You take that back, ya moron!

228
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,900
"Without joy and laughter
to balance the sorrow,

229
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,410
this world can't hope
for a bright future."

230
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,660
That's my motto.

231
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,660
Be careful not to wear it out!

232
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,410
Now then.

233
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,050
It looks like the big bad
is on the ropes.

234
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,430
[MIRIO] If we handle the rest a'
these creeps, we'll be golden.

235
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,810
Think your friends are
having fun over there!

236
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,100
[DABI]
But you look distraught.

237
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,100
I'm worried you're
not enjoying yourself.

238
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,940
Yeah, well, you either.
Your body's burning up.

239
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,190
I'm glad you were raised
to be a nice boy.

240
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,620
Don't worry 'bout me.

241
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm not sure I've
ever felt better.

242
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,290
Look at that face.

243
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,540
You may be his
little masterpiece,

244
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,960
but you're about to be killed
by his greatest failure.

245
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,500
[laughs] See how broken he is?

246
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:07,670
It's too good! [laughs]

247
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,890
Shoto!

248
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,560
Can you imagine the
expression Dad'll have

249
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,060
when he watches my flames

250
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,690
melt the flesh off
your blackened bones?

251
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,230
[IZUKU] Lemillion and the
others have their hands full

252
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,660
covering Jeanist.

253
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,690
But I'm with you, Todoroki.

254
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,240
I have no strength in my limbs,
but I can still help.

255
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,530
[IZUKU]
Blackwhip. Froppy Style!

256
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,960
[DABI]
Back off.

257
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,710
This fight is none
of your business!

258
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,210
Yes it is!

259
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,210
Todoroki is my friend.

260
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,010
And Endeavor is my mentor.

261
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,930
He made me stronger.

262
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,310
[IZUKU]
The past never dies, sure.

263
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,810
That's why...

264
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,230
...I'm watching Endeavor closely
as he fights to be better.

265
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,560
But you are not Endeavor!

266
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,240
[ENDEAVOR]
Midoriya!

267
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,030
[IZUKU]
You're obsessed with his fire,

268
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,290
but this is your Quirk, not his!

269
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,710
[laughs] Everyone can see
we're nothing alike.

270
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,340
But c'mon, don't you feel
the least bit bad for me?

271
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,380
I'm a crime
committed by someone

272
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,670
claiming to seek justice.

273
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,000
Evil is flourishing because
hero society is collapsing.

274
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,090
I know you idiots need
to be spoon-fed a story,

275
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,970
so I'm showing you
exactly who's to blame.

276
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,310
[IZUKU]
I felt this earlier, too!

277
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,320
[DABI] The future we're
heading for is built on chaos.

278
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,570
The lies you heroes spew
won't matter anymore!

279
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,610
Uh, guys?

280
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,200
[BEST JEANIST]
He's breaking free!

281
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,750
[IZUKU gasps]

282
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,170
[roars]

283
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,290
Endeavor, no!

284
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,590
Please, Dad!

285
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,430
What happened to my strength?

286
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,780
[SPINNER]
Machia!

287
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,870
We got a report from
the heroes in the field.

288
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,080
They said their plan had failed.

289
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,450
[MIRIO]
But the sedative worked!

290
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,590
[BEST JEANIST] I do not know
who accomplished this,

291
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,670
but our hopes
have been repaired.

292
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,040
The fact that this
drug kicked in

293
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,880
at the 11th hour
isn't a coincidence.

294
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,560
We've been chipping
away at this villain

295
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,350
little by little, using
whatever meager power

296
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,560
we were able to cobble together.

297
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,190
Sacrificing ourselves to break
his spirit and slow him down.

298
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,940
We held him off as best we could

299
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,810
until the drug had
time to take effect.

300
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,360
If I've learned one thing
through my Quirk,

301
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,120
it's that, though
a single fiber is weak,

302
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,450
it can be braided with others
to form a mighty rope.

303
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,710
[BEST JEANIST]
Had even one thread broken,

304
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,380
we would have failed.

305
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,960
It's only together that we've
woven a tapestry of faith.

306
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,930
[DABI] Just when things
were getting good!

307
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,470
It's obvious your
body is overheating.

308
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,770
Look around.

309
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,270
In a battle of wills,
we have the upper hand.

310
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,230
As I'd expect from his creation.
Brother, you're making me proud.

311
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,570
Power!

312
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,290
The heroes have been
fighting a difficult battle.

313
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,590
These Nomu don't
have fancy attacks,

314
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,880
but their speed and
toughness are crazy.

315
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,050
[MIRIO] Each one of these
is as strong as the High End

316
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,930
from Kyushu that almost
killed Hawks and Endeavor.

317
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,890
You do not wanna tango with them
'less you've been well trained!

318
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,180
[TENYA] Get back, Great
Explosion Murder God Dynamight!

319
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,610
You're wounded! You're in
no condition to fight.

320
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,770
Ugh.

321
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,570
[KATSUKI]
Dammit. I hate that he's right!

322
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,280
[HADO]
I can draw fire off of Jeanist

323
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,620
as long as I manage
to keep dodging!

324
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,450
[TENYA] I'll stick it out
until that giant quiets down.

325
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,630
Even if a complete victory
against him seems impossible.

326
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,250
[BEST JEANIST] The resources
used to stop this mammoth,

327
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,800
can now be employed
against the League.

328
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,260
[MR. COMPRESS]
This binding is so tight

329
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,220
that I can't touch the cables.

330
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,260
Which means I can't
activate Compress

331
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,270
to get us out of this mess.

332
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,440
What a shameful predicament.

333
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,770
All I can do is grope
my own posterior.

334
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,740
You're no better, Shigaraki.

335
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Remember why you
summoned us here?

336
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,610
We were supposed to gather
together and create a spectacle.

337
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,950
What'd you have to go
and get beaten up for?

338
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,700
Now we're trapped!

339
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,030
There's so much left
in this world to destroy.

340
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
[MR. COMPRESS]
It's just as Spinner said.

341
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,590
We haven't done anything yet.

342
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,510
Not Dabi.

343
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,090
Nor Toga.

344
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,550
Nor I.

345
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,380
None of us have
achieved our dreams!

346
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,470
This cannot be where
our performance ends!

347
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,090
[BEST JEANIST]
Blackout Bind!

348
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,140
[MR. COMPRESS]
The spotlight is mine now.

349
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,820
It's time for these
philistines to witness

350
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,030
the greatest show on earth!

351
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,870
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

352
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,200
A fight to the death
between brothers.

353
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,880
A hopeless Endeavor.

354
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,340
Spinner's wish.

355
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,840
The determination
of Mr. Compress.

356
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,050
And Me and Shigaraki.

357
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,430
No. One For All and All For One.

358
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,140
We each race towards our goals

359
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,140
as this war reaches
its dizzying conclusion.

360
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,850
Next time, "Final Performance."

361
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,270
Who'll be left
standing in the end?

362
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,640
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
