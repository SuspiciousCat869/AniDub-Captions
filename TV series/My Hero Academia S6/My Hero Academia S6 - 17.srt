Fortune has truly
smiled upon us.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,770
[HIMURA] As you surely know,
the Himura family

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,610
has enjoyed a long
and celebrated history.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,530
Which makes my daughter
the perfect match

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,450
for a man of your status.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,740
A top-tier pro needs
a fitting bride.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,120
[ENDEAVOR]
She was a woman made of ice.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,830
On the surface our union seemed
like any arranged marriage,

12
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,630
but I had an ulterior motive.

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,290
My goal was simple.

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,460
To produce the
strongest child possible.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,760
One who wielded
our combined powers.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,050
This was a Quirk marriage.
My flames were strong.

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,060
Add the ice abilities of
the Himura family to the mix,

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,020
and surely my offspring would
grow to surpass All Might.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,900
While Rei's family
was once prestigious,

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,900
they were now struggling.

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,860
They craved the
status associated

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,240
with the number-two
hero and my money.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,740
Which is probably why her father

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,080
quickly agreed
to my proposition.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,210
She had the option to refuse me.

26
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,830
Rei knew exactly what
this marriage was.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,630
And yet, she accepted my
intentions and became my wife

28
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,380
for the sake of her family.

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,810
Do you like the flowers?

Yes. They're quite beautiful.

31

[ENDEAVOR]
There was a strength to her,

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,110
but still, she seemed
like she might melt

33
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,860

34
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,490
[ENDEAVOR]

Are you okay?

In what world would I be?
That's why I've come here.

You aren't the

Because you're not the only one
who overlooked our child.

I can't feel a thing, though.

Knowing how tough my father is,

42
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,810
I doubt he'll die from whatever
injuries he racked up.

43
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,190
Even if he wanted to,
the number-one hero can't die

unceremoniously
on the battlefield.

I bet he'll do a

It's unusual.

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,290
Your son inherited a strong
version of your flame Quirk,

64
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,710
that's true, but unfortunately,

taken after his mother.

66
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,920
In other words, he's physically

Regardless, Toya shouldn't

We're failures to him, so he
pretends we don't even exist.

That's just how it works, not
like he's all that different.

this, like, 1,000,000 times.

Ugh, why don't you go
bother Fuyumi instead?

No, hold on, are you
ignoring me, too, Natsu?

want to become a hero?

I know Grandma and
Grandpa were poor.

That's why they sold you, right?

187
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,580
You had no choice in what
your life would be like.

But you did decide to have me.

[DABI]
My fire wouldn't go out.

193
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,510
I was smaller than
most kids my age,

194
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,560
but when I hit puberty,
things changed.

195
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,650
And my flames suddenly
transformed from red to blue.

196
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,490
[DABI] I see. They're like
extensions of my body.

197
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,860
When I get excited, my firepower
goes through the roof!

198
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,530
Oh, man, I'm incredible.

199
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,990
Dad is gonna be so surprised
when he sees this!

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,830
Ugh. Dammit. No crying!

201
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,380
Why do I always tear up
when things go my way.

Make sure you come watch!

that I'm not actually
a failure like you thought.

[REI]
Those eyes!

232
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,390
[REI]
I was taken to a facility.

233
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,430
Which is where I heard
about Toya's death.

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,900
That loss shattered whatever
was left of my mind.

I was afraid if I did,

238
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,660
it would feed a fire that
was already out of control.

239
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,080
No. The real reason is
I had no idea what to say.

Or how to be Toya's father.

It's too hot! Please
go out! It hurts!

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,020
Now that was some
impressive heat.

246
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,190
Well. What did you
expect, old man?

247
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,950
All you ever taught me
was how to burn everything.

248

[ENDEAVOR] If onlyI'd just given
everything up that day.

249
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,380
But after I killed Toya,
I couldn't go back.

250
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,960
The only thing I knew how
to focus on was molding Shoto

251
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,090
into the hero I could
never be myself.

252
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,430
The more domineering you were,

253
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,550
the harder it was
to look at you.

254

And whenever I looked
at my children,

255
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,480
it was your eyes I saw
staring back at me.

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,810
Even though I knew
we were falling apart.

257
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,520
I was too scared to get
to the bottom of our pain.

258
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,650
So I tried to
keep up appearances.

259
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,650
Ignoring the truth.

260

You're the one who

But if I'd been able to
knock some sense into Toya

263
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,370
before he ran off
to the mountain,

264
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,330
he wouldn't have
turned into Dabi,

265
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,210

different between me and Shoto.

so much more than we did.

calling me "Mom" again.

Even though he has
every right to hate me.

He's made friends at UA High.

276
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,070
And he's protected each of us,
likely more than we know.

00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,530
Gotta admit, it's shocking.

312
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,950
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
This didn't come up

313
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,120
when you were talking
about Toya, but...

314
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,120
Are you to blame for the burn
on Shoto's face as well?

315
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,120
[TODOROKI]
So close.

316
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,250
No that was me.

317
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,210
Mom, you--

318
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,590
[REI] But he still started
calling me "Mom" again.

319
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,220
Even though he has
every right to hate me.

320
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,380
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
I see.

321
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,010
[HAWKS] I never got
to confront my parents.

322
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,470
Instead, I abandoned them.

323
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,520
But you've stood your ground.

324
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,860
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
Shoto. You're a heck of a kid.

325
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,400
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
Endeavor, the world

326
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,740
is going to pieces.

327
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,740
I know.

328
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,780
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
Shigaraki, Dabi, Himiko Toga,

329
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,540
Spinner, Skeptic, and 132

330
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,660
Liberation Front
members escaped.

331
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,910
As well as seven
Near High End Nomu.

332
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,130
At this point, we have no leads.

333
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,090
No idea where they're hiding.

334
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,960
In addition to Tartarus, six
other prisons were broken into.

335
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,510
At least 10,000 prisoners

336
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,220
have been released
into the wild.

337
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,350
Causing mayhem and panic.

338
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,970
There's also no agency
calling the shots for us.

339
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,810
Not that there are a ton
of heroes left to organize.

340
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,100
Pros are resigning
left and right.

341
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,610
Many civilians have lost faith

342
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,440
in our ability to
protect the streets,

343
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,400
so they're taking up arms and
fighting villains themselves.

344
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,280
Which inevitably leads
to collateral damage.

345
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,160
Currently, the government
is requesting aid

346
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,950
in the form of rescue
teams and heroes

347
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,330
from other countries, but
with the safety commission

348
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,500
in shambles, bureaucracy
is getting in the way.

349
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,920
Everything's gone to crap
in just two days.

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,090
And I second what
your wife said.

351
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,010
You have no choice
but to keep fighting.

352
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,130
Of course, we've got your back.

353
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,600
Responsibility for this can't
be put on your shoulders alone.

354
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,430
And it's not your
family's fault either.

355
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,600
You would help me?

356
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,060
[HAWKS] Even if Dabi was right
about the Todoroki family,

357
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,320
things are different now.

358
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,690
I want to do what's right
and support people

359
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,450
who are trying their
best to do the same.

360
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,030
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
Yep!

361
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,740
We propose a little a team-up
between the top three heroes!

362
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,410
[BEST JEANIST] I've already bet
my life on Hawks once.

363
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,580
This will be another
tricky runway to walk,

364
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,750
but we will prevail.

365
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,880
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A] Look at
who's standing in front of you.

366
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,210
Don't we make the burden
feel a little lighter?

367
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,210
Isn't it time to move forward?

368
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,180
Yes. Yeah.

369
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,850
We'll help you,
just till we stop Toya.

370
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,310
[ENDEAVOR]
Right.

371
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,610
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
Now, to get down to business.

372
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,980
First, we explain things
to the public.

373
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,070
After Dabi's dramatic speech,
that's unavoidable.

374
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,320
I've given some thought to how
we might go about responding,

375
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,370
but there's still
a little confusion.

376
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,830
What do you know
about "One For All"?

377
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,380
Oh, yeah. A reporter
mentioned that, too.

378
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,130
[REPORTER 130A] While he
was fighting Shigaraki,

379
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,300
Endeavor mentioned something
called "One For All."

380
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,130
Do you know who or what
he was referencing?

381
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,510
[REPORTER 130B]
Does it have anything to do with

382
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,130
that terrifying supervillain
known as All For One?

383
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,050
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
Whatever it is,

384
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,270
we need to figure out how
it factors into the puzzle.

385
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,390
[IZUKU]
Sorry for using a private line.

386
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,770
It's highly possible that
I'm the one Shigaraki's after.

387
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,240
Deku.

388
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,570
Deku, you bastard,
you're dead!

389
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,780
I've been awake for how long...

390
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,830
[MINETA] Stop yelling,
this is a hospital!

391
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,120
[SATO]
...we're trying to grieve?

392
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,120
[TENYA] Uh, thank you
for the assistance, Tsu!

393
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,160
What is wrong with that boy?

394
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,710
When I saw the extent
of his injuries,

395
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,420
I figured he'd be
out for a while.

396
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,300
And yet, he's somehow
louder than ever.

397
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,510
[JIRO]
Hey, guys.

398
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,300
Sounds like Tokoyami
and Kaminari

399
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,470
are cleared to go home now.

400
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,680
Are they really?
That's wonderful news!

401
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Are there, uh,

402
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,510
any updates on
Midoriya's recovery yet?

403
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,730
[OCHACO]
They said his body's fine.

404
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,480
But I'm still worried.

405
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,610
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
Heyo.

406
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,690
[BEST JEANIST] Great Explosion
Murder God Dynamight,

407
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,980
are you all right?

408
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,780
[KATSUKI]
What's it look like?

409
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,990
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
We'd like a few words

410
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,610
with Izuku Midoriya.

411
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,870
[TENYA] Well... All Might said
to leave the two of them alone.

412
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,580
[SMARTPHONE VOICE 129A]
He did, huh?

413
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,000
[HAWKS] Endeavor said that
Shigaraki was after Midoriya,

414
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,300
and All Might is clearly
involved somehow.

415
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,210
What in the world
is One For All?

416
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,970
[ALL MIGHT] Young Midoriya.
I can feel it.

417
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,180
The vestige of me that
lives within One For All.

418
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,430
Inside you.

419
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,440
Right now, you must be talking
with the previous wielders.

420
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,530
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

421
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,410
While I sleep in the real world,

422
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,000
my consciousness is awake
inside of One For All.

423
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,880
Past generations of wielders
share their secrets.

424
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,130
And eventually, I'm faced
with a question.

425
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,960
"Can you kill Tomura Shigaraki?"

426
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,510
How do I answer that?

427
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,680
Next time,

428
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,390
"Izuku Midoriya and
Tomura Shigaraki."

429
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,680
My origin is about to be tested.

430
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,850
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
