1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,310
I don't understand.
Why are you here?

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,850
Because we're worried about you.

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,020
That's nice, but I
promise, I'm fine.

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,310
Really. No need for concern.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,650
So leave.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,730
Oh, yeah, great speech!

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,160
Just what we wanted from the
famous One For All successor!

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,070
[KATSUKI]
Real talk.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you able to smile right now?

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,870
C'mon, go ahead and show us.

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,420
[IZUKU]
In order to smile...

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,460
For everyone to live in peace...

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,300
I have to go. I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,360
[IZUKU]
Everyone get out of my way!

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,390
You're gonna have to make us,
ya busted-ass All Might wannabe!

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,810
Midoriya.

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,570
We had a feeling that's
what you were going to say.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,320
Let's do this, class!

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Right!

20
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,140
[TENYA]
Listen to me.

21
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,390
Stand down. Run away.

22
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,760
I told you, this has
nothing to do with you.

23
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,100
[IZUKU] If you really
believe that, then why are you

24
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,310
trying to become a hero
in the first place?

25
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,100
All Might was right.

26
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,520
Meddling when you don't need to

27
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,860
is the essence of
being a true hero!

28
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,230
[TENYA]
I know you.

29
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,410
So I know very well
that you can't be stopped

30
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,660
once you've decided you're
going to do something.

31
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,120
Hell of a look.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,370
We heard you unlocked Quirks
from users Four and Six.

33
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,540
But not that you started
dressing like a villain.

34
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,410
Talk, ya damn nerd!

35
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,180
[IZUKU]
Thank you for coming. Really.

36
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,430
Sixth!

37
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,640
[KIRISHIMA]
Smokescreen.

38
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,850
[SHOJI]
Of course.

39
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,020
He's acting exactly like
they said he would.

40
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,440
Heads up, morons!
Make sure he doesn't escape.

41
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,440
Land Mine Blast!

42
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,440
[KATSUKI] Barely a word,
and you're running away?

43
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,980
Oh, so now that you're the
all-powerful chosen loner,

44
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,320
you think the rest of us
are just extras!

45
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,750
[KODA]
Everyone wants you back at UA!

46
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,160
Did you hear me?

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,740
Principal Nezu said we can
bring you back to campus!

48
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,420
There's no reason
for you to keep hiding!

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,500
[IZUKU]
Koda. I'm sorry.

50
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,970
You sure look scary with
Blackwhip hangin' out.

51
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,470
People are gettin' spooked.

52
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,430
[SERO] Think of it as an
extension of your body.

53
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,760
Aim for the strike zone.

54
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,140
I'll try.

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,890
Oh, whoa! That makes
it way easier!

56
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,310
[IZUKU]
Sero.

57
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,980
[JIRO]
Heartbeat Wall!

58
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,110
So fast!

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,830
Midoriya, hold on! I know this
sounds like it wasn't much,

60
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,870
but when we were prepping
for the school festival

61
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,620
and you helped me with my notes,
you totally saved me!

62
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,210
[IZUKU] Wow, you came up
with these lessons?

63
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,040
That's awesome!

64
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,550
This makes me so happy!

65
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,090
I've actually gotten
pretty enthusiastic.

66
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,760
It's possible I went
a little bit overboard.

67
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,970
[JIRO] That was probably
nothing to you,

68
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,720
but it was more of a relief
than you can imagine.

69
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,770
[OJIRO]
Twirling Tail Dance!

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,730
Remember when you faced
Shinso at the Sports Fest?

71
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,860
I know this sounds selfish,
but I'll say it anyway.

72
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,320
Beat this guy for
you and me, all right?

73
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,000
[OJIRO] I'll never forget how
you fought on my account!

74
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,920
I want to return the favor.

75
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,240
You're battered and bruised
and running on empty.

76
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,920
So let me lend you a hand.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,250
[IZUKU] If I go to UA,
it's like killing you myself.

78
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,260
[gasps]

79
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,550
[IZUKU]
All For One would destroy you.

80
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,630
That's why I had to leave!

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,850
Go! Dark Shadow!

82
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,390
[JIRO] Dang, he's gotten
way too strong.

83
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,610
[OJIRO]
And stubborn!

84
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,360
Midoriya! Slow down a sec!

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,570
You might have
special powers now,

86
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,530
but we still share
the same goals!

87
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,780
Did you listen to what Koda
said about the school earlier?

88
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,210
Hear us out!

89
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,030
If ya don't, then the next time
Eri wants candy apples,

90
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,710
you don't get to use
my food coloring!

91
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,210
[IZUKU] That's fine.
Anyone can make them for her.

92
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,100
She doesn't need me.

93
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
[YAOYOROZU] At first,
we planned to find you,

94
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,440
and then fight alongside
you in the streets.

95
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,940
But things have changed.

96
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,270
We have a new mission that's
been approved by Endeavor

97
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,690
and the other
supervising heroes.

98
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,900
Our objective is now
to ensure your safety

99
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,360
by bringing you home.

100
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,480
[IZUKU] A device meant
to put me to sleep?

101
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,870
Forget it. You don't have
to bother with me anymore!

102
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,790
Just accept this
and go back to campus.

103
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,620
[KAMINARI]
Nope! Not a chance.

104
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,170
My dude, I know One For All's
super important and everything.

105
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,090
But right now, there's something
crucial you gotta accept.

106
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,260
You and me may be totally
different in some ways,

107
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,800
but you're my friend!

108
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,420
So I'm doing you a solid
even if you don't want it!

109
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,640
[IZUKU]
I told you--

110
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,230
[SHOJI]
I'm wrapped in electrical tape,

111
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,850
courtesy of Yaoyorozu!

112
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,020
Do you recall what you said
when we were attacked at camp?

113
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,850
[IZUKU] Honestly,
with a group like this...

114
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,690
[SHOJI "...we could probably
even go up against All Might."

115
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,280
Your words!

116
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,530
This gloom will do nicely.

117
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,370
Dark Shadow! Ragnarok Womb!

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,960
[TOKOYAMI] Observe how
I've used Dark Shadow's

119
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,170
offensive ability to protect.

120
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,540
That move was your idea.

121
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,430
[TOKOYAMI]
Stand down!

122
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,680
Listen to us!

123
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,100
[SHOJI] We're not a bunch
of fragile victims

124
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,810
you have to keep
out of harm's way!

125
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,930
Wouldn't you rather
relax instead?

126
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,770
You could really use a bath.

127
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,440
[IZUKU]
Don't make me do this!

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,310
--Midoriya! No!
--[IZUKU yells]

129
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,020
He managed to break
out of Ragnarok!

130
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,240
[SHOJI]
Insane.

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,870
Guess that's the power
of One For All!

132
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,620
[IZUKU whimpers]
Please.

133
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,160
For your sake and mine,
forget about me.

134
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,960
[IZUKU] I know you're here
because you care.

135
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,420
The Fourth's Quirk
is proof of that.

136
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,710
You're fighting me, but
without any malice or evil.

137
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,760
Danger Sense hasn't
activated a single time.

138
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,800
And that's why you have to stop.

139
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,190
I'm begging. I'm okay.

140
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,270
Really, I'm fine!

141
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,390
[TODOROKI]
Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall!

142
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,780
[IZUKU grunts]

143
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,160
[TODOROKI]
I can see it on your face.

144
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,700
You want to cry.

145
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,080
But your burden
won't allow you to.

146
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
Don't push us away.

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,500
We'll share this
responsibility with you.

148
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,050
[TSUYU]
Midoriya! I won't let you go.

149
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,050
[TSUYU]
I thought I'd stopped you.

150
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,170
But it turns out
I was worthless.

151
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,800
A complete failure.

152
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,510
And suddenly I had
no idea what to say.

153
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,730
[TSUYU]
I cried a lot back then.

154
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,150
But those days
are behind me now.

155
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,610
You're dear to me.

156
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,320
So when you're scared,
I'll be by your side.

157
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,820
When you're in pain,
I'll cry with you.

You're my friend, Midoriya.

You seem set on becoming some

[KATSUKI]
You've made the right calls

315
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,380
ever since you
inherited One For All.

316
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,430
Followed the best path,
acted like a real symbol.

317
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,260
But I can see that
you're lost right now.

318
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,850
You've hit a wall that you can't
overcome with ideals alone.

319
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,650
So we'll handle the things you
can't take care of yourself.

320
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,740
In order to be our
best selves, we'll save you,

321
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,620
the refugees at UA,
and everyone else.

322
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,240
Anybody out there
in need of a hero.

323
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,210
[IZUKU]
Don't you get it?

324
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:51,630
You, all of you, have
already far surpassed me.

325
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,890
[IZUKU] I'm sorry for saying
that you couldn't keep up.

326
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,440
Yeah, I know.

327
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,830
Looks as though we've cleared
the first hurdle, at least.

328
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,040
That being said,

329
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,500
things will only get
tougher from here.

330
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,470
[SERO]
His eyes are open!

331
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,720
[SHOJI]
Thirteen, he's awake.

332
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,970
[THIRTEEN]
Good!

333
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,810
Hi there!

334
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,600
Midoriya. Can you hear me?

335
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,150
Thirteen?

336
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,980
[THIRTEEN]
I'll update you.

337
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,020
Most civilians have been
evacuated to shelters.

338
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,780
The ones left in the streets
are anti-hero vigilantes

339
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,280
or looters taking advantage

340
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,780
of the chaos the
jail-breakers caused.

341
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,620
But they won't last for long.

342
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,160
More and more of them
have asked for our protection.

343
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,420
Plus, since most of
the rioters formed gangs,

344
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,250
they're easy enough
to deal with in one swoop.

345
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,390
During evacuations,
we had to split up our forces.

346
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,130
We've done our best
to improve the situation

347
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,970
outside and in, though.

348
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,640
At this point, all of the
help you've been providing

349
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,560
around the city can be
taken care of by others.

350
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,680
You can leave it
to us now, okay?

351
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,430
[IZUKU]
This is UA?

352
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,440
The UA Barrier, to be exact!

353
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,360
And this big wall is just the
tip of the security iceberg!

354
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,780
[HAGAKURE]
You're totally gonna geek out

355
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,240
when you hear about the system!

356
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,860
They said we can even
merge with Shiketsu!

357
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,460
[IZUKU] I want to respect what
everyone has done for me.

358
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,460
But...

359
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,500
I just can't take this risk.

360
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,220
[CITIZENS]
Keep the boy away!

361
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,720
[THIRTEEN]
Jeez. Loud, aren't they?

362
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,590
[CITIZEN 136A] Prioritize our
safety, like you promised!

363
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,430
[CITIZENS]
Prioritize our safety!

364
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,180
Don't let that boy
into UA's shelter!

365
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,730
[CITIZENS]
Keep him out!

366
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,900
[CITIZEN 136B] He's the one
Shigaraki's rumored to be after!

367
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,230
Bringing him here would kill us!

368
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,270
[PRESENT MIC] Hey, hey,
let's calm the vibe down!

369
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,320
[CITIZEN 136C] Didn't you hear
the principal's speech?

370
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,150
He said he'd
guarantee our safety!

371
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,870
[CITIZEN 136D]
So guarantee it!

372
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,370
[CITIZEN 136B]
We won't let this happen.

373
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,830
[CITIZENS]
Take the boy away!

374
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,950
[PRESENT MIC]
If you'll just--

375
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,240
We were told if we
abandoned our homes,

376
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,750
you'd keep us safe here!

377
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,540
[CITIZEN 136B] Now you want
a time bomb living with us?

378
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,790
[CITIZENS]
No way!

379
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,790
[CITIZEN 136A] Hide him
somewhere that's not UA!

380
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,790
[CITIZEN 136B] There's a whole
damn country out there!

381
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
[CITIZENS]
Take the boy away!

382
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,590
It's gonna be fine.

383
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,930
[OCHACO] Iida and the others,
Bakugo, all of us.

384
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,260
We're all in this together.

385
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,480
We won't let you go.

386
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,440
We can't.

387
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,940
You don't have to do this alone.

388
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,110
When a hero suffers, who's
supposed to protect them?

389
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,740
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

390
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,040
I wish I could go back
in the past and tell myself,

391
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,540
"You are not special.

392
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,250
You're just walking
one step at a time

393
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,330
toward the dream you believe in.

394
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,130
Still, never forget
that there are people

395
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,550
who are following your path."

396
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,590
Next time, "A Young
Woman's Declaration."

397
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,020
I have to be aware of the
footprints I'm leaving behind.

398
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,190
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
