up to the villa.

Bad news is, they're out
of Cementoss's range.

he's not gonna be a problem.

The big guy only takes orders
from the enemy leader.

currently taking a nice long nap

I trained as you told me.

I'm going to become

here right now...

...I hope you get to see
just how far I've come.

00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,740
[TWICE] I'll take
responsibility this time!

[TWICE] I'll take

[TWICES]
Hero! You will die!

226
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,980
[HAWKS] You're multiplying
at an insane rate.

227
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,400
But since you're making
copies of copies,

228
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,020
they aren't very durable.

229
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,530
Some melt and some
don't, even though

230
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,490
they're being hit by
the same type of feathers.

231
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,740
[TWICE] I can't keep up.
They're too fast.

232
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,250
[HAWKS]
I won't make a mistake because

233
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,580
I let emotions get
the better of me.

234
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,000
If you'd done as I said,
we could have salvaged this.

chummy with me.

Use every last feather.
I don't even care, bastard!

239
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,610
[HAWKS] I like to take
enemies out quickly.

240
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,400
[HAWKS]
Do you know why that is?

241
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,620
Because a villain
who refuses to quit

242
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,740
is the most terrifying
thing a hero can face.

243
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,450

244

246
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,050
[HAWKS]
That's why.

247
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,050
If neither side will give up,
someone has to die.

248
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,940
[TWICE] You people
call yourself "heroes."

249
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,060
But when things get tough,

250
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:02,440
your kind always abandons
the people who are the lowest.

251
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,280
Not my side.

252
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
When I fall apart,

253
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,200
Toga wraps me
in her handkerchief.

254
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,370
[TWICE]
And you know what?

255
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,500
This isn't even the first
time I've screwed up.

256
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,500

I got everyone hurt.

gonna wrap me up today, though.

people I care for end up happy!

00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,540
You didn't notice me
did ya, Hawks?

266
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,370
Guess you did get distracted.

267

Something you'll
definitely regret.

You didn't make a mistake.

It's the self-righteous heroes
who are in the wrong.

00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,220
As usual.

It doesn't matter.

275

How're you gonna fight
with burned-up feathers?

276

[HAWKS] That blast woulda
killed your friend, too.

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,820

to prioritize someone
else's safety.

281

not surprised

that I betrayed
you and your crew.

How'd you figure me out?

284
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,330
Didn't really have to.

285
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,460
See, at no point
did I ever trust you.

286
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,760
Even though I did
so many awful things

287
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,840
to prove myself loyal.

288

Gee, thanks.

290
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,020
[HAWKS] I don't see much
of a way out of this.

291
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,020
It's a small space and
my feathers are scorched.

292
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,110
Fire and I don't mix, but I
still have a goal to accomplish.

293
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,030
I've weakened
Bubaigawara by slicing

294
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,900
muscle and bone while
avoiding major organs.

295
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,410
He can't do much damage now.

296
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,830
I'll carry him out
alive and then...

297
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,290
Don't do this!

298
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,830
Dabi! Roast the bird!

299

back on our side.

He flew out ahead of the flames
and circled to the back!

306

Have to help everyone!

315
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,870
Protect them, Twice!

316
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,120
Defend your friends!

317
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,910
They accepted you as you are.

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,380
And all you've ever done
is cause them pain!

319
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,030
[TOGA gasps]

320
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,190
[MR. COMPRESS]
Toga!

321
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,110
Two of their
lieutenants neutralized.

322
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,280
You reading? I've got them here.

323
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
[MR. COMPRESS] Its seems
your detection-evading

324
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,450
techniques failed!

325
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,700
These hideous beings must
have heightened senses!

326
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,450
Ew, gross! Put me down!

327
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,710
We won't let you
destroy this world.

328
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,500
This is where your
plotting ends.

329
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,670
You'll spend the rest
of your lives locked up.

330
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,260
Your League is ended.
The heroes win!

331
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,800
Jin! Yay!

332
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,380
[TWICE]
Let them go.

333
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,600
Drop. Them.

334
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,220
[MR. COMPRESS]
Bravo! Perfect timing!

335
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,520
Twice, get to Doubling!

336
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,430
Toga, we should
head underground!

337
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,110
[TWICE]
Sorry. Compress.

338
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,730
[MR. COMPRESS]
Huh?

339
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,240
[TWICE] I can't. I can
barely manage this shape.

340
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,870
It's no good.

341
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,990
[TWICE] Like when you're
trying to hold in a dump.

342
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,120
I've been beat up too bad.
I can't keep it together.

343
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:16,170
[TWICE] Forgive me, you two.
It was my fault again.

344
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,810
Hawks got me. I ruined
things a second time.

345
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,390
Sorry.

346
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,600
[TWICE]
Toga.

347
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,610
[TWICE] It's my fault your
adorable face got hurt.

348
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,910
[TWICE]
Take this. Your hankie.

349
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,330
[TOGA] You should feel whole now
that you're covered up again.

350
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,760
[TWICE]
It's true that, in my life,

351
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,930
I kept falling and failing,
I got tricked, lost a friend,

352
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,770
and still ended up
getting fooled again.

353
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,150
[TWICE]
I musta looked pretty pathetic

354
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,360
and worthless to other people.

355
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:22,570
[TWICE]
I... can't make more.

356
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,580
[TWICE] Constantly trying
to find myself.

357
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,660
[TWICE]
Sorry. For everything.

358
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,540
I'm to blame.

359
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,340
[TWICE] But I was blessed
with people I cared about.

360
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,050
[TOGA]
Jin.

361
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,760
Thank you for
saving me, friend.

362
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,760
[TWICE] Who could ask for
a better life than that?

363
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,390
I hope you die, Hawks.

364
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:52,520
What right do you have to look
at me and call me unlucky?

365
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,610
I was happy with my life.

366
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,030
With them.

367
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,620
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

368
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,540
A furious Dabi lashes out
at a weakened Hawks.

369
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,790
Meanwhile, at Jaku Hospital,
the newly released Nomu

370
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:39,880
bare their fangs at Endeavor
and the rest of his raid team.

371
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,630
Is there any way
to beat a High End

372
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,260
that can resurrect itself
with Super Regeneration?

373
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,680
Next time: "Inheritance."

374
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,300
Mr. Aizawa and his Erasure Quirk

375
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,560
may be our last
chance at victory.

376
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,060
If he's not too late!

377
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,390
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
