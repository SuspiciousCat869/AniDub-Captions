00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,780
[ENDEAVOR] I can't give up.
I promised them.

163
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,670
As this country's top hero,
I have to keep fighting.

164
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,580
[DABI]
Hey, there you are!

165
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,710
From all the way up here,

166
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,080
everyone looks like
tiny little ants.

167
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,800
Ah. Shoto's with you.

168
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,380
Perfect.

169
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,310
[ENDEAVOR]
He brought the League?

170
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,800
Dabi!

171
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,980
[DABI]
Hey now, don't be rude.

172
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,560
You're acting like
we've never met.

173
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,890
Call me Toya.

174
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,980
After all, it's the name
you and Mom gave me.

175
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,790
Our live coverage continues.
The giant vill--

176
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,460
[NEWSCASTER 124B]
We're having s...

177
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,040
...echnical issues.

178
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,470
New reports suggest that
the radio interference

179
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,260
in Jaku City has
been getting worse.

180
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,550
Our correspondent can't
say exactly what--

181
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,770
[DABI] Sorry to interrupt.
My name is Toya Todoroki.

182
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,980
The number-one hero
is my father.

183
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,500
[DABI] Yeah, I know, my face
is pretty disgusting now.

184
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,960
But it's still surprising my own
family didn't recognize me.

185
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,380
It's honestly kinda crappy.

186
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,920
Or maybe it's just
depressing, you know?

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,130
Huh?

188
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,600
I thought you three were close.

189
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,020
So I figure you would have
told them all about Toya.

190
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,550
It's not exactly an easy
subject to broach.

191
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,390
[IZUKU]
Wait, he's...?

192
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,400
[DABI] Yes, the so-called
villain sitting in front of you

193
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,020
is Endeavor's oldest son.

194
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,150
At the time of this recording,

195
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,110
I've killed more than
30 innocent people.

196
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,450
Are you confused?

197
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,740
Lemme just explain how
I turned out like this.

198
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,120
I'll start at the beginning.

199
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,950
Endeavor has always
obsessively yearned for power.

200
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,250
Much to his despair,

201
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,710
he could never surpass
All Might on his own.

202
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,380
So he forced my mother
to marry him

203
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,260
in an attempt to create an
heir with the perfect Quirk.

204
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,890
I was bred for my
father's selfish dream.

205
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,970
But it didn't matter.
I was a failure.

206
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,020
It wasn't long before
he gave up on me,

207
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,650
and I was cast aside
and forgotten.

208
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,820
[DABI]
I didn't forget our family.

209
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,200
I've been watching you from
the shadows this entire time.

210
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,320
You know, out of
everyone in the world,

211
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,210
you should be beyond
reproach, number one.

212
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,960
And so a pre-recorded
video of my life story

213
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,840
is currently streaming on
every device in the country.

214
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,470
What an unexpected twist.

215
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,430
[DABI]
Oh, man. I didn't expect this.

216
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,430
I'm starting to have fun!

217
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,260
I wondered how I
could make you suffer.

218
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,230
How I could ruin your life.

219
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,360
Ever since I burned up,
it's all I've thought about.

220
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,570
As a kid, I didn't
know why I existed.

221
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,610
I'd cling to Natsu,
bawling my eyes out.

222
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,440
But you didn't know
that, did you?

223
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,740
At first, when I realized
your little puppet Shoto

224
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,670
was complete,
I figured I'd kill him.

225
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,710
But then, you unexpectedly
became the number-one hero!

226
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,130
Who'd woulda guessed, huh?

227
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,840
I was suddenly so invested
in your happiness.

228
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,300
Can you believe, in Kyushu,
I was actually afraid

229
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,420
you were going to die?

230
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,010
I led Starservant and
Ending to your doorstep.

231
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,730
Did they make you
feel like a big shot?

232
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,270
Must've been a heavy burden

233
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,400
to achieve your
dream after so long.

234
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,650
[DABI] But you were soothed by
public admiration, weren't you?

235
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,240
Is that why you finally decided

236
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,780
to try to bond
with your children?

237
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,610
Just keep looking
towards the future

238
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,790
and you could be a better man?

239
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,000
What? Nothing to say?

240
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, allow me.

241
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,460
The past never dies.

242
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,380
You will reap
everything you've sown.

243
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,130
Enji Todoroki.
Let's fall together.

244
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,220
Come and dance with me
in hell, won't you?

245
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,100
Well? Speak up, Dad!

246
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,310
[ENDEAVOR gasps]

247
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,610
[ENDEAVOR]
I remember a cold and windy day.

248
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,740
The air was dry.

249
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,200
Toya and I often trained
on Sekoto Peak.

250
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,780
And that's where he
was consumed by fire.

251
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,670
The flames raged at over
2,000 degrees Celsius.

252
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,630
We were told that his bones
must have turned to ash,

253
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,130
scattered far and wide
in the updraft.

254
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,590
No body was found.

255
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,940
We only recovered a small
fragment of his jawbone.

256
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,720
What's happened to your hair?

257
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,980
[DABI]
Huh?

258
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,520
It's turning white.

259
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,560
Nuh-uh! I'm not old!

260
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,650
[ENDEAVOR]
Did you dye it?

261
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,770
No, I'd never do that!

262
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,530
Forget about my hair!

263
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,530
It's time for you to teach me
an ultimate move!

264
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,610
[ENDEAVOR] I could see
that Toya's firepower

265
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,330
held greater potential than
my own, but he wasn't born

266
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,790
with my wife's Frost Quirk.

267
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,500
This posed a problem

268
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,500
since he couldn't keep
himself from overheating.

269
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,880
Despite that. I wanted
to raise him to be a hero.

270
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,050
At the same time,
I continued to hope for a child

271
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,130
who could harness
both fire and ice.

272
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,520
My wife wanted Toya
to have siblings as well.

273
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,850
That's how our family grew.

274
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,970
Fuyumi only had
Rei's Frost power.

275
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,560
Another Todoroki
who wasn't my ideal.

276
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,820
Though at the time,
I was fine with that.

277
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,490
Toya continued to show more
raw talent than I ever had.

278
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,910
So I placed my hopes and
ambitions on his shoulders.

279
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,370
[DABI]
Agh, Too hot!

280
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,010
[ENDEAVOR] I was certain
that you could find the success

281
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,040
I always wanted.

282
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,050
[ENDEAVOR] My frustration
and jealousy, my disgrace.

283
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,590
I thought you could
smash through

284
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,600
every one of my failures.

285
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,560
And be the best of the best.

286
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,930
My son is dead.

287
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,190
These are disgusting lies.

288
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,150
Oh, I'm very much alive.

289
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,860
You're just a broken man who
refuses to accept the truth.

290
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,280
How could you not
recognize your child?

291
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,900
Is it because fire
Quirks are so common,

292
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,870
there's nothing special
about someone who has one?

293
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,660
[MR. COMPRESS]
Wow, Dabi, I had no idea.

294
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,750
Yeah, I wonder what
he's playing at here.

295
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,040
He hid this from us,
too? What for?

296
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,340
C'mon, boss. You gotta wake up!

297
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,670
We're here! Machia needs orders!

298
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,090
Pull it together!

299
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,840
[MR. COMPRESS] Our little troupe
has dramatic lineages.

300
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,480
[DABI] If you doubt me,
I'll happily give you some blood

301
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,770
or a chunk of skin.
You can do a DNA test.

302
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,560
Obviously, I've already done one

303
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,390
and I released the
results to the public.

304
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,110
This here is an
official paternity test.

305
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,570
I used the blood Endeavor
left in Kyushu as my sample.

306
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,860
He's a 99.99% match
as my father.

307
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,500
You might think I fabricated
this, but all I can do

308
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,540
is say what I know to be true.

309
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,250
Endeavor continued to
make my mother have kids.

310
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,430
Their fourth child is
someone you probably know.

311
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,430
With Shoto, he finally
found his hybrid.

312
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,720
Not that that stopped my father
from abusing the child.

313
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,940
I saw it over and over again.

314
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,690
Endeavor is not a man who
cares about other people

315
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,400
or their well-being.

316
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,900
He's self-righteous
and weak-willed.

317
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,150
Consumed by ego.

318
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,700
Do you really believe someone
like that has the right

319
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,410
--to call himself a hero?
--[TAMEDA] It's not true.

320
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,120
Who would believe
a stunt like this?

321
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,500
These lies won't make us
lose faith in number one!

322
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,170
Does this bad guy think
we're stupid or something?

323
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,920
[DABI] Those working with
Endeavor are just as bad.

324
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,470
Take the number two pro, Hawks.

325
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,930
[gasps]

326
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,100
[DABI] He didn't hesitate
to drive his blade

327
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,480
through the back of
a despondent opponent.

328
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,230
Hawks murdered my friend
right in front of me.

329
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,480
It was hastily edited, but the
end result was quite powerful.

330
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,440
You should be impressed!

331
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,940
Stellar work.

332
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,310
Those cameras of yours
got some great shots,

333
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,110
so I'm glad the rest of
the world got to see 'em.

334
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,290
Endeavor! Allow me
to give you a gift.

335
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,120
I did some digging on
that bastard spy of yours.

336
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,540
[ENDEAVOR]
Hawks!

337
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,250
[DABI]
In order to get us to trust him,

338
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,330
Hawks murdered one of his peers.

339
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,380
He killed the number-three hero.
Best Jeanist is dead.

340
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,600
Since violence is essential
to a pro's life,

341
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,730
Hawks is comfortable
with blood on his hands.

342
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,560
It's something he was
exposed to early on.

343
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,390
His father committed serial
robberies and murders.

344
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,150
That's why Hawks kept his past
and his real name hidden.

345
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,320
Kinda funny that his old man
was put away by mine.

346
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,740
I don't know if that's
fate, or if Endeavor

347
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,910
naturally attracts damaged
people to his side.

348
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,130
But I do know
he must be stopped.

349
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,210
He can't cover up
his appalling behavior

350
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,170
by calling it "justice."

351
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,460
He really claims to be a hero?
He's tricking the whole world!

352
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,590
The thing I want you
to realize today

353
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,680
is that that these heroes
only protect themselves.

354
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,100
You're being used.

355
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,140
These disgusting people
treat you as tools

356
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,550
for their own self-affirmation!

357
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
Aw, "Look Boy." People
are gonna believe him.

358
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,520
He's telling the story first.

359
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,020
So there's no evidence
against it yet.

360
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,650
Even if everyone knows
that guy's a villain,

361
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,910
it doesn't matter.

362
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,790
I... Sorry. I've gotta bail.

363
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,830
I don't want it to be true, man.

364
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,790
But look at how much damage
the heroes've done lately.

365
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,460
I just don't know.

366
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,790
The people watching this
are gonna freak out.

367
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,870
He's already won!

368
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,130
Thank you for living long
enough to see this day.

369
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,760
Endeavor!

370
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,050
[panting]

371
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,850
[ENDEAVOR]
I looked for you everywhere.

372
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,560
Dammit. He's fast.
You ready, Dad?

373
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,230
[ENDEAVOR]
I believed you were alive!

374
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,270
Protect Midoriya and Bakugo!

375
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,240
Hado and I will hold him off!

376
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,160
Snap out of it! Protect them!

377
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,830
Please! We'll deal
with this later!

378
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,950
Flashfire Fist.

379
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,280
[gasps]

380
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,500
Ha! Prominence...

381
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,520
[DABI]
What the.

382
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,180
[BEST JEANIST]
Sorry I'm late!

383
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,270
[BEST JEANIST]
As of this moment,

384
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,440
Best Jeanist is back.

385
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,950
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

386
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,000
Dabi's shocking revelations
throw the heroes into confusion.

387
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
But Best Jeanist arrives
at the last second

388
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,870
to turn the tide of battle.

389
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,420
His appearance has a profound
impact on my classmate.

390
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,010
It's not over yet.

391
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,010
Our hopes and futures
are knotted together.

392
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,760
Next time, "Threads of Hope."

393
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,350
Kacchan's hero name
is finally revealed.

394
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,810
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
