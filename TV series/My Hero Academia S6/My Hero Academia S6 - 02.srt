[IZUKU]
This is a superhuman society,

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,760
where about 80 percent
of people are born

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,020
with an uncanny ability
known as a Quirk.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,850
Not everyone uses their
powers for good, though.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,110
Which is why the world
needed a new profession:

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,690
the hero.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,950
[IZUKU]
My name is Izuku Midoriya

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,610
and I inherited a secret
Quirk called "One For All"

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,030
from All Might.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,740
That's how I was enrolled
in the hero course at UA.

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,000
After a series of incidents
that put us up against

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,290
the worst of the worst,
my incredible classmates and I

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,540
got our provisional
hero licenses.

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,460
Meanwhile, the League
of Villains,

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,760
led by Tomura Shigaraki,
joined forces

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,130
with the Metahuman
Liberation Army.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,140
In that instant, their power
increased astronomically.

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,980
Shigaraki renamed this group
the Paranormal Liberation Front.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,690
His closest allies are now
lieutenants of different units

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,650
within the organization.

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,070
The Wing Hero, Hawks,
was sent undercover

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,030
by the Public Safety Commission.

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,690
Through careful recon,
he uncovered

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,740
some of the group's secrets.

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,620
Using that information,
the police called on heroes

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,080
from around the country
and began a huge operation

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,000
to round up this
new legion of villains

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,000
and get them off
the streets for good.

32
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,390

the Gunga Mountain Villa

33
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,810

Liberation Front's hideout.

34
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,890
These two events will
happen simultaneously.

35
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,440
In addition, hero course

as logistical support
for both teams.

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,690
It's time.

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,690
[HIGH END 115D]
Been so long.

163
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,740
Yes. Yes.

164
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,280
[HIGH END 115D]
Can go wild. Destroy.

165
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,200
[HIGH END 115A]
Kill. All of them.

166
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,460
Make them suffer.

167
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,710
[CRUST]
Mirko!

168
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,750
You're Crust from
the hero charts.

169
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,510
But I forget what
number you are.

170
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,220
[CRUST]
This one talks?

171
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,880
You're right about that, beast.

172
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,180
[HIGH END 115B grunts]

173
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,010
[CRUST grunts]
It's so powerful.

174
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,230
[DOCTOR] I'm sorry you don't
have more time to adjust,

175
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,520
but I'm counting
on you, High Ends!

176
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,320
[MIRKO] Like I'd let you
escape. This is great.

177
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,320
Now that I'm warmed up,
the fun can really begin.

178
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,880
[HIGH END 115B growls]

179
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,130
Too cramped.

180
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,050
Need more space
to tear you apart.

181
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,760
[HERO 115B gasps]

182
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,680
The Nomu is communicating!

183
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,800
Help me!

184
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,930
There are more of
the big ones ahead!

185
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,640
Mirko's in trouble!

186
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,850
Your weak attacks

187
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,940
will not save you
from destruction.

188
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,730
I pity you, abomination,
but we must pass.

189
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,570
[DOCTOR] The Nomu are created
when I bioengineer human corpses

190
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,410
and gift the reanimated
beings with Quirks.

191
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,740
They have no will of their
own and can only act

192
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,790
as they're programmed.

193
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,910
Based on their strength

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,660
and the number of
Quirks they command,

195
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,380
I split them into lower,
middle, and upper tiers.

196
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,840
In addition to Quirks,
upper tiers have more than

197
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,800
ten times the muscle
of an average person.

198
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,720
But another group outperforms
these champions.

199
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,350
The High Ends.

200
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,350
In addition to having
far higher specs

201
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,390
than the others
across the board,

202
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,020
they're capable of advanced
independent thinking.

203
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,270
Their personalities reflect
the human they were

204
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,610
before they shuffled off
the mortal coil.

205
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,440
As such, all High Ends
were once villains

206
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,650
who had a strong
desire for carnage.

207
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,490
Preparing raw materials
and surgically transferring

208
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,410
abilities is a chore.

209
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,330
And the Quirks take over
three months to adhere.

210
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,000
Without All For One's power,
it's hard to mass produce

211
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,250
these exquisite creatures.

212
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,000
Currently there are five in the
testing phase, but just barely.

213
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,470
That includes the
one called "Woman."

214
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm sorry I left
you behind, children,

215
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,430
but you must protect us!

216
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,100
We lost Warp when Johnny died
and Double went with Mocha.

217
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,810
Which means Shigaraki
and I have lost

218
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,690
our most trusted
means of escape.

While my creations do their
best against the heroes?

Oh, Villain?

224
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,000
I wonder what's keeping you
from running further.

225
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,250
I can hear you clacking away
in the back a' the tunnel.

who slip past the

It would basically be like

Think of it this way.

We had to recruit this many pros

because the enemy
is that dangerous.

00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,010
Damn it! This is
terrible timing.

318
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,430
The whole organization's
in trouble.

[TWICE] We gotta get ya
in front a' Shigaraki

[HAWKS]
Seriously. Kind weird

322
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,440
that I haven't gotten
to talk to him.

323
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,400
[TWICE] That's because
he's off getting stronger.

324
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,200
He'll be in the mountains
near Kyoto for four months.

325
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,610
Whoops, that's a secret.

326
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,240
Though I'm sure that
long-haired spy heard me.

Ya big creep!

[CHIKAZOKU]
After that idiocy,

329
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,660
I made sure to watch
Hawks even more closely.

330
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,960
But not a single thing
he did seemed suspicious.

331
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,420
He tricked me!

332
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,590
No, I'm not to blame.
That fool is!

333

The heroes are coming!

didn't they, Mr. Skeptic?

Let's go light 'em up, huh?

They're here!

Is that...?

[EDGE SHOT]
Not one villain gets away!

They'll give their lives
to bring down society.

If we miss a single person,
the world is in danger.

[MIDNIGHT] Charge! Try not
to get overwhelmed, kid.

Uh, sure thing, Ms. Midnight.

If protecting the world is hard
for you to gear up for,

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,210
here's a trick you can use.

355
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,960
Just imagine you're
really protecting

whatever is most
dear to your heart.

That would be...

I know you can
do this, Chargebolt.

If protecting the world is hard

This happened because
we were waiting for Shigaraki.

But we don't have time
for that anymore.

Unfortunately, Twice has
the power to give the villains

more than just
a fighting chance,

401

to move quickly.

Maybe too fast.
