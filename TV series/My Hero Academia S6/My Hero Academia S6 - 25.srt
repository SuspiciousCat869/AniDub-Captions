00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,310
[ALL MIGHT] When your disciple
was desperate and hurting,

00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,680
you couldn't do
anything for him.

Remain at their side.

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,230
Your presence is enough
to inspire greatness.

That's the truth.

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,240
[ALL MIGHT] The reality is,
you've been holding him back.

00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,500
Great job, All Might.

[STAIN]
What's this?

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,340
Have you come to blaspheme
against a great hero?

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,170
I think not, heretic!

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,850
The Hero Killer. Hello, Stain.

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,810
Unfortunate that our
paths never crossed

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,980
when I was still a hero
who could've stopped you.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,100
And then, after your
capture and imprisonment,

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,520
I figured we'd never
have a reason

16
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,610
to meet each other
face-to-face.

00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,360
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,730
Oh, I see you don't know.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,370
Quite a bit has happened
since you were put away.

20
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,530
I am All Might.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,790
You lie.

Don't disgrace his name
with your falsehoods.

23

I don't blame you for
thinking that I'm lying.

[coughs] You gonna kill me now?

25
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,830
If not--

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,050
It's a trick.

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,420
There's no way you're
the real All Might.

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,010
You're an imposter!

29

We're on sacred ground.

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,860
Why are you pretending to be
that man here, of all places?

31
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,640
Who are you to claim
the title of "hero?" Speak!

32
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,900
Pretending.

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,110
Sure. That's not far off.

34
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,570
[ALL MIGHT] I always felt like
I had to do something

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,700
to help others.

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,450
I couldn't stand in
the wings and watch.

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,420
Not when I saw people's lives
stolen away from them every day.

38
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,250
Even though I was powerless,
I had to take action.

39
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,710
I wanted to improve society.

40
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,930
[ALL MIGHT]
And then I hung up my cape.

41
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,390
And this is the result.

42
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,520
I was supposed
to protect my successor.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,230
But I couldn't even find a way
to protect him from himself.

44
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,980
[ALL MIGHT]
The reason is obvious.

45
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,850
I am a failure,

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,860
watching everyone else
become true heroes.

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,200
[ALL MIGHT]
Strange.

I'm not feeling murderous
intent from him.

I'm usually a hugger,
but we just met.

She's probably staying
at a nearby shelter.

No doubt they'd rather
she not come out here.

58

But she's in danger here.

Why do this?

60
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,950

No matter how terrible
the situation,

All Might smiled as he
faced the insurmountable.

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,470
That didn't have anything
to do with his power.

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480
It was the only way
the Symbol of Peace knew

to bring security
to the citizens.

You say you're All Might,

no idea who he was!

Make no mistake,
this is All Might's legacy.

The smoldering embers
he left behind

They are fueled by the select

Before long, they will form
a new, unstoppable blaze.

The important thing is making
sure that fire doesn't go out.

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,830
I am here to apologize
for not being of any use.

160
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,450
Young Midoriya!

161
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,460
[IZUKU] Huh? No! What are
you talking about?

162
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,960
You helped me a ton out there!

163
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,790
If you're gonna apologize
for being shady,

164
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,760
you better ask us
for forgiveness, too!

165
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,550
You can't just take our
friend away and ghost us!

166
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,010
[ALL MIGHT] The day of the
final battle will soon be here.

167
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm sorry that I caused
everyone to worry.

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,480
[ALL MIGHT] The truth is,
I lost sight of who I was.

169
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,980
I thought I was
no longer a hero.

170
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,230
All right, Stain.

171
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,030
Even if all I can do is
crawl, I'll still fight,

172
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,860
because I want to witness
the fire raging in their hearts

173
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,040
with my own eyes.

174
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,910
The details aren't
important at the moment,

175
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,620
but there's new intel.

176
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,050
We should have more information
in the coming days.

177
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,000
And we'll need everyone's help.

178
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,830
Even mine.

179
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,170
This weakened body may limit my
usefulness, but I'll do my best.

180
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,800
[IZUKU]
All Might!

181
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,760
The food you brought me
gave me the strength

182
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,430
to keep going! I'm sure
that I lost my way

183
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,470
because I distanced
myself from you.

184
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,650
So from now on,

185
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,270
we fight side by side.

186
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,060
Let's protect the world!

187
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,450
Thank you all.

188
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,990
[ALL MIGHT] I'll show these kids
that I can stand by their side.

189
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,950
[ALL MIGHT]
Anyway, I gotta go.

190
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,870
Dude, you're bouncing already?

191
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,870
[ALL MIGHT] I need to speak
with Endeavor and the others.

192
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,370
There's still a lot to do.

193
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,080
Please tell Hawks he could
at least send me a text message.

194
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,010
[ALL MIGHT]
Right. I'll pass that on.

195
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,340
[ASHIDO]
Ooh, someone's an Angryami.

196
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,050
I'm concerned, not angry.

197
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,380
[SATO] Why don't Endeavor
and the others

198
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,060
just set up shop at UA?

199
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,380
He would need a good reason
to show his face on campus.

200
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,640
Anyone who sees him
will think of Dabi.

201
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,850
He's doesn't want
to be triggering.

202
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,270
We may have sold the
evacuees on Midoriya,

203
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,810
but they're not thrilled.

204
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,280
Many still don't trust heroes,
especially my old man.

205
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,320
[YAOYOROZU] Seems someone
finally calmed down enough

206
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,070
to get some sleep.

207
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,610
[TODOROKI] As Dabi's brother
and Endeavor's son,

208
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,790
I know people are skeptical
about me being here, too.

209
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,620
Can't blame them.

210
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,330
Just because of your family.

211
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,700
That sucks so bad,

212
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,960
and it's not like you did
anything wrong yourself.

213
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,460
But I did.

214
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,920
I got so obsessed with my
bloodline, I forgot who I was.

215
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm acting with a clearer
head now, though.

216
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,470
And I'll destroy
any doubts about me.

217
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,810
I'll do my best to regain
everybody's trust.

218
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,310
Now that's chivalry!

219
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,240
You're making me
cry manly tears!

220
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,360
Right. If we've got
a bunch of evacuees

221
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,110
who aren't exactly fans of ours,
then we just fix that. No prob.

222
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,620
Huh? Jiro? You're
getting really close.

223
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,160
What's going on?

224
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,460
It might be kinda weird
to compare these two things,

225
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,130
but stay with me.

226
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,260
During the school festival,
there were plenty of people

227
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,800
who were on the fence about us.

228
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,630
We wanted to find a way
to reassure them, remember?

229
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,010
And make them feel good, too.

230
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,300
So we made a plan
to win their hearts.

231
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,430
[JIRO]
If we could do it back then,

232
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,770
I know that we can do it again.
We just have to give it our all.

233
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,240
Let's show them who we are.

234
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,660
Yeah, you're right.

235
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,870
[JIRO]
We won't just go back to normal.

236
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,620
We'll make it better
than it was before.

237
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,410
If we can do this together,
we'll go beyond!

238
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,260
[HAWKS]
So.

239
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,430
We got some info about
Shigaraki's upgrades

240
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,970
from Garaki's polygraph
and cross-referenced it

241
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,010
with Central's Nomu research.

242
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,440
It was tricky, since we were
comparing a living person

243
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,690
to some lackeys created
out of corpses,

244
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,610
but we did come to a conclusion.

245
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,820
We believed his body would
be completed after two months.

246
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,610
All our intelligence
pointed to that timeline.

247
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,530
There was also
additional testimony

248
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,610
from the assassins Deku caught.

249
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,990
It sounds like All For One's
intention is to get his hands

250
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,700
on One For All before
his protégé's body

251
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,830
has reached full potential.

252
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,700
A month has passed since
the attack on Tartarus,

253
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,670
which, in theory, left us
with another 30 days or so

254
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,050
to plan our next move on
All For One and the League.

255
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,470
Or so we thought.

256
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,590
[HAWKS] We received Tartarus
security records from Stain,

257
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,470
who gave them to All Might along
with an overzealous love letter

258
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,550
to our Symbol of Peace.

259
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,980
Mr. Fanboy had no intention
of giving this information

260
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,020
to anyone but All Might himself.

261
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,780
[ENDEAVOR] I never thought
that the Hero Killer

262
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,450
would end up being
some sort of ally.

what of the outside world?

to the only man I believe in.

I told the guard I would
pass on his resolve,

so you must pick up
where he left off

I'll take any good

Tartarus has a security system
that's completely cut off

from the outside world.
It's a defensive measure.

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,160
Shigaraki used Radio Waves
liberally in that last battle,

314
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,290
and it caused havoc both
inside and outside the prison.

315
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,080
You mean All For One
and his consciousness

316
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,130
inside Shigaraki were in sync?

317
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,920
Is that what allowed him
to coordinate his attack?

318
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,140
It's more complicated
than that, Sansa.

319
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,430
Yes, he shared his thoughts
through the consciousness

320
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,430
that resides inside
of his Quirk.

321
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,260
I've experienced
a similar phenomenon

322
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,770
as a wielder of One For All.

323
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,140
But the thing is, that sort
of Quirk communication

324
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,780
doesn't go both ways.

325
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,570
Which means what?

326
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,030
[ALL MIGHT] My vestige inside
One For All knows everything

327
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,820
that the me living in
this world sees or thinks.

328
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,500
But in all my years dealing
with this synchronization,

329
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,960
I've never experienced it
working the other way around.

330
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,340
Except in one recent moment.

331
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,170
In the hospital,
when I touched Midoriya,

332
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,670
or close enough, anyway,

333
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,420
my vestige's thoughts just
seemed to flow into me.

334
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,430
But even if All For One
has a higher rate

335
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,970
of synchronization
than the users

336
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,520
of One For All communicate with,

337
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,060
could a body at 500 meters
below sea level

338
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,180
really have the power

339
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,820
to reach out to Shigaraki
on the ground?

340
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,070
Using nothing but thoughts
and the sheer force of will?

341
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,940
Isn't there something
like that with twins?

342
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,910
Some kinda connection
between brains?

343
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,910
Yeah, well, I can't
speak to that.

344
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,540
In this case, though, I know
they talked using Radio Waves.

345
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,910
The data suggests that if
someone has that Quirk,

346
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
they can send messages
and receive them.

347
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,920
Our analysis shows
that the radio waveforms

348
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,040
recorded at Tartarus were,
in fact, a conversation.

349
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,380
I didn't realize we had
those results back.

350
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,310
Any idea what they were saying?

351
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,520
That Shigaraki would
be complete in 38 days.

352
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,310
[gasps] But reports from Central
said it'd be two months.

353
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,440
I don't get it.

354
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,190
[ALL MIGHT]
He knew we'd investigate.

355
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,690
So he arranged for the research

356
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,660
to lead us to a
specific conclusion.

357
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,580
We believe these private
communications between his body

358
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,660
and consciousness reveal
the actual schedule.

359
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,130
[ALL MIGHT] Which means
Shigaraki, All For One's vessel,

360
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,510
will be complete
in about three days.

361
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,630
Wait. No way. That soon?

362
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,300
Yes. Which means that we're
quickly running out of options.

363
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,800
We need time and
allies to figure out

364
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,680
how we can go up
against the League.

365
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,090
Soon.

366
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,600
[AMBASSADOR 138A]
A plea from All Might himself?

367
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,190
[AMBASSADOR 138B] He's asking
for them to be deployed

368
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,110
tomorrow, but that's impossible!

369
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,860
A mountain of
paperwork is required

370
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,780
to dispatch heroes overseas.

371
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,530
[AMBASSADOR 138C] And a
country's power is determined

372
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,570
by the strength of its heroes.

373
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,740
Deploying them abroad
upsets the equilibrium

374
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,490
and invites all manner
of attack on a nation.

375
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,670
[AMBASSADOR 138D] Whenever a
wealth of heroes are dispatched,

376
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,290
crime syndicates
jump into overdrive.

377
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,120
We're overwhelmed as it is.

378
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,300
Every country's facing
domestic threats.

379
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,090
The villains are
conspiring across borders.

380
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,760
[AMBASSADOR 138E]
According to Interpol,

381
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,220
All For One has
allies and supporters

382
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,970
scattered across the globe.

383
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,180
[EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR 138A]
That may be.

384
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,810
But Hawks, Endeavor,
and of course All Might

385
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,810
sent in this request.
There's no way we can ignore it.

386
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,430
Our Salaam wants to
move out immediately.

387
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,900
He's convinced he'll be the one
to take down All For One.

388
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,440
[SINGAPOREAN AMBASSADOR 138A]
Big Red Dot in my country

389
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,780
is also chomping at the bit.

390
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,400
He keeps asking why bureaucracy

391
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,780
should keep him from
saving a friend.

392
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,830
[AMERICAN AMBASSADOR 138A]
Yeah, so, our hero left already.

393
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,330
[AMBASSADORS gasp]

394
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,700
[AMERICAN AMBASSADOR 138A]
Apparently she couldn't stand

395
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,500
to wait around. She dropped
everything and flew off.

396
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,470
[WEDGE] Don't blame us if you
get in trouble, Star!

397
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,630
[STAR AND STRIPE]
It wasn't a question

398
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,140
of whether or not I would help,

399
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,430
so why not start sooner,
rather than later?

400
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,800
And besides, we're talking
about a direct request

401
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,230
from All Might himself.

402
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,440
If my master's got
himself in trouble,

403
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,610
why would I even think twice
before rushing to his side?

404
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,950
Which means now,
it's your turn.

405
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,080
[IZUKU yelps]

406
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,130
Oh, good morning! Hey!

U-Uraraka. Am I--

408
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,130
Dang, Midoriya, did you know
you talk in your sleep?

409
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,810
You're nestled safe and
sound back at UA...

410
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,140
Put those things away.
They look gross.

411
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,100
[IZUKU]
Right! I'm sorry!

412
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,220
There's no need to worry
yourself any more.

413
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,100
Right. From now on,
we'll be standing at your side.

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,980
[KIRISHIMA] Yeah.
We're gonna fight as a class.

415
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,280
[IZUKU]
The final battle draws near.

416
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,960
But oddly enough,
I'm not afraid.

417
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,330
I know that I'm not alone.

418
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,500
My friends are with me.

Together, we'll
set things right.
