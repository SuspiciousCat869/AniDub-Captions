1
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,350
Here's what I know.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,310
Two months from now,
in Haibori Woods,

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,140
they're meeting
at a hidden mansion.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,900
I was supposed to
bring the boy there.

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,860
[LADY NAGANT]
And it's not just me.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,910
He sent the other hunters
after the target, too.

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,530
The same job.

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,630
[IZUKU]
All For One.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,970
[HAWKS]
Good luck.

10
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,260
Let's put an end
to this tonight.

11
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,770
[BEST JEANIST]
Be on your guard.

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,520
[EDGE SHOT] We have no idea
what traps might be inside.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,640
Wait, Deku, don't be reckless!

14
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,980
[IZUKU] I have to finish this
while All For One and Shigaraki

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,450
still aren't strong enough
to steal One For All.

16
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,750
[ENDEAVOR] It's empty.
Can't say I'm shocked.

17
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,630
[ALL FOR ONE] Izuku Midoriya,
I do hope you enjoyed

18
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,510
your heart-to-heart with
the lovely Lady Nagant.

19
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,590
If you're seeing this, it means
she relayed my instructions,

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,520
and I remain a
step ahead of you.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,140
I knew a righteous boy
such as yourself

22
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,850
would never abandon
a lost soul like her.

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,480
But she acted of
her own free will.

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,900
I didn't force her.

25
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,070
Do you know what the world
calls those who face setbacks?

26
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,150
Villains.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,870
People are quick
to praise individualism,

28
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,950
but in truth,
this a regulated society.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,210
Those who don't fit in
are ostracized.

30
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,330
Democracy. Socialism.

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,090
This prejudice exists
across every ideal.

32
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,880
It's a byproduct of group living

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,510
that predates the
concept of "society."

34
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,510
The path you've chosen
is a thorny one.

35
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,720
Every fight will wear at you,
until there's nothing left.

36
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,020
While I was imprisoned,
I spent countless hours

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,100
thinking about you.

38
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm afraid I'm not interested
in All Might anymore.

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,940
I've grown bored
of that pitiful oaf.

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,490
Which means now, it's your turn.

41
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,910
[IZUKU growls]

42
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,760
[EDGE SHOT] We narrowly
escaped the explosion,

43
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,850
but any trace of the League
burned with the mansion.

44
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,180
Can Nagant supply
any more information?

45
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,770
Sounds like a "no."

46
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,060
Her doc at Central says
she's still unconscious.

47
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,740
From what I understand,
the hospital staff

48
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,270
isn't totally sure how
she's managed to stay alive.

49
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,700
[KAMUI WOODS] She was beaten
down by anger and despair

50
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,030
throughout her years.

51
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,700
But despite her past,
she refuses to give up.

52
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,950
[EDGE SHOT]
Endeavor.

53
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,370
Don't you think it's time
we made our move?

54
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,910
We should share the secret
of One For All and Midoriya

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,380
with more heroes, not just
this hand-picked group.

56
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,510
It would allow for a more
comprehensive search.

57
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,890
The incident with Lady Nagant
confirmed what we already knew.

58
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,140
From here on out, if we
want to find the League,

59
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,220
our best bet is
to lean on the boy.

60
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,930
The police are
already overwhelmed

61
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,640
with all the jail-breaker cases.

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,260
And we've got no eye-witness
reports to lean on.

63
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,850
We need to get a support
system into place now,

64
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,730
before it's too late.

65
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,440
Not two days ago,
Death Arms threw in the towel.

66
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,080
[DEATH ARMS] I constantly
fight for our citizens,

67
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,750
and still they
doubt my intentions.

68
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,570
They yell at me.
Send me away.

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,580
And yeah, some still back us.

70
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,330
But one insult can
overshadow ten cheers.

71
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,920
I've never felt this before.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,670
Guess I thought I was
bigger than that.

73
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,930
I'm sure the others
who quit felt the same.

74
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,890
Turns out I'm not
a hero after all.

75
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,770
Just a human.

76
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,060
He was a key figure
during the raid,

77
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,480
the one who rounded up
any hero secretly aiding

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,770
the Paranormal Liberation Front.

79
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,570
A man with courage and grit.

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,610
[BEST JEANIST] Anyone's
uniform could unravel next.

81
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,790
I fear the fabric that
makes up our hero network

82
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,530
will soon be threadbare.

83
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,080
The press is getting ever closer
to figuring out who Deku is.

84
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,870
I suspect the former heroes
are leaking them information.

85
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,340
With all this chaos,
no one knows who to look to.

86
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,460
If the reality of One For All
is exposed, it could set off

87
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,640
a chain reaction of
negativity toward Midoriya.

88
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,010
I don't want to imagine
what will happen

89
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,510
if it goes down that way.

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,980
I mean, hell, it's already
a madhouse out there now.

91
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,650
Something's been nagging at me.

92
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,520
Why doesn't All For One go
public about the power himself?

93
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,770
Sic the world on Midoriya,
then take what he's after?

94
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,530
It seems like the
kinda thing he'd do.

95
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,030
[ENDEAVOR] If he did, we'd
mobilize every hero in our ranks

96
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,240
and hide Deku in isolation.

97
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,030
Since he's keeping
his mouth shut,

98
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,900
he must want to
avoid that outcome.

99
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,370
Meanwhile, we're stuck.

100
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,990
The only way we can
catch the League's scent

101
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,960
is if Deku is
roaming the streets.

102
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,590
Even with more enforcement.
This is up to him.

Oh, hey, that's mine.
It's All Might.

109
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,860
Midoriya just made contact
with another hired gun!

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,240
And he defeated him. Instantly.

[IZUKU]
He had no useful information.

It's possible he
could explode, too.

If you did, you'd realize
he can't be trusted out there.

313
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,770
He never considers
his own wellbeing.

314
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,700
He just says he's fine.

315
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,450
That type of thinking
is what made All Might

316
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,870
the Symbol of Peace, so he
can't be trusted to stop Deku.

317
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,160
Listen to me!

318
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,450
Something terrible
is gonna happen

319
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,630
if you let them do this alone.

320
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,330
[HAWKS] Jeez, looks like he's
shaken off All Might, as well.

321
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,010
Kid's on his own.

322
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,510
If we were faster,
maybe we would've talked

323
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,180
some sense into him.

324
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,720
We could be backing him up.

325
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,590
Midoriya.

326
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,220
Hold up, is that
GPS tracking Deku?

327
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,650
I need to borrow this.
Sorry, sir.

328
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,360
I know I'm just a guy
who randomly ended up

329
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,530
in Midoriya's class,
but I wanna help.

330
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,070
Me, too.

331
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,150
Especially after everything
we've been through this year.

332
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,990
Yeah, same here.

333
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,160
[HAGAKURE]
Ditto!

334
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,990
I can't believe he
didn't confide in me

335
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,040
about his worries
concerning One For All,

336
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,450
but I'm more surprised
that he thought

337
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,040
a simple letter would
convince us to let him run away.

338
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,880
Class 1-A sticks together.

339
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,050
We'll track his location,
and we'll stand by his side.

340
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,170
We know that One For All
has burdened Midoriya

341
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,050
with a terrible responsibility,
but that doesn't change

342
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,310
the fact that he's our friend.

343
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,890
And knowing that
someone we care about

344
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,820
is walking a treacherous path,

345
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,390
means we can't look
to the future with a smile.

346
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,240
The streets are too dangerous.
They're brimming with crime.

347
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,820
It's no place for students.

348
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,490
[NEZU] I've seen how
you've matured, Todoroki.

349
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,700
I agreed to let Midoriya
team up with you

350
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,160
because I know that he
didn't want to come back to UA

351
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,710
and risk it being
targeted by villains.

352
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,710
He was worried.

353
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,460
But he can come back.
The school will be just fine.

354
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,600
Ever since we accepted him,
he's been under our protection

355
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,550
like every other student here.

356
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,800
[NEZU] It's my pleasure
to welcome you to UA,

357
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,730
your hero academy.

358
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,730
[OCHACO] He's right.
This our Hero Academy.

359
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,780
What about the evacuees
you've taken in?

360
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,110
They'll be at risk
if he returns,

361
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,040
and they're furious
with us already.

362
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,570
Something like this
will stoke the fire.

363
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,330
[NEZU] I'll figure out a way
to make them understand.

364
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,370
Besides, I didn't approve our
status as an emergency shelter

365
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,670
because we have a large campus.

366
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,540
You see, when we were
preparing for the last

367
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,760
school festival,
we reinforced the UA Barrier.

368
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,340
We didn't end up needing
the extra security,

369
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,260
so this is our chance
to test it out.

370
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,550
Don't forget, All Might
grew up in this school, too.

371
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,310
And we survived.
Go ahead, students.

372
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,520
Bring your classmate back.

373
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,040
The villain is secured!
We're in the clear, Bakugo!

374
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,540
"Great Explosion Murder
God Dynamight" damn it!

375
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,290
Oh, right! I forgot! Sorry!

376
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,710
My body's mine again!

377
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,670
What just...?

378
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,800
A bunch of kid
heroes showed up.

379
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,920
I don't understand.
Why're you here?

380
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,090
Because we're worried about you.

381
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:02,100
That's nice, but I promise
I'm fine. Really.

382
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,350
No need for concern. So leave.

383
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,270
Oh, yeah, great speech!

384
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,020
Just what we wanted from the
famous One For All successor!

385
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,490
Real talk. Are you able
to smile right now?

386
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,610
C'mon, go ahead and show us.

387
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:27,950
[IZUKU] In order to smile...
For everyone to live in peace...

388
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,710
I have to go. I'm sorry.

389
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,970
[IZUKU]
Everyone get out of my way.

390
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,590
You're gonna have to make us,

391
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,020
ya busted-ass
All Might wannabe!

392
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,480
Midoriya.

393
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,190
We had a feeling that's
what you were going to say.

394
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,940
Let's do this, class!

395
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,020
Right!

396
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,490
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

397
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,670
My friends are in front of me,
but I continue my lonely fight.

398
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,170
Trying to do
everything by myself.

399
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,130
Hoping that nobody else
will have to suffer.

400
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,250
In the midst of my exhaustion,

401
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,340
if I just stopped
to look around,

402
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,980
despite the darkness,
I would see light.

403
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,770
Next time, "Deku vs. Class A."

404
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,770
Even as my friends
try to help, I resist.
