1
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,730
[IZUKU] In the aftermath
of the destruction,

2
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,730
I read the Safety Commission's
post-mortem report.

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,400
[IZUKU] Only then
did I get a full picture

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,150
of everything that
went down that day.

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,240
[IZUKU] Just before the huge
villain arrest operation began,

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,990
the Chairwoman invited
a key figure

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,570
involved in the Deika incident
to their headquarters

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,830
for an exploratory
business meeting.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,210
[SECRETARY 127A]
Congratulations, President.

10
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,790
What a boon, sir!

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,670
Who'd've guessed the commission
would propose a joint venture

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,960
to develop support items!

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,600
They're not our biggest fans.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,770
They've had an eye on us
for some time,

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,130
claiming we've played a big role

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,020
in fueling public anxiety
across the country.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,690
The timing suggests
they called because

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,900
they can't ignore our wonderful
products any longer,

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,570
and if we succeed today and
form a strong bond with them,

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,200
there's no end to
the data we can mine.

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,490
A few spies, some backdoors
in our software;

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,030
we'll uncover their
every secret.

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,530
Including...

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
...the identity of
the clandestine agent

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,500
the commission has had under
their wing since childhood.

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,580
With an upgraded
Tomura Shigaraki leading

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,050
our fight, the Paranormal
Liberation Front

28
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,090
will make even greater
strides toward progress.

29
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,590
People will truly be free.

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,100
[YOTSUBASHI] The society
my father, the great Destro,

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,230
wished for is so close.
Can you feel it?

32
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,360
[chuckles] The other me
is so happy.

33
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,540
[CHAIRWOMAN]
I apologize for making you wait.

34
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,790
[YOTSUBASHI]
Please, think nothing of it.

35
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,950
[SECRETARY 127A]
We appreciate you pitching

36
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,000
such a lucrative proposal
to our company.

37
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,840
It was an honor
to hear from you.

38
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,710
[CHAIRWOMAN]
We're the ones who're grateful.

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,180
I speak for everyone when
I say the Safety Commission

40
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,720
would be thrilled to
work with Detnerat,

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,720
you've developed so many
ground-breaking products.

42
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,310
However, as for the proposal...

43
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,970
[YOTSUBASHI gasps]

44
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,770
There are some line items
I'd like to discuss.

45
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,530
[glass shatters]

46
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,240
[YOTSUBASHI] You suppressors
played on our business acumen

47
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,210
to catch us in an ambush.

48
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,670
I knew we were being watched

49
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,290
by the Safety Commission,
of course.

50
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,340
But I thought you'd come
around and couldn't live

51
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,340
without our
cutting-edge designs.

52
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,140
It seems my celebration
was premature.

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,760
A double--it's
Bubaigawara's power.

54
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,940
Wait, so he's a fake?

55
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,350
[YOTSUBASHI]
I didn't expect you'd rely

56
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,610
on such aggressive tactics.

57
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,200
[YOTSUBASHI] Aren't you supposed
to champion diplomacy and order?

58
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,200
Ah, well,
this was inevitable.

59
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,990
Necessary, even.

60
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,280
But we strive for society
without order, pure freedom!

61
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,870
The seeds have already
been sown;

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,210
you will be liberated soon!

63
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,250
[IZUKU] With the death
of the chairwoman,

64
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,840
the Heroes Public
Safety Commission

65
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,840
was thrown into disarray.

66
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,260
While chaos unfolded,

67
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,970
the raid operation went
ahead as planned.

68
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,010
Endeavor lead a team
of heroes that stormed

69
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,600
Jaku Hospital. Their target was
All For One's right-hand man,

70
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,310
the doctor who created
the bioengineered Nomu,

71
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,890
Kyudai Garaki.

72
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,860
[AIZAWA]
Those you've toyed with,

73
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,700
and those who cared for them.
Do you know what they all say?

74
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,030
It's our turn to take
something away from you.

75
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,580
[IZUKU] However, the man they
captured was, in actuality,

76
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,040
a double created
by Jin Bubaigawara,

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,960
the duplicating villain
known as Twice.

78
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,960
When a surprise horde
of Nomu appeared,

79
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,390
the hospital suddenly
became a battlefield.

80
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,760
Thinking back on it now,
they must've already

81
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,630
been fighting while those
of us in the rear guard

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,520
evacuated citizens,
though we had no idea

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,730
what was going on at the time.

84
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,440
Three minutes after
the raid began,

85
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,270
Mirko cornered the real
Garaki in a hidden lab,

86
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,650
where he managed to
activate five powerful Nomu

87
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,110
called High Ends.

88
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,530
[yells]

89
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,920
[MIRKO] If I'm gonna die, it'll
be after I achieve my goal.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,290
[IZUKU]
Despite being wounded,

91
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,920
Mirko found Tomura Shigaraki
in suspended animation.

92
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,300
[MIRKO]
Luna Arc!

93
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,970
[IZUKU] She wasn't able
to fully destroy the lab,

94
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,090
and as more heroes
rushed to the scene,

95
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,850
the situation devolved
into a free-for-all.

96
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,270
[IZUKU] In the end,
our worst fears came true.

97
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,900
Shigaraki awakened.

98
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,280
Wielding enhanced Quirks,
he decimated Jaku City.

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,280
In a flash, the hospital became
ground zero for his Decay wave.

100
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,580
I wasn't there,
but I felt Shigaraki.

101
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,250
I knew he was close by.

102
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,710
While Endeavor's team fought,
another army of heroes

103
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,040
amassed 80 kilometers away
from Jaku Hospital

104
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,880
at the Paranormal Liberation
Front's secret base,

105
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,350
the Gunga Villa.

106
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,850
They were the second prong

107
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,100
of the sweeping raid operation,
an army lead by Edge Shot.

108
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,520
Aw, yeah, That's one scary
leader rendered powerless.

109
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,480
[KAMUI WOODS] Pre-emptive
Binding, Lacquered Chain Prison!

110
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,730
[IZUKU] Their surprise
attack was a success,

111
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,070
and it looked as
though the heroes

112
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,440
would have an easy victory.

113
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,700
According to the report,
Hawks, who was in the middle

114
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,200
of an undercover
investigation at the villa,

115
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,080
had the primary goal
of keeping the villains

116
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,450
from using Twice's Quirk,
which could change

117
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,920
the tide of the battle.

118
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,380
[HAWKS] In the end I guess
it comes down to bad luck

119
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,380
Atone for your crimes
and start over.

120
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,250
[TWICE]
No! I stopped giving a damn

121
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,720
about myself a long time ago.

122
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,560
[IZUKU] Hawks was able
to carry out his mission,

123
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,690
but was badly injured. He was
rescued by my classmate,

124
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,810
Tsukuyomi, who barely
managed to flee

125
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,490
with the Number-Two hero.

126
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,450
[TOKOYAMI]
I believe in you!

127
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,160
We all do, Whatever you
did was justified!

128
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,950
So don't you die!

129
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,250
[IZUKU]
With the appearance of Geten,

130
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,710
a Paranormal Liberation
Front lieutenant,

131
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,960
and Gigantomachia, All For One's
enormous bodyguard,

132
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,550
the fight quickly
became a brawl

133
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,430
the heroes weren't able
to keep contained.

134
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,850
Ordered to find his way
to Shigaraki's side,

135
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,680
Gigantomachia started
running towards Jaku City,

136
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,140
taking members of the League and
the Liberation Front with him.

137
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:43,440
No heroes were capable
of overcoming his raw power.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,650
[MIDNIGHT] No one in our ranks
can stop that thing with force.

139
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,780
We need you.

140
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,400
[YAOYOROZU]
Together. As one.

141
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,410
We'll take down this villain.

142
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,330
[IZUKU] The only hope of slowing
Gigantomachia's advance

143
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,700
lay in the hands of the
courageous work study students

144
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,340
who fought to dose him
with sedatives.

145
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,510
[KIRISHIMA] I am Red Riot!
You won't hurt them!

146
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,430
This ends here!

147
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,900
Heroes, take him down!

148
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,600
We can't rely on the work study
students to do all the work!

149
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,690
[IZUKU] Meanwhile, at the
ruins of Jaku Hospital,

150
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,060
Team Endeavor and Shigaraki
continued to fight

151
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,150
in what was fast becoming
a battle to the death.

152
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,410
This is Endeavor!
Does anybody copy?

153
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,160
I'm fighting Shigaraki
where the hospital stood.

154
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,450
If there's anyone who can move

155
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,670
without touching the ground,
form a perimeter.

super-charged
physical strength

158
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,670
and regeneration abilities,

159
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,750
which forced the heroes
to the brink.

[ENDEAVOR]
Plus Ultra, Prominence Burn!

[IZUKU] Finally, Gigantomachia
reached his master in Jaku.

162
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,960
[DABI]
Yes. The so-called villain

163
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,340
sitting in front of you
is Endeavor's oldest son.

164
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,920
[IZUKU]
That's when Dabi, a member

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,920
of the League of Villains,
revealed that he was,

166
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,470
in fact, Endeavor's son

167
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,720
in a message broadcast
across the country.

168
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,590
His recording included
video of Hawks

169
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,980
killing Bubaigawara.
In just a few minutes,

170
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,190
he caused people nationwide
to doubt heroes.

171
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,690
[IZUKU]
My allies and I

172
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,400

disadvantage, but...

[BEST JEANIST]
Sorry I'm late!

176
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,410
[IZUKU] As Best Jeanist and
Lemillion joined the fray,

177
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,630
the sedatives the work study
students used to drug

178
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,050
Gigantomachia began
to take effect,

179
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,170
allowing us to restrain him.

180
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,690
[IZUKU] But it wasn't over,
Shigaraki attempted to flee

181
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,820
with the Nomu that had surfaced
from inside the hospital ruins.

182
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,480
The heroes worked diligently,

183
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,730
rescuing and
evacuating citizens,

184
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,310
fighting on the front
lines until they were

185
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,650
no longer able
to stand, and yet,

186
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,950
Shigaraki still slipped
through our fingers,

187
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,990
escaping with seven Nomu.

188
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,160
[IZUKU] The final pages
of the report include

189
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,380
a few interesting details.

190
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,920
They note that every hero
at the scene explicitly said

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,960
that no work study
students participated

192
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,260
in the fight against Shigaraki,

193
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,050
Our part was erased
from the record.

194
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,970
That denial is the only
reference to me, Kacchan,

195
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,550
and Todoroki in the
entire document.

196

[IZUKU] But I know
what happened that day.

197

[IZUKU]
Shigaraki--no, All For One--

198

was desperately trying to
steal One For All from me.

because we've all chosen
to remain inside of this boy.

201
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,250
[IZUKU] I clearly remember
the first wielder's defiance.

202
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,550
[IZUKU]
And Shigaraki's face.

203
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,170
He looked like he
wanted to be rescued.

204
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,400
[IZUKU] The report was sparse
regarding what happened

205
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,900
after Shigaraki escaped. Only
the barest facts were recorded.

aiding and abetting murder,

when rushed to the hospital.

Any incapacitated Nomu
were restrained in Maidens,

00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,320
to be autopsied later.

218

The equipment from
the hidden lab was taken.

With any luck, analysis
will give us a better idea

of exactly how Garaki used it.

[IZUKU] One hundred thirty-two
members of the PLF,

including several lieutenants,
left the villa on Gigantomachia

or fled in his wake
and remain on the run.

247
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,370
While the raid focused
on two main locations,

248
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,300
there were smaller searches
across the country

249
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,920
which resulted in
even more villains

None of those targets
evaded arrest.

We don't yet know what
we can learn from them.

O negative blood, stat!

there are only four bags left!

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,650
[DOCTOR 127A]
That's not nearly enough!

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,570
Doctor, this one's
not responding!

317
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,240
[DOCTOR 127A] Lay him on
the ground for now!

But--

[DOCTOR 127A]
I can't save everyone.

Water.

It's okay. We're here for you.
We'll get you water in a second.

Where are the heroes?

[HERO 127F]
I quit.

Please, say something.

[KIRISHIMA]
This is...

How? Why?

339
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,000
But she was just on the radio.

340
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,000
She was fine. You guys
heard her. We all did.

[KIRISHIMA] No! Wake up!

Stop joking and open your eyes!

[TOKAGE]
Yaoyorozu?

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,410
It's Majestic.

351
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,700
Is this for real?

352
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,700
Because it feels
like a nightmare.

353
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,170
This can't possibly
be happening, right?

Guys?

355
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,300
[IZUKU] According to the
deposition Garaki gave

356
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,340
after his arrest,
Shigaraki died

357
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,420
when he was broken out
of his chamber.

358
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,840
Given the state
of the equipment,

359
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,390
there should have been
no way to resuscitate him.

360
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,850
The electric shock,
which was so weak

361
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,270
that the hero X-Less
likely didn't even feel it,

362
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,690
isn't what brought him back.

363
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,570
Shigaraki was revived
by his dreams and hatred.

364
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,620
[IZUKU] Now we try
to pick up the pieces.

We try to come to terms
with the many lives lost

366
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,790
because of Shigaraki's
resolve, and what's to come.

367
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,540
Oh, man, this country
is falling apart.

368
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,300
Dabi's so annoying,
but he wrecked Endy.

the headlines are saying?

what happens next?

I never trusted that guy,

even when he was
still number two.

protect us, did he forget that?

explain himself, and fast!

to plan, but we have momentum.

Here's the preview.

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,120
While we try to catch our
breath after the battle,

the Paranormal Liberation Front

393
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,300
sets a horrendous
plan into motion.

The prison called "Tartarus."

Their goal: to free All For One
from the shackles that bind him.

Next time, "Tartarus."

hits us off guard
