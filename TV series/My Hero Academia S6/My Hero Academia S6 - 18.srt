1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,430
[ALL MIGHT]
I can feel it.

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,640
The vestige of me that
lives within One For All.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,220
Inside you.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,980
[ALL MIGHT]
Right now, you must be talking

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,600
with the previous wielders.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,770
[IZUKU] What's going on?
What happened to everybody else?

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,070
My friends. My teachers.

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,200
Please. Let them be okay.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,370
[BANJO]
We need to have ourselves a talk

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,950
before you wake up.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,670
My apologies.
The timing's not ideal.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,130
Fate has brought us here.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,300
Oh, please.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,550
It's just bad luck
this is happening now.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,850
[EN] Banjo, you spoke
to him before, yes?

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,520
When he first used Blackwhip.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,150
[IZUKU] These are the people
who had One For All before me.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,320
They're in my dreams again.

19
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,580
[FIRST WIELDER] At first,
we could only talk to you

20
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,200
when we found cracks
in your consciousness.

21
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,540
But we're not limited
to those moments anymore.

22
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,630
The reason is related
to my power,

23
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,500
which you now hold.
About four months ago,

24
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,340
it suddenly began to
grow at a rapid pace.

25
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,130
As a result of
this acceleration,

26
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,300
the previous wielders,
the figures you see

27
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,800
in front of you now,
were able to take shape

28
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,970
and communicate with each other
inside of One For All.

29
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,730
When my brother
forcibly pulled us

30
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,360
into the battle earlier,
we gained even more freedom.

31
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,690
It's now far easier for us
to appear before you.

32
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,280
Don't you worry,

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,700
we'll still give you plenty a'
privacy if you know what I mean.

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,870
[IZUKU muffled grunting]

35
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,160
Oh, right. I forgot you don't
have a mouth in here.

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,910
[IZUKU]
Right. Back then...

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,040
[IZUKU yells]

38
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,340
[IZUKU] I wasn't able to do
much more than make noise.

39
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,590
Now it feels like my mouth's
starting to take shape.

40
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,760
[IZUKU muffled]

41
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,550
Dang! I can almost
understand what you're saying.

42
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,350
[SHINOMORI]
Allow me to explain.

43
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,110
[SHINOMORI]
My name's Hikage Shinomori.

44
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,650
and I was One For All's
fourth wielder.

45
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,240
During the recent battle,
you unintentionally tapped

46
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
into my Quirk and
used it on the field.

47
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,820
[IZUKU muffled]
Yeah!

48
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,370
[IZUKU]
According to All Might,

49
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,870
the fourth wielder's Quirk was
the ability to sense danger.

50
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,040
It was kind of
a shock to be honest.

51
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,460
[IZUKU muffled]

52
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,920
Strange that I didn't
sense you'd be

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,250
using Danger Sense
since it is my Quirk.

54
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,210
[IZUKU]
Makes a lot of "sense." Heh.

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,430
Number four's a weird one.
He got tired of everyday life,

56
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,010
so he started living in
seclusion like a hermit.

57
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,060
Mine was a terrible era.

58
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,310
The rest of society
was strange, not me.

59
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,270
Were you informed of how I died
and how old I was at the time?

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,190
[IZUKU muffled]

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,530
[IZUKU] All Might didn't mention
specifics in his notes.

62
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,820
Actually. I'm pretty
sure he crossed out

63
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,660
the important details.

64
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,240
We discovered
I died of old age.

65
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,000
[IZUKU]
But, he was so young!

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,920
I was as surprised as you.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,380
Neither Banjo nor I had any way
of knowing how we died.

68
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,130
We only found out because
Yagi looked into the matter.

69
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,180
What this fact
leads us to believe

70
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,390
is that One For All
can't be wielded safely

71
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,310
by an ordinary human being.

72
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,810
[SHINOMORI] I'm second only
to Yagi in terms of users

73
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,560
who lived with the
Quirk the longest.

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,360
For 18 years I spent
my days training

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,900
and building up the
power as best I could.

76
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,280
Avoiding All For One.

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,950
I always knew I didn't
stand a chance

78
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,700
of defeating him myself.

79
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,320
So I figured the best
thing I could do

80
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,160
was improve the Quirk
for its next user.

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,700
But as time passed,

82
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,170
cracks began appearing
on my body.

83
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,380
I thought perhaps
I wasn't training enough

84
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,250
or that I'd contracted
some unknown disease.

85
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,050
That wasn't the case.

86
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,510
As Yagi researched,
he was able to track down

87
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,010
my medical records
and autopsy report.

88
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,850
That's when the truth
came to light.

89
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,350
The "natural causes"
that killed me

90
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,690
were due to the multiple
Quirks inside my body.

91
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,270
They drastically
shortened my lifespan.

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,360
[IZUKU muffled]

93
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,200
That's correct.

94
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,330
Which is exactly the reason
we needed to talk to you.

95
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,540
Yagi is fully aware
of what a burden it is

96
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,130
to carry One For All.

97
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,250
A burden that you'll
have to deal with.

98
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,550
We don't have a
proper sample size.

99
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,630
Most of us didn't
have the power long.

100
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,380
We died in battle,
not of "old age."

101
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,640
So we asked,
what was the intrinsic

102
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,680
difference between
Yagi and Shinomori?

103
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,890
[IZUKU gasps]

104
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,690
[IZUKU]
All Might was Quirkless!

105
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,990
Yes. Yagi may still be alive,
but as he gathered information,

106
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,860
we took what he learned
through the piece of him

107
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,700
that exists inside
of One For All.

108
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,030
And then, after I
heard what my brother

109
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,330
had to say, I was certain.

110
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,910
According to what he said,

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,250
a person's consciousnesses is
etched into their Quirk factor.

112
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,500
So why is Yagi's vestige
here even though

113
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,380
he didn't have an
ability of his own?

114
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,130
We always thought
a piece of the user

115
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,970
ended up inside of One For All
because of the power

116
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,760
they were born with.

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,800
More precisely,
that the consciousness

118
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,810
of every wielder after me lived
on because their Quirk factors

119
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,140
were added to my One For All.

120
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,980
Yagi being the exception.

121
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,480
[FIRST WIELDER] With no Quirk
of his own, he's the only user

122
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,860
who gained a vestige through
One For All itself.

123
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,070
Think of one's ability
to hold a Quirk as a glass.

124
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,700
If it's not empty when
they inherit One For All,

125
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,870
it overflows, eating
away at your lifespan.

126
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,370
Yagi was able to use
One For All over the course

127
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,330
of 40 years because his
vessel was empty at first.

128
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,550
My cultivated power
fit perfectly,

129
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,920
and it became his true Quirk.

130
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,470
By some twist of fate,
this ability that's passed

131
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,260
from person to person, could
only reach its true potential

132
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,810
when wielded by someone
born powerless.

133
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,190
[IZUKU muffled]

134
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,700
There is a caveat.

135
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,580
You could pass it on
to another Quirkless person,

136
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,540
but they're like an
endangered species,

137
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,380
few and far between these days.

138
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,590
It's not something we could've
known in the beginning.

139
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,420
We learned this over
generations of observation.

140
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,430
[FIRST WIELDER] It must have
been fate once again that

141
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,890
the two of you somehow became
back-to-back recipients.

142
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,100
If we'd been able to talk with

143
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,730
the other users sooner,
perhaps fewer people

144
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,190
might've suffered
over the years.

145
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,940
Ya get what this means, kid?

146
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,780
You might be the last person
who wields One For All.

[IZUKU muffled]

148
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,500
And now the real question.

149
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,500
Izuku.

150
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,710
Tell us.

Can you kill Tomura Shigaraki?

Tell us.

153

Can you kill Tomura Shigaraki?

[IZUKU gasps]

155

[NANA]
That's not a request.

156

I'm gauging your resolve.

157
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,440
When you saw that boy's face,
you thought he looked as though

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,610
he was asking
for help, didn't you?

159
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,990
We feel your emotions,
so we know what was ringing

160
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,740
through your head in that
moment of desperation.

161
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,450
[BANJO] The problem is,
the rest of us had a completely

162
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,330
different take on the situation.

163
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,630
We know All For One
was inside his head.

164
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,540
Which was causing
Shigaraki pain, yeah.

165
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,550
But in that moment, it didn't
seem like he wanted to be saved.

166
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,510
Even as he suffered
in front of us,

167
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,300
those terrible eyes held
nothing but hatred.

168
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,100
Because that's the person
All For One raised him to be.

169
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,350
My brother was incarcerated
during the fight.

170
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,060
I think his plan was probably
to possess Shigaraki

171
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,360
both physically and mentally.

172
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,530
So that he could
take One For All.

173
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,320
Me and En, my junior here.

174
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,740
We both ended up
facing All For One,

175
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,000
but we managed to keep him from
stealing the power from us.

176

Cause in order to make
One For All surrender,

177
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,210
you gotta come at it with
a passion that surpasses

178
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,550
the Quirk's incredible power.

179
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,630
No person can produce such
an overwhelming will alone.

180
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,680
Our best guess is
All For One's trying

181
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,470
to use Shigaraki's
hatred as a booster.

[BANJO] At the heart of
the Quirk inside of you

It looked like Yagi

you can't abandon your power.

00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,710
But Tomura Shigaraki
is my grandson.

193
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,260
I left my family
to fight All For One.

194
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,180
Abandoned my child.

195
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,430
And this is the result.

196
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,470
We're in a terrible situation.

197
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,180
It's disgraceful that I failed
to achieve my goal,

198
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,310
and now have to rely
on a 16-year-old.

199

However, if that monster

200
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,200
manages to fully awaken,
no one will be able to stop him.

201
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,660
You can't make him see reason
or offer him forgiveness.

202
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,410
Some people are simply
beyond redemption.

And I believe Tomura
is one of them.

204

So if you think he looked
like he wanted to be saved...

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,090
Ask yourself.

I could sense
a lost child crying.

I've fought a lot of people

I never found out why they
ended up becoming villains.

What caused all their anger.

If I had known, maybe things
would've been different.

Maybe I still would've
had to fight. Maybe not.

Shigaraki killed so
many innocent people.

things Dabi mentioned

312
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,710
are correct for the most part.

313
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,340
My father's identity.

314
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,970
How I killed a desperate villain
who was running away.

315
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,220
That's all true.

316
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,310
I apologize for hiding
the truth about my origin.

317
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,430
I know now that
it was a mistake.

318
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,480
Regarding Jin Bubaigawara.

319
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,770
The League member
known as Twice.

320
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,150
I thought I had no other choice

321
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,070
but to keep him
out of the fight.

322
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,650
If he had activated his Quirk,
the damage would've been

323
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,160
unimaginably worse
than it already was.

324
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,870
I did want to bring him
in for his crimes.

325
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,160
But in the end, his concern
for his fellow League members

326
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,700
forced the issue.

327
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,040
I had to act.

328
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,170
I feel awful for
how things went down.

329
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,960
I just hope you'll believe me.

330
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,670
I've got a question.

331
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,210
In the chaos caused
by Gigantomachia,

332
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,130
my own mother was
seriously injured.

333
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,640
Do you really think apologizing

334
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,470
and saying you feel
bad fixes anything?

335
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,770
Do you have any idea

336
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,680
how many people
lost their homes?

337
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,390
Their livelihoods this week?

338
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,270
I don't think you understand
how much you screwed up.

339
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,860
It was the villains
who did this, sure,

340
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,030
but the only reason they
were able to wreak havoc

341
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,780
on such a scale is because
of your mistakes.

342
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,490
If we stood up here
crying and carrying on,

343
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,910
would that make
your mother better?

344
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,030
Huh? No of course it wouldn't!

345
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
But you could do
something besides talk!

346

Take care of the villains
on the streets!

Be a...

...a hero.

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,550
You make a good point.

350
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,510
As number one, that's how
I will atone for my sins.

[BEST JEANIST]
But right now,

there are fewer heroes
in the field.

We're no longer equipped
to protect so many citizens.

With that in mind,

we have patterned
a temporary solution.

After consulting
with government officials,

we'd like to announce that,
starting today, UA High

and other schools
with hero courses

359
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,110
will be designated
as emergency shelters.

360
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,900
There should be plenty
of space in these facilities

for anyone who is scared
or seeking protection.

[OCHACO] Our champions
are at a crossroads.

If a hero is someone people
know they can call on

when they need help, then the
heroes disappeared that day.

[DABI]
Haven't had enough pain yet?

[OCHACO] When Endeavor was

he said he knew
nothing about it.

Uraraka, thank you.

So much.

It's time for you and the rest
of our class to know everything.

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,240
So I'm writing letters
to try and explain.

391
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,620
My Quirk is a power passed
on to me from All Might.

392
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,120
It's a gift that Shigaraki and
All For One want to steal,

393
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,380
so they're coming after me.

The last thing I want to do
is put others in danger,

and it's dangerous
to be near me.

So I'm leaving UA.
