Team Endeavor to confirm

00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,680
the status of Jaku
Hospital evacuations.

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,190
[OPERATOR 114BB] Some of
the heroes stationed there

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,570
are still combatting lower-level
Nomu on the ground floor.

talking-type Nomu underground.
Where Garaki's hiding.

[OPERATOR 114BB]
Endeavor, Crust, and a few other

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,910
team members are
rushing to support her.

18

The hospital evacuations
are completed.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,410
The building is cleared.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,000
The pros who've been
aiding in the process

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,960
will now join the fight.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,920
[OPERATOR 114BB]
We have the upper hand.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,590
The enemies who appeared
at the surface level

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,340
are falling rapidly.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,960
So our only concerns
are the ones underground.

26
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,300
The talking Nomu are formidable.

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,980
There's a reason they're
referred to as "High Ends."

28
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,480
If they're anything like
the one who appeared in Kyushu,

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,400
then their Quirks
and physical ability

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,570
will surpass those
of a typical Nomu.

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,400
They're likely equipped
with fast-acting

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,150
self-regeneration as well.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,280
The top two heroes
were in Kyushu,

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,200
and they were barely able
to defeat the monster

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,700
that attacked there.

36
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,290
You better call 'em off if
you know what's good for ya.

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,420

[X-LESS]
What was that machine?

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,740
Looks like those tubes
took the brunt of the attack.

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,360
I'll finish the job.

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,220
It's cold.

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,690
Try my Shoot Shield!

[AIZAWA] I can't blink
or look away from these Nomu.

52
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,660
But if Endeavor lures
the other one over here,

53
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,320
I can add it to the group.

No, Tsukuyomi! Get back here!

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,760
It's not safe.

He's in deep trouble.

[FATGUM]
You sure?

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,760
[TOKOYAMI]
I'll help him!

It's too dangerous to go alone!

[FATGUM]
I knew he was strong, but jeez.

93
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,850
Nobody's ever escaped
from my fat before,

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,320
much less without a struggle!

Right, that's far enough.
Hurry back to the rear guard.

Tell your classmates
we're doin' fine.

See ya, Hawks.

It's bad, Fumikage.

104
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,890
[TOKOYAMI]
How bad?

105
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,020
[DARK SHADOW]
His back is a nightmare!

106
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,730
His wings. They're gone!

107
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,060
[HAWKS] Weaknesses? Hm.
Well, that's a tough one.

108
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,490
My Achilles heel is
fire I guess.

109
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,030
Oh?

110
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,280
[HAWKS]
Of course.

111
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,900
My wings are tough
but flammable.

112
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,670
[DABI] You're a UA rookie.
You must be joking.

113
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,750
They dragged students out
to fill their ranks?

114
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,550
Well, take a good look.
Your pal here killed Twice.

115
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,590
Stabbed him in the back with
one of those big feathers.

116
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,180
Twice was just trying
to save his friends.

117
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,220
Well? What are you here to do?

118
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,690
Come to rescue him?

119
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,570
You still think
that's the right thing?

120
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,610
These pros you admire
play dirtier than me.

121
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,860
Better learn that now

122
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,360
before you waste your life
worshipping them.

[HAWKS]
Tokoyami.

124
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,210
[TOKOYAMI]

125
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,210
I'm only concerned
about my mentor.

126
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,130
You're brainwashed.

127
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,250
[TOKOYAMI]
No room. I can't dodge much!

128
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,880
Sorry, Fumikage!

129
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,880
[TOKOYAMI]
The light of the flames

130
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,430
is forcing Dark
Shadow to retreat.

131
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,260
I need to get away quickly and
get Hawks medical attention.

132
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,350
He's still running his mouth.

133
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,180
[DABI] Think about it,
ya barbecued birds.

134
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,440
Who do you think really
needs rescuing.

135
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,070
Because it's not you.

136
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,070
[TOKOYAMI]
Your orders?

137
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,650
[HAWKS] He couldn't
finish me off before.

138
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,530
'Cause he was too busy talking.

139
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,660
He's doing the
same thing again.

140
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,410
But why?

141
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,040
His powers may have
some drawbacks.

142
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,250
So he's throwing us off
guard to stall for time.

143
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,130
The flames he just shot were a
lot weaker than the last ones.

144
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,750
Which means...

145
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,090
He can't fire in rapid
succession anymore.

146
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,060
We go. Now.

147
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,310
[TOKOYAMI]

148
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,810
[DARK SHADOW]
Brace yourself!

149
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,890
No! Too weak.

150
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,940
Hawks! Hey. Are you okay?

151
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,810
[TOKOYAMI]
He's still breathing.

152
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,820
The impact must have
knocked him out.

153
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,650
My apologies.

154
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,200

passage to the underground!

This is good. There's
far less light here.

Try Dark Fallen Angel!

158
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,920
I thought it might
go down this way,

159
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,720
so I saved power by making
my last two shots weaker!

160
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,470
Say goodbye!

gotten out of hand.

319
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,040
They were supposed
to wait for me to wake.

320
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,040
To me, Machia.

321
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,300
Bring the others with you.

322
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,010
[SHIGARAKI]
From this moment on,

323
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,510
I'll destroy everything.

324
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,010

[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

326
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,160
Tomura Shigaraki is out
of suspended animation

327
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,750
and obliterating
everything in sight.

328
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,500
And that's not our only problem.

329
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,580
Gigantomachia is on the move.

330
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,510
Endeavor takes
Shigaraki on alone,

331
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,510
knowing he must be defeated.

332
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,930
With the heroes scattered
and at a disadvantage,

333
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,470
is there any hope for success?

334
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,390
Next time: "Encounter, Part 2."

335
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,640
I know who Shigaraki is after.

336
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,900
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
