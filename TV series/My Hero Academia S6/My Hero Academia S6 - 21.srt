00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,390
[ALL MIGHT] If not for the car,
I would have been a goner!

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,770
This isn't a car jacking.
They're out for blood.

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,690
If that's the case,
their goal must be

4
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,650
trying to separate
me from him.

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,900
Assassins!

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,570
They're after Young Midoriya.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,040
[VILLAIN 134A]
Wait. Is that All Might?

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,380
[VILLAIN 134B]
Don't back down.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,380
This doesn't change our job.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,920
Look at him.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,260
The number-one hero we knew
and feared died a long time ago.

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,550
Huh, yeah. Guess you're right.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,350
Step aside.

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,230
I swear to protect your son.
Even if it costs me my life.

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,190
[ALL MIGHT] That boy has been
carrying a burden far heavier

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,530
than mine, and I gave it to him.

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,910
All Might. No matter what
happens to you from now on,

18
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,410
I'll be there
to help fight fate!

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,380
Yet despite that,
he continues to idolize me.

20
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,760
If the unthinkable ever
happens to that young man,

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,340
it'll be over my dead body.

22
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,530
[IZUKU] I'll zigzag
to avoid the line of fire

23
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,650
and keep her from
guessing my path.

24
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,950
Then get close!

25
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,320
My speeds with One For All
have gotten faster,

26
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,280
and as long as she's
not quicker than me,

27
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,620
I can stay one step ahead

28
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,830
and get the jump on her
before she can react!

29
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,410
I'll make her talk.

30
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,840
She'll tell me where All For One
and Shigaraki are hiding!

31
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,760
[IZUKU]
A bullet! No way!

32
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,340
[IZUKU groans]
How'd that happen?

33
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,590
Without a search-type Quirk,

34
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,930
she shouldn't be able
to sneak up behind me.

35
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,600
Does she have help?

36
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,310
No, I don't sense any
other hostility nearby.

37
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,280
[IZUKU]
Damn it! I see now.

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,740
I should've figured
that was a possibility.

39
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,910
She's All For One's hired gun.

40
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,820
Of course he gave her
extra Quirks!

41
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,040
[ALL FOR ONE] Air Walk.
This power will dramatically

42
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,790
expand the range and
accuracy of your attacks.

43
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,010
[IZUKU] Right. I know she's
trying to capture me alive.

44
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,720
But since I dodged
her first shots,

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,140
she's shortened the
distance between us.

46
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,510
The bullet that hit me
from the back

47
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,220
was fired from my flank
with a crazy curve.

48
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,100
As she gets closer, it's easier
to lock onto my location,

49
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,850
instead of calculating my path.

50
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,610
And as the distance shrinks,

51
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,480
it's harder for the Fourth to
warn about consecutive shots.

52
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,110
In that case--Sixth, full blast!

53
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,330
[LADY NAGANT] Another Quirk?
He has multiples, too.

54
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,290
What secrets are you hiding?

55
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,670
[EN]
Hey, Ninth! Keep it together.

56
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,800
Did you already forget
what I told you before?

57
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,010
It's way too risky to
put out that much smoke!

58
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,430
Listen. Your opponent
is basically a high-speed,

59
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,180
long-range rifle.
You've trapped yourself.

60
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,850
She'll tag you the
second you try to run.

61
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,520
[IZUKU] I'm not going to run.
I just needed to buy some time.

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,230
[EN]
Whoa, wait. You're joking!

63
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,520
Are you doing what
I think you are?

64
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,110
[THIRD WIELDER]
Terrible idea.

65
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,900
I can see what you're
attempting to do right now.

66
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,780
But this plan is beyond
your current abilities.

67
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,620
You said so yourself.

68
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,080
First off, you need to be able
to do two things at once

69
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,620
without concentration.

70
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,460
When you master that,
add something else.

71
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,130
You have no experience
using my Quirk.

72
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,170
Parallel processing
takes practice.

73
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,510
[IZUKU]
It's a little late for that.

74
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,010
If I can get some good
intel out of Lady Nagant,

75
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,600
I can make sure All For One
and Shigaraki are defeated.

76
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,140
I'll learn how to use
your power on the fly.

77
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,140
Third. Fa Jin!

78
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,750
[LADY NAGANT]
A decoy! What's he playing at?

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,580
Cheeky brat!

80
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,750
Hiding in a puff of smoke
is a waste of time.

81
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,420
I'm still going to capture you.

82
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,760
You might be right,
if that was my plan!

83
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,720
[LADY NAGANT]
He's somehow faster than before!

84
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,560
This kid powered up
while he was down there!

85
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,100
[IZUKU] The rain doesn't
affect my smokescreen.

86
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,730
So it was easy to send out
decoys and track Nagant's

87
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,480
movements based on the
timing of her shots.

88
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,030
I didn't know her
exact position,

89
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,030
so I couldn't attack head-on.

90
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,160
But she never expected me
to burst out of a building.

91
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,620
With the help of Fa Jin,
I caught her off guard.

92
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,370
A sniper's skills are
useless at close range!

93
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,210
Give up the fight and start
talking about who hired you!

94
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,340
You think you've won?
Not a chance!

96
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,090
[LADY NAGANT] The safety
commission trained me well.

97
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,260
Why are you helping
a monster like All For One?

98
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,730
He's an evil tyrant hell-bent
on controlling people.

99
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,110
I don't get it.
You used to be a hero!

100
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,400
The just world you've
been sold is a lie.

101
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,650
You've been brainwashed.

102
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,690
You'll never
understand the truth.

103
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,450
[IZUKU] Crap! I had her
there for a second!

104
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,040
The Third was right.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,250
Using multiple Quirks at once is
a whole other difficulty level.

106
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,250
[IZUKU]
From behind?

107
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,550
[LADY NAGANT] I was exhausted.
I'd killed so many.

108
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,300
All to keep our
citizens in the dark.

109
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,850
[LADY NAGANT]
Say some group was plotting

110
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,560
a terrorist attack against pros.

111
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,400
Or a famous hero team worked

112
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,940
with a villainous
organization on the sly.

113
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,440
When someone is capable of
shaking the foundation

114
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,070
of this society,
they can't be tried.

115
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,660
They have to disappear quietly.

116
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,870
That's where the safety
commission comes in.

[gasps]

118
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,790
[LADY NAGANT] Back in the day,
there were vigilante groups

119
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,880
who were seen as heroes.

120
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,920
They earned the trust
of the public,

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,670
and the country approved
of their actions.

122
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,300
That's when our
leaders discovered

123
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,720
that this superhuman
society works best

124
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,140
if people have faith in heroes.

125
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,060
I was a cog in the state-run
machine that upheld that trust.

126
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,850
[FISHMAN VILLAIN 134A] Wait!

[LADY NAGANT]
To maintain the status quo,

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,860
the government needed a
public face and a secret one.

130
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,820
So I obeyed.

Afterwards, they turn them

in to the police and collect
rewards for capturing them.

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,460
You murdered the previous
head of the Safety Commission?

157
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,210
But wait. I read about you!

158
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,630
The media reported that
you killed fellow heroes.

159
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,050
[LADY NAGANT] That's what
the commission told them

160
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,880
to hide their shame.

161
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,800
They wouldn't say I rebelled.

162
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,100
That could expose the
reason I turned on them.

163
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,850
Here's the sad truth.

164
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,980
[LADY NAGANT]
The hero world everyone admires

165
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,400
as a force of good is
nothing but an illusion.

166
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,320
And if things go back
to the way they were?

167
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,990
History will repeat itself.

168
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,740
The citizens will see
the infallible public face,

169
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,790
while someone else gets
crushed by the dirty work.

170
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,500
Bright-eyed hopefuls will be
chewed up and spit out.

171
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,340
All For One's future makes
more sense than that.

172
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,250
[IZUKU]
There!

173
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,630
Fifth! Pinpoint Focus!

174
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,720
[LADY NAGANT]
The hell?

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,140
He's mapping my movements from
the trajectory of the bullets!

176
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,800
I had no idea.

177
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,890
[LADY NAGANT]
He's fast!

178
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,600
But now, little by little,

179
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,890
I think I'm starting
to understand.

180
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,020
Nothing is truly
black and white.

181
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,320
Our society exists
in a gray area,

182
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,730
swirling with anxiety and anger.

183
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,570
[SHIGARAKI]
You cover up the pain you cause.

184
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,330
This world has grown so rotten.

185
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,500
It's infested with maggots.

186
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,290
That's exactly why
I have to keep

187
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,630
reaching my hand out to help!

188
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,380
You're the product
of their indoctrination!

189
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,720
[LADY NAGANT] Even in midair,
he's managing to avoid

190
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,640
major damage to his joints.

191
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,810
He's focused on predicting
and evading my attacks.

192
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,890
Fine, then.

193
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,890
I'll give him more
to think about!

194
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,610
Is that Chisaki?

195
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,570
[LADY NAGANT]
Now I have you!

196
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,880
[CHISAKI]
I've met your target before.

197
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,130
[LADY NAGANT]
Huh?

198
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,250
[CHISAKI] Kid stopped me
from enacting my plan.

199
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,510
He has a bad case
of hero syndrome.

200
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,340
It's like this was fated.

201
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,760
I knew you might come in handy.

202
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,350
I'll bring you along so you can
confirm it's the same boy.

203
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,270
I've got one condition.

204
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,600
[LADY NAGANT]
I don't care about your grudge.

205
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,480
It's not that. I'm not
looking for revenge.

206
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,690
I've lost everything.

207
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,450
There's only one thing
that's left for me to do.

208
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,960
I just want to talk
to the old man.

209
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,670
Pops. I'm sorry.

210
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,300
I really am.

211
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,260
I've already fulfilled
my part of the agreement.

212
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,930
Hurry up and take me
to the boss, damn it!

213
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,600
Is that Chisaki?

214
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,810
[LADY NAGANT] I'm increasing
the velocity of my bullets,

215
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,730
even if I risk
jamming as a result.

216
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,150
I'll make you face the worst
outcome a hero can imagine.

217
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,940
[LADY NAGANT] It doesn't
matter who the person is.

218
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,410
When you can't save somebody,
your conscience is destroyed.

219
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,030
[LADY NAGANT] Give you
too much to think about,

220
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,830
and it'll slow you down.

221
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,370
That's when you're mine!

222
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,840
[IZUKU]
Quirk. Fa Jin!

223
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,630
By repeating a motion
over and over again,

224
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,300
I can temporarily store kinetic
energy to be released later.

225
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,220
While I was being shot at,
I continuously bent

226
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,810
and stretched my legs
to keep from being hit.

227
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,760
Plus!

228
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,560
One For All at 45 percent!

229
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,430
Plus!

230
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,600
Centrifugal force!

231
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,440
There's something everyone
my age has seen.

232
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,030
All Might, the Symbol of Peace,

233
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,530
moving faster than
a speeding bullet!

234
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,580
[IZUKU]
Faux 100 percent!

235
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,660
[LADY NAGANT] Impossible.
He caught up to the bullet?

236
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,080
No, he's even faster!

237
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,580
While I'm over here aiming
the muzzle for another shot,

238
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,670
he's already
shifting directions!

239
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,750
[grunts]

240
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,960
[LADY NAGANT]
This kid.

241
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,680
I'll come for
you later, Chisaki.

242
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,010
[THIRD WIELDER] Earlier, he used
One For All at 45 percent,

243
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,600
cycling through Danger Sense,
Smokescreen, Blackwhip,

244
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,190
Fa Jin, and Float
in rapid succession.

245
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,230
But he couldn't process those
powers fast enough and froze up.

246
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,070
After figuring that out,
he narrowed his scope

247
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,070
to One For All, Blackwhip,
and Fa Jin this time.

248
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,450
[LADY NAGANT]
We're not finished.

249
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,620
[THIRD WIELDER] And, even now,
he still has built up strength

250
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,040
from Fa Jin stored in one leg.

251
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,880
[IZUKU]
Faux 100 percent.

252
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,720
Manchester Smash!

253
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,350
Your barrel's broken!
It's over, Lady Nagant!

254
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,600
[LADY NAGANT]
I don't hesitate.

255
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,480
Once I recognize someone
as the enemy,

256
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,810
whatever happens next plays out
like it was inevitable.

257
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,860
[LADY NAGANT]
When did that start?

258
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,700
Let's use that
right arm of yours

259
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,280
and make this country
a better place.

260
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,660
[LADY NAGANT] When did empty
sentiments start making me sick?

261
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,840
You shot towards Chisaki,
but you didn't aim at him.

262
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,880
And if you really believed
in All For One's future,

263
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,600
your first bullet would've hit
my spine and paralyzed me.

264
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,010
[IZUKU] You've seen the
darkness in this world.

265
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,020
So you know what needs
to be brought into the light.

266
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,110
It's not too late for you
to fight on our side.

267
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:26,110
I know the heart of a hero
still beats inside you.

268
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,450
Nothing is truly
black and white.

269
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,070
Our society exists
in a gray area

270
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,830
swirling with anxiety and anger.

271
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,500
That's exactly why

272
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,080
I have to keep reaching
my hand out to help!

273
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,050
[LADY NAGANT]
Incredible.

274
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,420
Izuku Midoriya.

275
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,890
You are a hero.

276
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,480
[ALL FOR ONE] The heart
is a fickle, unruly beast.

277
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,980
Knowing this fact,
I made a few preparations

278
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,360
in the event of an unfortunate
breach of contract.

279
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,080
[ALL FOR ONE]
Such a pity.

280
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,710
You were used by others
until the very end.

281
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,250
Though perhaps the Quirk you
were blessed with is to blame.

282
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:31,340
What a pathetic life
you've led, dear Lady Nagant.

283
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,470
Nagant, no!

284
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,310
I won't let you die,
you hear me?

285
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,020
Hawks, you're here?

286
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,690
[ENDEAVOR] Deku! All Might
sent word of an assassin!

287
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,570
I'm sorry we're late.
I'm not good in this weather.

288
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,200
What's going on?
Are there other enemies?

289
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,700
[IZUKU] Chisaki's on the roof
of that building over there!

290
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,490
I've got him.

291
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,000
[HAWKS] Endeavor!
My wings can't handle this!

292
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,290
It's too soon for me to fly!

293
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,550
[IZUKU] I'm all out of strength.
I can't pull him up.

294
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,340
Hold on, Hawks!

295
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,720
I can't be sure, but I don't
think she meant to do that.

296
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,810
She got at least one extra
Quirk from All For One.

297
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,520
He probably added
some kind of trap to it.

298
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,480
[HAWKS]
This boy.

299
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,190
My name is Hawks.
I sort of replaced you.

300
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,690
We're in this mess because of
All For One's manipulation.

301
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,860
If you fought against that kid,

302
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,200
then you should
understand that now, too.

303
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,990
It's not too late for you, okay?

304
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,240
You don't have to
throw everything away!

305
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,290
Please tell me you realize that!

306
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,210
Help us create a future
you can be proud of!

307
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,290
Take control of your own life!

308
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,590
You're Lady Nagant,
and you are a hero!

309
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,930
[LADY NAGANT]
My replacement, huh?

310
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,560
They probably made you
do terrible things, too.

311
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,770
For the "greater good."

312
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,730
So how is it you still have
so much hope in your eyes?

313
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:18,200
[LADY NAGANT] In all this chaos,
with no control over the future,

314
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,910
how can you people
keep fighting?

315
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,000
Here's what I know.

316
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:36,720
In two months, at a mansion,
in Haibori Woods--

317
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,520
[LADY NAGANT] I was supposed
to bring the boy there.

318
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,400
[LADY NAGANT]
And it's not just me.

319
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,480
He sent the other hunters
after the target, too.

320
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,610
The same job.

321
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,620
Hey. Replacement.

322
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,910
I fell apart. I just
couldn't take it anymore.

323
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,300
But you? How do you
still keep going?

324
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,880
[HAWKS] Because there was
someone who helped me out.

325
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,680
Also, I'm an optimistic guy.

326
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,810
Oh. Is that so?

327
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,360
[ENDEAVOR]
Deku! Was he the only one?

328
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,610
No. This isn't what
we agreed on.

329
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,110
Why'd you get caught?

330
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,490
You said you were gonna
take me to him!

331
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,410
I need to visit Pops.
He's all I've got left.

332
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,000
I have to see him.

333
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,750
To tell him I'm sorry!

334
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,710
[ERI]
Please. Please don't go.

335
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,840
[IZUKU]
Chisaki.

336
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,510
[CHISAKI]
Not a word, you sick freak!

337
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,720
I was talking to the woman.

338
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,470
You remember Eri, right?
What you did to her?

339
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,890
Eri? Oh, yeah. Yeah, the girl.

340
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,850
If I had her, she could
Rewind the old man.

341
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,770
[IZUKU] You want forgiveness
from somebody?

342
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,610
Apologize to Eri.

343
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,990
And in return, I'll fulfill
Nagant's promise.

344
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,990
You have my word on that front.

345
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,780
How does that sound to you?

346
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,040
Young man! Are you okay?

347
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,040
Yeah. I'm all right.

348
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,550
We've captured Lady Nagant
and Kai Chisaki!

349
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,380
Contact the police.

350
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,670
Nagant needs medical attention.

351
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,430
Midoriya's been roughed up
pretty bad as well.

352
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,180
You, too, by the looks of it.

353
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,610
[IZUKU]
All For One.

354
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,950
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

355
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,910
In order for everyone
to live in peace again,

356
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,540
in order to smile again with
the people I care about,

357
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,420
I need to push
myself even harder.

358
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,470
I have to fully unleash
the power of One For All.

359
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,970
That's what has to happen.
No matter what.

360
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,350
Next time, "Friend."

361
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm fine. Really, I am.
