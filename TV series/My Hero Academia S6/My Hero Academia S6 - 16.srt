to get up! You could die!

[MINETA] Just stop!
You're the worst patient.

even more likely to drop dead.

Why do you have to be so
stubborn about everything, dude?

There's nothing you can

[SERO] I'll tell you, okay,
but you gotta stay calm.

Todoroki's burned bad

11

some serious injuries,

[HAWKS]
I saw heroes every day as a kid.

29

They were always giving
speeches to the cameras.

30
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,950
But they didn't seem real.

31
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,500
More like people
in another reality.

32
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,080
Characters plucked from dreams.

33
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,460
[TAKAMI] Keigo! I know
you snuck into town.

34
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,590
You think I'm stupid?

Boy, if you sold me out...

37
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,270
My wings were all tingly.

38
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,650
I thought maybe something
bad was happening.

39
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,520
But then they
went back to normal.

40
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,360
I came straight home after that.

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,780
No one saw me, I swear.

[TOMIE] Wait, you're not
leaving again, right?

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,870
[TAKAMI] Y'ever think
maybe our crap would work

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,540
if you found us some cash?

49
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,750
[HAWKS] Apparently, my father
once killed someone

50
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,420
over an absurdly
small amount of money.

51

[HAWKS] My mom let him
hide out with her.

52
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,260
Kept him fed and out of sight.

53
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,430
I was born pretty soon after.

54
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,850
[TAKAMI]

Don't turn your

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,980
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,690
[TAKAMI] Shouldn't've relied
on Tomie's useless Quirk.

59
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,700
No, the real problem
is Tomie got knocked up.

60
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,450
If that brat had
never been born,

61
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,040
I'd still be free, goddamn it.

62
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
[TOMIE]
Please just come back.

63
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,130
[HAWKS] My mother and father
were broken souls.

64
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,800
But I endured them.

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,630
Hoping I wouldn't
turn out the same way.

66
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,260
I figured if I kept my
head down, when I grew up,

67
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,850
I'd be free.

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,730
[TOMIE]
Baby. Your father got caught.

69
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,650
Huh?

70
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,940
[TOMIE]
What should we do, Keigo?

71
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,030
He stole a car to get
away, but it was slow,

72
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,410
and he got himself
arrested by Endeavor.

73
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,580
The fire guy?

74
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,130
[HAWKS] In that instant,
fiction became reality.

75
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,470
[HAWKS] A hero, someone
I had only seen on TV...

76
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,300
...was real. Part of my life.

77
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,100
They'll come.
We can't stay here.

78
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,930
They'll take us, too.

79
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,480
[HAWKS]
Paranoia took my mother.

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,560
She feared she'd be punished
for harboring my father,

81
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,150
so she took my hand and we
left the only home I knew.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,740
Unfortunately, my mother was

83
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,570
completely unequipped
for survival.

84
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,990
The police. They'll help.

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,750

we did things right.

86
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,040
Keigo. Do what you have to,

87
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,330
just get us money.
You're your daddy's son.

88
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,420
If you can't do this, I don't
know why you were born.

89
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,220
What's the point of all those
damn feathers, huh? Go!

90
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,060
[HAWKS] If I used
Fierce Wings, it'd be easy

91
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,810
to steal wallets
and purses. But...

92
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,190
I couldn't.

When I gave up the Takami name,

That was fine by me,

As relieved as
I can be right now.

The safety commission
is essentially out of business.

And as a result, nobody's around
to tell me what to do.

Nomu actually exist.

rumors, like I told Endeavor.

Ever since one appeared

Still, the stories

Looking back, it's easy

310
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,190
how many of us will remain?

311
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,070
[HAWKS]
The anger.

312
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,910
The blame for every
tragedy and setback

313
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,490
was directed at a single,
shattered man.

314
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,750
[DOCTOR 129A] Shoto and the
others will recover eventually.

315
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,750
And somehow you also
managed to evade death.

316
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,760
Endeavor. Please know
I'm rooting for you.

317
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,860
[ENDEAVOR]
I can breathe on my own.

318
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,360
But my head feels foggy.

319
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,740
The anesthesia hasn't
worn off completely.

320
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,910
[ENDEAVOR]
I'm still alive.

321
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,960
Come and dance with me
in hell, won't you?

322
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,470
[ENDEAVOR]
This must've been Toya's plan.

323
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,680
He knew that I would
survive the fight.

324
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,390
[TODOROKI]
Snap out of it!

325
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,020
Please! We'll deal
with this later!

326
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
[ENDEAVOR]
I couldn't move.

327
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,190
[ENDEAVOR]
It was just like before.

328
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,820
My child was going
to die in front of me.

329
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,280
And I...

330
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,240
[ENDEAVOR]
I froze.

331
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,160
[ENDEAVOR] Jeanist showed
that Dabi was wrong

332
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,340
about some things, but the
truth about me is undeniable.

333
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,710
[DABI] See, apparently,
I was a failure to my father.

334
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Before long, he gave up on me.
And then, I was cast aside.

335
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,220
[ENDEAVOR]
Everything I did in the past

336
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,770
has come back to
haunt me and others.

337
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,900
Even if I survived the fight...

338
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:40,200
[ENDEAVOR] ...the hero I was,
Endeavor, is dead.

339
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,660
I can't fight my own son.

340
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,950
[TODOROKI]
Uh.

341
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,960
Shoto!

342
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,380
Hi, there, Dad!
I'm glad you're up.

343
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,220
Now we can all check in
on each other.

344
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,680
[ENDEAVOR coughs]
Are you all okay?

345
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,430
Are you crying?
What the hell, Dad?

346
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,310
Sorry. For everything. Really.

347
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,320
I failed! And it's too late.

348
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,240
My regret, and my guilt, too.

349
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,410
Everything.

350
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,830
My heart is breaking.

351
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,590
[REI]
What's this about your heart?

352
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,880
Regret and guilt I understand.

353
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,010
In fact, we've felt it
much more than you have.

354
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,550
Rei? What are you doing here?

355
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,020
I came to talk to you.
About our family.

356
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,480
[REI]
And... about Toya.

357
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,450
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

358
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,200
The Todoroki family has gathered
in Endeavor's hospital room

359
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,910
to talk about Toya

360
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,540
and every terrible thing
that happened to him.

361
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,250
For Toya, this is a history
of hope and despair

362
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,000
that are intertwined.

363
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,380
For the rest of his family,
it's a story of how

364
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,970
a household was torn apart.

365
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,010
Next time,

366
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,180
"The Wrong Way
to Put Out a Fire."

367
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,850
Perhaps this is also the tale
of a family finding new life.

368
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,890
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
