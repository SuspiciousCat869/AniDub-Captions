1
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,680
This is an aerial
view of Jaku City

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,550
and what a nightmare.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,310
I'm estimating
a third of the city

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,770
has been completely leveled.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,230
Heroes and rescue teams

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,690
are evacuating citizens,
but look at the current state

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,610
of the streets!
It's chaos down there!

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,360
Dust clouds are
obscuring the extent

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,830
of the damage here,
but the scene calls to mind

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,870
the disaster in Deika City.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,160
What terrible force are
the heroes fighting against?

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,340
Hosu City, Camino Ward,
and now this in Jaku.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,170
There seems to be no end to
the massive terrorist attacks

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,340
that began last year.

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,170
And despite the army
of police officers

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,430
and pros on the ground,
no information whatsoever

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,640
has been released to the press.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,850
It begs the question:
did authorities know

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,850
about this catastrophe
before it happened?

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,560
Whatever the case, there's no
doubt that the destruction

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,270
we're witnessing today is worse

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,860
than any incident
in recent history.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,070
You have to wonder

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,780
what exactly is going on
in Japan right now.

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,400
Is this the new normal?

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,990
The dangerous future
we're heading towards?

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,840
[GRAN TORINO] It appears that
the many Quirks All For One

28
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,220
collected over the years were
transplanted into Shigaraki.

29
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,590
That's what Present Mic
said, anyway.

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,810
Still, right now,
he's just one person.

31
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,770
If we can't stop him,
then what's the point

32
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,690
of there being so many
heroes in this world?

33
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,570
[gasps] Are those--?

34
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,900
[growls]

35
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,910
[IZUKU gasps]
No!

36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,160
[KATSUKI]
Where did they come from?

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,910
The whole lab should've
crumbled to dust

38
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,200
in that Decay wave!

39
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,920
So how are there Nomu here?

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,170
Jetburn!

41
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,180
[ENDEAVOR grunts]

42
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,390
[SHIGARAKI chuckles]

43
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,600
[LOCKLOCK]
Come on, Endeavor!

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,850
Shigaraki must be stopped.

45
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,360
Sneaky.

46
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,600
[ENDEAVOR]
Hell Spider!

47
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,870
[SHIGARAKI]
Ouch. That stung.

48
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,450
Hey, Number One.

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,540
Is this the arm
you held up that day?

50
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,380
Probably should've checked
before I beat you.

51
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,840
[ENDEAVOR]
Get off!

52
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,300
Where did these
new Nomu come from?

53
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,940
It's simple, I have full
control over Decay now.

54
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,440
I wanted to keep the capsules
from getting destroyed

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,150
during that first wave, but I
just couldn't save them all.

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,940
[SHIGARAKI] They won't wake up
and freak out suddenly?

57
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,620
[DOCTOR]
Hm? Of course not.

58
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,820
They're activated
by electricity.

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,950
When I tap on this little
device, it triggers the current.

60
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,660
Once awake, they'll
follow the orders

61
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,330
of whoever's designated
as their master.

62
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,670
[DOCTOR]
I'd say they're servants

63
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,000
fit for the king of villains.

64
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,260
As I'd expect from
my friend's disciple.

65
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,050
He was careful to keep
the High Ends alive!

66
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,300
[PRESENT MIC]
High Ends?

67
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,510
[DOCTOR] Then he used
Radio Waves to generate

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,890
the current needed
to open their eyes!

69
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,720
How clever.

70
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,310
Unfortunately, this batch
hasn't been through testing yet.

71
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,310
The poor soldiers can't
think on their own.

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,440
That said, they're
still far stronger

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,440
than the upper-tier Nomu.

74
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,660
For the time being,

75
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,240
I suppose we could call
them "Near High Ends"!

76
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Not good!

77
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,620
They're heading for
Eraser Head now!

78
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,990
You two keep yourselves hidden!

79
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,920
[GRAN TORINO]
I can't imagine a worse scenario

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,050
than him stealing One For All.

81
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,550
Who could defeat him then?

82
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,670
What's worse?

83
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,060
Jetburn!

84
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,890
You know, if your
eyes are on me...

85
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,480
[SHIGARAKI] ...then you should
assume I can see you as well.

86
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,660
[SHIGARAKI] Eraser Head,
you're standing in my way.

87
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,080
You won't touch him!

88
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,960
[AIZAWA]
No. I will not let you kill me.

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,000
If I die here and your Quirks
return, you'll be unstoppable!

90
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,760
There are still people
I have to keep watch over.

91
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,680
Until the day they graduate
and become heroes!

92
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,770
[AIZAWA]
You think I'm a problem?

93
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,480
[AIZAWA]
Look around.

94
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,100
You're the one who's
standing in the way.

95
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,900
[GRAN TORINO]
Too slow. I won't make it!

96
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,500
[IZUKU]
Mr. Aizawa! It's okay!

97
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,750
No, kid!

98
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,710
If Shigaraki can't
use his powers,

99
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,960
then let us join
the fight against him!

100
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,470
Who could defeat him then?

101
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,220
[IZUKU] Most of the pros
are fighting the Nomu

102
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,800
that just showed up.

103
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,920
There aren't enough heroes
left to stop him.

104
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,310
If Erasure fails and Shigaraki
uses Decay again, we're doomed.

105
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,810
The worst thing would
be losing Mr. Aizawa!

106
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,990
I'm so sorry, Midoriya.

107
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,370
With your power, there's no
way you can become a hero.

108
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,040
[IZUKU] He's protected his
students this whole time!

109
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,610
We can't lose him after
everything he's done!

110
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,410
Or what are we even doing?

111
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,380
Midoriya, I...

112
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,840
It's our turn...

113
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,000
...to return the favor!

114
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,680
How's this for rational, Teach?

115
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,300
A.P. Machine Gun!

116
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,510
[SHIGARAKI] Heh! Aren't those
fireworks adorable?

118
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,610
I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid you're just

119
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,730
not interesting to me anymore.

120
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,150
[ENDEAVOR growls]

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,410
Endeavor, sir!

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,700
Where is Shoto?

123
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,160
[IZUKU]
Outside the zone.

124
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,290
Huh. I was awfully close
to my goal there for a second.

125
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,920
I need you to
protect him for me.

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,250
Yeah, we got it!

127
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,340
He's not getting hurt
on our watch, don't worry.

128
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,090
[GRAN TORINO]
Shigaraki's physical abilities

129
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,920
have become extraordinary.

130
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,930
Uh-huh.

131
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,220
His power and endurance

132
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,180
are comparable
to All Might's now.

133
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,680
Really? But how?

134
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,980
As long as I don't blink,
that physical strength

135
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,400
is his only advantage.

136
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,820
I'll keep my eyes open
as long as I can.

137

Deku. Bakugo.

138
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,660
There's nothing we can do
about you two being here.

139
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,200
I won't ask why you came.

140
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,030
But we need to support Eraser!

141
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,460
Bakugo, you cover Deku!

142
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,320
[SHIGARAKI] It might be
best to grab Midoriya

143
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,040
and get out of here.

144
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,460
[SHIGARAKI grunts]

You must take his ability.

Come to me. Dear little brother.

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
That wasn't me talking.

[SHIGARAKI]
Your ego is too big, Master.

153
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,950
This is my power.

My body.

155
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,570
I won't let a voice in my head

156
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,250
turn me into some
kind of puppet.

157
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,040
There's something
I've been wondering.

158
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,500
How could a person
called the "Lord of Evil"

159
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,750
be brought to his knees
by a single man?

160

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,650
[MIDNIGHT gasps]

315
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,120
[MR. COMPRESS]
Here! A gift!

316
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,870
[MIDNIGHT]
The League's on his back?

317
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
[MIDNIGHT]

318
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,540
[MIDNIGHT]
Damn it!

319
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,370
[MIDNIGHT grunts]

320
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,920
[MR. COMPRESS]
Don't underestimate the heroes!

321
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,600
[MIDNIGHT]
Whose Quirk can stop that beast?

322
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,230
[MIDNIGHT]
Majestic? No. S'too big for him.

323
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,150
He'd end up trampled.

324
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,540
We failed. We weren't enough.

325
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,250
Wait, so Mt. Lady got
thrown outta the way?

326
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,750
[SHOJI]
Yes. And I saw blue flames.

327
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,120
[MIDNIGHT]
Creaty? Can you hear me?

328
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,290
[YAOYOROZU]
Ms. Midnight?

329
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,840
Oh, good, she'll
tell us what to do.

330
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,300
[MIDNIGHT] You know
what's coming, don't you?

331
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,010
Yes. Jiro heard it first
and Shoji has visuals.

332
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:01,140
No one in our ranks can
stop that thing with force.

333
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,560
We need you.

334
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,600
[gasps]

335
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,070
[MIDNIGHT]
I know I shouldn't ask,

336
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,860
but given the circumstances,

337
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,690
you must sedate him.

338
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,320
[YAOYOROZU] But that--
What are you saying, ma'am?

339
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,740
[MIDNIGHT]
Make tranquilizers for the pros.

340
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,410
And then get out of there. Fast.

341
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,910
If you can't do that,
then run, right now.

342
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,670
[MIDNIGHT] Our Creaty will grow
into a top-class leader one day.

343
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,340
[MIDNIGHT]
It's up to you, be strong!

344
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,720
What's going on?

345
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,180
Ms. Midnight, are
you still there?

346
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,430
I'm confused.
What does she want?

347
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,640
Sounds like Yao-momo's
in charge now.

348
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,520
[MINETA] If she wants
to put him to sleep,

349
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,980
why doesn't she
just do it herself?

350
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,440
Yeah, I mean, is she okay?

351
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,410
[YAOYOROZU] Make a sedative
and give it to the pro heroes?

352
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,740
But they've already left
to help the advance guard.

353
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,990
So, should we flee?
She said to run in either case.

354
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,370
[MIDNIGHT]
I know I shouldn't ask,

355
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,130
but given the circumstances...

356
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,760
[YAOYOROZU] She must be hurt.
I could hear it in her voice.

357
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,880
But she didn't
ask us to help her.

358
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,380
That's how strong the enemy is.

359
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,600
Oh, Ms. Midnight, what do I do?

360
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,810
[ASHIDO gasps]
We can't just stand here!

361
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,310
[KIRISHIMA] Are we running away
with our tail between our legs?

362
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,940
[SATO] No way! Without
putting up a fight?

363
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,900
[KAMINARI]
Leaving a teacher behind?

364
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,200
Right. Earphone Jack
and Tentacole!

365
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Use sound to track his
approach and calculate

366
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,030
how long it'll take
him to get here!

367
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,540
Get a rough estimate
of his size, too.

368
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,620
Mudman, please lend us
your strength, as well!

369
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,330
Everyone, be prepared to move!

370
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,710
Crap, even I can see
that thing now!

371
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,960
He's so fast.

372
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,290
He'll be here in
less than a minute.

373
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,010
[JIRO gasps]
No, something changed!

374
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,380
He's slowed down a little.

375
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,930
[MT. LADY grunting]

376
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,390
You'll pay for this!

377
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,560
I haven't clung to a guy
since I was in middle school.

378
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,930
[SHOJI] He's approximately
25 meters tall!

379
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,440
Bigger than Mt. Lady!

380
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,860
It's been a year since
we enrolled at UA High.

381
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,690
And in that brief period,
our teachers taught us

382
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,660
that a real hero
never turns their back

383
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,160
or runs from an enemy.

384
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,530
Yeah, you got that right!

385
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
Uh-huh!

386
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,120
Couldn't've said it
better myself.

387
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,870
So what now?

388
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,260
It's my choice.
And I will fight.

389
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,210
As for you all--

390
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,500
No way. Don't even.

391
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,430
When we suit up and
we're outside the school,

392
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,010
we're all heroes!

393
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,260
All right, very well.

394
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,060
[YAOYOROZU]
Together. As one.

395
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,110
We'll take down this villain.

396
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

397
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,210
The perimeter around the
villa has been broken.

398
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,250
And the only ones left
to face the walking calamity

399
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,420
are UA students.

400
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,590
With few options, Class A
and Class B work together

401
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,880
in a desperate operation
to stop Gigantomachia.

402
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,600
Next time: "League of Villains
vs. UA Students."

403
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,730
Those haunted by past fears must
overcome them with chivalry!

404
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,060
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
