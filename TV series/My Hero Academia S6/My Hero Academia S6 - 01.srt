00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,760
[IZUKU]
This is a superhuman society,

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,600
where about 80 percent
of people are born

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,310
with an uncanny ability
known as a Quirk.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,100
Not everyone uses their
powers for good, though.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,650
Which is why the world
needed a new profession:

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,860
the hero.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,740
[IZUKU] My name is Izuku
Midoriya and I inherited

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,740
a secret Quirk called
"One For All" from All Might.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,330
That's how I was enrolled
in the hero course at UA.

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,500
After a series of incidents
that put us up against

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,920
the worst of the worst,
my incredible classmates and I

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,460
got our provisional
hero licenses.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,550
We had our hands full

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,470
at the end of our
first year at UA.

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,380
Which is why we didn't realize
the evil quietly growing

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,680
in the shadows until
it was too strong to ignore.

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,980
[YOTSUBASHI] Welcome,
and thank you for coming.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,980
Liberation warriors!

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,320
I am Re-Destro. It is
a pleasure to see you.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,780
From this moment,
the Liberation Army

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,450
recognizes Tomura Shigaraki
as grand commander.

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,040
Now, the name please,
Tomura Shigaraki!

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,630
[SHIGARAKI] "The Paranormal
Liberation Front"!

24
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,590
We got rid of the term
"villain" and expanded on

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,010
the whole meta angle
to be a little more inclusive.

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,090
The nine people on stage
are my lieutenants.

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,470
Teams will be assigned
to them based on our needs.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,980
Anyway, the name's
the same as this hand,

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,600
a decoration.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,900
We'll do what we want.

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,230
[LIBERATION ARMY cheers]

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,400
[HAWKS]
I'm too late!

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,280
This superhuman society may be
overflowing with heroes,

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,530
but Shigaraki has
gathered so much power

35
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,790
that it might be
impossible to stop him.

36
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,700
Come on, Hawks.

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,000
If you're too slow,
it'll be the end of Japan.

38
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,760
[DOCTOR] Your Quirk blossomed
in the Deika City fight.

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,800
Now, you can obliterate
not only something you touch,

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,640
but also whatever
is connected to it.

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,390
You have become the
embodiment of destruction.

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,480
I won't underestimate
heroes anymore.

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,310
I'll use all the power I can get

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,360
to destroy All Might
and his legacy.

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,480
Our next fight's his last.

46
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,070
[IZUKU]
A decisive battle is upon us.

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,950
An all-out war
between the villains

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,000
of the Paranormal Liberation
Front and the heroes

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,040
sworn to protect this world,
is about to begin.

50
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,230
[HAWKS]
It's been a week since I passed

51
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,440
the safety commission my hint.

52
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,730
The word "Hospital."

53
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,270
[TWICE]
Hey! Hawks!

54
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,190
Hey there, Twice. 'Sup?

55
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,110
[TWICE]
I need some help, pronto!

56
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,450
Crap. You've got
Carmine guys with you?

57
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,410
Uh, could we...

58
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,490
Excuse me for a moment.

59
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,250
Start talking.

60
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,040
[TWICE] I gotta come up with
something to use as a credo.

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,880
Why do you need my help?

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,630
[TWICE] Spinner and Compress
are in meetings

63
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,090
with Re-Destro all day.

64
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,500
Talk, talk, talk.

65
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,300
Giran and Dabi
couldn't care less.

66
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,630
And Toga's too cute to ask.

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,060
Please, Sensei.
Help a confused man out.

68
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,260
Sanctum just said,

69
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,730
"There are still troops
who don't trust us.

70
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,390
Even if you're
just a figurehead,

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,980
they should hear some credo
or mission statement from you,

72
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,900
and it better be inspiring."

73
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,770
And the only thing
I could think was,

74
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,570
"Uh, I gotta take a dump!"

75
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,820
And that's when I
ran out here to find you.

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,990
[laughs] You actually said
that to ol' Sanctum?

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,790
That dude is one of the founding
members of the Liberation Army.

78
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,040
[HAWKS]
The Paranormal Liberation Front

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
has been split into regiments.

80
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,920
These groups specialize in
different areas and are led

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,420
by members of the
League of Villains

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,880
and high-ranking brass
from the old MLA.

83
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,010
The three strongest
members of each regiment

84
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,340
serve as aides
to the lieutenants.

85
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,640
All but one of the aides
previously headed bases

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,600
across the country.

87
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,180
Their duties
kept them elsewhere,

88
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,560
so they didn't participate in
the revival party in Deika City.

89
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,320
Still, their abilities surpass
those of the average hero.

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,780
Lemme think a second.

91
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,570
[HAWKS]
If they move first, we'll lose.

92
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,820
I've been under strict
surveillance since I came here.

93
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,660
The only way I've been
able to get a clear idea

94
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,040
of the organization's
structure is because of

95
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,000
the intelligence skills
the safety commission

96
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,210
drilled into me
when I was a kid.

97
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,290
One thing is obvious.

98
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,670
There's hostility and resentment
toward the current system.

99
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,510
[HAWKS]
I think I got somethin'.

100
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,760
"The freedom of an
individual reigns supreme

101
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,810
and the existing status quo
must be destroyed."

102
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,850
A little wordy, but I
think it would work.

103
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,680
[TWICE]
Perfect!

104
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,020
[HAWKS]
Oh, yeah.

105
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,350
And "We must be completely
devoted to Re-Destro."

106
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,770
[TWICE]
Huh?

107
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
I mean, it's because of
his bloodline that we were able

108
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,150
to band together
in the first place.

109
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,070
[TWICE]
Uh, maybe we could add that.

110
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,030
I'll think about it.

111
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,950
We should totally
talk that guy up!

112
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,160
Good call! Thanks for your help!

113
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,700
[HAWKS]
Anytime, friend!

114
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,960
[HAWKS]
The future looks dire.

115
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,500
What they're really
trying to accomplish

116
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,080
by breaking the status quo,

117
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,710
is the annihilation of
every hero in existence.

118
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,630
[HAWKS] They'll attack major
cities across the country.

119
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,180
Citizens will be left
without leaders.

120
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,140
Chaos will ensue.

121
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,850
Then, Re-Destro and the
Hearts and Mind Party

122
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,640
will swoop in.

123
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,690
They'll hand out weapons
and encourage self-defense.

124
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,360
It'll be like when
Quirks first appeared

125
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,520
and laws became meaningless.

126
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,110
Shigaraki will ascend
a throne of rubble

127
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,910
and rule a world of anarchy.

128
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,040
Which really means, the second
coming of All For One.

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,500
The end of Japan as we know it.

130
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,250
[TWICE]
Hey. You know, you're the best.

131
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,840
Especially to me.
Glad I got such a nice pal.

132
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,130
Right back atcha.

133
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,930
[HAWKS] All of this came
into focus thanks to you,

134
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,050
Jin Bubaigawara.

135
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,890
When I heard you'd
overcome your trauma,

136
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,140
I feared what you might do.

137
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,850
You went from being
a petty criminal

138
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,770
to a one-man army.

139
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,230
The person we needed
to keep the closest eye on.

140
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,990
But I also knew that
you were friendly guy.

141
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,110
[TWICE] You sure know a ton
about the Liberation Army

142
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,740
for being a pro hero.
Why is that?

143
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,240
Because I believe in
what they preach.

144
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,870
The world I once dreamed of
turned out to be a birdcage

145
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,960
that kept me prisoner.

146
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,580
I wanna fly free.

147
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,000
But I can't do that
as things are now.

148
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,840
[TWICE]
Ah, jeez, man!

149
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,630
We gotta get ya
in front a' Shigaraki

150
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,470
so he knows you're legit!

151
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,720
[HAWKS]
Seriously.

152
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,510
Kinda weird I haven't
gotten to talk to him.

153
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
[TWICE] That's because
he's off getting stronger.

154
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,480
He'll be in the mountains
near Kyoto for four months.

155
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,850
Whoops, that's a secret.

156
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,560
Though I'm sure that
long-haired spy heard me.

157
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,270
Ya big creep!

158
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,320
Anyway, I don't think
it matters if you know

159
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,570
since you're working
so hard for us.

160
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,700
We're a lot alike.

161
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,160
The best people are those
who help their friends.

162
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,580
Don't you agree?
Yeah, I thought so.

163
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,370
[TWICE] Let's fly
where we want together!

164
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,000
[HAWKS] I was right.
Friendly and far too trusting.

165
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,680
[DOCTOR humming]

166
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,310
You sure seem happy, Doctor.
Good morning!

167
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,230
[DOCTOR laughs]
And to you!

168
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,730
[IZUKU]
Kyudai Garaki.

169
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,900
Quirkless.

170
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,020
The founder of
Jaku General Hospital

171
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,400
and its current
chairman of the board.

172
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,700
He championed the idea
of Quirk-based community

173
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,280
medical care and started
doing philanthropic work

174
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,830
soon after opening the hospital.

175
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,200
That meant building
orphanages and nursing homes

176
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,620
throughout the country,
as well as partnering with

177
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,920
private hospitals and clinics.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,790
On the surface,
the doctor comes across

179
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,250
as a kind man.

180
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,130
He's respected and even admired.

181
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,050
[LOCKLOCK]
So this is the monster.

182
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,510
A true villain.

183
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,720
All For One's
most trusted agent.

184
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,470
Right. And he's
the mad scientist

185
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,140
who bioengineered
those Nomu abominations.

186
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,890
How are you so certain
he's the one to blame?

187
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,020
I sent someone in
undercover after receiving

188
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,360
intel from the
safety commission.

189
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,070
He found a restricted area
within the hospital.

190
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,740
None of the staff
knew its purpose.

191
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,160
[TSUKAUCHI] This off-limits
area has one entrance:

192
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,490
through the morgue.

193
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,250
Garaki is the only person
who ever comes and goes.

194
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,370
If you need more evidence...

195
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,500
This picture's from
our man inside.

196
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,670
Is that a tiny Nomu?

197
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,550
It would be easy
to arrest the doctor

198
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,340
since he's a public figure.

199
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,260
But if we act rashly, the
Paranormal Liberation Front

200
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,800
will enact countermeasures.

201
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,600
The last thing
we want is a repeat

202
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,020
of the widespread devastation
in Hosu or Camino.

203
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,730
Those events traumatized
the public and we lost

204
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,310
too many good people
on our side.

205
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,440
Sure, we were able
to apprehend All For One.

206
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,610
But it was at the cost
of our number one.

207
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,450
All Might was forced to retire.

208
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,660
Therefore, we'll
face this situation

209
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,200
with every available
resource at our disposal.

210
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,290
First,

211
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,710
the pros will be split
into two groups.

212
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,580
Team Endeavor will be
in charge of securing

213
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,170
Kyudai Garaki at Jaku Hospital.

214
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,590
Team Edge Shot will storm
the Gunga Mountain Villa

215
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,090
we believe to be the Paranormal
Liberation Front's hideout.

216
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,140
These two events
will happen simultaneously.

217
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,640
In addition, hero course
students will be deployed

218
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,140
as logistical support
for both teams.

219
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,520
They'll assist with civilian
evacuation and rescue

220
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,070
if the encounters
start to escalate.

221
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,730
We expect substantial resistance

222
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,150
from the villains,
their supporters, and the Nomu,

223
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,200
but we cannot wait any longer.

224
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,120
If we don't act now,
they will prevail.

225
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,160
The doctor, his pets,
Shigaraki--

226
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,500
every villain must fall.

227
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,370
Heroes, the idea is to take out

228
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,960
the entire Paranormal
Liberation Front in one sweep.

229
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,550
[EDGE SHOT] Our intel states
that the lieutenants

230
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,390
have gathered for
a routine meeting.

231
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,680
Every one of them should
be inside this mansion.

232
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,520
Our enemy has someone
with a warping power,

233
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,820
but apparently that creature
is at the hospital.

234
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,570
As long as he's kept
out of the equation,

235
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,070
these foes will have
nowhere to run.

236
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,990
[KOMORI] Um. Is it a good idea
for us to be this close?

237
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,530
[HONENUKI]
What's wrong?

238

Doesn't the League of Villains
have it out for UA students?

239

too big of a problem.

[MIDNIGHT] Now that they've
amassed so much raw power,

242
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,300
Shigaraki will move
to dominate society.

243
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,140
That means the entire world is
in danger, not just the school.

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,760
[MIDNIGHT]
Don't you worry.

245

We just want you
to help us a little

at the very beginning
of the raid.

247
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,940
After that, you'll
go to the rear.

Why would they put me on the
front lines of this smackdown?

Aw, I should be
back with the others!

I never knew I could miss
my stupid classmates so much!

We have no idea what
this army is capable of.

as many of our opponents

314
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,830
Tomura Shigaraki
will be complete

315
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,920
in a little over a month.
Ooh, I can hardly wait.

316
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,210
[ENDEAVOR]
Stop right there.

317
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
You're the creator of the Nomu.

318
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,880
And All For One's
right-hand man. Aren't you?

319
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,470
[gasping]

320
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,800
[ENDEAVOR]
You're the Devil's pawn.

321
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,100
And you will face justice.

322
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,320
[NATSUO]
Wait. Dad called?

323
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,320
[FUYUMI] Yeah. He said
there's a big work thing,

324
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,280
so we may not hear
from him for a bit.

325
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,950
Wow. I never imagined he'd think

326
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,410
to keep us in
the loop like that.

327
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,880
I hope this job doesn't
turn out like Kyushu did.

328
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,260
[ENDEAVOR]
Stop right there.

329
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,310
You're the creator of the Nomu.

330
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,270
And All For One's
right-hand man. Aren't you?

331
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,600
You're the Devil's pawn.

332
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,770
Impossible. How?

333
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,190
[ENDEAVOR]
And you will face justice.

334
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,900
[DOCTOR gasps]

335
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,870
[ENDEAVOR]
As expected.

336
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,040
His profile in the
official registry is wrong.

337
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,500
The instant you used Erasure
on this madman, he aged.

338
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,000
He has a Quirk.

339
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,840
That could answer
a big question.

340
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,760
How All For One has been
alive such a long time.

341
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,680
Super Regeneration
is also something

342
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,850
the more powerful Nomu have.

343
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,220
Not a common Quirk
by any measure.

344
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,930
Did you reproduce
an existing power,

345
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,900
or create it artificially?

346
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,480
Whatever the case,

347
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,730
All For One benefits from
the ability now, doesn't he?

348
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,240
[PRESENT MIC]
Impressive. Regeneration.

349
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,120
A Quirk that can heal.

350
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,950
Used correctly,
it becomes a cheat code

351
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,290
that lets you escape death.

352
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,950
So, why?!

353
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,000
Why are you using it
for evil, Doctor?

354
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,840
You could be saving countless
lives with that power!

355
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,630
But you've hurt so many.

356
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,760
Tell me what the hell
you did to my friend!

357
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,760
[NURSE 114AA]
Let him go.

358
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,180
Are you trying to hurt him?

359
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,810
[NURSE 114C] Why are you
heroes attacking the doctor?

360
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,560
Step away from the man.

361
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,520
[TSUKAUCHI] You have
to leave. It's dangerous.

362
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,520
[NURSE 114AA]
Explain this.

363
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,850
[NURSE 114C]
What's going on?

364
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,850
[TSUKAUCHI] Sorry. We'll
have to fill you in later.

365
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,730
While you decay before us,

366
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,320
our comrades are evacuating
everybody in the hospital.

367
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,410
We're more than prepared
to fight the Nomu here.

368
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,120
Although, it would be beneficial

369
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,870
to all parties if blood
was not spilled in these halls.

370
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,250
You've programmed those
creatures so they don't act

371
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,630
unless they receive instructions
from a specified individual.

372
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,260
Without commands,
they're nothing but corpses.

373
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,300
We figured that much out

374
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,850
by analyzing the
Nomu we've captured.

375
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,220
[SHIRAKUMO] I been thinkin',
when we graduate,

376
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,180
we should start a hero agency!

377
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,390
[AIZAWA]
Those you've toyed with,

378
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,110
and those who cared for them.

379
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,320
Do you know what they all say?

380
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,280
It's our turn to take
something away from you.

381
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,290
[OPERATOR 114A] Team Endeavor
has entered Jaku Hospital.

382
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,870
Garaki is in custody thanks
to Eraser Head's Quirk.

383
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,370
[OPERATOR 114AA]
Ninety-seven percent of patients

384
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,290
have been evacuated.

385
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,960
[OPERATOR 114B] Team Edge Shot
is closing in on the main base.

386
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,960
So far, there's no evidence
of enemy defenses.

387
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,380
[OPERATOR 114A] Update!
Mirko's found the secret area

388
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,510
in the morgue at Jaku Hospital.

389
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,390
Mercy. I'm begging you
to forgive me.

390
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,940
[gasps] Hey, ya there, Endeavor?

391
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,440
No, please.

392
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,570
[MIRKO]
We got company.

393
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,730
[gasps]

394
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,160
[DOCTOR laughs]
It seems Erasure doesn't destroy

395
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,580
a body created using
Double. Fascinating.

396
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,880
Were you really not
clever enough to guess

397
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,880
that I would employ
such an ability?

398
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,340
What fools you heroes are.

399
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,470
[ENDEAVOR]
Twice's Quirk? He was a copy.

400
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,970
[NOMU 114A growls]

401
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,270
You will burn!

402
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,280
[DOCTOR laughs] I suppose
they couldn't have known

403
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,080
that I've been so consumed
with my masterpiece,

404
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,620
Tomura Shigaraki,

405
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,500
that I left everything else in
the capable hands of my double.

406
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,340
Still. That ruse only
bought me a little time.

407
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,760
And I can't just walk away
from this hospital.

408
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,340
Do they have any idea
how much equipment and time

409
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,550
is needed to copy or
cultivate one simple Quirk?

410
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,100
Of course not.

411
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,430
I've spent incalculable hours
stockpiling these abilities.

412
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,310
I will not leave them behind.

413
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,770
My world is in this facility.
My entire life's work.

414
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,860
[DOCTOR] The blood and sweat
and fruitful days

415
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,110
I shared with All For One.

416
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,870
Every memory!

417
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,620
[NOMU growling, snarling]

418
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
Oh, this'll be fun!

419
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,210
[DOCTOR]
Playtime's over, Lil Johnny.

420
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,300
You must warp me and
Shigaraki out immediately!

421
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,100
[gasps]

422
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,310
[screams]

423
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,770
[MIRKO]
What's up, Doc?

424
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,020
I'm guessing you're
the real one.

425
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,910
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

426
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,490
The massive raid
has finally begun.

427
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,660
While Endeavor's team
is up top fighting the Nomu,

428
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,790
Mirko, the number-five hero,
runs into her own problems

429
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,300
as she chases Doctor Garaki

430
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,090
through the hospital's
underground facilities.

431
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,260
And she has no idea
what awaits her.

432
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,680
Next time, "Mirko,
the Number Five Hero."

433
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,520
Do your best, pros.
We're here to support you!

434
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,270
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
