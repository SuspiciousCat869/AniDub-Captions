1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,760
[TOKOYAMI]
My mentor, Hawks.

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,180
Quirk: Fierce Wings.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,350
Oversized wings let him
take flight with ease,

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,900
and he has control over each of
his strong, flexible feathers.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,030
In an emergency, they can be
used to rescue those in need,

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,150
but they serve as weapons, too.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,780
He can also sense
vibrations through them,

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,080
allowing him to collect
sound and location data.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,910
If he loses a large
number of feathers,

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,290
it becomes difficult to fly, but
they grow back after a few days.

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,630
Speed. Power.
Precision. Reconnaissance.

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,920
In terms of sheer
Quirk versatility,

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,720
Hawks is nearly unmatched,
even among the pro heroes.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,850
I thought he was
untouchable, until...

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,140
[HAWKS] Weaknesses? Hm...
Well, that's a tough one.

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,860
My Achilles heel
is fire, I guess.

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,190
Oh?

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,650
[HAWKS]
Of course.

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,690
My wings are tough
but flammable.

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,070
[TOKOYAMI]
So how do you counter that?

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,660
Honestly, it's pretty simple.

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,330
I stop bad guys before
fire's a problem.

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,040
[FATGUM panting]
Outta the way!

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Fataxi is comin' through!

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,420
[HONENUKI] You sure it's okay
for us to leave the battle?

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,300
We can still help
you guys out a ton.

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,630
Trust me!

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,890
We needed you kids to use
your powers to disrupt

29
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,430
the enemy's response
and divide leadership.

30
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,220
That kept them
from coordinating.

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,230
Now, we circle 'em and close in.

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,440
They'll be crushed
slowly but steadily.

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,940
As the battlefield gets smaller,
it'll be harder to use

34
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,730
your area attacks without
harming the pros, so it's best

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,610
for you to take a breather with
the rest of your classmates.

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,200
[HONENUKI]
Makes sense.

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,370
We can handle the raid
from here on.

38
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,620
Is that...? Oh, no.

39
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,180
[DABI] You killed Twice
like it was nothing.

40
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,010
And yet you have the audacity
to call yourself a hero?

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,440
[HAWKS groans]

42
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,980
[HAWKS] His flames are
somehow getting even hotter!

43
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,780
[DABI]
You hypocrite.

44
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,990
[groans]

45
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,530
[DABI] I can't believe
you murdered him!

46
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,500
[HAWKS]
You sound upset.

47
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,910
So what's with the smile,
you lunatic?

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,340
Shut your mouth, traitor!
You're being rude.

49
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,210
It's not possible for me to cry.
My tear ducts are burned shut.

50
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,220
Do you know what you've done?

51
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,100
His Quirk was invaluable.
He made my dream feel possible!

52
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,350
I'm more than just
a little "upset."

53
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,890
I'm consumed by my sorrow.

54
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,440
[HAWKS] What's your deal?
I researched the League.

55
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,940
Found background
info on everybody.

56
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,450
Except for you and Shigaraki.

57
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,120
Keigo Takami!

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,870
[HAWKS]
He knows my name?

59
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,460
[COMMISSIONER 117A] "Keigo."
Today, you will say goodbye

60
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,040
to that name.

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,080
[COMMISSIONER 117B] You're going
to complete an exclusive program

62
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,420
that will turn you
into a special hero.

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,170
How's that sound?

64
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,170
The training will
be tough, though.

65
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,760
Can you handle it?

66
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,140
Will I grow up to become
a hero like him?

67
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,270
The kind who stops bad people?

68
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,480
Will I make people smile?

69
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,480
I mean, like he did
when he saved my life?

70
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,190
[COMMISSIONER 117A]
Yes! That's the idea.

71
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,280
Tell me. Who are you?

72
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,580
[DABI]
More than Twice.

73
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,250
More than any army of villains.

74
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,090
Your attention should
have been focused on me.

75
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,840
The League. Shigaraki.

76
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,060
I've never cared about them.

77
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,310
Did you know the world
can be forever altered

78
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,850
because of one person's
singular obsession.

79
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,270
There's no such thing as a
true hero in this society.

80
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,240
You frauds must be killed.

Do you get it now?

I am the one who will
carry out Stain's will!

I'll make this right.

Come on. Just try and
stop me, you fakes!

There is only one man
I'll let kill me.

He is a true hero.

See ya, Hawks.

At the end of the day,
your death means nothing!

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,820
Now's your chance!
Take the finishing blow.

162
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,660
[ENDEAVOR yells]

163
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,660
[MIRKO] The moment I
laid eyes on this creep,

164
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,410
my body knew exactly what to do.

165
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,790
It's a rabbit's
survival instinct.

166
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,960
The guy's evil.
And he must be stopped.

167
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,760
I can't let him be set
loose on the world!

168
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,590
No matter what it takes!

169
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,100
Don't touch that!

170
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,810
[yells]

171
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,780
[WOMAN]
Their powers.

172
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,700
Voice. Shield. Laser.

173
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,620
Physical Enhancement. Saber.

174
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,870
Which means the one keeping me
from using my Quirks is him.

175
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,420
[WOMAN] I lost my abilities
when he appeared.

176
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,090
How does his power function?
He didn't so much as touch me.

177
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,300
His eyes are kept hidden.

178
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,800
Yes. Sight.

179
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,640
He needs to see me
to activate it.

180
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:10,440
How long does it last?
Is there a time limit, or...

181
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,030
[WOMAN]
Oh. Yes, this is good.

182
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,570
So fast!

183
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,120
And it's base strength,
not some Quirk.

184
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,660
[AIZAWA]
Running from my field of vision.

185
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,410
Don't tell me it figured
out how my power works.

186
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,620
[X-LESS grunts]

187
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,050
[WOMAN] My mind and body
are in peak condition!

188
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,010
[WOMAN]
This feels delicious.

189
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,730
[CRUST growls]

190
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,600
[laughs]

191
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,480
[MIRKO growls]

192
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,950
[yells]

193
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,290
[DOCTOR whimpers]

194
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,040
[MIRKO]
Luna Arc!

195
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,710
[gasping]

196
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,880
[MIRKO grunts]
Wait!

197
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,010
[DOCTOR]
Yes. The system. It's working!

198
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,810
[DOCTOR]
Huh?

199
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,270
Oh, no!

200
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,690
[gasps, groans]

201
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,870
Mirko!

202
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,500
I'll cauterize.

203
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,460
Brace yourself.

204
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,500
[ENDEAVOR] You managed to
take on multiple enhanced

205
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,750
Nomu by yourself?

206
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,630
[MIRKO muffled screams]

207
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,470
I already owed you
for your work in Kyushu.

208
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,050
Don't you die.

209
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,180
Oh, really?

210
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,680
How much you owe me, y'think?

211
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,560
[WOMAN]
It's Number One.

212
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,190
Destroying you will
make me feel even better!

213
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,280
[RIBBY]
Not completely awakened yet.

214
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,280
[RIBBY]
No good. Can't use my Quirks.

215
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,580
The strength I got
by becoming a High End,

216
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,040
the power, was taken from me.

217
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,460
[MIRKO]
Listen up, team.

218
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,330
Mirko! You're alive!

219
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,630
[MIRKO] Shigaraki's floating
in some kind of capsule.

220
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,510
From what I've seen, I'm betting
it's an activation chamber.

221
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,550
The Nomu started moving
when electricity

222
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,090
shot through them.

223
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,180
Like they were zapped to life.

224
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,470
Don't let Shigaraki wake up.

225
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,520
He's not just some
bratty punk anymore.

226
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,480
[LOCKLOCK] Eraser, you
and the others keep going!

227
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,150
I'll be right behind you after
I've secured these guys!

228
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,950
[AIZAWA] Reinforcements are
inbound, but not fast enough.

229
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,070
Mirko's right.

230
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,280
Shigaraki can't
enter this fight.

231
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,280
The Nomu that ran
and broke out of Erasure

232
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,660
has probably started
fighting Endeavor.

233
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,500
He could use my back up,

234
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,420
but I can't let go of
my hold on these three.

235
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,630
I'm stuck here for now.

236
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,970
X-Less! Mic! Help them.

237
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,420
Gotcha.

238
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,430
[RIBBY roars]

239
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,930
Go!

240
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,310
[AIZAWA]
I'm counting on you, Mic.

241
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,180
[PRESENT MIC]
I've got this!

242
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,230
[DOCTOR] The machine's
on the fritz, but the data,

243
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,610
the data looks good!

244
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,980
I need to rouse him quickly

245
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,730
before even more of
the solution leaks out.

246
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,280
Damn! Ugh!

247
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,280
I'm reluctant to get you out
when you're still unfinished.

248
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,330
But the dream I share with
All For One must survive!

249
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,250
Crap! Blasted machine.

250
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,250
Wake up, Tomura Shigaraki!

251
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,800
[screams]

252
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,210
[DOCTOR yelps]

253
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,430
[gasps]

254
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,900
[AIZAWA]
Yamada. If you go,

255
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,690
I'll go, too.

256
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,280
[AIZAWA] We had big dreams
when we were kids.

257
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,780
Even when some of them
turned into nightmares,

258
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,910
we had each other.

259
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,790
Checking for authenticity!

260
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,960
DJ Punch!

261
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,540
That's for making my buddy cry!

262
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,920
[DOCTOR groans]

263
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,010
I'm not feeling any heartbeat.

264
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,930
[DOCTOR] The boy's in suspended
animation to reduce the burden

265
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,060
on his body during
the transfer process.

266
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,810
That receptacle housed
the means to revive him.

267
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,440
[sobs] The only reason for me
to live was to see this through.

268
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,450
What now? It's all over!

269
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,580
The dream that
I shared with him.

270
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,040
The Lord of Evil.

271
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,870
Yeah, that's great,
but more importantly,

272
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,840
the Nomu are acting on
your instructions, right?

273
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,210
You better call 'em off
if you know what's good for ya.

274
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,760
You hear me?

275
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,170
X-Less! Deal with Shigaraki!

276
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,430
Right!

277
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,680
What was that machine?

278
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,150
[DOCTOR] Seventy years ago, the
world ridiculed me and my ideas.

279
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,610
They said my paranormal
singularity theory

280
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,400
was irrational and
based on weak evidence.

281
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,650
The short-sighted fools.

282
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,910
The world was in
chaos at the time,

283
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,660
and in order to restore peace,
there couldn't be suggestions

284
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,330
of another collapse of
stability in the future.

285
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,460
[PRESENT MIC]
Now it's called

286
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,500
the Quirk singularity
doomsday theory.

287
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,090
Cults love it.

288
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,540
The man who proposed the concept

289
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,000
went missing and
was thought dead

290
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,840
after his claims were published.

291
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,220
If he were alive,
he'd be over 120.

292
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,970
[PRESENT MIC]
Now I see.

293
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,470
[DOCTOR]
I was exiled.

294
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,060
I lost everything.

295
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,480
He was the only one
who reached out a hand

296
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,190
when the rest of the
world cast me aside.

297
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,320
His presence is overwhelming.
His smile like Buddha's.

298
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,400
He is a god walking
among us in human form.

299
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,910
My Quirk, Lifeforce,
gave me the ability

300
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,120
to live twice as long
as a normal person

301
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,290
at the cost of
physical strength.

302
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,710
I offered this
humble power to him.

303
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,210
The version of the Quirk
I have in me right now

304
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,920
is actually a duplicate
of my original.

305
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,050
[TSUKAUCHI] That could
answer a big question.

306
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,800
How All For One has been
alive such a long time.

307
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,060
[DOCTOR] You're a friend
of Kurogiri's, aren't you?

308
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,640
[DOCTOR]
I'll admit, back then,

309
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,890
what we really
wanted was Erasure.

310
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,230
[PRESENT MIC] I feel dirty
just touching him.

311
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,400
I don't know if I'm more
disgusted or more furious.

312
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,950
I've seen a lot.

313
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,410
But this creep just might be
the most revolting monster

314
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,200
I've ever encountered.

315
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,060
[SHIGARAKI]
Where am I?

316
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,150
[HANA] Because Dad gets mad
when you play pretend,

317
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,110
but I think it's great!

318
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,990
I'll be cheering you on
as your biggest fan, Tenko.

319
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,200
Hana's here?

320
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,370
[HANA]
Tenko. Hey, there you are.

321
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,580
Sorry. It's my fault
you got in trouble.

322
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh. I don't care
about that anymore.

323
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,090
[SHIGARAKI'S MOTHER]
Do you still wanna be a hero?

324
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,390
We'll figure out
your allergies, okay?

325
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,310
No more itching.

326
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,230
Don't worry, I'm okay.
Thanks, Mom.

327
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,440
[KOTARO]
Tenko! You were in my study.

328
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,910
[ALL FOR ONE]
Tomura!

329
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,330
[gasps]

330
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,040
Master.

331
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,920
You're starting to
look like Kurogiri.

332
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,130
Come here.

333
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,460
[DOCTOR]
All For One predicted his demise

334
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,090
and decided to entrust
everything to his successor.

335
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,590
Including his astonishing Quirk.

336
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,180
But just like me,

337
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,020
he maintained a duplicate of
his own power after transferring

338
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,860
the original to
Tomura Shigaraki.

339
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,490
[SHIGARAKI]
Stop it.

340
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,610
Tenko!

341
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,120
Make sure you don't forget.

342
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,580
[HANA]
Let's become heroes together,

343
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,340
and dad doesn't have to
know anything about it!

344
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,220
[SHIGARAKI]
You will see me as I am.

345
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,980
[SHIGARAKI]
I'm done being rejected.

346
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,070
[SHIGARAKI]
Done.

347
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,740
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

348
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,080
While Mr. Aizawa's Erasure
keeps the Nomu at bay,

349
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,250
Gran Torino arrives with
aid and reinforcements.

350
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,840
The odds appear
to be in our favor.

351
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,000
However, no one realizes

352
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,210
that the situation is
about to change dramatically.

353
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,390
The Symbol of Evil has been
awakened and none are safe.

354
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,220
Next time: "The Thrill
of Destruction."

355
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,220
This town is about
to succumb to decay.

356
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,560
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
