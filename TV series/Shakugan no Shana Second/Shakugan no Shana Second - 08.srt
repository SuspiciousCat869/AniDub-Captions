1
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,583
- Alastor: IKE MAY BE
THE BRAINS OF THE GROUP,

2
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,750
BUT HIS AFFECTION FOR
YOSHIDA PROVED TOO MUCH

3
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,541
EVEN FOR A BRIGHT YOUNG MAN
SUCH AS HIM TO HANDLE.

4
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,666
HE METICULOUSLY PLANNED
AN OUTING TO A THEME PARK,

5
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,333
ONLY TO WATCH HIS EVERY
CALCULATION FAIL.

6
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,750
FORTUNATELY, GOOD MEMORIES
CAN BE MADE FROM MISADVENTURE,

7
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,583
AND THE GROUP
WILL LONG REMEMBER THIS DAY.

8
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,166
- ( theme song playing )

9
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,375
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,833
- ( moaning )

11
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,333
- ( yelling )

12
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,250
- STOP RIGHT NOW!  I WANT
MY REVENGE.  I'LL KILL THEM!

13
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,083
- ( gasping )

14
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,583
THAT WAS SOME DREAM.

15
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,208
DID I SAY ANYTHING?
- Marcosias: DON'T THINK SO.

16
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,833
- ( yelling )

17
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,083
- OH!
- COME BACK HERE.

18
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,708
- YOU CAN DO IT, YUJI.
- I'LL CRUSH YOU!

19
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,250
- WELL DONE.

20
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,500
- Yuji: THAT WAS
A PRETTY LOW BLOW, WILHELMINA.

21
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,000
WHY DID YOU PUT ME UP
AGAINST THAT RINNE?

22
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,625
- I HAD NO CHOICE.

23
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,166
THE FLAME OF THE HEAVENS
AND HIS PARTNER REQUESTED IT.

24
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,583
- Tiamat: OUR HANDS WERE TIED.
- ALASTOR?

25
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,625
- HMM, I SUPPOSE
IT'S TIME

26
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,625
FOR US TO MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT STEP.

27
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,541
- NEXT STEP?
- CASTING AN UNRESTRICTED SPELL.

28
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,291
- UNRESTRICTED?
WHO, ME?

29
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,541
- YES.  WHEN IT COMES TO
THE SENSING

30
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,541
AND CONTROLLING
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE,

31
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,875
YOU'RE ACTUALLY AT A PRETTY
ADVANCED LEVEL ALREADY.

32
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,125
- I'M NOT SO SURE.

33
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,958
OH, YEAH.
YOU FIND ANYTHING OUT

34
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,958
ABOUT THE KEEPER
ON THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD?

35
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,208
- INDEED, ALTHOUGH THE MATTER
REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION.

36
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,083
I'VE RECENTLY RECEIVED
INFORMATION FROM OUTLAW.

37
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,083
I AM CURRENTLY
ANALYZING IT.

38
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,791
- Tiamat: DO NOT BE
CONCERNED.

39
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,291
- Alastor: THERE'S NO REASON
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW.

40
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,708
REMAIN FOCUSED AND CONCENTRATE
ON THE TASK AT HAND.

41
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,000
- YEAH, THAT'S EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY.  IT DOESN'T AFFECT YOU.

42
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,000
- ALASTOR'S RIGHT.

43
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,000
YOU NEED TO FOCUS
ON YOUR TRAINING.

44
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,750
WE'LL START WORKING ON CASTING
A SEAL FIRST THING TOMORROW.

45
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,666
- ( distant dog barking )

46
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,375
- LET ME SEE.

47
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,625
- Tiamat: THAT'S
AN ISOLATED CASE.

48
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,250
- I FAIL TO SEE
HOW IT RELATES

49
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,583
TO OUR CURRENT SITUATION
IN ANY WAY.

50
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,833
- ( ticking )

51
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,291
- WAIT, WHAT IS THIS?

52
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,041
IT CAN'T BE.

53
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,541
NOT PHELES.

54
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,541
- ( birds chirping )

55
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,333
- GOOD MORNING.

56
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,541
WHAT'S GOING ON?

57
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,708
- I WILL INDEED BE LEAVING
FOR A SHORT TIME.

58
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,333
- ( Tanaka sighs )
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS MESS?

59
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,500
- Margery: OH, LIGHTEN UP.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

60
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,500
( giggling )

61
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,875
- SATO.
TALK ABOUT GOOD TIMING.

62
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,291
GIVE ME A HAND.

63
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,500
- HEY, MARGERY,
I NEED A FAVOR.

64
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,166
- OH, YOU DO NOW?

65
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,250
WELL, THEN LET'S HEAR IT,
KIDDO.

66
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,916
- I WANT YOU
TO TRAIN ME.

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,916
- HMM.

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,958
DON'T BE STUPID.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

69
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,083
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE
WE'RE DOING ENOUGH TO HELP.

70
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,666
EVEN IF WE CAN'T INCREASE
OUR PHYSICAL STRENGTH,

71
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,291
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

72
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,041
- DUDE, WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU?  CHILL.

73
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,416
- I WANT POWER.
I'LL TRY ANYTHING.

74
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,458
- POWER FOR WHAT?
- WELL, SO--

75
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,125
SO THAT I CAN FOLLOW YOU.

76
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,750
I'LL LEAVE THIS CITY BEHIND
AND GO ANYWHERE YOU GO.

77
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,291
I WANT TO BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

78
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:51,125
- YOU REALIZE YOU'D DIE?

79
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,458
YOU POOR BOYS,
YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

80
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,750
- ABOUT WHAT?

81
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,375
- ( ice clinking )

82
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,250
- VERY WELL.

83
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,041
I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD TELL YOU

84
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,666
A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE WORLD I COME FROM.

85
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,333
IT OUGHT TO GIVE YOU
SOME INSIGHT INTO WHO I AM.

86
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,083
SEVERAL YEARS AFTER
THE GREAT DEPRESSION...

87
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,458
NEW YORK CITY,
THE HEART OF THE CATASTROPHE,

88
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,458
WANTED TO REGAIN
ITS FORMER GLORY,

89
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,166
RESTORE ITS SPLENDOR.

90
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,291
- ( boat horn blares )

91
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,333
- ( chuckles )

92
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,750
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
BUT I CAN'T STAY LONG.

93
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,583
- Marcosias: SORRY TO BE ABRUPT,
BUT GOODBYE.

94
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:11,041
- I AM ANNABERG, THE CHASM
OF FASTIDIOUS IMPALING.

95
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,875
FROM THE COLOR
OF YOUR FLAME,

96
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,291
I ASSUME I'M IN THE PRESENCE
OF MARCOSIAS,

97
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,625
THE CLAWS AND FANGS
OF VIOLATION,

98
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,416
AND MARGERY DAW,
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES--

99
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,916
TWO ILLUSTRIOUS NAMES.

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,958
- Marcosias: YEAH,
WHAT'S IT TO YOU, BUDDY?

101
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,916
- SHUT UP AND DIE,
DENIZEN.

102
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,083
- ( Marcosias laughs )
THAT WAS TOO EASY.

103
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,791
- HIS POWER OF EXISTENCE
WAS STRONG,

104
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,625
BUT HIS FIGHTING SKILLS
WERE NOT.

105
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,625
I'M ALMOST OFFENDED
HE DIDN'T TRY HARDER.

106
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,833
( gasps )

107
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,750
WHERE IS HE?
- BELOW US!

108
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,416
- SYDONAY,
THE THOUSAND CHANGES,

109
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,041
THANKS FOR THE TIMELY
ASSISTANCE.

110
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,125
- I WAS JUST DOING
MY JOB.

111
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,791
SHALL I
FINISH HER OFF?

112
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,916
I DON'T LIKE LEAVING A JOB
HALF-FINISHED,

113
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,625
ESPECIALLY THIS ONE.
- YOU KNOW HER THEN?

114
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,208
- WHILE I'VE NOT FACED HER
PERSONALLY UNTIL NOW,

115
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,875
I CERTAINLY KNOW
WHO SHE IS.

116
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,000
HUNDREDS OF MY MEN HAVE BEEN
KILLED BY HER ATTACKS.

117
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,208
- THE STRONG PRESENCE
I FELT BEFORE--

118
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,833
IT WAS HIM.

119
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,458
DAMN IT.

120
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,250
I'VE BEEN DECEIVED.

121
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,416
- Annaberg: THEN LET'S END HER
NOW AND BE DONE WITH IT.

122
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,000
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO WASTE ANY TIME.

123
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,833
I SCHEDULED MY ARRIVAL
IN MANHATTAN TO COINCIDE

124
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,833
WITH THE DEPARTURE
OF THE FLAME HAZE.

125
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,916
BUT WHO KNOWS
WHEN THEY MIGHT RETURN?

126
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,625
- YOU'RE THE CLIENT.
I JUST DO WHAT I'M ASKED.

127
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,166
- HUMANITY,
YOU FASCINATE ME.

128
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,250
I PRAISE
YOUR INGENUITY.

129
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,125
BUT YOU MUST DO MORE.
YOU MUST MAKE MORE.

130
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,958
SHOW ME YOUR POWER.

131
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,166
SHOW ME THE CHANGES THAT ONLY
YOU CAN BRING TO THIS WORLD.

132
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,500
YOU TWO HAVE
FRONT-ROW SEATS.

133
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,708
OBSERVE AS I DESTROY HUMANITY
AND ACCELERATE CIVILIZATION.

134
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,166
IT WILL BE SOON,
VERY SOON.

135
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,625
- WELL, WE'RE NOT DEAD.

136
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,625
- WELL, DAMN IT.

137
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,541
AND I REALLY LIKED
THIS DRESS.

138
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,166
- ( Marcosias laughs )
YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE

139
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,083
AND YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT A DRESS?

140
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,500
OH.

141
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,875
ARGH!
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

142
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,875
DO YOU HAVE TO
THROW ME AROUND LIKE THAT?

143
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,375
YOU'RE ROUGHING UP MY BINDING,
DEAR MARGERY DAW.

144
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,041
- SORRY BUT I THINK A LADY
HAS A RIGHT TO PRIVACY

145
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,750
WHEN SHE'S DISROBING.

146
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,875
THE PURIFICATION FLAME,
PLEASE.

147
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,458
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

148
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,958
- ( sighs ) I'D LIKE A SUIT
THIS TIME.

149
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,833
THE ONE I BOUGHT IN MARSEILLES
WILL DO.

150
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,000
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

151
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,250
YOU'RE... NAKED.

152
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,791
- ( punch lands )
- ( man yells )

153
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,083
- ( car horns honking )

154
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,625
- ( man stuttering )
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

155
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,625
I'M THE COMMANDER
OF WRAITHS,

156
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,791
THE FLAME HAZE OF VALAC,
THE MARSHALL OF LIZARDS.

157
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,875
MY NAME IS
YURI CHVOJKA.

158
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,791
LET'S SEE,
WHAT ELSE CAN I TELL YOU?

159
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,416
UM, I'M 16--
WELL, AS LONG AS YOU COUNT

160
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,250
THE YEAR I'VE BEEN
A FLAME HAZE.

161
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,833
- Valac: YOU NITWIT,

162
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,541
WHY DO YOU BOTHER KEEPING TRACK
OF YOUR AGE ANYMORE?

163
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,958
- OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT,
VALAC.

164
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,333
- DON'T BE SO QUICK
TO APOLOGIZE.

165
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,875
- SORRY.

166
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,333
UH, IF YOU DON'T MIND ME
SAYING SO,

167
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,166
I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED YOU,
CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

168
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,166
I HEAR YOU'VE KILLED
HUNDREDS OF DENIZENS

169
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,791
IN YOUR TIME
AS A FLAME HAZE.

170
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,958
- ALL RIGHT, KID, HOW LONG
ARE YOU PLANNING TO FOLLOW ME?

171
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,375
MY BUSINESS IS WITH THE SUMMONER
OF STAR RIVER,

172
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,125
NOT WITH A LITTLE TWERP
LIKE YOU.

173
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,416
- OH, I'M SORRY, MA'AM.

174
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,291
- IF YOU'RE SO SORRY,
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT ALREADY.

175
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,291
- BUT I COULD BE
OF SERVICE TO YOU.

176
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,333
SEE, I WORK
FOR EAST EDGE.

177
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,750
I MEAN, I'M WORKING
AT HIS OUTLAW.

178
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,458
I CAN TAKE YOU TO HIM.
- HUH?

179
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,250
- THE SUMMONER HIRED
A PIPSQUEAK LIKE YOU?

180
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,833
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
( laughs )

181
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,541
NO FUN BEING A NEW RECRUIT,
EH, VALAC?

182
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,541
YOU GET STUCK
WITH ALL THE GRUNT WORK.

183
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,958
- Valac: I MUST BE BAD OFF
IF I'M BEING RIDICULED

184
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,958
BY THE CLAWS AND FANGS
OF VIOLATION.

185
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,583
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
( laughing )

186
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,791
- ( Margery's voice )
SUDDENLY I HAD THIS FEELING

187
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,916
THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF
ABOUT THE BOY.

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,291
YURI WAS DIFFERENT
FROM OTHER FLAME HAZE.

189
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,750
HE DIDN'T POSSESS THE SPIRIT
NEEDED FOR KILLING DENIZENS.

190
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,750
HE HAD NEITHER THE FINESSE
TO HIDE IT

191
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,000
NOR THE CALMNESS THAT COMES
AFTER ACHIEVING ENLIGHTENMENT.

192
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,833
- YOU KNOW, KID,

193
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,083
YOU'RE NOT LIKE
OTHER FLAME HAZE.

194
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,041
- YEAH?
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

195
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,291
- ( car horn honks )
- Man: HEY, I'M WALKING HERE.

196
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,083
- THE ONLY REASON
I EVEN WENT TO NEW YORK CITY

197
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,625
WAS BECAUSE I WAS ASKED TO
DELIVER A LETTER TO EAST EDGE.

198
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,541
AT THE TIME,
FLAME HAZE AROUND THE WORLD

199
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,416
WERE GATHERING IN EUROPE.
THEY WERE COMING TOGETHER

200
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,791
TO FIGHT AN ARMY OF CRIMSON
DENIZENS CALLED REVOLUTION.

201
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,416
THAT GATHERING
WAS THE SUBJECT MATTER

202
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,250
OF THE LETTER
I'D BROUGHT HIM.

203
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,083
- EVERYONE
UP AND LEFT, HUH?

204
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,125
I THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE
I COULDN'T FEEL THE PRESENCE

205
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,500
OF A SINGLE FLAME HAZE.
IT MUST BE ROUGH AROUND HERE.

206
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,750
- Marcosias: ESPECIALLY SINCE
THE ONLY ONE WHO STAYED BEHIND

207
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,166
IS THAT YURI KID.

208
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,333
EVEN WITH THE PRESIDENT
OF LIZARDS WITH HIM,

209
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,625
HIS INEXPERIENCE
IS A RISK.

210
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,125
- MM, BUT A NECESSARY RISK.

211
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,291
OUR OPTIONS
ARE LIMITED HERE.

212
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,375
WE HAVE YOU,
AND THERE'S US--

213
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,083
THE FOUR GODS OF EARTH.
HOWEVER...

214
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,500
- WE ARE STUCK RIGHT HERE.
WE CANNOT LEAVE.

215
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,666
- YEAH, WE KNOW.
BUT IF THAT DENIZEN

216
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,875
WAS TO ATTACK THE CITY,
IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS.

217
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,916
THERE'S NOBODY HERE
TO FIGHT HIM OFF.

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,250
- DON'T YOU WORRY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

219
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,708
- East Edge: ABOUT THE BOY--
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

220
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,166
- HE ISN'T UP TO THE JOB.
I DON'T SENSE ANY ANGER

221
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,833
OR HATRED TOWARD DENIZENS
WITHIN HIM.

222
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,125
AND THERE'S SOMETHING...

223
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,583
STRANGE ABOUT HIM.

224
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,541
- ( record hissing )

225
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,666
- I TOO HAVE NOTICED
THE BOY CARRIES AN ABERRATION

226
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,666
IN HIS HEART
THAT HE SHOULD NOT POSSESS.

227
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,791
- NO BATTLE,
NOT FOR HIM.

228
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,416
WE CANNOT.
TOO DANGEROUS.

229
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,166
- INTERESTING.

230
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,833
SO HE WASN'T ORDERED
TO ENTER MY SEAL.

231
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,333
HE DID IT
OF HIS OWN ACCORD.

232
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,833
- I HATE TO ASK,
BUT WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

233
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,125
- LET ME GUESS:
TRAIN THE NEW RECRUIT?

234
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,250
FINE, BUT TRAINING
ISN'T REALLY MY THING.

235
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,083
I'VE GOT
MY OWN PROBLEMS.

236
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,666
I'VE STILL GOT TO FACE OFF
WITH THOUSAND CHANGES.

237
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,000
JEEZ, THAT'S GONNA BE
TOUGH.

238
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,708
- YOU COULD JUST BLIND HIM
WITH YOUR NAKEDNESS

239
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,500
LIKE YOU DID WITH THAT
POOR LITTLE BOY. ( laughing )

240
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,875
- SHUT UP, STUPID MARCO.
- OW!

241
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,375
- ( Margery's voice ) I CAN FEEL
A CRIMSON DENIZEN'S PRESENCE.

242
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,666
- Marcosias: I'M THINKING
SONAR UNRESTRICTED SPELL.

243
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,708
JUST GO IN GUNS BLAZING.
- WE COULD DO THAT.

244
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,166
I'M WORRIED IT MIGHT LEAD
THOUSAND CHANGES

245
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,541
STRAIGHT TO US THOUGH,
AND I'M NOT READY TO FACE HIM.

246
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,166
BESIDES, I DON'T WANT
TO ENDANGER

247
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,166
OUR PRECIOUS
LITTLE TRAINEE.

248
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,041
- OBSERVE AS I DESTROY HUMANITY
AND ACCELERATE CIVILIZATION.

249
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,333
- HERE.

250
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,041
UM, SORRY, WOULD YOU PREFER
SOMETHING STRONGER?

251
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,333
ARE YOU WARM?

252
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,500
YOU'RE LOOKING
KIND OF FLUSH.

253
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,625
- THIS WILL BE FINE.

254
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,958
- Yuri: IT'S TRULY AN HONOR TO
ACCOMPANY YOU ON YOUR SEARCH.

255
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,208
THANKS FOR
INVITING ME ALONG.

256
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,166
- IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD A CHOICE.
EAST EDGE ASKED ME TO.

257
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,458
- IT'S BEEN HALF A CENTURY SINCE
YOU WERE LAST IN NEW YORK,

258
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,541
RIGHT?  HAS IT CHANGED MUCH
SINCE THEN?

259
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,208
- YEAH, I GUESS.

260
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,875
I HAVE NOTICED THERE'S NOT
AS MANY PIGS AND HORSES

261
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,416
RUNNING AROUND THE CITY
ANYMORE.

262
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,416
- PIGS, HUH?
THAT'S WEIRD.

263
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,458
- BACK THEN THE STREETS
WERE COVERED IN CRAP,

264
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,500
TRASH PILED UP
EVERYWHERE.

265
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,458
HUNTER'S POINT
WAS A DEN OF TOXIC GAS.

266
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,250
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT WAS THAT BAD.

267
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,500
DAMN HIM.

268
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,250
THIS CITY HAS HAD TO OVERCOME
SUCH HARDSHIPS,

269
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,625
EVEN TODAY AS IT STRUGGLES
TO REVIVE ITSELF

270
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,708
AFTER THE ECONOMIC
DEPRESSION.

271
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,625
WHY DID THAT CRIMSON DENIZEN
HAVE TO COME HERE?

272
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,416
AND HE WAS SPOUTING
ALL THAT NONSENSE

273
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,208
ABOUT ACCELERATING
CIVILIZATION?

274
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,250
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE
HOLDING HUMANITY BACK

275
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,833
FROM REACHING
ITS FULL POTENTIAL.

276
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,916
THEY WOULD PROGRESS FASTER
IF IT WASN'T--

277
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,291
- Marcosias: CALM DOWN, KID.
DON'T GET BENT OUT OF SHAPE.

278
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,666
- OH.

279
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,583
UM, I'M SORRY, SIR.

280
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,750
- Valac: YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
WORRYING ABOUT HUMANS.

281
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:36,041
YOUR MISSION AS A FLAME HAZE IS
TO MAINTAIN THE WORLD'S BALANCE,

282
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,875
NOT TO PROTECT HUMANITY.

283
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,041
- Yuri: BUT HUMANS ARE
PART OF THE WORLD TOO.

284
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,708
- Valac: REMEMBER, YOU'RE NOT
ONE OF THEM ANYMORE.

285
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,291
- Yuri: YEAH, I KNOW.

286
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,666
- AM I REALLY ALL THAT DIFFERENT
FROM OTHER FLAME HAZE?

287
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,541
- YES, YOU ARE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY

288
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,791
VALAC ENTERED A CONTRACT
WITH YOU.

289
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,791
- I CAN EXPLAIN.
- NO NEED.

290
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,208
- A YEAR AGO I BOARDED
AN IMMIGRANT SHIP

291
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,833
BOUND FOR AMERICA.

292
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,833
THE JOURNEY
WENT SMOOTHLY

293
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,000
UNTIL WE WERE ATTACKED
BY A DENIZEN.

294
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,750
- ( people screaming )

295
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,708
- Yuri: I LOST MY FATHER,
MY MOTHER.

296
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,791
THE DENIZEN, A KRAKEN,
CONSUMED HUNDREDS OF SOULS,

297
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,291
THEREBY ERASING THEM
FROM EXISTENCE.

298
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:48,041
IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT
CARNAGE, VALAC FOUND ME

299
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,000
AND I BECAME
HER FLAME HAZE.

300
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,875
I WILL ALWAYS BE HAUNTED WITH
REGRET FOR MY ACTIONS THAT DAY.

301
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,958
- WHY IS THAT?
DO YOU REGRET YOUR CONTRACT?

302
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,958
- OH, NO,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

303
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,625
I'M VERY GRATEFUL
FOR WHAT VALAC DID.

304
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:08,208
IT'S JUST
I WAS SO SELFISH.

305
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,000
INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING
TO SAVE THE OTHERS,

306
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,083
I WAS ONLY WORRIED
WITH SAVING MYSELF.

307
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,750
BUT IT WON'T
HAPPEN AGAIN.

308
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,875
ONE DAY I WILL SAVE
SOMEBODY'S LIFE.

309
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,083
- ( sighs )

310
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,500
- HUH?

311
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,375
- VALAC.
- YES, I KNOW.

312
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,333
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE HAD ME DO?

313
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,625
- Margery: GO BACK TO EAST EDGE.
- HUH?

314
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,041
- YOU'RE JUST NOT FIT
TO BE A FLAME HAZE.

315
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,958
- BUT, MISS DAW, WE STILL
HAVE TO FIND THE DENIZEN.

316
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,666
- HOW IS A ROOKIE LIKE YOU
GONNA HELP ME DO THAT?

317
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,666
THE DENIZEN ASKED
TO BE OBSERVED,

318
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,875
YET HE'S CLEARLY IN HIDING.
SO WHAT IS HIS GOAL?

319
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,958
I HAVE A THEORY BASED ON
THE SEARCHING WE'VE DONE.

320
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,583
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

321
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,250
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

322
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,458
- OF COURSE NOT,
'CAUSE YOU'RE AN AMATEUR.

323
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,125
YOU'RE OF NO USE
TO ME.

324
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,083
- VALAC.

325
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,666
- IF YOU CAN'T ANSWER HER,
WE'VE NO CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE.

326
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,416
- WAIT, WHAT?

327
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,833
- THE SUN'S SETTING,
SO I'D BETTER BE GOING NOW.

328
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,375
BYE, YURI.
- SEE YOU, MARSHALL OF LIZARDS.

329
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,375
GIVE OUR APOLOGIES
TO EAST EDGE.

330
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,708
- NO.  WAIT!

331
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:24,500
( grunts )

332
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,750
- I'M WARNING YOU,
DON'T FOLLOW US.

333
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,625
- Annaberg: WHAT AN INCREDIBLE
BUILDING.

334
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,541
TO THINK, A STRUCTURE
THIS GRAND

335
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:41,458
WAS BUILT IN A MERE
405 DAYS.

336
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,958
REMINDS ME OF ANOTHER
OLD TOWER.

337
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,250
IT'S AN ACHIEVEMENT
WHICH RIVALS THE BABYLONIANS'.

338
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,583
- Margery: FLAME HAZE
ARE DRIVEN BY THEIR HATRED

339
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,500
AND DESIRE FOR REVENGE.
BUT NOT THAT BOY.

340
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,500
HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE IT
IN HIM.

341
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,291
- WHAT THE HELL
WAS VALAC THINKING,

342
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,958
ENTERING INTO
THAT CONTRACT?

343
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,333
- HE WANTS TO SAVE
SOMEONE'S LIFE?

344
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,250
YOU CAN'T PAIR FLAME HAZE
RAGE WITH ALTRUISM.

345
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,333
THAT IS A BAD
COMBINATION.

346
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,833
- Marcosias: THE POOR KID'S
JUST NOT CUT OUT FOR THE JOB.

347
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,083
- WELL, LET'S NOT WASTE OUR TIME
WORRYING ABOUT HIM.

348
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,791
THE DENIZEN DESERVES
OUR FULL ATTENTION.

349
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,166
- Annaberg: THIS BUILDING
WILL BE RECORDED

350
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,833
IN THE ANNALS OF HISTORY AS THE
PINNACLE OF HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT--

351
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,458
NOT ONLY THEIR CAPACITY
FOR COMPLEX CONSTRUCTION,

352
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:33,625
BUT UNDENIABLE PROOF
OF MANKIND'S INFINITE POWER.

353
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,625
WHAT BETTER PLACE
TO BEGIN MY WORK THAN HERE--

354
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,708
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING?

355
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,583
- CAST A SEAL!

356
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,750
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

357
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,625
- Yuji:
MARGERY HAS FOUND AN ADMIRER

358
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,125
IN A YOUNG FLAME
HAZE NAMED YURI.

359
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,791
THE BOY HAS AN INFALLIBLE
SENSE OF JUSTICE.

360
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,708
HOWEVER, MARGERY KNOWS

361
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,791
THIS IS A DANGEROUS QUALITY
FOR A FLAME HAZE TO POSSESS,

362
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,166
BECAUSE IT RENDERS HIM
VULNERABLE.

363
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,375
BUT YURI WILL NOT BE
HELD BACK

364
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,166
FROM ALLOWING HIS FLAME
TO BLAZE.

365
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,333
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II,"

366
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:55,333
"THE MILESTONE OF SORROW."
