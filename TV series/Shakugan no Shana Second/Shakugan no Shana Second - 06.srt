1
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,416
- Alastor:
SHANA'S UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR

2
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,000
CAUSED WILHELMINA TO BECOME
CONCERNED ABOUT HER WELL-BEING.

3
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:57,375
THANKS TO A COOKING LESSON FROM
CHIGUSA, WILHELMINA WAS ABLE

4
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,333
TO CREATE A HOME-COOKED MEAL
THAT HELPED CHEER SHANA UP.

5
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,791
HOWEVER, THINGS ARE NOT
COMPLETELY BACK TO NORMAL.

6
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,708
SHANA AND KAZUMI ARE STILL
FUMING WITH JEALOUSY

7
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,583
BECAUSE OF YUJI'S TIME
SPENT ALONE WITH KONOE.

8
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,208
- ( theme song playing )

9
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,833
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,166
 - YOU'VE BEEN LATE
EVERY MORNING THIS WEEK.

11
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,833
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

12
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,208
- Yuji: YOU THINK
I'M SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME

13
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,000
WITH KONOE?  YOU'VE SEEN
HOW HELPLESS SHE IS.

14
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,875
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN LEAVE HER
TO HER OWN DEVICES, YOU KNOW.

15
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,833
- I THINK YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT HERE, BUDDY.

16
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,666
YOU DON'T SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND YOU.

17
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,833
JUST TRY NOT TO SPEND
SO MUCH TIME WITH HER.

18
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,208
- THAT'S WEIRD.

19
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,625
- HEY, KONOE.
- HUH?

20
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,833
- NOW THAT OGATA'S HERE
TO WALK YOU TO AND FROM SCHOOL,

21
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,916
MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED
MY HELP ANYMORE.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,916
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, SAKAI?

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,083
ARE YOU TRYING TO DITCH HER
AND LEAVE HER TO ME?

24
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,083
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT
AT ALL.

25
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,000
I'LL STILL HELP YOU OUT WITH HER
AT SCHOOL AND STUFF.  IT'S JUST

26
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,083
I FEEL BAD ABOUT MAKING YOU GUYS
WAIT FOR ME EVERY MORNING.

27
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,291
- ( students chattering )

28
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,833
- GOOD MORNING.

29
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,833
- MAYBE YOSHIDA
IS UPSET WITH ME

30
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,291
BECAUSE SHE WANTED
TO KEEP LOOKING AFTER KONOE.

31
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,791
BUT...

32
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,250
- ( Shana sighs )

33
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,416
- THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY SHANA'S MAD AT ME.

34
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,208
IT SEEMS LIKE SHE'S LEFT
MY TRAINING UP TO WILHELMINA.

35
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,250
- ( clock chiming )

36
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,250
- EVERYBODY TAKE
YOUR SEATS.

37
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,458
- UH, I HATE TO TELL YOU,

38
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,125
BUT I JUST FOUND OUT YOU'RE ALL
GOING TO HAVE A ROUND OF TESTS

39
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,708
IN EACH OF YOUR CLASSES
TOMORROW.

40
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,125
- BUT YOU CAN'T JUST SPRING THAT
ON US WITHOUT ANY WARNING.

41
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,333
- YEAH, WE NEED TIME
TO STUDY AND PREPARE.

42
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,458
- THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TELL
WHO ACTUALLY STUDIED

43
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,958
OVER SUMMER BREAK IS TO TEST YOU
ON THAT INFORMATION.

44
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,375
THESE TESTS WILL TOUCH
ON EVERYTHING YOU WERE TAUGHT

45
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,291
THE FIRST SEMESTER.  NOW LET'S
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SCHEDULE.

46
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,625
- Tanaka: I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE PULLING THIS CRAP ON US.

47
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,208
POP QUIZZES ARE JUST EVIL,
YOU KNOW?

48
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,333
- IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S
ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

49
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,750
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO TRY
AND FAKE IT THE BEST WE CAN.

50
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,375
- GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

51
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,041
SWEATING IT
WON'T DO ME ANY GOOD.

52
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,083
- EXCUSE ME, IKE,

53
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,208
I HAVE A SMALL FAVOR
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU.

54
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,208
WOULD YOU BE AT ALL
WILLING TO TUTOR ME?

55
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,458
AN OVERNIGHT CRAM SESSION
WITH YOU WOULD GIVE ME

56
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,041
A BETTER CHANCE OF PASSING
THAN IF I STUDY ALONE.

57
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,875
PLEASE HELP.
- WELL, I GUESS THAT WOULDN'T BE

58
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,000
A PROBLEM, BUT--
WAIT, DID YOU SAY OVERNIGHT?

59
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,291
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

60
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,208
- YEAH, WE CAN MAKE IT
A SLEEPOVER.

61
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,166
NOW WHERE CAN WE GO?
WHAT ABOUT SATO'S?

62
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,666
- HUH?

63
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,291
- SO, TANAKA,
WANT TO JOIN US?

64
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,083
- MM-HMM.

65
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,750
YOU SHOULD DO IT, BIG GUY.
YOU NEED TO STUDY.

66
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,250
- SHUT UP, JERK FACE.

67
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,750
- AN OVERNIGHT STUDY SESSION?
WELL, OKAY.

68
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,958
YOU CAN COUNT ME IN,
BUT ONLY IF THE REST

69
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,916
OF THE GANG CAN COME OVER
TO STUDY TOO.

70
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,250
- OKAY, GUESS I'LL GO UP
AND ASK 'EM.

71
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,500
SO ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA JOIN US?

72
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,791
- I DON'T GET WHY WE ALL
HAVE TO STUDY TOGETHER.

73
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,125
I THINK I'D PREFER TO STUDY
FOR THE TESTS ON MY OWN.

74
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,083
- BUT IF WE ALL
STUDY TOGETHER,

75
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,125
WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER
WITH THE DIFFICULT STUFF.

76
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,750
SO ARE YOU GONNA GO,
YOSHIDA?

77
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,708
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

78
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,333
- WHO ELSE
WILL BE THERE?

79
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,541
- WELL, IT'LL BE
THE USUAL SUSPECTS, YOU KNOW--

80
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,375
IKE, SATO,
TANAKA AND OGATA.

81
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,791
HOPEFULLY THE TWO OF YOU
LADIES.

82
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,583
AND I'LL BE THERE,
OF COURSE.

83
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,291
- AND?

84
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,458
- AND?

85
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,166
AND KONOE.

86
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,291
- WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY,
MILADY?

87
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,666
WAS IT MY COOKING?

88
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,541
DID YOU NOT LIKE
THE BACON AND EGGS I MADE?

89
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,291
- IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT.

90
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,000
- THEN WHAT--?
- IT'S NOTHING, OKAY?

91
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,625
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

92
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,291
AND DON'T BE LATE
FOR YUJI'S TRAINING.

93
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,166
- ( door closes )

94
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,458
- WHATEVER IT IS, IT MUST HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MYSTES.

95
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,291
HE STOPPED BY TO SPEAK WITH ME
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

96
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,416
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

97
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,416
- HE SAID HE WANTS TO SKIP
TONIGHT'S TRAINING

98
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,666
TO ATTEND A STUDY SESSION
WITH YOU.

99
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,416
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

100
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,583
I WORRY THE MYSTES IS NOT
TAKING HIS SITUATION SERIOUSLY.

101
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,291
HIS TRAINING
IS MUCH MORE VITAL.

102
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,250
- Tiamat: UTTER NONSENSE.

103
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,166
- Alastor: YOU CANNOT
LEAVE YUJI SAKAI'S TRAINING

104
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,791
TO THE SPECIALIST
OF EVERYTHING

105
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,250
AND THE TIARA OF DREAMS
AND ILLUSIONS FOREVER.

106
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,541
I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU TOOK THE REINS AGAIN.

107
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,500
HOW LONG DO YOU INTEND
TO KEEP UP THIS STUBBORN ACT?

108
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,416
- I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

109
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,541
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

110
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,875
- Eita: PLEASE,
WE'RE BEGGING YOU, MARGERY.

111
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,125
IT'S JUST FOR ONE NIGHT.
COME ON, GET UP, WOULD YOU?

112
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,166
- STOP YELLING AT ME.

113
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,041
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
I HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

114
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,625
- WE ALREADY TOLD YOU, WE'VE GOT
FRIENDS COMING OVER TO STUDY.

115
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,500
YOU TRY IT, SAKAI.
SHE'S NOT GONNA LISTEN TO US.

116
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,500
- IF SHE WANTS TO SLEEP,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TRY

117
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,250
MOVING HER
TO ANOTHER ROOM?

118
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,250
- DO YOU WANT HER STUMBLING
IN HERE ALL DRUNK LATER?

119
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,875
- BESIDES, IF SHE
RUNS INTO OGATA,

120
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,500
IT COULD CAUSE
SOME MAJOR PROBLEMS.

121
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,708
UH, LONG STORY.

122
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,708
- ( Margery moans )
- ( Marcosias laughing )

123
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,708
THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY, BOYS.

124
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,208
WHEN THE BOTTOMLESS KEG,
A.K.A. MARGERY DAW,

125
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,583
IS THIS DRUNK,
SHE WON'T GET UP FOR ANYTHING.

126
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,250
A DENIZEN COULD APPEAR
AND SHE'D--

127
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,833
OW!
- OKAY, THAT'S SCARY.

128
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,041
SHE RESPONDS TO MARCO
EVEN WHEN SHE'S DEAD ASLEEP.

129
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,625
- ( doorbell rings )
- DAMN IT.  OUT OF TIME, GUYS.

130
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,333
- I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO HIDE HER
AND HOPE

131
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,458
SHE DOESN'T WAKE UP
ANYTIME SOON.

132
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,416
WELCOME TO MY
HUMBLE ABODE.

133
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,083
- WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE GROCERIES?

134
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,416
- WELL, I FIGURED I WOULD BE
IN CHARGE OF COOKING.

135
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,875
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING
LATE INTO THE NIGHT,

136
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,916
WE'RE BOUND TO GET HUNGRY
AT SOME POINT.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,958
- I OFFERED TO LEND HER
A HELPING HAND IN THE KITCHEN,

138
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,208
BUT IKE WON'T LET ME.
- YOU HAVE TO STUDY.

139
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,375
YOU'RE THE WHOLE REASON WE'RE
EVEN HAVING THIS CRAM SESSION.

140
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,375
- HE'S RIGHT.
THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.

141
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,458
- LET YOSHIDA HANDLE IT.
SHE HAS GOOD GRADES

142
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,875
AND SHE'S AN AWESOME COOK.
CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR YOU.

143
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,500
- TANAKA!

144
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,125
- SATO, WOULD YOU MIND
SHOWING ME TO THE KITCHEN?

145
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,250
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

146
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,625
- Hayato: WOW, I HEARD
THAT YOU HAD A HUGE PLACE,

147
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,916
BUT I WASN'T EXPECTING
THIS AT ALL.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,125
- WELL, I TRY NOT TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

149
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,500
HOW'S THE A.C.?
IS THE TEMPERATURE OKAY?

150
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,500
OH, AND IF YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO DRINK, PLEASE HELP YOURSELF.

151
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,125
- ALL RIGHT, I GUESS
WE'D BETTER GET STARTED.  I KNOW

152
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,791
WE'VE GOT ALL NIGHT, BUT WE'VE
GOT A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER.

153
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,583
- LET'S DO IT.  I'M READY
WHENEVER YOU GUYS ARE.

154
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,083
- I GOT THIS.

155
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,583
- THERE'S AN EASIER WAY
TO SOLVE IT.  TRY USING

156
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,208
THIS EQUATION INSTEAD.
ONCE YOU SUBSTITUTE THIS ONE,

157
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,791
YOU CAN SEE HOW EASY
IT COMES TOGETHER.

158
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,416
- THIS WORD PROBLEM SHOULD BE
FAIRLY EASY.  WANT TO TRY?

159
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,833
- IT MAKES
MY BRAIN HURT.

160
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,375
- SEE?
PRETTY EASY, RIGHT?

161
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,000
- ( giggles )

162
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,208
- PERFECT.
HOPE THEY'RE HUNGRY.

163
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,791
- Ogata: WHOA!

164
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,666
DID YOU SERIOUSLY MAKE
ALL OF THIS BY YOURSELF?

165
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,416
- YEP, AND THERE'S SECONDS ON
THE RICE AND THE MISO SOUP.

166
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,458
- All: THANKS FOR DINNER,
YOSHIDA.

167
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,875
- OH, WOW, THIS MAY BE THE BEST
STIR-FRY I'VE EVER TASTED.

168
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,166
OMELET'S AWESOME TOO.

169
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,583
IT'S ALL SO GOOD, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO EAT NEXT.

170
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,625
- I HAD NO IDEA YOU ATE LIKE A
FREAKING KING EVERY DAY, SAKAI.

171
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,958
MAN, YOU ARE
ONE LUCKY BASTARD.

172
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,125
- SO HOW DOES IT TASTE,
SHANA?

173
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,208
- FINE.  IT'LL DO.

174
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,125
- HEY, KONOE, YOU WANT
TO SPLIT THIS WITH ME?

175
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,291
- OH, YES,
THANK YOU.

176
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,958
- ( all giggling )

177
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,083
- Ogata: IT REALLY WAS
DELICIOUS.

178
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,208
YOU'LL HAVE TO TEACH ME
A FEW TRICKS.

179
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,708
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO HELP.
I CAN HANDLE THE DISHES.

180
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,750
- OH, COME ON.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO

181
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,750
AFTER YOU COOKED US
SUCH AN AMAZING MEAL.

182
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,208
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO LEAVE
ALL THE CLEAN-UP TO YOU.

183
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,250
- NO BIG DEAL.
SATO HAS A DISHWASHER.

184
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,333
- YEAH, BUT THAT THING IS
A LITTLE TEMPERAMENTAL.

185
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,958
IF YOU DON'T LOAD IT
PERFECTLY,

186
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,833
THEN WATER STARTS
LEAKING OUT OF IT.

187
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,000
- IF YOU PUSH THAT BUTTON OVER
THERE, IT'LL TURN ON THE POWER.

188
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,750
I KNOW MY WAY
AROUND THIS PLACE.

189
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,458
SATO AND I
HAVE BEEN FRIENDS

190
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,583
SINCE WE WERE WAY BACK
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

191
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,375
TANAKA HUNG OUT
A LOT TOO.

192
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,666
OH, WOW,
I MISS THOSE DAYS.

193
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,000
WE DIDN'T HAVE A CARE
IN THE WORLD BACK THEN.

194
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,250
- ( moans )

195
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,291
HELP ME.

196
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,041
WATER.

197
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,375
- MARGERY?  OH, HEY.

198
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,291
- KAZUMI.

199
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,583
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

200
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,333
AND WHO IN THE HELL
ARE YOU?

201
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,083
- ( screaming )

202
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,541
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN "IT'S"

203
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,083
AND "ITS" WITHOUT
THE APOSTROPHE?

204
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,958
- WITH AN APOSTROPHE
IS A CONTRACTION.

205
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,791
WITHOUT AN APOSTROPHE,
"ITS" IS POSSESSIVE.

206
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,958
- BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN
TO USE ONE OR THE OTHER?

207
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,458
- WELL, THAT IS DEPENDENT UPON
THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR SENTENCE.

208
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,416
- WELL, CAN'T YOU GIVE ME SOME
KIND OF EXAMPLE OR SOMETHING?

209
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,666
( screams )

210
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,875
DAMN IT, SATO, STOP BEING LAZY
AND STUDY WITH US!

211
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,875
- THE DINNER
MADE ME SO TIRED.

212
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,416
- I SWEAR YOU ARE
TOTALLY HOPELESS, MAN.

213
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,875
WHAT'S TAKING OGATA
AND YOSHIDA SO LONG?

214
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,958
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM.
OGATA'S BEEN HERE

215
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,041
MILLIONS OF TIMES, SO IT'S NOT
LIKE THEY'RE GONNA GET LOST.

216
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,916
- BUT IT'S BEEN 30 MINUTES.
DISHES SHOULDN'T TAKE THAT LONG.

217
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,208
- UH, HOLD UP A SEC, KONOE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

218
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,916
- I'M GOING
TO CHECK ON THEM.

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,916
- WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME DO THAT?

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,083
- BUT IF THEY'RE STILL CLEANING,
I SHOULD HELP THEM,

221
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,166
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOSHIDA COOKED
SUCH A DELICIOUS MEAL.

222
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,208
- I'LL GO TOO.  BET THEY COULD
USE AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS.

223
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,375
- Shana: I'LL GO WITH HER.

224
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,208
YUJI, YOU STAY HERE
AND STUDY.

225
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,333
- UH, EXCUSE ME.

226
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,041
- I AM NOT GONNA LET HER
BE ALONE WITH YUJI.

227
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,125
Shana:
THIS IS BIZARRE.

228
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,875
YOSHIDA WOULD NEVER ABANDON
THE DISHES HALFWAY THROUGH.

229
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,458
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

230
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,583
- I THOUGHT I'D GO AHEAD
AND CLEAN UP THE REST.

231
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,791
- YOU DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

232
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,791
( sighs ) YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
WASHED DISHES BEFORE, HAVE YOU?

233
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,791
FIRST, YOU HAVE TO
TURN ON THE WATER.

234
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,750
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

235
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,541
JUST WATCH ME.

236
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,708
NEXT, YOU GOTTA PUT SOAP
ON THE SPONGE.

237
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,375
IF YOUR HANDS GET MESSY,
JUST GRAB A PAPER TOWEL.

238
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,583
- ( ice clinks )
- SO WHAT BRINGS YOU

239
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,875
TO THIS NECK OF THE WOODS,
MISS OMEGA?

240
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,500
- MY NAME IS OGATA--
MATAKE OGATA.

241
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,500
- THESE JAPANESE NAMES
ARE HARD TO REMEMBER.

242
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,750
THEY ALL
SOUND THE SAME.

243
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,750
- KAZUMI, YOU AREN'T FRIENDS
WITH THIS CRAZY LADY, ARE YOU?

244
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,375
- WELL, KINDA.

245
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,458
- ( groans )
WHAT IS HER DEAL?

246
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,125
SHE'S ACTING LIKE
SHE OWNS THE PLACE,

247
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,541
AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN
LIVE HERE.

248
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,166
- UM, I DON'T KNOW.

249
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,541
- THE NAME'S MARGERY DAW.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

250
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,958
HERE'S A THOUGHT: YOU GOT
A QUESTION-- JUST ASK IT.

251
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,791
- ALL RIGHT THEN.
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN TANAKA?

252
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,333
- OGATA.

253
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,625
- THAT WAS RUDE.
I'M SORRY.

254
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,666
- ( chuckles ) I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

255
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,000
- JUST ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

256
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,458
I SAW YOU TOGETHER.
YOU AND TANAKA

257
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,166
WERE WALKING SIDE BY SIDE
AT THE MISAGO FESTIVAL.

258
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,541
- YOU SAW KEISAKU
WITH US TOO, RIGHT?

259
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,208
NO NEED TO WORRY.

260
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,083
I LIKE THE TWO OF THEM,
BUT NOT ROMANTICALLY.

261
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,125
I CAME TO THIS CITY ON BUSINESS
RATHER UNEXPECTEDLY.

262
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,916
KEISAKU WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO OFFER ME A PLACE TO STAY

263
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,083
UNTIL I CAN ARRANGE A SUITABLE
RESIDENCE OF MY OWN.

264
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,416
IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE THOSE
TWO HELPING ME WITH ODD JOBS

265
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,666
EVERY NOW AND THEN,
BUT THAT'S AS FAR AS IT GOES.

266
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,458
- IS IT NOW?
- YEP.

267
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,166
THEY MAY FEEL MORE FOR ME
THAN I DO THEM,

268
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,375
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
THAT KIND OF LOVE.

269
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,750
THEY THINK OF ME
MORE LIKE A SISTER.

270
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,916
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES.
IT'S PURELY INNOCENT.

271
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,875
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
ROMANTIC LOVE OR AFFECTION.

272
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,166
THEY SIMPLY ADMIRE ME
AS YOUNG PEOPLE

273
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,458
OFTEN ADMIRE THEIR ELDERS.
YOU GET IT NOW?

274
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,583
SO TELL ME, WHAT'S A CUTE GIRL
LIKE YOURSELF SEE IN THAT

275
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,000
BIG OAF ANYWAY?  EITA'S NOT
EXACTLY THE SMARTEST KID AROUND.

276
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,208
- I DON'T KNOW.  WE'RE FRIENDS.
I'M SO SORRY I WAS RUDE.

277
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,416
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I UNDERSTAND.

278
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,541
JEALOUSY IS JUST ANOTHER PART
OF BEING IN LOVE.

279
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,541
LOVE IS LIKE A MIRROR
THAT REFLECTS

280
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,583
BOTH YOUR GOOD
AND BAD SIDES,

281
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,541
ESPECIALLY IF YOUR LOVE
IS UNREQUITED.

282
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,791
THEN YOU CAN BECOME ENVIOUS,
JEALOUS, EVEN RESENTFUL.

283
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,166
IT CAN BE TOUGH.  YOU HAVE TO
FACE ALL KINDS OF EMOTIONS.

284
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,958
- HAVE YOU FELT
THAT WAY?

285
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,291
- WE ALL HAVE.  THERE'S NO
REASON TO FEEL ASHAMED.

286
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:49,333
IT JUST SHOWS HOW SERIOUS
YOU ARE ABOUT THE ONE YOU LOVE.

287
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,916
TELL YOU WHAT:
I'LL SHARE THE SECRET OF HOW

288
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,166
TO GET THROUGH THIS JEALOUSY
CRAP WITHOUT LOSING YOUR MIND.

289
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,166
TO BE HONEST, IT'S NOT
ALL THAT DIFFICULT.

290
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,583
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
PERSON.  IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

291
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,250
AND DON'T MAKE
ANY HARSH JUDGMENTS,

292
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,166
'CAUSE THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM.

293
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,166
WELL, BEST OF LUCK,
YOUNG MAIDENS.

294
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,583
I HOPE IT WORKS OUT.

295
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,000
- JEEZ, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON AROUND HERE?

296
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,666
WHERE DID ALL THE GIRLS
RUN OFF TO?

297
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,125
THIS TURNED INTO
A TOTAL SAUSAGE FEST.

298
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,125
- IT IS TAKING THEM
A LONG TIME TO CLEAN UP.

299
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,916
SHOULD WE CHECK ON 'EM?
- NAH, I'D LEAVE THEM BE.

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,166
THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST
SHARING SOME GIRL TALK.

301
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,000
- I'M NOT SAYING
I'M GOING IN THERE.

302
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,583
- IT'S NICE AND QUIET.

303
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,208
I LIKE HANGING OUT WITH JUST
THE BOYS SOMETIMES.

304
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,875
WE SHOULDN'T TAKE
THESE TIMES FOR GRANTED.

305
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,125
WE'LL ALL GO
OUR OWN WAYS SOON.

306
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,291
WE MAY NEVER GET TO SIT
TOGETHER LIKE THIS AGAIN.

307
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,291
- Yuji: SATO'S WORDS
REALLY STRUCK ME.

308
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,916
HE WAS RIGHT.

309
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,333
I DIDN'T PLAN ON STAYING
IN MISAKI CITY FOREVER.

310
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,541
THIS MOMENT
MAY NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

311
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,208
- WHAT'S WITH YOU, GUYS?

312
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,708
YOU'RE ALL QUIET AND DEPRESSED
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

313
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,208
- ( bang )
- ( girls scream )

314
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,000
- SHANA!
- KONOE!

315
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,958
- THAT DISHWASHER.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

316
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,250
DID YOU FORGET TO TELL THEM
HOW TO LOAD IT?

317
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,250
AND WHY ARE THEY DOING DISHES?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD IT COVERED.

318
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,291
- WELL, WE STARTED,
BUT WE GOT DISTRACTED.

319
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,958
- HELP ME OUT, YUJI.
PLEASE JUST MAKE IT STOP.

320
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,083
- LET ME TRY
THE VALVE.

321
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,166
- ( sighs ) THAT SHOULD DO IT.
YOU OKAY?

322
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,750
- YEAH.
- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN EXACTLY?

323
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,500
- KONOE'S THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME TO.

324
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,500
- I DON'T MEAN TO LAUGH.
I'M SORRY,

325
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,458
BUT IT'S REALLY FUNNY.

326
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,750
- I'M GLAD EVERYONE'S OKAY.
I WAS KIND OF WORRIED

327
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,875
AFTER HEARING THOSE
BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS.

328
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,750
- KONOE'S LAUGHING,
SO I GUESS IT'S ALL GOOD.

329
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,500
- YEAH, BUT SHANA DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE SHE'S TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT.

330
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,958
- Marcosias: LOOKS LIKE
EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL.

331
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,250
GOOD JOB, MARGERY.
- I DIDN'T DO MUCH.

332
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,250
I JUST GAVE THEM SOME ADVICE
THAT HELPED ME

333
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,208
WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE.

334
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,541
- SERIOUSLY?
ADVICE YOU GOT AS A TEEN

335
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,500
IS STILL RELEVANT
AFTER HUNDREDS OF YEARS?

336
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,625
OW!
- STUPID MARCO, SHUT YOUR TRAP.

337
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,583
- ( clock chiming )

338
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,333
- TOTALLY BOMBED IT.
- YEAH, WE SHOULD'VE

339
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,833
GONE BACK TO STUDYING
AFTER THE WHOLE WATER INCIDENT.

340
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,500
- WIPE OFF THE FROWNY FACE.
OUR TEST SCORES AREN'T

341
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,750
THE ONLY THING THAT CAME OUT OF
OUR STUDY SESSION, TANAKA.

342
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,750
- THERE'S BEEN
A MAJOR CHANGE WITH KONOE.

343
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,916
SEEMS YOSHIDA AND SHANA
ARE BOTH MAKING ATTEMPTS

344
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,375
TO GET ALONG WITH HER.
WHERE DID THEY--?

345
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,375
- THEY WENT UP ON THE ROOF
AGAIN FOR A MINUTE.

346
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,375
- SOMETHING THEY NEEDED
TO TAKE CARE OF.

347
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,166
- THEY SAID
THEY'D BE RIGHT BACK,

348
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,166
SO THERE'S NO NEED TO WAIT FOR
THEM TO START EATING.

349
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,916
- THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
SAID THAT?

350
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,583
- SHE SAID
IT'S IMPORTANT

351
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,458
THAT WE ALL TRY AND
UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER.

352
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,708
SHE SAID THAT IF YOUR LOVE
IS UNREQUITED,

353
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,833
THEN SOMETIMES YOU START
TO FEEL JEALOUS OF OTHERS.

354
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,833
BUT THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE ASHAMED,

355
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,916
BECAUSE THAT JUST PROVES
HOW MUCH YOU REALLY CARE.

356
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,166
MARGERY SAID A LOT.
IT WAS ALL VERY HELPFUL.

357
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,125
- SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT
IN TELLING ME ALL THIS?

358
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,250
- IT'S INFO I THOUGHT
I SHOULD PASS ALONG,

359
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,708
'CAUSE I FELT THAT WAY
TOWARDS YOU

360
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,708
AND I DON'T WANT OUR
FRIENDSHIP TO BE RUINED

361
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,708
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
GET OVER IT.

362
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,541
- Shana: SO WE NEED TO TRY
TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER.

363
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:48,250
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND
YUJI'S DESIRE TO HELP KONOE

364
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,583
INSTEAD OF
GETTING JEALOUS OF THEM.

365
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,500
- ( running footsteps )
- COME ON, SHANA.

366
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,208
LET'S JOIN THE OTHERS
FOR LUNCH.

367
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,291
- I'LL HAVE TO BE
HARDER ON YOU

368
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,416
TO MAKE UP FOR YESTERDAY'S
MISSED TRAINING SESSION.

369
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,291
- IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?
I TOLD YOU, WE WERE STUDYING.

370
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,875
- I HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR THIS.
- Tiamat: EN GARDE.

371
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,000
- Shana: WILHELMINA.

372
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,500
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?

373
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,875
- WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF
TRAINING, MILADY.

374
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,166
- I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

375
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,541
I'M INTERESTED TO SEE JUST HOW
MUCH YOU'VE LEARNED FROM HER.

376
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,333
- I'LL DO MY BEST.
GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

377
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,125
- Shana:
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND YUJI

378
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,041
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
I FEEL.

379
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,125
BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT,
I WANT TO KNOW

380
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,791
HOW HE REALLY FEELS
ABOUT ME.

381
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,708
SO I'M GONNA STICK CLOSE TO HIM
UNTIL I FINALLY FIND OUT.

382
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,541
- ARE YOU READY?

383
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,833
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

384
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,333
- Yuji: MY BUDDY IKE
HAS ALREADY TOLD ME

385
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,000
HE'S GOT FEELINGS
FOR YOSHIDA,

386
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,000
BUT MAKING A CONFESSION OF LOVE
ISN'T EASY FOR ANYBODY,

387
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,666
NOT EVEN THE SMARTEST GUY
IN CLASS.

388
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,000
IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND MAKE IT
A LITTLE EASIER ON HIMSELF,

389
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,291
IKE COMES UP WITH A NEW PROJECT
AND PLANS IT OUT TO A TEE.

390
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,875
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II,"

391
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,375
"IKE HAYATO,
HIS DAY OF GLORY".
