1
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,583
- ( Alastor's voice )
A STUDY SESSION AT SATO'S HOUSE

2
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,750
BECAME AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR A LIFE LESSON

3
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,250
WHEN MARGERY OFFERED
WORDS OF WISDOM TO THE GIRLS.

4
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,833
SHANA AND KAZUMI
HAD BEEN UNEASY

5
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,708
EVER SINCE FUMINA KONOE
TRANSFERRED TO THEIR SCHOOL.

6
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,375
BUT MARGERY'S ADVICE
HELPED THEM SET ASIDE

7
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,625
THEIR JEALOUSY OF THE NEW GIRL
AND OF ONE ANOTHER.

8
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,208
- ( upbeat song playing )

9
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,791
- DEPARTURE TIME--
CHECK.

10
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,833
DIRECTIONS TO DESTINATION--
CHECK.

11
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,750
A DESCRIPTION OF EVERY RIDE,
INCLUDING ITS LOCATION

12
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,041
AND RELEVANT WARNINGS--
CHECK.

13
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,250
THE LOCATIONS OF
AND DIRECTIONS TO

14
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,875
THE FOOD COURT
AND BATHROOMS-- CHECK.

15
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,458
AND NOW THE FINAL
VARIABLE--

16
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,833
THE WEATHER TOMORROW
FOR MISAKI AND OUTO.

17
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,958
CHECK.

18
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,708
THIS IS PERFECT.
EVERYTHING'S READY.

19
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,333
I'VE PLANNED FOR
EVERY CONTINGENCY.

20
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,333
NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW,

21
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,458
KONOE AND THE REST OF THE GANG
WILL HAVE AN AWESOME TIME.

22
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,958
HOPEFULLY, EVERYTHING GOES
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

23
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,125
'CAUSE THEN

24
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:46,166
I'LL RIDE THE FERRIS WHEEL
WITH YOSHIDA AT MY SIDE.

25
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,458
ALL RIGHT.
LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE'S HERE.

26
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,875
GLAD TO SEE
NONE OF YOU WERE LATE.

27
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,666
- WHO WOULD HAVE DARED?

28
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,916
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH ROOM
TO DEVIATE FROM THE PLAN.

29
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,083
YOU TOLD US
WHICH BUS TO TAKE

30
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,291
AND THE EXACT TIME
THE TRAIN WOULD BE LEAVING.

31
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,083
AND YOU CALLED AGAIN YESTERDAY,
JUST TO REMIND US.

32
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,208
- YEAH, NOTHING LIKE
AN EARLY MORNING WAKE-UP CALL.

33
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,708
IF WE HAD BEEN LATE,
YOU WOULD HAVE FREAKED.

34
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,166
- HE CALLED YOU?

35
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,208
- YEAH, BUT WILHELMINA
ANSWERED THE PHONE.

36
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,208
- Hayato: Yeah, we'll all
buy our tickets

37
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,541
at the entrance gate
when we get there.

38
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,375
- HOW MUCH TIME
WILL THAT REQUIRE?

39
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,625
- Two to three minutes.

40
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,625
- HE DIDN'T GIVE ME
ANY DETAILED PLAN LIKE THAT.

41
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,250
- I'M BETTING THAT'S BECAUSE HE
KNOWS YOU'RE THE MOST ORGANIZED.

42
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,750
- WE SHOULDN'T HARP ON HIM
JUST FOR BEING PREPARED.

43
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,833
ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS
IS WE'RE HERE NOW.

44
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,000
TODAY'S AN IMPORTANT DAY.

45
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,708
IT'S KONOE'S FIRST TIME
AT AN AMUSEMENT PARK.

46
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,333
IT NEEDS
TO BE AWESOME.

47
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,833
THAT WAY SHE'LL REMEMBER
HOW MUCH FUN SHE HAD.

48
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,583
- NO WORRIES.

49
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,833
I HAVE A LIST OF THINGS
FOR US TO DO.

50
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,000
IF YOU FAIL TO PLAN,
THEN YOU ARE PLANNING TO FAIL.

51
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,000
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED
THAT SAYING.

52
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,583
- MAN, YOU'RE SO SMART.

53
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,333
- HE JUST LOOKS SMART
'CAUSE OF THOSE GLASSES.

54
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,666
- YAY, HERE'S TO THE
SMARTEST-LOOKING GUY IN TOWN.

55
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,916
- ( all laugh )

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,083
- PLEASE.
IT WAS NOTHING.

57
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,916
- ALL RIGHT,
I GOT YOSHIDA'S ATTENTION--

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,750
ONE MORE THING
ACCOMPLISHED.

59
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,791
NOW TO SHOW HER
WHAT A RELIABLE LEADER I AM.

60
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,875
THAT'S SURE
TO IMPRESS HER.

61
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,083
- OKAY, IT'S TIME
TO GET STARTED.

62
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,333
EVERYONE FOLLOW ME
INTO THE PARK.

63
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,666
- LEAD ON, IKE.

64
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,833
WHICH RIDE
ARE WE GOING ON FIRST?

65
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,625
THE HAUNTED MANOR?
THE AFRICAN SAFARI BOAT?

66
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,375
OR SHOULD WE JUMP
RIGHT TO THE COASTERS?

67
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,000
- NOW WE DON'T WANT
TO SCARE KONOE.

68
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,625
WE'LL SAVE THAT
FOR LATER.

69
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,333
I KNOW-- LET'S GIVE HER
A TOUR OF THE PARK FIRST.

70
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,375
WHAT BETTER WAY
TO SOAK UP THE ATMOSPHERE?

71
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,875
LET'S NOT FORGET,
TODAY'S ALL ABOUT HER.

72
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,416
WE HAVE TO TREAT HER
LIKE OUR HONORED GUEST.

73
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,583
I MADE SURE WE COULD
TAKE OUR TIME TODAY.

74
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,208
I WANT HER TO ENJOY
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

75
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,791
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
- YEAH, GOOD THINKING.

76
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,833
- I'VE TAKEN A LOOK
AT THE PARK MAP

77
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,083
AND DETERMINED THE PERFECT ROUTE
FOR US TO FOLLOW.

78
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,791
FIRST, WE'LL TAKE A STROLL
PAST THE MAIN ATTRACTIONS.

79
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,791
I'VE SELECTED
AN EXCELLENT PATH.

80
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,458
IT'S FAST
AND THE SCENERY IS--

81
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,208
- Eita: HEY,
WHERE'D KONOE GO?

82
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,250
- KONOE, DO YOU WANT TO GO
ON THIS RIDE?

83
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,750
- YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE
A LOT OF FUN.

84
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,166
- I THINK THAT ONE'S MEANT
FOR LITTLE KIDS.

85
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,833
- WELL, IKE?
- NO PROBLEM.

86
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,958
I DIDN'T INCLUDE THIS RIDE
IN MY INITIAL PLANS,

87
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,166
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE HAVE TO SKIP IT EITHER.

88
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,166
GO ON, KONOE.

89
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,541
WE CAME HERE TODAY
TO SHOW YOU A GOOD TIME.

90
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,541
YOU CAN RIDE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

91
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,708
- WELL, IN THAT CASE...

92
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,250
- THIS IS HUMILIATING.
WHY DO WE HAVE TO RIDE IT TOO?

93
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,125
- BE A GOOD SPORT.
THIS IS WHAT KONOE WANTED.

94
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,958
- IT'S MORE FUN
IF EVERYBODY RIDES TOGETHER.

95
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,125
- UH, YEAH, I GUESS SO.

96
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,750
- HOW EMBARRASSING.

97
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,791
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

98
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,208
I NEVER PREDICTED KONOE WOULD
WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

99
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,958
THE DAY'S JUST STARTED AND I'VE
ALREADY MADE A MAJOR MISTAKE.

100
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,250
- UM, IKE,

101
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,333
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
RIDING SOMETHING LIKE THIS

102
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,333
WILL MAKE YOU MOTION-SICK?
- NO.

103
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,916
I THINK I SHOULD BE OKAY.
- Woman: EVERYONE READY?

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,916
- Kids: YEAH.
- LET'S GO!

105
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,416
- I THOUGHT
THIS MIGHT HAPPEN.

106
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,416
YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

107
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,125
- WE HAVE NO CHANCE
OF SCORING, EVER.

108
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,166
- YEAH, RIGHT?  DO WE HAVE
TO TURN IN OUR MAN CARDS?

109
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,083
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE
UNDERESTIMATED THAT RIDE

110
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,166
JUST BECAUSE
IT'S FOR KIDS.

111
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,041
WHAT GOOD AM I
AS A LEADER

112
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,708
IF I CAN'T TELL WHICH RIDES
ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO GO ON?

113
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,791
- LET'S TRY
THAT ONE OVER THERE.

114
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,708
- IKE.

115
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,166
- UH, WE'VE GOT AN IDEA.
- A GOOD ONE.

116
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,458
- IT'S NOT THAT I MIND
SPLITTING UP INTO TWO GROUPS.

117
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,208
IT'S JUST WEIRD.
I ALWAYS SEEM TO END UP

118
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,333
WITH YOU GUYS.
AT LEAST SHANA'S WITH ME.

119
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,333
- WELL, WE DREW NAMES.
IT MUST BE FATE.

120
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,333
- I THINK
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

121
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:25,625
KONOE'S BETTER OFF WITH IKE,
SINCE HE'S THE ORGANIZER.

122
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,375
- TRUE.  AND WE'LL MEET BACK UP
WITH THEM AT LUNCH.

123
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,208
OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO DO UNTIL THEN?

124
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,125
HEY, SHANA.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO RIDE?

125
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,083
- I DON'T KNOW.

126
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,708
HEY LET'S GO
ON THAT.

127
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,000
- THE BUNGEE?

128
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,541
- THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS AMUSEMENT PARK

129
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,833
IS THEY OFFER A VARIETY
OF SWEET TREATS.

130
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,541
SPEAKING OF,

131
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,291
THERE'S AN AMAZING CHEESECAKE
SHOP HERE WE SHOULD TRY.

132
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,958
UH, HOW ABOUT ICE CREAM?

133
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,000
THERE'S STILL
THE JAPANESE SWEET SHOP.

134
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,916
NO WAY.
I KNOW I SAW IT.

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,416
BUT I CAN'T FIND IT
ON THE MAP.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,958
- EH, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

137
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,750
- I'M REAL SORRY.

138
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,125
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME TODAY.

139
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,250
TOO MANY MISTAKES
AND NOT ENOUGH RESEARCH.

140
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,833
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH
TO BE GROUPED WITH YOSHIDA,

141
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,041
BUT I'M MAKING
A TOTAL MESS OF IT.

142
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,208
- I KNOW
IT LOOKS SCARY,

143
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,875
BUT ROLLERCOASTERS ARE
ACTUALLY A WHOLE LOT OF FUN.

144
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,333
- A ROLLERCOASTER?  HUH.

145
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,041
WELL, I'LL GO ON IT
IF YOU RIDE BESIDE ME.

146
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,291
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO IT.

147
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,083
- WELL, ACCORDING TO
MY RESEARCH,

148
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,375
THIS PARTICULAR COASTER
TENDS TO BE LESS CROWDED

149
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,375
IN THE MORNING
THAN IN THE AFTERNOON.

150
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,416
SO NOW'S OUR CHANCE.
LET'S GO.

151
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,166
NO!  THE LINE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE SHORTER THAN THIS.

152
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,375
IMPOSSIBLE!
- HECK OF A LINE.

153
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,750
- IS THIS WHAT THEY CONSIDER
LESS CROWDED?

154
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,958
- Yuji: IT'S RARE FOR IKE
TO MISJUDGE LIKE THIS.

155
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,125
- Kazumi: HE'S USUALLY
SO ACCURATE ABOUT EVERYTHING.

156
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,250
- WHAT HAPPENED?

157
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,458
I GATHERED ANY DATA THAT WAS
EVEN REMOTELY RELEVANT

158
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,791
AND ANALYZED IT
MULTIPLE TIMES.

159
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,250
WHERE COULD I HAVE
GONE WRONG?

160
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,583
IT'S A LOST CAUSE.
I'VE MADE SUCH A FOOL OF MYSELF.

161
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,291
I CAN'T POSSIBLY
ASK YOSHIDA

162
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,125
TO RIDE THE FERRIS WHEEL
WITH ME NOW.

163
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,833
I HAVE TO THINK.

164
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,333
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
I CAN DO TO SAVE FACE.

165
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,166
- IT'S UP TO YOU, KONOE.

166
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,250
WE CAN WAIT IN THAT LONG LINE
OR WE CAN TRY AGAIN LATER.

167
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,666
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE.
- DON'T GIVE UP, YOU GUYS.

168
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,458
IT'S ALL GOOD.  I GOT THIS.
I'LL WAIT IN LINE

169
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,125
AND YOU CAN GO ENJOY
ALL THAT THE PARK HAS TO OFFER.

170
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,666
- ( Hayato's voice )
WELL, I TRIED TO PLAY THE HERO,

171
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,958
BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
YOSHIDA WAS ESPECIALLY TOUCHED

172
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,166
BY MY GRAND GESTURE.

173
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,875
I GUESS
IT WAS WORTH A TRY.

174
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,875
BUT I'VE MADE
SO MANY MISTAKES TODAY,

175
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,083
I SHOULDN'T EXPECT
TO MAKE UP FOR IT THAT EASILY.

176
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,666
( sighs )

177
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,166
I BET THE OTHERS
ARE HAVING FUN.

178
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,291
I SPENT SO MANY DAYS
RESEARCHING THIS.

179
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,291
I STAYED UP
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,

180
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,291
TRYING TO MAKE SURE
IT WAS PERFECT.

181
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,208
AND THIS IS
THE RESULT I GET?

182
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,416
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO GIVE UP.

183
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,708
YOSHIDA WILL NEVER WANT TO RIDE
THE FERRIS WHEEL WITH ME

184
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,916
AFTER HOW MUCH
I'VE SCREWED UP.

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
IT WOULD BE POINTLESS
TO ASK.

186
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,666
I TOOK ON
MORE THAN I COULD HANDLE.

187
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,375
BIG PLANS
MEAN BIG FAILURES.

188
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,166
- THANK YOU.

189
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,291
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE LONELY,
WAITING HERE BY YOURSELF.

190
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,208
SAKAI'S OFF
LOOKING AFTER KONOE.

191
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,875
- OH, THAT'S COOL.

192
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
- IKE, DON'T
STRESS YOURSELF OUT.

193
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,208
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYONE ELSE'S GOOD TIME.

194
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,291
- OH, YOSHIDA,
YOU'RE SO KIND TO ME,

195
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,583
WHEN I'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT MAKE MISTAKES.

196
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,083
- Kazumi: YEAH, SO...

197
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,708
DO YOU GET MOTION-SICK
ON ROLLERCOASTERS TOO?

198
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,000
- YEAH, I DO,
PRETTY BAD.

199
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,625
BUT I FIGURED YOU GUYS
COULD GO WITHOUT ME.

200
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,500
I'LL JUST WAIT
AT THE EXIT.

201
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,291
- OH.

202
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,125
SO ARE THERE ANY RIDES HERE
THAT DON'T MAKE YOU SICK?

203
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,750
- WELL, THE FERRIS WHEEL'S
FINE.

204
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,208
- THE FERRIS WHEEL?
- MM-HMM.

205
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,250
I WENT ON ONE
BACK IN KINDERGARTEN,

206
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,500
AND IT WAS THE ONE RIDE
I WAS OKAY ON.

207
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,125
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS JUST TOO FAST, SO...

208
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,416
SO I WAS WONDERING--

209
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,083
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,
I THOUGHT MAYBE

210
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:56,000
AFTER YOU GUYS GET OFF
THE ROLLERCOASTER WITH KONOE--

211
00:12:56,083 --> 00:13:00,041
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D RIDE
ON THE FERRIS WHEEL WITH ME.

212
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,416
- UM, SURE.

213
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,125
- ( people screaming )

214
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,041
- SO MANY THRILL RIDES.
NEED A SEC.

215
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,958
- FOR REAL.

216
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,291
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS,
BUT MY BACK'S KILLING ME.

217
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,291
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN WALK.

218
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,666
- REALLY?

219
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,500
- Matake: YOU'RE SOMETHING,
SHANA.

220
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,333
YOU DON'T FLINCH AT ANY RIDE,
NO MATTER HOW SCARY IT IS.

221
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,208
YOU'RE LIKE A SUPERHERO.

222
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,666
- YEAH.

223
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,791
- I SEE NO REASON
TO BE AFRAID.

224
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,958
EACH RIDE'S SPEED
AND CENTRIPETAL FORCE

225
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,000
ARE SET FOR HARMLESS
ENTERTAINMENT.

226
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,333
AND THEY EXPECT IT
TO BE SCARY?

227
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,958
- HEY, I'LL GO GET THE OTHERS
AND BRING THEM HERE.

228
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,250
- THAT'LL WORK.  TELL THEM
IT'S MOVING PRETTY FAST NOW.

229
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,458
- OKAY.

230
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,791
- ACCORDING TO
MY CALCULATIONS,

231
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,750
THIS COASTER HAS A 32-PERSON
CAPACITY PER RUN.

232
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,875
SO OUR TURN SHOULD COME
IN THREE OR FOUR ROUNDS.

233
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,291
THEY SHOULD MAKE IT
JUST IN TIME.

234
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,041
WAIT.  OH, NO.

235
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,291
WHAT IF THEY
DON'T MAKE IT?

236
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,291
THEN I'LL HAVE
TO RIDE.

237
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,708
- ( people screaming )

238
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,416
- I DON'T HAVE LUCK
WITH COASTERS.

239
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,416
THAT ONE TIME,
I GOT SO SICK AFTERWARDS,

240
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,625
I HAD TO SKIP SCHOOL
THE NEXT DAY.

241
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,541
AND THAT OTHER TIME, THEY HAD
TO CART ME OFF IN AN AMBULANCE.

242
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,666
NO, I HAVE TO STAY CALM.

243
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,000
IF I LEAVE THE LINE NOW, KONOE
WILL MISS HER CHANCE TO RIDE IT.

244
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,333
WORSE, YOSHIDA
MIGHT DECIDE

245
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,041
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RIDE THE
FERRIS WHEEL WITH ME AFTER ALL.

246
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,166
IT'S OKAY.
SHE'LL FIND THEM

247
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,416
AND THEY'LL MAKE IT BACK
IN TIME.  THEY WILL.

248
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,416
THEY HAVE TO.

249
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,416
- EXCUSE ME.
COMING THROUGH.

250
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,791
THE GROUP UP AT THE FRONT
DECIDED NOT TO RIDE,

251
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,500
SO THE LINE'S
MOVED UP A BIT.

252
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,083
EVERYONE IN FRONT OF THE ROPE
GOES NEXT.

253
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,333
- HUH?

254
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,375
- ( people screaming )

255
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,416
- THAT'S STRANGE.

256
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,416
THAT SCREAM SOUNDED
JUST LIKE IKE.

257
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,000
- YOSHIDA, ARE WE
ALMOST UP IN LINE?

258
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,000
- YEAH, WE SHOULD START
HEADING OVER THERE.

259
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,041
- I'M SORRY WE MISSED IT.
- DON'T BE.

260
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,541
I DIDN'T THINK THE LINE
WOULD MOVE SO FA--

261
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,000
( hiccups )

262
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,875
- POOR GUY.

263
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,875
- I'M SO SORRY, KONOE.

264
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,041
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANTED
TO RIDE THE ROLLERCOASTER.

265
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,958
- YEAH,
SO ABOUT THAT, IKE:

266
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,291
THE LINE'S DOWN TO, LIKE,
NOTHING RIGHT NOW.

267
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,750
-  ( screaming )

268
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,666
- I SEE.  THE NEW MAGIC SHOW
IS ABOUT TO START.

269
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,666
THAT'S WHY THE LINE
FOR THE COASTER

270
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,833
IS SO SHORT
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

271
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,958
ALL RIGHT, I QUIT.
I RELINQUISH MY DREAM.

272
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,875
GOODBYE, FERRIS WHEEL RIDE
WITH YOSHIDA.

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,541
- WOW, WHAT A GLORIOUS DAY.

274
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,166
- WOW, SHE'S AMAZING!

275
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,958
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

276
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,416
YOU GOT THE HIGHEST SCORE
IN THE PARK'S HISTORY.

277
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,625
YOU WON A PRIZE!

278
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,291
- UH, THANKS.

279
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,041
- AWESOME.
THAT WAS SOME SHOW.

280
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,458
YOU ROCKED IT,
SERIOUSLY.

281
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,166
MAN, YOU REALLY ARE
LIKE A SUPERHERO.

282
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,166
- Alastor: BE CAREFUL.
YOU SHOULD NOT

283
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,458
EXPEND YOUR STRENGTH
WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE.

284
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,291
- IF I WERE HER, I'D USE THAT
STRENGTH TO MY ADVANTAGE.

285
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,291
- MM-HMM.
- OH?

286
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,541
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT WAS INSANE.

287
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,666
SHE TOTALLY SLASHED 'EM ALL
AND WON A PRIZE.

288
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,083
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

289
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,166
- WOW, I WISH
I COULD HAVE SEEN THAT.

290
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,583
- I KNOW, RIGHT?  SERIOUSLY,
IT WAS FREAKING AMAZING.

291
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,583
I COULDN'T WAIT
TO TELL YOU GUYS.

292
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,750
- UH, SHANA.
- CHILL OUT.  I WAS HAVING FUN.

293
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,583
- HEY, WHAT'S WITH HIM?
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

294
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,125
- I GUESS HE'S WALLOWING
IN SELF-LOATHING

295
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,708
'CAUSE HIS PLANS
FELL APART.

296
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,000
- HE'S NOT USED
TO FAILING.

297
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,958
- Fumina: UM, IKE?

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,583
I BROUGHT A BAG OF HOMEMADE
COOKIES FOR EVERYBODY.

299
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,583
I HOPE THEY'RE NOT
TOO SMOOSHED.

300
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,458
THINK THIS MIGHT
CHEER YOU UP?

301
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,791
- DELICIOUS.

302
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,541
- FOR YOU AND YOU.

303
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,708
- YES.  SHE HASN'T
FORSAKEN ME AFTER ALL.

304
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,833
SHE GAVE ME
MY COOKIES FIRST.

305
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,916
SHE MUST THINK
I'M SPECIAL.

306
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,458
THAT'S IT, I'M GONNA TRY THIS
ONE MORE TIME.

307
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,583
- GUYS, I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE
THE AFTERNOON PLAN.

308
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,875
IN FOUR GROUPS OF TWO,

309
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,708
WE'RE GONNA RACE EACH OTHER
THROUGH THE GIANT MAZE.

310
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,875
- THE RULES ARE SIMPLE.

311
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,666
THE PAIR THAT REACHES THE EXIT
FIRST IS THE WINNER.

312
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,541
THE PRIZE IS A SOFT-SERVE ICE
CREAM BOUGHT BY ALL THE LOSERS.

313
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,708
- HOW'D HE GO FROM DEPRESSED
TO MOTIVATED ALL OF A SUDDEN?

314
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,583
- WHO KNOWS?
- WHO CARES?

315
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,833
LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS--
FREE ICE CREAM.

316
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,458
- LET'S SHOW 'EM HOW IT'S DONE.
- YEAH.

317
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,833
- OKAY.

318
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,000
READY?  BEGIN!

319
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,916
- I HAVE A FEELING
YOUR ANALYTICAL THINKING

320
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,666
IS GONNA
COME IN HANDY.

321
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,000
IN FACT, IT MIGHT GIVE US
A LEG UP ON THE OTHER TEAMS.

322
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,958
- "MIGHT" ISN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

323
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,375
- OH.

324
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,666
- WE'RE GONNA
WIN THIS RACE OR ELSE.

325
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,291
- HE'S SO SERIOUS.

326
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,791
MUST BE A BIG FAN
OF SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM.

327
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,125
- I HAVEN'T SEEN A GIANT MAZE
LIKE THIS IN A WHILE.

328
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,833
- WELL, THIS IS AN OLDER
AMUSEMENT PARK.

329
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,125
BUT I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
GONE THROUGH HERE.

330
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,083
- I'M NO GOOD
AT THIS SORT OF THING.

331
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,666
- UH, GUESS NOT.

332
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,583
- Keisaku: HEY, CAN I
ASK YOU A QUESTION?

333
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,708
- WHAT?
- COULD I DO IT TOO?

334
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,000
BECOME A FLAME HAZE,
I MEAN.

335
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,041
- Alastor: WHY WOULD YOU
ASK SUCH A THING?

336
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,708
- WELL, I--

337
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,625
- OKAY, WHICH WAY
DO WE GO NOW?

338
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,416
- I DON'T KNOW.

339
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,666
- MAYBE THIS WAY?

340
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,041
OR...

341
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,291
- SO GO THAT WAY?

342
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,916
THANK YOU.

343
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,541
- WE APPRECIATE IT, SIR.

344
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,833
- WEIRDEST THEME PARK EVER.

345
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,791
- WOW, IKE, YOU HAVEN'T
GOTTEN US LOST ONCE.

346
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,791
- IF WE GET LOST,
WE CAN'T WIN.

347
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,500
AND LOSING TO THE OTHERS
IS NOT AN OPTION.

348
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,125
- ( Hayato's voice )
IT'S NOT LIKE I KNOW THE ROUTE

349
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,958
OR ANYTHING.
I CAN JUST SENSE IT.

350
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,458
MY INTUITION'S LEADING ME
TOWARDS THE EXIT.

351
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,583
WE'RE ALMOST THERE,
I CAN FEEL IT.

352
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,750
I'M PUTTING EVERYTHING I HAVE
INTO THIS ONE MOMENT.

353
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,750
- YOSHIDA, I ASKED YOU
SOMETHING

354
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,791
WHILE WE WERE IN LINE
FOR THE COASTER.

355
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,041
DO YOU REMEMBER?
- RIDING THE FERRIS WHEEL?

356
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,791
- IF WE'RE ABLE
TO WIN THIS RACE

357
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,250
AND GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE THE OTHERS,

358
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,083
TO CELEBRATE
OUR VICTORY,

359
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,750
I'D STILL LIKE YOU TO RIDE
THE FERRIS WHEEL WITH ME.

360
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,541
- IT'S ALMOST OUR TURN.
- YEAH.

361
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,791
- ( Hayato's voice )
I'M GLAD I DIDN'T GIVE UP.

362
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,500
SURE, I MADE A FEW
PLANNING MISTAKES,

363
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,166
BUT IF I CAN GO ON THIS RIDE
WITH YOSHIDA,

364
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,833
IT WON'T MATTER ANYMORE.

365
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,958
IT'S ALMOST TIME.

366
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,833
THIS WILL BE A MEMORY
ONLY THE TWO OF US WILL SHARE.

367
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,416
IF I'M REALLY LUCKY,
THIS SPECIAL MOMENT

368
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,708
MIGHT BE THE FIRST
OF MANY

369
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,541
THAT WE'LL SHARE TOGETHER
FOR THE REST OF OUR YEARS.

370
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,791
- ( Hayato retching )

371
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:25,250
- Kazumi: IKE, IKE!
OH GOSH, HANG ON.

372
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,000
- I'M SORRY.

373
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,791
- HE THOUGHT
THE FERRIS WHEEL

374
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,791
WOULDN'T BE
A MOTION SICKNESS ISSUE,

375
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,500
BUT HE GOT ALL QUEASY
HALFWAY THROUGH.

376
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,833
- Hayato: I SWEAR, WHEN I
RODE IT BACK IN KINDERGARTEN,

377
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,375
IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME
AT ALL.

378
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,666
- Yuji: MAYBE IT'S GETTING WORSE
AS YOU GET OLDER.

379
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,500
- MAYBE.
( gagging )

380
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,375
- ( Hayato's voice ) ALL DAY,
RIGHT TO THE VERY END,

381
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,041
I'VE MADE A FOOL OF MYSELF
IN FRONT OF YOSHIDA.

382
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,291
I WAS A CRAPPY
ORGANIZER.

383
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,458
I GOT ALL DEPRESSED
AND PATHETIC.

384
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,875
AND THEN I THREW UP
ON THE FERRIS WHEEL.

385
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,958
I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING RIGHT.

386
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,375
- WHAT IS IT, KONOE?

387
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,125
- IKE, YOU'RE THE BEST
ORGANIZER.

388
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,958
I HAD SO MUCH FUN TODAY.
THANK YOU.

389
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,000
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

390
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,250
- YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
SURE, SOME THINGS WENT WRONG,

391
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,958
BUT ALL THAT MATTERS IS
KONOE HAD A GOOD TIME.

392
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,541
- Keisaku: WE ABOUT
READY TO GO?

393
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,375
- Eita: THEY'RE GONNA
LOCK US IN.

394
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,791
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

395
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,750
FANCY PARK DOESN'T CLOSE
ITS GATES THAT QUICKLY.

396
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,416
THEY WAIT AN HOUR
AFTER EVERYTHING SHUTS DOWN.

397
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
- Masake: YAY!  THAT'S THE IKE
WE KNOW AND LOVE.

398
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,500
- ( all laughing )

399
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,666
- ( Hayato's voice )
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.

400
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,958
I'LL HAVE TO ADD THAT ONE
TO MY LIST OF FAVORITE SAYINGS.

401
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,958
- ( upbeat song playing )

402
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,125
- ( Yuji's voice )
