1
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,583
Alastor: 
YUJI DECIDED IT'S BEST

2
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,833
HE LEAVE MISAKI CITY
WITH SHANA.

3
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,750
HOWEVER, HE WAS SURPRISED
BY THE REACTION

4
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:01,125
BOTH KAZUMI YOSHIDA
AND SHANA HAD TO THE NEWS.

5
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,625
STUNNED, YUJI WENT FOR A WALK
TO CLEAR HIS THOUGHTS

6
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:08,583
AND CAME FACE TO FACE
WITH A MYSTERIOUS DENIZEN.

7
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,708
- ( theme music playing )


8
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

9
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,083
- PLEASED TO MAKE 
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

10
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,458
MY NAME IS ZAROVEE.

11
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,750
I AM KNOWN
AS THE COLLATION FLUX.

12
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,750
( laughing )

13
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:54,041
- YOU'RE A... DENIZEN?!

14
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,041
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,250
MY SENSES ARE SHARPER NOW.

16
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,916
WHY WASN'T I ABLE TO SENSE
THIS GUY'S PRESENCE?

17
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,333
IT MUST BE BECAUSE
HIS EXISTENCE IS PRETTY WEAK.

18
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,750
I DOUBT EVEN SHANA
OR WILHELMINA COULD SENSE HIM.

19
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,958
- NO NEED TO GLARE AT US
LIKE THAT, BOY.

20
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,541
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY.
WE DON'T POSE ANY DANGER.

21
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,208
AT LEAST NOT TO YOU ANYWAY.

22
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,083
- STOP PLAYING GAMES.

23
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,833
JUST WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- I'M SAYING THAT,

24
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,708
WHILE YOU MAY
NOT BE IN DANGER,

25
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,333
THE REST OF YOUR CITY
IS ANOTHER STORY.

26
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:42,666
- NO WAY.
- WHAT IS THE POPULATION
OF MISAKI CITY?

27
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,416
ANY IDEA?
- BASTARD!

28
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,500
- ( grunting )

29
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,625
- WHOA.
BE CAREFUL, YOUNG MAN.

30
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,916
I'M WARNING YOU,
IF YOU DARE CAUSE US ANY HARM,

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,916
YOU WON'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH
TO REGRET IT.

32
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,750
- LET ME GUESS,
IF I TRY AND ATTACK YOU,

33
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,750
THE GUY YOU'VE GOT
HIDING IN TOWN

34
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,083
WILL START
CONSUMING PEOPLE'S SOULS.

35
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,708
- ( all grunting )

36
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,208
- ( horns honking )

37
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,041
( chuckles )

38
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,666
YES, THAT IS CORRECT.
IF YOU EVEN LAY A FINGER ON US,

39
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,583
I'LL SEND THE SIGNAL
TO OUR PINK FRIEND

40
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,375
TO EAT EVERY SOUL
HE COMES ACROSS.

41
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,125
YOU SEE NOW, BOY?

42
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,750
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D BE ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR.

43
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,291
YOU DON'T WANT
INNOCENT PEOPLE TO DIE.

44
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,875
- HE WAS ABLE TO CONFRONT
ME WITHOUT BEING SPOTTED.

45
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,291
YOU'RE A JAEGER
FROM BAL MASQUE.

46
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,625
- Both: HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?!

47
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,458
- I KNEW IT.

48
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,958
I'VE READ ABOUT THEM
IN DOCUMENTS FROM OUTLAW.

49
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,583
THEIR WEAK PRESENCE
MAKES THEM PERFECT

50
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,208
FOR COVERT OPERATIONS,

51
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,750
BUT NOT SO MUCH FOR BATTLE.

52
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,416
SO THEY USUALLY GET PARTNERED
WITH WANDERERS,

53
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,583
DENIZENS WHO SPECIALIZE
IN COMBAT MANEUVERS.

54
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,625
THE WANDERER CAN'T BE
TOO FAR AWAY.

55
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,791
WHY CAN'T I SENSE
ITS PRESENCE EITHER?

56
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,916
MUST BE
AN UNRESTRICTED SPELL.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,833
WISH I KNEW
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

58
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,000
BETTER PLAY ALONG
TILL I FIGURE IT OUT.

59
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,625
- I SUGGEST YOU DO
EXACTLY AS WE SAY.

60
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,041
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW
QUITE A BIT ABOUT US.

61
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,750
I'M SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF.

62
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,583
NOW, IF YOU WILL,
WE'D LIKE YOU TO WALK WITH US.

63
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:29,250
JOIN US, MYSTES YUJI SAKAI.

64
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,166
- THIS WEIRD FEELING
I KEEP GETTING.

65
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,750
IS IT 'CAUSE OF HIM?

66
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,750
- HOW'S THE REMEDY?
DOES IT TASTE OKAY?

67
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,166
- CERTAINLY
TASTES LIKE MEDICINE.
WHERE'S WILHELMINA?

68
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,083
- SHE'S MAKING SOUP
TO HELP YOU FEEL BETTER.

69
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,250
IT SHOULD BE GOOD.
- ( water boiling )

70
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,166
- OH, AND KAZUMI
BROUGHT THIS BY FOR YOU.

71
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,500
- GOODNESS.
TELL HER I SAID THANK YOU.

72
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,916
OH, AND THE SAME
GOES FOR YOU, SHANA.

73
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,041
- Kazumi:
WHY ARE YOU APOLOGIZING?

74
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,250
- YOU'RE JUST LYING
TO YOURSELF.

75
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,291
I KNOW THAT DEEP DOWN,
YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR MOM

76
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,083
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE TOWN.

77
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,000
YOU WON'T FACE THE TRUTH.

78
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,166
FORGET IT.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITH YOU.

79
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,041
YUJI.

80
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,916
- ( footsteps approaching )

81
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,000
- HEY.

82
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,208
- YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

83
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,166
- DON'T BOTHER
WITH SUCH QUESTIONS.

84
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,625
JUST CONTINUE TO FOLLOW ME.
- WHAT'LL YOU DO IF I REFUSE?

85
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,791
- YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN.

86
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,625
- WHAT DO THEY WANT FROM ME?

87
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,416
NOBODY GETS KIDNAPPED
JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT.

88
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,666
CLEARLY
THEY'RE AFTER SOMETHING.

89
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,458
THEY COULD BE USING ME
AS BAIT TO LURE OUT SHANA

90
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,250
AND THE OTHER FLAME HAZE.

91
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,333
IF SO, I'VE GOT TO WARN THEM.

92
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,333
THE QUESTION IS HOW?

93
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:59,333
AHHHH!  AHHHHHH!

94
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:04,083
AHHHHH!  AHHHH!

95
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,666
- WHAT IN THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

96
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,833
- LET GO!
- STOP SCREAMING.

97
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,500
WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?
- THIS IS A TRAP, ISN'T IT?

98
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,500
ARE YOU USING ME AS BAIT
SO YOU CAN CAPTURE THE OTHERS?

99
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,458
- UH, IS THAT A TRICK QUESTION?

100
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,500
- THEY'RE GOING
TO HEAR ME SCREAM.

101
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,041
- TRY THAT AGAIN AND I SWEAR
I WILL START DEVOURING SOULS.

102
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,666
- FINE, I GET IT!

103
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,875
- UGH, THIS KID IS A PAIN.

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,833
- WAS THAT SAKAI
WHO JUST WENT CRAZY?

105
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,833
- YEAH, THINK SO.

106
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,250
- I WONDER WHY
HE WAS SCREAMING LIKE THAT.

107
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,208
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
ABOUT TO FIGHT THAT GEEZER.

108
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,916
- I KNOW HE SAW ME.
BUT IF HE NEEDED HELP,

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,125
WHY DIDN'T HE
JUST SAY SOMETHING?

110
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,291
WAS IT
'CAUSE OF THAT OLD MAN?

111
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:08,291
- HEY, WE SHOULD FOLLOW HIM.
SAKAI'S OUR FRIEND.

112
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,666
IF HE'S IN TROUBLE,
THEN WE HAVE TO GO HELP HIM.

113
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,583
- HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP HIM
FROM NOTICING US.

114
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,750
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

115
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,666
HE MUST BE DANGEROUS.

116
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,041
DON'T TELL ME--
THAT OLD MAN'S A DENIZEN?

117
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,500
- Ogata: HEY, SNAP OUT OF IT,
WOULD YA?

118
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,208
WE'D BETTER GET GOING
OR ELSE WE'RE GOING TO
LOSE TRACK OF SAKAI.

119
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,916
COME ON.

120
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,500
WHAT?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

121
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,083
- I'M SORRY.  WE CAN'T.

122
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:56,208
- ARE YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE LOOKING KIND OF PALE.

123
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:00,250
SAKAI WAS WITH SOME GUY.
DO YOU THINK HE'S IN DANGER?

124
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,083
'CAUSE IF SO, THEN WE SHOULD--

125
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,416
- THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN THAT, OGATA.

126
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,500
THERE'S NO MISTAKING IT.

127
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,208
THAT DENIZEN
IS HOLDING SAKAI HOSTAGE.

128
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,291
HE STARTED SCREAMING

129
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,708
'CAUSE HE SAW US
DOWN THE STREET.

130
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,916
HE WANTS ME TO WARN THEM.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,875
- THIS IS A TRAP, ISN'T IT?!

132
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,500
ARE YOU USING ME AS BAIT
SO YOU CAN CAPTURE THE OTHERS?

133
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:35,291
- BUT TO DO THAT,
I'D HAVE TO FACE MARGERY.

134
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:39,125
THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN I WOULD'VE FOLLOWED HER
ANYWHERE,

135
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,000
BUT NOW?

136
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,875
WHAT IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN,

137
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,625
ONLY THIS TIME NOTHING
COULD BE RESTORED?

138
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,666
FORGET IT.
I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED.

139
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,750
I DON'T EVER WANT
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

140
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,375
- WHAT'S WRONG?

141
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,791
- FOLLOW ME, OKAY?

142
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,041
- WILL YOU AT LEAST TELL ME
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

143
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,666
- HOW COULD I BE
SUCH AN IDIOT?

144
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,666
IF MY FRIEND'S IN DANGER--

145
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,916
I'VE GOT TO DO
WHAT I CAN TO HELP HIM.

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,416
STAY HERE.

147
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,791
I'VE GOTTA TALK TO THEM
REAL QUICK.

148
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,666
TRY NOT TO LISTEN, OKAY?
- UH, SURE.

149
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,416
- ( ringing )

150
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,750
- Sato: Who's there?
Tanaka!

151
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,000
- There's something
I need to tell Margery about.

152
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,041
Can I come in?

153
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,166
Please,
it's real important.

154
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,375
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

155
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:27,041
- Marcosias: MMM. SOUNDS LIKE
A JAEGER FROM BAL MASQUE,
IF YOU ASK ME.

156
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,916
- I'LL ALERT THE OTHERS
RIGHT AWAY.

157
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,708
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO ME
WITH THIS.

158
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,000
KEISAKU AND EITA,

159
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,458
I NEED YOU BOTH
AT THE CRYSTAL ALTAR.

160
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,291
- WAIT, UH...

161
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,625
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

162
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,583
YOU CAN CALL ME EVERY NAME
IN THE BOOK IF YOU WANT,

163
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,416
BUT I'VE GOT TO STAND UP
FOR MYSELF AND QUIT
BEING A COWARD.

164
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,666
I CARE ABOUT HER
AND I JUST CAN'T TAKE THE RISK.

165
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,291
- TAKE HER HAND
AND RUN FAR AWAY.

166
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,250
- CHIGUSA'S FINALLY
GETTING SOME SLEEP.

167
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,833
- THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR.

168
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,000
IT SEEMS THE REMEDY
IS INDEED WORKING.

169
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,833
- Tiamat: QUITE A CURE-ALL.

170
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,625
- HOW'S THE SOUP COMING ALONG?

171
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,333
- YOU CANNOT RUSH A RECIPE
FULL OF HEALING INGREDIENTS.

172
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,833
SNAPPING TURTLE, PIT VIPER,

173
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,458
GARLIC, AND WHAT WAS THE OTHER?
- Tiamat: KOREAN GINSENG.

174
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,041
- INDEED.
THAT'S WHAT I FORGOT.

175
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,666
- Alastor: SOUNDS DISGUSTING.

176
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,000
- WHY DON'T WE JUST RUSH IN

177
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,416
AND SAVE SAKAI
BEFORE THE ENEMY MAKES A MOVE?

178
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,250
I DON'T GET WHY WE'RE JUST
STANDING HERE WATCHING.

179
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,416
- DON'T WORRY,
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

180
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,958
I'M NOT JUST STANDING HERE.

181
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,416
I'M ALLOWING THE ENEMY
TO SENSE THE PRESENCE
OF A FLAME HAZE.

182
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,083
- Marcosias ( laughing ): 
LETTING 'EM SMELL THE BOOZE
ON YA, MORE LIKE-- OW!

183
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,083
- SORRY ABOUT THE LONG WALK,

184
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,500
BUT WE'VE ALMOST
REACHED OUR DESTINATION.

185
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,000
- OH, YEAH?

186
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,125
IS THERE A WANDERER
THERE WAITING?

187
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,958
- ( laughs )
SURELY YOU DON'T THINK
I'M STUPID ENOUGH

188
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,000
TO ANSWER A QUESTION LIKE THAT,
NOW DO YOU?

189
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,541
- I CAN TELL
BY THAT COCKY SMIRK

190
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,333
HE'S GOT SOMETHING MAJOR
IN THE WORKS.

191
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,541
I WONDER
WHERE HIS PARTNER'S HIDING.

192
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,625
I DON'T THINK HE'D BE IN HERE.
THESE CEILINGS ARE TOO LOW.

193
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,458
HE WOULDN'T
HAVE ROOM TO FIGHT.

194
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,541
FACING OFF AGAINST FLAME HAZE
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS

195
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,166
WOULD BE SUICIDE.

196
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,833
WE'VE WALKED ALL THIS WAY

197
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,875
AND I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT HE WANTS.

198
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,458
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

199
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,500
THE OTHERS ARE IN DANGER.

200
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,416
- WE HAVE FINALLY
REACHED OUR DESTINATION.

201
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,250
ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW
IS SET THE STAGE FOR BATTLE.

202
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,708
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

203
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,291
ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE GOING
TO CAST THE SEAL,

204
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,208
NOT THE WANDERER?

205
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,750
- YES, DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT, BOY?

206
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,458
I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT WHEN THE FIVE OF US
ARE COMBINED,

207
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,208
WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH POWER
TO COVER A SMALL AREA

208
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,208
SUCH AS THIS PLACE
WITH A SEAL.

209
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,458
- I DON'T GET IT.

210
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,375
THEY'LL NEED A PRETTY LARGE ONE
IF THEY PLAN TO FIGHT US.

211
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,583
AND NO WAY THIS GUY'S
STRONG ENOUGH TO DO THAT.

212
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,708
SO WHAT WOULD BE
THE POINT OF HIM
CASTING SUCH A SMALL SEAL?

213
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,791
WHY DID THE FIFTH GUY STOP?

214
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,416
WAIT A MINUTE--
A SMALL SEAL AREA.

215
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,333
STATIONARY FIFTH GUY.

216
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,625
THE SEAL
WILL ATTRACT FLAME HAZE.

217
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,958
THE WANDERER'S NOT NEARBY

218
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,125
AND ZAROVEE'S ABILITY--

219
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,750
THAT'S IT.

220
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,916
- WHY'D YOU STOP WALKING?

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,750
- HIS SMALL SEAL
WILL ACT AS A BEACON

222
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,666
TO LURE THE FLAME HAZE.

223
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,750
AND BECAUSE IT'S ENCLOSED,

224
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,041
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE.

225
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,125
ZAROVEE IS GOING
TO USE THE FIFTH GUY

226
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,750
AS AN ESCAPE ROUTE.

227
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,666
SO THE WANDERER
MUST BE OUTSIDE.

228
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,958
IT'S GOING
TO ATTACK THE FLAME HAZE
ON THEIR WAY HERE!

229
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,041
- Bifrons: LET'S BEGIN.

230
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,958
WHAT'S TAKING YOU SO LONG,
ZAROVEE?

231
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,833
YOU SHOULD'VE SENT ME
THE SIGNAL BY NOW.

232
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,166
I'M STILL WAITING
TO SEE YOUR SEAL.

233
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,458
- YOU CAN'T STOP NOW, BOY,

234
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,625
NOT WHEN WE'VE COME THIS FAR.

235
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,583
I WARNED YOU
ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

236
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,333
IF YOU CHOSE
NOT TO OBEY MY ORDERS.
- I WILL PROTECT IT.

237
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,291
I SWEAR.

238
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,000
I WILL PROTECT THIS CITY!

239
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,916
- DON'T HURT ME!
- ( grunts )

240
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,208
- AHHH!

241
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,416
- SHANA AND YOSHIDA
WERE RIGHT.

242
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,750
- WHY ARE YOU APOLOGIZING?

243
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,333
- FORGET IT.

244
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,708
I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

245
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,958
- ( bone cracking )

246
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,833
- I WAS LYING TO MYSELF.
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

247
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,541
I WAS ONLY TELLING MYSELF
WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.

248
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,833
- Margery: NOW, YUJI,
ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND--

249
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,166
YOU WON'T FIND YOUR RESOLVE
IN YOUR HEAD.

250
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,375
YOU HAVE TO FEEL IT
IN YOUR HEART.

251
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,708
- Yuji: TRUTHFULLY,
I HADN'T FORMED ANY RESOLVE.

252
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,916
I HADN'T ACCEPTED MY FATE.

253
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,041
I DON'T BLAME SHANA AND YOSHIDA
FOR GETTING MAD AT ME.

254
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,625
I NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO THEM.

255
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,625
( grunts )

256
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,708
- AHHH!

257
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,625
- JUST AS I SUSPECTED--

258
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,750
THE WANDERER'S
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

259
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,291
THE FLAME HAZE ARE IN DANGER.

260
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,208
SHANA!

261
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,208
SHANA!

262
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,875
- YUJI!

263
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,041
ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

264
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,958
THERE'S A PROBLEM W--
- GIVE US THE SHORT VERSION.

265
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,041
- UH, SURE.

266
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,083
THERE'S A WANDERER
SOMEWHERE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY

267
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,458
GETTING READY
TO LAUNCH A LONG-RANGE ATTACK.

268
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,916
- WE HAVE TO STOP IT.
- INDEED WE DO, MILADY.

269
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,416
PROMISE ME
YOU'LL KEEP YOUR SEAL UP
NO MATTER WHAT.

270
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,416
- YOU GOT IT. AHH!

271
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,416
- THAT'S IT!

272
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,375
- IT'S ABOUT TO FIRE!

273
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,083
- YOU READY FOR THIS?

274
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,291
- Tiamat:
IT'S TIME TO LAUNCH.

275
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,416
- I'LL HAVE TO STRIKE FROM HERE.

276
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,791
AHHH!

277
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,875
- AHHHH!

278
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,958
- THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

279
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,833
- Alastor: YES,
IT WAS SMART OF YOU

280
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,416
TO STRIKE WHEN YOU DID.
THAT WAS GOOD THINKING.

281
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,666
- I'LL ADMIT, HE HAS INDEED
PROVEN HIMSELF WORTHY

282
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,000
OF BECOMING
THE MISTRESS'S PARTNER.

283
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,583
DON'T YOU AGREE? 
- Tiamat: BEGRUDGINGLY.

284
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:14,083
- ( sighs )
I DIDN'T GET ANY TIME
IN THE SPOTLIGHT TONIGHT.

285
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,541
WHAT A SHAME.
- ( Marcosias laughing )

286
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,541
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS
BE THE STAR, MY DEAR.

287
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,833
- I'M JUST GLAD IT'S ALL OVER.

288
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,500
WE CAN BREATHE EASY.
- HMM.

289
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,291
- Yuji: WHAT'S GOING ON?

290
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,875
THE JAEGER AND THE WANDERER
HAVE BEEN KILLED.

291
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,333
SO WHY DO I STILL
HAVE THIS WEIRD FEELING,

292
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:39,291
LIKE IT'S EMANATING
FROM THE EXPLOSION SITE?

293
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,125
SHANA!

294
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,125
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU.

295
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,416
- ( theme music playing )


296
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,333
- Yuji: A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
CAUSED BY SABRAC,

297
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:34,041
THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE,
SEVERELY INJURES
THE FLAME HAZE.

298
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,541
I'M MORTIFIED

299
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:39,208
AS MISAKI CITY
IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES.

300
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,041
DESPITE HER INJURIES,

301
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:45,500
WILHELMINA FACES OFF
AGAINST HER ARCH NEMESIS.

302
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,333
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA SECOND,"

303
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:55,166
"THE SCARLET BATTLE
TO THE DEATH".
