1
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,125
- Alastor:
HECATE AMBUSHED YUJI

2
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,208
AND STOLE THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD FROM HIM.

3
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:59,458
SUDDENLY, MISAKI CITY'S
CLOCK TOWER BEGAN TO TRANSFORM.

4
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,083
IT WAS BAL MASQUE'S
SECRET WEAPON,

5
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,583
THE TAIMEI SHIHEN,
BEGINNING TO TAKE SHAPE.

6
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,958
- ( theme music playing )


7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,458
- Bel-Peol: EVERYTHING
IS GOING AS PLANNED.

9
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,333
LET US HOPE
OUR GOOD LUCK CONTINUES.

10
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,833
- AT LAST
WE WILL ACHIEVE VICTORY.

11
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,291
- YES, WE WILL.

12
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,458
THEN BOTH THE CRIMSON
AND HUMAN WORLDS

13
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,875
WILL BE UNDER OUR COMMAND.

14
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,416
- ( heartbeat )

15
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,500
- Alastor: SEEKING RESEARCHER,

16
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,541
YOU CANNOT
ALLOW THIS CREATURE

17
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,333
TO PERMANENTLY RESIDE
IN THE HUMAN WORLD.

18
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,291
HAVE YOU COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND?

19
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,166
- I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND, FLAME OF HEAVEN.

20
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,708
CRITICIZE ME ALL YOU WANT.
IT'LL ONLY MAKE ME STRONGER.

21
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,916
IT'S MY DUTY
TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,041
IT'S PIONEERS LIKE ME
WHO ADVANCE SCIENCE!

23
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,208
- YOU TELL HIM, PROFESSOR!

24
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:37,291
- YEE-HEE!  ONCE YOU
SEE THE STATUE OF PRIDE
IN ITS AWAKENED STATE,

25
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:41,083
ANY DOUBTS YOU HAVE
ABOUT MY SCIENTIFIC CREDIBILITY

26
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,750
WILL BE SQUELCHED.

27
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,333
MY BRILLIANCE
WILL BE RECOGNIZED.

28
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,041
- Tiamat: WE MUST STOP HIM.
 - EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

29
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,708
- WE HAVE TO FIND
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

30
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,416
AND GET IT BACK TO YUJI.

31
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,291
- AHA HA HA! 
- ( steam whistle blowing )

32
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,625
- AHHHH!

33
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,541
( grunts )

34
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,791
- YOU MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP.

35
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,708
- Margery: JEEZ.

36
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,333
WHAT WAS I THINKING
BLOWING ALL MY POWER LIKE THAT?

37
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,333
THERE'S A BATTLE
UNFOLDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME

38
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,208
AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
BUT WATCH IT HAPPEN.
( coughing )

39
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,208
- Marcosias: SHUT YOUR TRAP,
WOULD YOU?  DAMN IT.

40
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,416
THIS'LL TAKE A WHILE
TO HEAL YOU.

41
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,541
- YUJI.

42
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,375
- SAKAI.

43
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,791
- Alastor: I DON'T THINK
THERE IS ANY REASON TO WORRY.

44
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,708
EVEN THOUGH IT WILL NO LONGER
RENEW ITSELF,

45
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,666
HE CARRIES ENOUGH POWER
OF EXISTENCE WITHIN HIM

46
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,750
THAT IT IS UNLIKELY
HE WILL RUN OUT.

47
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,833
- Shana: BUT WHAT IF
WE DON'T FIND HIM IN TIME?

48
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,250
- Tiamat: HE'LL DISAPPEAR.

49
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,208
- WHAT IF SHANA
AND THE OTHERS

50
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,916
AREN'T ABLE TO GET TO HIM
IN TIME?

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,416
I HAVE THE POWER TO SAVE HIM,

52
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,666
BUT TO USE IT,
I HAVE TO SACRIFICE MYSELF.

53
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,333
- NOT QUITE.

54
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,208
SO THAT I CAN FIGHT
ALONGSIDE HIM.

55
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:09,416
- SAKAI'S LIFE
IS IN MY HANDS.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,666
- ( grunts )

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,958
- ( grunts )

58
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,708
- HMMM!

59
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,333
- TRAPPED.

60
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,708
HE'S NOT ATTACKING?

61
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,291
THEY WON'T ATTACK US
BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID

62
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,875
OF DAMAGING THE CLOCK TOWER.
- HMM.

63
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,875
- Yuji: WILHELMINA.

64
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,791
THAT MEANS SHANA'S HERE,

65
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,333
BUT I'M NOT SENSING
HER PRESENCE.

66
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:03,041
FOR SOME REASON,
ALL I SENSE IS THE SILVER.

67
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,875
DAMN IT.
I HAVE TO KEEP MOVING.

68
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,000
I HAVE TO FIND
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

69
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,833
- ( scanning )

70
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,166
- Dominos:
INTRUDER!  INTRUDER!

71
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,791
- I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING
TO BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

72
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,750
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW HARD IT IS

73
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,416
TO PROTECT SOMETHING
SO MASSIVE.

74
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
- I FIND IT IRONIC INDEED

75
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,333
THAT THE ENEMY'S WEAPON
IS WHAT'S KEEPING US SAFE.

76
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,333
- Alastor: 
WE MUST NOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME
FIGHTING THOSE TWO.

77
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:18,166
WE HAVE TO REMOVE
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
FROM THE BEAST.

78
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,666
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY
WE CAN PREVENT ITS AWAKENING.

79
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,375
- Tiamat: AND SAVE THE MYSTES.

80
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,041
- I'LL FLY INSIDE
WHEN I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY.

81
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,750
I KNOW HE'S IN THERE.

82
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,125
- Dominos: 
SEIZE HIM!  SEIZE HIM!
SEIZE HIM!  SEIZE HIM!

83
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:42,000
- IF USING THIS
MEANS SAKAI WILL BE SAVED,

84
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,291
THEN I--

85
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,750
( gasps )

86
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,375
- ( traffic sounds,
people chattering )

87
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,208
- Shana: I'LL BRING HIM
BACK WITH ME

88
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,291
AND WE'LL SETTLE OUR RIVALRY.

89
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,541
- I HAD FORGOTTEN
WHAT SHANA TOLD ME.

90
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,083
SHE PROMISED
THAT SHE'D BRING HIM BACK.

91
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,333
WHAT'S WITH ME?

92
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,875
I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE MY LIFE

93
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,166
INSTEAD OF TRUSTING HER.

94
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,208
- Shana:
SO I CAN FIGHT ALONGSIDE HIM.

95
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,750
HE'S IN THERE
AND HE'S FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE.

96
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,041
- Kazumi:
I HAVE FAITH IN HER.

97
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,750
THEY WILL MAKE IT
OUT OF THERE ALIVE.

98
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,208
AND WHEN THEY DO,

99
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:39,208
I'LL BE THERE
TO WELCOME THEM BACK.

100
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,541
- Dominos: SEIZE HIM!
SEIZE HIM!

101
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,875
SEIZE HIM!  SEIZE HIM!

102
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,708
MUST DETAIN!  MUST DETAIN!

103
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,416
MUST DETAIN!
- AH!

104
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,125
I'VE GOTTA BE MORE CAREFUL.

105
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:59,916
IF I DON'T CONSERVE MY POWER,
I'LL DISAPPEAR.

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,250
IT'S WEIRD.

107
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,458
ALL I'M WORRIED ABOUT RIGHT NOW

108
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,583
IS PROTECTING THEM--

109
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,666
MY DAD,

110
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,166
MY MOM,
MY FUTURE SIBLING...

111
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,166
MISAKI CITY
AND ITS CITIZENS,

112
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,000
YOSHIDA, WHO'S OPENED HER HEART
TO A MYSTES--

113
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,041
I WANT TO PROTECT ALL OF THEM,

114
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:32,541
- ESPECIALLY...
- AHA HA HA HA!

115
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,416
( laughing maniacally )

116
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,625
- SHANA!

117
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,916
( grunting )

118
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,125
I WILL PROTECT YOU!

119
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,625
- AHHHH!

120
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,500
- WHY HIM?!
WHY TARGET YUJI?!

121
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,916
- BECAUSE WE NEEDED
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

122
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,541
NOW THAT WE HAVE IT,
WE HAVE NO USE FOR HIM.

123
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,416
SOON HE'LL DISAPPEAR
LIKE ANY OTHER TORCH.

124
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,333
- I'LL KILL YOU!

125
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,333
- DO NOT EVEN
THINK ABOUT HARMING HECATE.

126
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,166
- AHH!

127
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,750
HMM!  DON'T WORRY,
I'LL GO AFTER HER.  MOVE!

128
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,708
- INDEED YOU WILL NOT
GET PAST ME.

129
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,666
- Dantalion: JUST FORGET
ABOUT THE GIRL, SYD!

130
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,500
ONE MEASLY LITTLE FLAME HAZE
IS NO MATCH

131
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,500
FOR MY ELITE ARMY OF ROBOTS.

132
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,625
IN FACT,
I BET THEY'RE ZEROING IN
ON HER COORDINATES AS WE SPEAK!

133
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,750
- I AM UNCERTAIN OF THAT,
SIR.

134
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,541
THEY HAVE NOT EVEN
CAPTURED THE MYSTES YET--

135
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,541
- SHUT UP!

136
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,375
ALL I NEED IS FOR YOU
TO BUY US SOME TIME

137
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:07,166
UNTIL THE STATUE OF PRIDE
HAS BEEN FULLY AWAKENED, OKAY?

138
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,250
OOOH!
SHOULD BE ANY MINUTE NOW!

139
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,916
- SURE, WHATEVER YOU SAY.

140
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,166
- I KNOW HE'S HERE SOMEWHERE.

141
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,875
- YUJI!
- SHANA.

142
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,875
- PLEASE DON'T DISAPPEAR
ON ME.

143
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,458
- I'LL BE OKAY.

144
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,958
- BUT YOU'RE STARTING TO FADE.
- YEAH.

145
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,958
SOMETHING'S DRAINING ME--
MY POWER OF EXISTENCE.

146
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,708
I CAN FEEL IT HAPPENING.

147
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:02,125
- Alastor: 
THE SEEKING RESEARCHER
SAID THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

148
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,541
IS THE "HEART"
OF HIS CREATION.

149
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,750
IT MUST BE THE STATUE OF PRIDE

150
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,708
WHICH IS FEEDING OFF
OF YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE.

151
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,291
- ( heartbeat ) 
- Yuji: THE STATUE OF PRIDE?

152
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,583
- Alastor: BAL MASQUE
PLANS TO USE THE POWER

BEL-PEOL TRAPPED
BENEATH THE CITY

154
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,750
TO BREATHE LIFE
INTO THIS MANGLED IRON.

155
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,208
IT WILL BE THE FIRST DENIZEN

156
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,208
TO BE BORN
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD.

157
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,000
- Yuji: WHY WOULD THEY
DO SUCH A THING?

158
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,541
- Shana: I DON'T KNOW.
THE ONLY THING I DO KNOW

159
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,333
IS WE'RE DOOMED
IF WE DON'T STOP IT.

160
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,000
WHAT IF WE REMOVED
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD?

161
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,583
DO YOU THINK
THAT WOULD DO IT?

162
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,000
- WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

163
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,666
- YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

164
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,041
- IT'S ABOVE US.

165
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,916
- YUJI.
- I'LL BE FINE.

166
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,416
COME ON.
- YOU SHOULDN'T FIGHT.

167
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,791
- BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE
I'VE SWORN TO PROTECT,

168
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,500
LIKE YOU.

169
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,333
THAT IS, IF YOU'LL LET ME.

170
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,875
- OF COURSE.

171
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,541
TOGETHER.  COME ON.

172
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,000
- ARISE, DENIZEN.

173
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,708
- IT'S MOVING.

174
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:56,125
- ( all reacting )

175
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,458
- I WOKE UP
IN THE NICK OF TIME, HUH?

176
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,541
- Marcosias: 
IF YOU DON'T RELAX,

177
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,416
I'M NEVER GOING
TO GET YOU HEALED.

178
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,416
- WELL, I CAN'T
JUST LAY HERE AND DO NOTHING.

179
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,041
- Marcosias: GIVE ME A BREAK.

180
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:19,000
WHY ARE YOU
ALWAYS SO HARDHEADED?

181
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,708
- THIS SEAL
HAS STOPPED OUR NEWBORN DENIZEN
IN ITS TRACKS!

182
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,208
IT'S TIME TO PULL OUT
THE BIG GUNS.

183
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,958
DOMINO, I'M GOING TO ACTIVATE
THE EMERGENCY FUNCTION

184
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,458
I DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY
FOR CASES LIKE THIS.

185
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,916
- BUT, SIR,
WE HAVE NOT TESTED IT!

186
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,625
FOR ALL WE KNOW, IT COULD CAUSE
A MASSIVE EXPLOSION,

187
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,958
CASTING US OUTSIDE
THE OPERATIONAL AREA.

188
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,083
- NO PROBLEM-O!

189
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,166
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER TIME
TO TEST THE EMERGENCY FUNCTION

190
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,083
THAN WHEN WE TRULY NEED IT!

191
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,541
- IT HAS WINGS.

192
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,458
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TRY
TO FLY IT OUTSIDE OF THE SEAL?

193
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,208
- Tiamat: IT'S UNSTOPPABLE.

194
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,083
- AHHH!

195
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,416
- THEY MUST BE STOPPED
AT ANY COST.

196
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,541
- Alastor: YOU HAVE TO HURRY!
THE DENIZEN HAS BEEN AWAKENED.

197
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,750
- ALMOST THERE.

198
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,000
- ( gasps )
- ( growls )

199
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,375
- ( Yuji shouts )

200
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,916
- IT'S HIM-- THE SILVER!

201
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,666
YUJI, WHERE IS
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD?

202
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,250
- HE'S GOT IT.
IT'S INSIDE OF HIM.

203
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,125
- ( shouting )

204
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,750
DAMN IT.
COVER ME!  I'M GOING IN.

205
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,000
- IF I HADN'T STEPPED IN,
YOU'D BE TOAST RIGHT NOW!

206
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,041
- I KNEW YOU WOULD.
- OH, YEAH?

207
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,875
- DISPOSE OF THEM.

208
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,208
- ( gasps )

209
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,625
- MARGERY, IT'S YOU.

210
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,583
- Marcosias: YOU'RE LUCKY
WE FOUND YOU IN TIME.

211
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,083
- I'VE GONE SOFT.

212
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,833
INSTEAD OF GETTING MY REVENGE
ON THE SILVER,

213
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,041
I'M OUT SAVING HUMANS.

214
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,791
- SHANA!

215
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,791
- I'VE GOT THIS.

216
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:47,000
- MY POWER'S
STILL BEING DRAINED.

217
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,083
AS IF IT'S BEING USED
FOR SOMETHING.

218
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,375
- Alastor: IT MUST BE
THE STATUE OF PRIDE

219
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,000
WHICH IS FEEDING OFF
OF YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE.

220
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,083
- THAT'S IT-- THE HEART!

221
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,000
- I COMMEND YOU
FOR YOUR EFFORTS.

222
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,791
HOWEVER, NOW THAT IT'S AWAKENED,
YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO HIDE.

223
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,375
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
LONG I CAN CONTAIN MYSELF

224
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,000
WITH ALL OF THIS EXCITEMENT!

225
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,291
YOU'RE NOW FREE
TO SPREAD YOUR WINGS

226
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,000
AND MAKE THIS WORLD YOUR OWN. 
- SMASH THE MACHINE!

227
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,375
IT'S WHAT'S PULLING POWER
FROM THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

228
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,250
TO SUPPORT THE DENIZEN!

229
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,000
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

230
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,833
- AHHH!

231
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,250
- OH, NO.

232
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,916
- AHHH!

233
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,291
GIVE ME BACK
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD!

234
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,791
AH!

235
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,666
- YUJI.
DID YOU GET IT BACK?

236
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,875
- MM-HMM.

237
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,541
Alastor: GOOD, NOW GET OUT.

238
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,375
- Fecor: HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
WE WERE SO CLOSE.

239
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,291
- I SUPPOSE
THAT SOME THINGS IN THIS WORLD

240
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,791
ARE NOT MEANT TO BE.

241
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,250
- WHAT HAPPENED, HECATE?

242
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,375
- I WISH I COULD TELL YOU.
- Sydonay: NO!

243
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,416
WHY IS THE STATUE OF PRIDE'S
SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONING

244
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,916
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

245
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,333
IT MUST BE
SOME KIND OF PROGRAMMING ERROR.

246
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:01,208
DOMINO, PREPARE
TO INITIATE REMOTE CONTROL
OF THE DENIZEN IMMEDIATELY!

247
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,333
- CONNECTION LOST, SIR!

248
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:07,333
AH!  THE MYSTES
MUST HAVE TAKEN BACK
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

249
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,333
- WHAT?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

250
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,208
WITHOUT ITS HEART,
THE STATUE CANNOT FUNCTION.

251
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,625
IT HAS BEGUN
A SYSTEM-WIDE SHUT DOWN.

252
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,416
- WE SHOULD BE ON OUR WAY,
PROFESSOR.

253
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,333
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

254
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,416
I WON'T ALLOW THOSE FOOLS
TO DISRUPT YET ANOTHER OF MY--

255
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,166
- Domino: EJECT.
- AHHH!

256
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:51,041
- Shana: WE DID IT.
WE PROTECTED THE CITY.

257
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,708
- YEAH.

258
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,500
YOSHIDA.

259
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,541
- YOU'RE ALIVE!

260
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,250
- YEAH, I'M FINE.
- TOLD YOU SO.

261
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,250
- WELCOME BACK.

262
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,958
- ( theme music playing )


263
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:18,083
- Yuji: ON THAT NIGHT,
WHEN WE SAVED THE CITY,

264
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,291
MY WORLD COMPLETELY CHANGED.

265
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,916
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS.
