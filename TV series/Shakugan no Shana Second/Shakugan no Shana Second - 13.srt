00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,791
- Announcer: EVERYONE IS SHOCKED
TO LEARN YUJI'S FLAME IS SILVER.

2
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:56,583
DURING HER INVESTIGATION,
WILHELMINA LEARNED THE MIDNIGHT

3
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:00,166
LOST CHILD'S CREATOR, HER OLD
FRIEND PHELES, IS STILL ALIVE.

4
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,625
THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL WAS ABRUPTLY
INTERRUPTED BY A HOWLING WIND.

5
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,708
SUDDENLY, YUJI FOUND
HIMSELF FACE TO FACE

6
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,541
WITH THE CAPRICE OF BEAUTY
HERSELF.

7
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,166
- ( theme music playing )

8
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

9
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,083
- ( screaming )

10
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:55,875
- YUJI!

11
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,916
- THAT COLOR.
- IT CAN'T BE.

12
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,125
- Marcosias: HOPE YOU'RE READY
FOR A THROWDOWN, LADIES!

13
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,375
- JOHAN, MY LOVE.

14
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,291
- ( gasps, heart beats )

15
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:48,958
- NO!
- YUJI. SHE'LL DESTROY HIM.

16
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,541
- IT'S PHELES.
- Tiamat: HIS FATE WAS SEALED.

17
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:57,250
- SHE FOUND HIM.
- HIS FATE WAS SEALED.

18
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,208
- WHAT DOES THIS DENIZEN
WANT WITH ME?

19
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,041
- I'VE BEEN SEARCHING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

20
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,708
- IT'S HER,

21
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,166
THE ONE WILHELMINA
WARNED ME ABOUT.

22
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,833
- I SHALL FREE YOU.

23
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,750
- NO, YOU CAN'T!

24
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,916
- ( screaming )

25
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,666
- ( laughing )

26
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,000
- Marcosias:
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

27
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,875
YES!

28
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,041
I FOUND YOU.

29
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,208
FINALLY, I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE.

30
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,208
- Marcosias: MARGERY!

31
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,625
- ( roars )

32
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,958
- PHELES.
- HIS FATE WAS SEALED.

33
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,166
- THE POOR BOY.
- HIS FATE WAS SEALED.

34
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:29,041
- BASTARD, I WILL KILL YOU!

35
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,708
- IF YOU DON'T CALM DOWN, I WILL
BE FORCED TO RESTRAIN YOU.

36
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,708
- ( roaring )

37
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,083
- ( snarls )
- WILHELMINA!

38
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,416
- LEAVE THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
TO THE SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING.

39
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,416
FOCUS ON PHELES.

40
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,666
- JOHAN.

41
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,750
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

42
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,583
NOW COME TO ME.

43
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,833
- ( gasps )
- JOHAN, MY LOVE.

44
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,250
- NO!
- ( screaming )

45
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,750
- ( screams )

46
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,875
- GO!  GET OUT OF HERE!
- ( grunts )

47
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,625
- CAPRICE OF BEAUTY,
PLEASE LISTEN FOR A MOMENT.

48
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,583
- I CAN'T SENSE
HER PRESENCE ANYMORE.

49
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,541
- IT'S HER INVERNA SPELL.

50
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,083
IT GIVES HER THE ABILITY
TO OBSCURE HER PRESENCE.

51
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,458
YOU'LL HAVE TO KEEP
AN EYE OUT FOR HER.

52
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,333
- ( grunting )

53
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,916
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, DUDE?
- THINK SO.

54
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,125
HEY, WHAT'S UP WITH THIS SEAL?
- SATO!

55
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,458
- IT'S MARGERY.

56
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,791
- STOP IT!

57
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,708
- WAKE UP.  WE GOTTA MOVE.

58
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:52,625
- OH, SATO.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

59
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,250
- I'M NOT SURE,
BUT WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

60
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,625
COME ON.  TANAKA!

61
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,708
- NO WAY.
WHAT THE HELL'S GOTTEN INTO HER?

62
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:04,250
IF SHE KEEPS THIS UP, SHE'S
GONNA WRECK THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

63
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,416
- LET'S GO!
WE GOTTA FIND SOMEWHERE SAFE.

64
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,375
- ( roaring )

65
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,333
- YOU THINK SHE'S PISSED
'CAUSE OF THE SEAL?

66
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,208
- YEAH, LOOK.
- Kazumi: IT'S SILVER.

67
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,083
- THE CREEP MARGERY'S BEEN
SEARCHING FOR ALL THESE YEARS.

68
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,958
HE HAS A SILVER FLAME.
IT LOOKS LIKE

69
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,750
WILHELMINA'S TRYING TO HOLD
HER BACK FOR SOME REASON.

70
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,625
- Sato: WHY?
- NO CLUE.  WHAT'S UP?

71
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,375
- NOBODY COULD'VE CAST
THAT SEAL BUT HIM.

72
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,166
THE SILVER'S GOTTA BE HERE.

73
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,625
YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE THAT
DENIZEN WHO SHOWED UP OUT

74
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,125
OF NOWHERE
AND CAUSED ALL THIS MESS?

75
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,208
- NO, THAT'S THEIR
FLAME OVER THERE.

76
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,833
IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE, WHICH
MEANS IT'S SOMEONE WE KNOW.

77
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,916
IT MUST BE HIM.
WHO ELSE COULD IT BE?

78
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,500
- WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS?

79
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,833
- I DON'T KNOW.
DAMN IT.

80
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,541
I KNOW HE'S OUT THERE FIGHTING
WHILE I JUST SIT HERE.

81
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,791
- SHE'S GONNA HURT
ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

82
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,041
BE CAREFUL, MARGERY!
- GET BACK HERE.

83
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,916
- WATCH OUT!

84
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,083
- ( screaming )

85
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,125
- COME HERE, DUDE.
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU.

86
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,708
IT'S OKAY.
THEY'LL RESTORE EVERYTHING

87
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,791
BEFORE THEY TAKE DOWN THE SEAL.

88
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,458
( wailing )

89
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,291
DAMN IT.  I'M USELESS.

90
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,208
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

91
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,625
- SHE MUST BE LOSING POWER.
SHE'S SLOWING.

92
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:10,125
- ( snarls )
I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE!

93
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,166
- CHANTER OF ELEGIES.
- WHAT?

94
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,750
YOU WERE HIDING HIM ALL ALONG?

95
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,375
- ENOUGH, MARGERY!
- STAY OUT OF THIS.

96
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:35,458
- PHELES.
- DON'T!  CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

97
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,208
- SHE WON'T LISTEN.
- SHE MUST BE STOPPED.

98
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,208
- THEN LET'S DO IT.

99
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,791
( shouts )

100
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,250
GOOD.  SHE'S GETTING WEAKER.

101
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,458
- Margery Monster: DAMN IT!

102
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,458
- ( roars )

103
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:05,125
- ENOUGH, BOTH OF YOU.
NOW SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.

104
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,875
- Tiamat:
EXCELLENT TEAMWORK.

105
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,875
- Shana:
DID YOU EXPECT ANYTHING LESS

106
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,041
FROM WILHELMINA AND ME?

107
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,375
- PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU.

108
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,791
LET US EXPLAIN THE SITUATION.
- Tiamat: A HUMBLE REQUEST.

109
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,708
- HEY, LISTEN TO 'EM,
WOULD YOU?

110
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,166
- HOW SHOULD WE
BREAK THE NEWS?

111
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,666
- Sato: I GOT IT.

112
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,041
SAKAI, HOW LONG WERE YOU
PLANNING TO HIDE

113
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,750
YOUR SILVER FLAME
FROM THE REST OF US?

114
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,625
CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG NOW.

115
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,750
- MARGERY, YOU ASSUMED SAKAI
WAS THE SILVER

116
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,583
JUST 'CAUSE OF HIS FLAME?

117
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,250
IF HE WAS, DON'T YOU THINK

118
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,916
HE WOULD'VE SHOWN
HIS TRUE COLORS BY NOW?

119
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,500
SAKAI MAY BE THE LINK WE NEED
TO FIND THE SILVER.

120
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,666
KILL HIM AND IT'S GONE.

121
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,750
- INDEED, THIS IS WHAT I PLANNED
TO TELL YOU

122
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,958
IN OUR MEETING
TOMORROW NIGHT.

123
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,625
- Tiamat: PLEASE UNDERSTAND.
- LISTEN TO US.

124
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,250
- SATO.
- JUST SHUT UP AND STAY BACK,

125
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,625
WOULD YOU?

126
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,458
- MARGERY.

127
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,166
HOW COULD YOU?

128
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,083
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANT REVENGE
AGAINST THE SILVER.

129
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,000
I DO.

130
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,208
I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WENT BERSERK,

131
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,666
BUT TODAY, WHAT--

132
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,125
WHAT YOU DID.

133
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,416
THAT EXPLOSION YOU CAUSED.

134
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,833
OGATA WAS RIGHT THERE.

135
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,208
OGATA WAS-- ( sobbing )

136
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,666
AND I WATCHED HER.

137
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,583
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.
YOU WERE AWARE.

138
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,208
YOU COULD HEAR EVERY WORD
WE SAID, COULDN'T YOU?

139
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,208
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.

140
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,250
THIS JUST PROVES YOU COULDN'T
CARE LESS ABOUT US.

141
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,958
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS SOME
100-YEAR-OLD VENDETTA.

142
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,541
DAMN YOU, MARGERY.

143
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,375
Marcosias: I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT THE KID'S RIGHT, MARGERY.

144
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,250
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK
BEFORE YOU ACT.

145
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,750
WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE ARE YOU
SETTING FOR THESE TWO?

146
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,166
YOU KNOW THEY LOOK UP TO YOU.

147
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,250
ARE YOU SO HELL-BENT ON REVENGE

148
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,000
THAT YOU'D RISK
THE LIVES OF OTHERS?

149
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,833
DESTROYING ANYTHING
AND EVERYTHING

150
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,000
THAT GETS IN YOUR WAY?

151
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:24,166
TODAY I SAW A SIDE OF YOU
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE,

152
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,375
AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

153
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,958
IF YOU LET HIM CONSUME YOU
LIKE THAT, HE'S ALREADY WON.

154
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,916
- MARGERY.
- LEAVE HIM ALONE.

155
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,708
- SO YOU'RE NOT A DENIZEN?
- NO, HE'S NOT.

156
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,750
- AND HE'S NOT THE SILVER.

157
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:49,041
- THERE'S CLEARLY A CONNECTION,
BUT WE'RE STILL INVESTIGATING.

158
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,291
- I SEE.

159
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,541
THEN WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?

160
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,708
- I WISH I COULD TELL YOU.

161
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:00,208
I'D LIKE TO KNOW MYSELF.
- YEAH?

162
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,000
- YUJI!

163
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,291
- PHELES, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

164
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,208
- WILHELMINA.

165
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,125
- MAY I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

166
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,958
WHY DID YOU CALL THE MYSTES
BY THE NAME JOHAN?

167
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,541
I KNOW THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
WITHIN HIM

168
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,416
IS A MEMENTO
OF YOUR ETERNAL LOVER.

169
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,083
BUT YOU DO KNOW
JOHAN IS GONE.

170
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,458
- NO, HE IS STILL ALIVE.

171
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,333
- WHAT?

172
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,500
- I SEALED HIM INSIDE
THE TREASURE TOOL.

173
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,541
SABRAC.

174
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,041
THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE
HAD ATTACKED US.

175
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,291
HE WANTED TO TAKE
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

176
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,375
- Wilhelmina: I SHOULD'VE
KNOWN HE WAS TO BLAME.

177
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,958
- Shana: WHO IS SABRAC?

178
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,666
- Whilhelmina: A POWERFUL
CRIMSON LORD INDEED.

179
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,333
HE IS WIDELY KNOWN
AS AN ASSASSIN.

180
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,791
- Pheles: JOHAN HAD
BEEN INJURED.

181
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,666
I PROTECTED HIM THE ONLY WAY
I KNEW HOW.

182
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,583
MY LOVE, WE WILL BE REUNITED.

183
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,833
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING
FOR HIM EVER SINCE.

184
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,708
AND NOW

185
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,375
I HAVE FINALLY FOUND HIM.
- I'M SORRY.

186
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,416
I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT YOU
AND JOHAN HAD BEEN KILLED.

187
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,041
- PLEASE, FRIEND.
LET ME FREE MY BELOVED.

188
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:07,666
- PHELES, THIS MYSTES MAY BE
CARRYING A DANGEROUS PHENOMENON

189
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,458
KNOWN AS THE SILVER.

190
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,000
IT WOULD BE BEST TO POSTPONE
YOUR REUNION WITH JOHAN

191
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,416
UNTIL WE KNOW MORE.

192
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,458
- UNTIE ME.

193
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:22,250
- PHELES, I KNOW YOU
DO NOT TRUST HER.

194
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,708
BUT I AM INDEED BEGGING YOU,
MILADY.

195
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,750
PLEASE DO NOT KILL THE CAPRICE
OF BEAUTY JUST YET.

196
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,333
SHE DOES NOT CONSUME HUMAN POWER
OF EXISTENCE,

197
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,500
SO SHE IS NOT A THREAT
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

198
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,583
- Tiamat: PLEASE SPARE HER.

199
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,333
- WILHELMINA.

200
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,791
- I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

201
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,166
I SUPPOSE IT'LL BE SAFE
TO KEEP HER AROUND.

202
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,250
HER LACK OF POWER IS PROOF
THAT SHE DOESN'T PREY ON HUMANS.

203
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,625
- VERY ADMIRABLE OF YOU,
I MUST SAY.

204
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,041
ADMIRABLE INDEED, MILADY.

205
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,583
JOHAN.  THE OTHER HALF
OF THE ENGAGED LINK

206
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,500
IS INSIDE OF ME.

207
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,541
- AT TIMES LIKE THIS,
SAKAI FEELS SO DISTANT.

208
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,458
LIKE HE'S WORLDS AWAY.

209
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,208
- I COULD REALLY USE A DRINK.

210
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,916
- INDULGE ALL YOU WANT
WHEN WE GET HOME.

211
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,458
I WON'T PESTER YOU THIS ONCE.
- THANK YOU.

212
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,208
WHAT?
- I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU

213
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,375
FOR THE RESTRAINT
YOU SHOWED EARLIER.

214
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,500
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE THANKING ME.

215
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,375
I SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING
TO YOU.  SO WHAT'S UP?

216
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,166
- WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM
A RESTORATION

217
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,833
USING YUJI SAKAI'S
POWER OF EXISTENCE.

218
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,000
THE FLAMING-HAIRED BLAZING-EYED
HUNTER IS WARY

219
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,666
OF HAVING PHELES PRESENT
WHEN WE DO SO.

220
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,416
I WILL STAY WITH HER,

221
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,833
AND YUJI WILL SEND ME HIS POWER
THROUGH MY RIBBONS.

222
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,375
- SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK
FOR YOU.

223
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,291
- ONE THING, BEFORE WE GO.

224
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,833
- MARGERY DAW,
CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

225
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,833
YOU ARE WELL KNOWN FOR YOUR
BRILLIANT SPELL CASTING.

226
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,333
WILL YOU HELP ME?

227
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:02,375
SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

228
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,750
I AM CONCERNED
ABOUT JOHAN'S SAFETY.

229
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,333
THE TREASURE TOOL SHOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO PRODUCE

230
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,166
A SILVER FLAME LIKE THAT.

231
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,666
- SO IT'S LIKE AN EGG.

232
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,000
AND THE ETERNAL LOVER
IS LOCKED AWAY INSIDE OF IT.

233
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,875
- I GUESS THAT MAKES THE MYSTES
THE EGGSHELL, HUH?

234
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,958
- IT COULD HAVE BEEN
SABRAC'S DOING

235
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,416
BEFORE IT WAS SEALED,

236
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,666
HE CAST SOME KIND
OF SPELL ON IT PERHAPS.

237
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,625
- I HATE TO LET YOU DOWN,

238
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,041
BUT DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK
I'M CAPABLE OF,

239
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,958
I'M NOT SURE I CAN BE
OF MUCH HELP TO YOU HERE.

240
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,708
- SAYS THE WOMAN
WHO'S BEEN KNOWN

241
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:40,083
TO IMPROVISE INCANTATIONS
AT THE DROP OF A HAT.

242
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,958
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!
( screams )

243
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,208
- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU'D BE MUCH BETTER OFF

244
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,750
ASKING SOMEBODY LIKE THE SEEKER
OR THE CORPSE COLLECTOR

245
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,458
FOR THEIR HELP.

246
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,208
HE TOLD ME THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

247
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,958
- Lamies:
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,

248
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,791
THE SILVER WILL
APPEAR BEFORE YOU.

249
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,208
- IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
TIME HAS COME.

250
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,041
I NEED TO FOCUS ON THE PRESENT
INSTEAD OF WORRYING

251
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:07,166
ABOUT THE PAST.

252
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,583
- WHAT'S WRONG?

253
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,458
- LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE READY
FOR YOU.

254
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,041
- I'LL START RIGHT AWAY.

255
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,791
- SO YUJI AND THE MIDGET
ARE INSIDE THE SCHOOL?

256
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,583
- INDEED.  THE OTHERS ARE
WITH THEM AS WELL.

257
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,000
- KEISAKU AND EITA.

258
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,083
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

259
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,291
LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

260
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,500
- I KNOW.  I WANT TO.
CALL IT A WHIM.

261
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,000
- Marcosias: YOU TRYING TO ATONE
FOR YOUR SINS?

262
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,541
- I'M THE ONE
WHO MADE THIS MESS.

263
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,333
I SHOULD BE THE ONE
TO CLEAN IT UP.

264
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,791
 ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

265
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,666
- YOU'RE GOING TO PERFORM
THE RESTORATION, MARGERY?

266
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,500
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

267
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,333
I'M JUST SURPRISED.

268
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,916
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA TAKE
THE RESTORATION BACK

269
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,083
TO BEFORE PHELES' ARRIVAL.

270
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,333
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE INJURED
IN THE CHAOS

271
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,958
AND I'D LIKE TO FIX THAT.

272
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,000
YOU JUST KEEP YOUR SEAL UP
AS LONG AS YOU CAN

273
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,708
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE REST,
OKAY?

274
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,833
- RIGHT.  I'LL DO MY BEST.

275
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,083
- I'M SO SORRY, MATAKE.

276
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,708
I PROMISE I'LL MAKE IT UP
TO YOU SOMEHOW.

277
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,208
- Sorry, folks, we had some
technical difficulties

278
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,875
due to the wind.

279
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,708
Now let's get back to announcing
our grand prize winners!

280
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:06,666
- ( cheering )

281
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,875
- JEEZ, I THOUGHT THIS DAY
WOULD NEVER END

282
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,916
AND THERE'S STILL TOMORROW.

283
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
- HERE.
- THANKS.

284
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,875
- SORRY ABOUT--
YOU KNOW.

285
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,166
- ONE DAY I WILL CATCH UP
TO YOU.

286
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,666
SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE
YOU'RE SO FAR AWAY.

287
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,250
BUT I PROMISE ONE DAY
I'LL CATCH UP.

288
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,958
AND KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON
IN YOUR LIFE MAKES ME FEEL

289
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,041
CLOSER TO YOU.

290
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,041
- YOSHIDA.

291
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,458
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

292
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,333
- HEY, TANAKA.  ARE YOU OKAY?

293
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,083
SATO ASKED ME TO COME
AND CHECK ON YOU.

294
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,833
WHAT'S WRONG?

295
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,416
- OGATA.

296
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:01,583
- TANAKA?
- OGATA, IT IS YOU.

297
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,416
YOU'RE OKAY.

298
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,625
OH, THANK GOD.

299
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,666
- GUESS WE'RE BOTH WINNERS, HUH?

300
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,000
- CONGRATULATIONS, SHANA.
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

301
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,791
AND THIRD PLACE ISN'T TOO SHABBY
EITHER, KAZUMI.  NICE JOB.

302
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:55,625
- ( mouthing )

303
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,083
- ( theme music playing )

304
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:14,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

305
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,416
- Yuji: AS PHELES LOSES
STRENGTH, SHE TELLS THE STORY

306
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,625
OF HER ETERNAL LOVER, JOHAN,
AND THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

307
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:37,208
LITTLE DOES SHE KNOW,
THE TREASURE TOOL SHE CREATED

308
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:41,250
IS BEING MUTATED FROM WITHIN
BY A DANGEROUS FORCE.

309
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,625
WHILE THE OTHERS REMAIN
SKEPTICAL OF HER,

310
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,750
YOSHIDA INVITES PHELES
