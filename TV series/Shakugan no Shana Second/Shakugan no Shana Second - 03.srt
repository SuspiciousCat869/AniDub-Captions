1
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,750
- Alastor: MARE, THE KEEPER
OF JESTFUL SLUMBER,

2
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,916
CAME IN SEARCH OF
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,916
THE FIGHT PUT EVERYONE
IN JEOPARDY,

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,416
BUT THE AFFECTION YOSHIDA HAS
FOR YUJI SAVED THEM ALL.

5
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,541
AS THE BATTLE
DREW TO A CLOSE,

6
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,541
THE EXISTENCE OF A KEEPER
WAS REVEALED.

7
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,916
LATER, A TRANSFER STUDENT
STRONGLY RESEMBLING

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,583
SUPREME THRONE HECATE
APPEARED AT YUJI'S SCHOOL.

9
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,166
- ( theme song playing )

10
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,625
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

11
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,916
- ( students chattering )

12
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,708
- Man: THIS IS
FUMINA KONOE.

13
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,458
IT MAY TAKE HER A WHILE
TO GET USED TO THINGS HERE,

14
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,666
SO I WANT YOU ALL
TO HELP HER OUT AS BEST YOU CAN.

15
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,500
- THE SUPREME THRONE
HECATE?

16
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,291
- CAST A SEAL!

17
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,958
- Kazumi: SAKAI, SHANA.

18
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,541
- YOU'RE AWAKE.

19
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,541
BUT HOW?

20
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,750
- I ALWAYS MAKE SURE
TO CARRY THIS.

21
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,541
KHAMSIN GAVE IT TO ME.

22
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,125
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

23
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,083
- WE'RE IN A SEAL.

24
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,500
- ANY THOUGHTS, ALASTOR?

25
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,166
- Alastor: HMM.

26
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,208
- SHE SEEMS FROZEN.

27
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,333
IF SHE CAN'T MOVE WITHIN THE
SEAL, THEN SHE'S HUMAN, RIGHT?

28
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,833
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?  WHY ARE
YOU SO SUSPICIOUS OF HER?

29
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,833
I MEAN, WHAT DID SHE
EVER DO TO YOU?

30
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,333
- WELL, NOTHING.
IT'S JUST SHE LOOKS LIKE

31
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,916
A MEMBER OF BAL MASQUE
WE'VE FACED OFF AGAINST BEFORE.

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,416
- HE MEANS
THE SUPREME THRONE HECATE.

33
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,083
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO USED YUJI

34
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,416
TO TRY AND CREATE A FOUNTAIN
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE.

35
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,125
- I REMEMBER NOW.

36
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,250
DO YOU THINK SHE'S COME
BACK HERE LOOKING FOR SAKAI?

37
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,416
- Yuji: NO,
IT CAN'T BE HER.

38
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,416
IF IT WAS, THE SEAL
WOULDN'T HAVE STOPPED HER.

39
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,208
SHE'D STILL BE MOVING.

40
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,208
- Alastor: HMM,
EVEN SO...

41
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,166
- Shana: SHE LOOKS
JUST LIKE HER.

42
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,333
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
ALASTOR?

43
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,875
IS IT POSSIBLE
FOR A CRIMSON DENIZEN

44
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,916
TO IMITATE A HUMAN
THIS WELL?

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,250
- Alastor: IT'S NOTHING
I'VE EVER SEEN DONE BEFORE.

46
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,916
HOWEVER, THAT CERTAINLY DOESN'T
MEAN THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,875
- I SEE.

48
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,250
- SHANA, I KNOW
THEY LOOK ALIKE,

49
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,833
BUT I DON'T SENSE THE SAME THING
I DID WITH HECATE.

50
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,250
I HONESTLY DON'T THINK
IT'S HER.

51
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,583
- I WANT TO AGREE.
STILL...

52
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,291
I JUST DON'T BUY IT.  A GIRL
WHO LOOKS IDENTICAL TO HECATE

53
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,416
HAPPENS TO SHOW UP
IN THE SAME CITY AS YOU

54
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,833
AND AT THE SAME SCHOOL,
NO LESS?

55
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,958
- YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO?

56
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,250
- Alastor: WE CANNOT MAINTAIN
THIS SEAL FOREVER, SHANA.

57
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,916
FOR NOW, WE'LL SIMPLY
HAVE TO STAY CAUTIOUS

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,875
AND KEEP A CLOSE EYE
ON HER.

59
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,708
- MISS HIRAI,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

60
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,000
- NO, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

61
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,833
- ALL RIGHT.
AS I WAS SAYING,

62
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,500
KONOE HAS LIVED ABROAD
SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD.

63
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,833
SHE ONLY RECENTLY RETURNED
TO THIS COUNTRY

64
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,083
AND THEREFORE MIGHT REQUIRE
SOME ASSISTANCE.

65
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,875
- ( students chattering )

66
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,625
- I'M SURE
YOU CAN ALL IMAGINE

67
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,875
THE CULTURE SHOCK
SHE'S GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

68
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,083
LET'S MAKE HER FEEL
WELCOME, OKAY?

69
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,791
- Students: YES, SIR.

70
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,541
- KONOE, NOW THAT WE'VE
INTRODUCED YOU TO THE CLASS,

71
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,208
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE EMPTY SEAT

72
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,083
TOWARD THE BACK
OF THE ROOM?

73
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,166
NO, THAT ONE'S TAKEN.

74
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,416
YOU CAN HAVE THE ONE
THAT'S A LITTLE FURTHER BACK.

75
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,583
- I WOULD LIKE TO SIT HERE.
- THIS IS MY DESK.

76
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,333
- BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO SIT THERE.

77
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,083
- WHAT?  NO.
TEACHER.

78
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,583
- WELL, IT IS
HER FIRST DAY.

79
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,375
OKAY, SUGANO, GO AHEAD
AND SWITCH SEATS WITH HER.

80
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,208
- Sugano: HUH?

81
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,875
- Shana:
THAT CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE.

82
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,791
- Teacher: NOW LET'S
GET STARTED.

83
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,541
WHERE DID WE
LEAVE OFF?

84
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,333
UH, KONOE, DO YOU NOT HAVE
THE TEXTBOOKS FOR THIS COURSE?

85
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,750
- I HAVE THEM.
THEY'RE IN MY BAG.

86
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,250
- MM, THEN MAYBE
YOU COULD TAKE THEM OUT?

87
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,166
- YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE THEM OUT MYSELF?

88
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,958
- OF COURSE.
YOU DON'T REALLY EXPECT

89
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,625
SOMEONE ELSE TO DO THAT
FOR YOU, DO YOU?

90
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,250
- NO, I CAN DO IT.

91
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,250
- HERE, I'LL HELP YOU.

92
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,291
- Teacher: THANKS, SAKAI.

93
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,583
WILL YOU KEEP AN EYE ON HER?
- YES, SIR.

94
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,708
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.
- NO PROB.

95
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,541
THAT'S STRANGE.
WHAT'S THIS?

96
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:57,625
OH, MY BUTLER GAVE ME THAT
TO COVER THE TOP OF MY DESK.

97
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,125
- SHE'S AN ODD DUCK.
THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

98
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,625
- HEY, SATO, WAKE UP.
SCHOOL'S ALREADY STARTED.

99
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,875
WE ARE SO LATE.
WE'RE GONNA BE DEAD MEAT.

100
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,916
- JUST FIVE MORE
MINUTES.

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,416
- ( laughs ) YOU POOR KIDS
DO KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRY

102
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,416
AND KEEP UP WITH HER
EVERY NIGHT, DON'T YOU?

103
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,416
- I'M INCLINED
TO AGREE WITH YOU.

104
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,958
- ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M SENSING
A SNEAKY PRESENCE

105
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,916
HERE IN MISAKI CITY.
- IS IT A DENIZEN?

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,541
- IT'S GOTTA BE.  BUT I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING.

107
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,083
THERE ARE ALREADY THREE
FLAME HAZE STATIONED HERE.

108
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,375
IF THEY'RE SMART, THEN THEY'LL
LEAVE BEFORE WE CAN GET TO 'EM.

109
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,083
BUT IF NOT,
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO--

110
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,041
( snoring )

111
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,208
- WHAT A LOVELY CITY.

112
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,458
SHOULD BE A FLAME HAZE
HERE SOMEWHERE,

113
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:20,375
HOPEFULLY ONE THAT CAN
KEEP ME ENTERTAINED.

114
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,083
- ( clock chiming )

115
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,125
- HEY, GUYS, THE P.E. SCHEDULE'S
BEEN SWITCHED UP,

116
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,875
SO THE BOYS ARE ON THE FIELD NOW
AND THE GIRLS ARE IN THE GYM.

117
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,541
- Students: OKAY.

118
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,125
- LISTEN, YUJI, I WANT YOU
TO KEEP YOUR GUARD UP.

119
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,791
WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN WHETHER
IT'S REALLY HER YET OR NOT.

120
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,041
- I KNOW.

121
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,208
- HEY, KONOE,
DID YOU BRING

122
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,208
GYM CLOTHES WITH YOU?
- YES.

123
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,208
- THINK YOU CAN CHANGE
INTO THEM YOURSELF

124
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,208
OR DO YOU NEED YOUR BUTLER
TO HELP YOU?

125
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,000
- I DON'T KNOW.

126
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,125
I AM USED TO ASSISTANCE, BUT
I GUESS I COULD DO IT MYSELF.

127
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,000
- ( laughs )

128
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,625
WHAT, ARE YOU SOME KIND OF
FOREIGN PRINCESS OR SOMETHING?

129
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,375
I SWEAR, YOU ARE TOTALLY
CRACKING ME UP.

130
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,958
DON'T WORRY, I'LL HELP YOU OUT.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

131
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,125
KAZUMI.

132
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,250
- Yuji: DANG, SHE LOOKS
JUST LIKE HER.

133
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,833
- Shana: I WISH
THERE WAS SOME WAY

134
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,208
FOR US TO CONFIRM
OUR SUSPICIONS ABOUT HER.

135
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,375
- I STILL DON'T SENSE
THAT SHE'S A DENIZEN.

136
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,083
- YOU WOULDN'T.

137
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,625
- WE'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE
TO DEAL WITH ANYWAY.

138
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,375
- OH, DO WE?

139
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,625
- THERE'S A DENIZEN SOMEWHERE
ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.

140
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,541
CAN YOU NOT SENSE
ITS PRESENCE?

141
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,791
- I THINK I'LL JUST
LET IT BE FOR NOW.

142
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,083
HECATE IS MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT.

143
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,583
BUT I AM IMPRESSED
THAT YOU NOTICED IT WAS THERE.

144
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,166
- SHE COMPLIMENTED ME.

145
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,833
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

146
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,458
WHY IS SHE IGNORING
THE DENIZEN?

147
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,416
THAT CAN'T BE SAFE.

148
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,000
- OKAY, ARMS UP.
THERE WE GO.

149
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,166
TRY TO HOLD STILL, OKAY?
NO STRUGGLING.

150
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,625
GOOD.  ALL FINISHED.

151
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,625
- Fumina: I CAN'T BRING MYSELF
TO BELIEVE

152
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,583
THIS SWEET GIRL
IS ONE OF THEM.

153
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,958
I HOPE THEY'RE WRONG
ABOUT HER.

154
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,500
- ( students chattering )

155
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,208
- Kazumi: IF KONOE REALLY IS A
CRIMSON DENIZEN,

156
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,666
THEN THAT MEANS
SHE'S AFTER SAKAI.

157
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,833
- ( blows whistle )

158
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,291
- Girl: COME ON!
YOU CAN DO IT!

159
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,583
- I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS
FINALLY BACK TO NORMAL.

160
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:56,000
BUT NOW THE ONE I CARE ABOUT
MOST IS IN DANGER AGAIN.

161
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,791
NOTHING'S SIMPLE
ANYMORE.

162
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,708
I SHOULD HAVE
EXPECTED THAT.

163
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,791
- Ogata: LOOK OUT, KAZUMI!

164
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,708
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

165
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,041
- YEAH, I THINK SO.

166
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,500
- I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT YOU.

167
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,666
- I'M OKAY.

168
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,250
NO NEED TO CRY.

169
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,666
- ( whistle blows )

170
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,000
- ( students cheering )

171
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,375
- SO, KONOE...

172
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,125
- UH-HUH?

173
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,166
WHEN YOU WERE CHOOSING
YOUR SEAT THIS MORNING,

174
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,875
WELL I-- I NOTICED THAT
YOU WANTED TO SIT BY SAKAI.

175
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,000
WAS THERE ANY REASON?

176
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,291
- WHO'S SAKAI?
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER HIM?

177
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,333
HE'S THE BOY
WHO SITS NEXT TO YOU.

178
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,333
- OH, THAT'S HIS NAME?

179
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,208
- I'M SORRY.  I SHOULDN'T HAVE
EXPECTED YOU TO KNOW THAT.

180
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,333
IT'S JUST, WELL, I--

181
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,958
I-- I WONDERED IF YOU KNEW
SAKAI FROM SOMEWHERE,

182
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,500
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU HAD MET HIM
OR RUN INTO HIM BEFORE,

183
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,583
AND WHETHER YOUR TRANSFER TO OUR
SCHOOL WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE

184
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,791
OR POSSIBLY A CHANCE
FOR YOU TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

185
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,166
UM, KONOE?

186
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,125
YOU AWAKE?

187
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,416
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST
OVERANALYZING THINGS.

188
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,916
- YOU HUNGRY?
IT'S LUNCHTIME.

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,500
I KNOW.  BUT I CAN'T START
EATING UNTIL IT GETS HERE.

190
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,500
- UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

191
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,500
- I'M WAITING FOR LUNCH.

192
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,208
- DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE WAITING
FOR SOMEBODY TO BRING IT TO YOU.

193
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,666
- HMM?

194
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,166
- YOU'RE HYSTERICAL.

195
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,166
NOBODY IS GONNA
WAIT ON YOU HERE.

196
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,291
WAIT ALL YOU WANT,
BUT LUNCH ISN'T COMING.

197
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,250
WE HAVE TO GO TO IT.

198
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,166
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- ARE YOU COMING?

199
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,250
- UH, WELL, NO.

200
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,208
I ALREADY HAVE A LUNCH.

201
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,000
- I SEE.

202
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,958
- ( Ogata chuckles ) LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE HAS A LITTLE CRUSH.

203
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,250
COME ON, KONOE.

204
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,666
( laughs )

205
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,833
- THAT GIRL'S RIDICULOUS.

206
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,791
HOW PAMPERED
CAN ONE PERSON BE?

207
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,750
- UH, SAKAI,
I KNOW SHANA'S SUSPICIOUS

208
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,833
BUT I DON'T THINK
KONOE'S ONE OF THEM.

209
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,083
- HMM, YEAH.

210
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,083
- I THINK IT'S ALL
JUST AN ACT.

211
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,708
- Ike: WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

212
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,750
- OH.
- THERE YOU GUYS ARE.

213
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,750
WILL YOU EVER MAKE IT
TO CLASS ON TIME?

214
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,041
- CHILL OUT.
- THAT CHICK WE JUST SAW--

215
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,125
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HER.
IS SHE A NEW STUDENT?

216
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,916
- MM-HMM.

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,416
WAIT.

218
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,916
- ( Sato over speaker )
MARGERY, MARGERY,

219
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,916
PLEASE PICK UP.

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,916
- HEY, WAKE UP!
YOU GOT A CALL.

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,083
- NOT SO LOUD.

222
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,416
YEAH?

223
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,333
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

224
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,291
- ARE YOU SURE IT'S WISE TO RELY
ON THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES?

225
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:54,041
- WHY NOT?  SHE IS A SPECIALIST
IN UNRESTRICTED SPELLS.

226
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,666
- Alastor: HMM.

227
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,416
- I GUESS WE COULD USE ANOTHER
SET OF EYES ON THIS ONE.

228
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,750
AND THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT
PLACE TO CAST A SPELL.

229
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,625
- ( laughs )

230
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,750
THERE YOU ARE,
MY PRETTIES.

231
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,250
I SMELL
EVERY ONE OF YOU.

232
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,250
- Ogata: THIS ONE'S NOT BAD,

233
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,916
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I'D STAY AWAY FROM THAT ONE.

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,791
OOH, AND THAT ONE TOO.

235
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,791
WHERE'D SHE GO?

236
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,041
- ( chirping )

237
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,916
- THESE BIRDS ARE HERE
IN JAPAN TOO.

238
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,750
IS THIS YOUR HOME,
LITTLE BIRDIES?

239
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,583
- HUH, I'M NOT SURPRISED

240
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,625
THE MIDGET
IS SUSPICIOUS OF HER.

241
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,083
- Marcosias: THAT'S SOME CRAZY
STUFF!  SHE WASN'T KIDDING!

242
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,875
THEY'RE LIKE
IDENTICAL TWINS.

243
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,625
- JUST PHYSICALLY THOUGH.
I DON'T SENSE THE POWER IN HER.

244
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,333
WELL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
CHECK HER OUT ANYWAY.

245
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,666
WHEN A MAN
HAS MARRIED A WIFE...

246
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,958
- Marcosias: HE FINDS OUT
WHETHER...

247
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,791
HER KNEES AND ELBOWS
ARE ONLY GLUED TOGETHER!

248
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,625
- HUH?  HUH?

249
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,250
DON'T GO.

250
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,333
- KONOE, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

251
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,833
THE FOOD WAS GOING QUICK,
SO I GRABBED YOU SOMETHING.

252
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,958
- THAT WAS NICE,
THANK YOU.

253
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,750
- Marcosias: HUH.
NO REACTION AT ALL.

254
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,666
- Margery: SHE DIDN'T EVEN
NOTICE THE UNRESTRICTED SPELL.

255
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,041
WE'VE DONE OUR PART.
NOW IT'S UP TO THE MIDGET.

256
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,750
- THAT WAS A SPELL.

257
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,625
NOW I GOTCHA.
( chuckles )

258
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:29,000
- Yuji: WELL, MARGERY TESTED HER
AND SHE PASSED,

259
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,416
SO THERE'S NO WAY
KONOE IS HECATE.

260
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,458
- MAYBE NOT, BUT I'M STILL
NOT GONNA LET MY GUARD DOWN.

261
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,333
I NEED MORE PROOF
BEFORE I CAN BE SURE OF THAT.

262
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,041
- I MIGHT BE
OUT OF LINE,

263
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,541
BUT SHOULD YOU LET THAT MUCH
OF YOUR POWER LEAK OUT

264
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,541
WHILE YOU'RE JUST
WALKING AROUND?

265
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,708
THAT DENIZEN IS STILL
AWFULLY CLOSE BY.

266
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,750
SHOULDN'T WE, I DON'T KNOW,
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

267
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,208
- YUJI, I THINK
YOU SHOULD HEAD HOME.

268
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,541
- WHY?
- JUST DO IT!

269
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,750
- SHANA.

270
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,541
- Alastor: WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE

271
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,166
TO ABANDON THE MYSTES
LIKE THAT?

272
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,166
- 'CAUSE HE'LL ONLY
GET IN MY WAY.

273
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,750
- AH, DUE TO
THE BRUTALITY INVOLVED.

274
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:13,958
- HUH?

275
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,375
THIS MUST BE
WHERE YOU LIVE, HUH?

276
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,625
- THE PERFECT PLACE
TO TAKE THEM ON.

277
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,416
- Alastor: IT SEEMS THE DENIZEN
HAS NOTICED US.

278
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,666
IT'S COMING.
- HMM.

279
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,625
I'M GOING TO PERFORM A TEST
TO DETERMINE

280
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,000
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE
THE SUPREME THRONE HECATE.

281
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,958
- HECATE?

282
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,166
- CAST A SEAL!

283
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,916
- ( laughing )

284
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,625
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU,

285
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,958
PRECIOUS FLAME HAZE.
HA-HA!

286
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,958
GOOD.  YOU'RE GONNA
PUT UP A FIGHT.

287
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,208
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN BEAT ME--

288
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,208
KASHA, ALSO KNOWN AS THE DEBRIS
OF THE DASHING CROOK?

289
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,083
- CAN'T SAY
I'VE HEARD THE NAME.

290
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,583
- HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO RECOGNIZE US EITHER.

291
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,458
HE MUST BE A NEWBORN.
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

292
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,875
BUT MY REPUTATION'S
GOTTA START SOMEWHERE.

293
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,041
HA!

294
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,250
( laughing )

295
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,416
SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU TOUCH MY RINGS?

296
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,000
THEY'RE A POWERFUL TREASURE TOOL
CALLED CHORDE.

297
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,166
HOW THE HELL WERE YOU ABLE
TO HURT ME LIKE THAT?

298
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,833
- YOU'RE JUST
A NEWBORN,

299
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,833
EASILY BEATEN
BY SOMEONE OF MY STRENGTH.

300
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,833
- Alastor: SO WEAK
FOR SUCH BIG TALK.

301
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,333
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
CAUTIOUS WITH YOUR WORDS.

302
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,666
- ( laughs )

303
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,250
THAT'LL TEACH YOU
TO UNDERESTIMATE ME.

304
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,208
AWW, BUT I FORGOT TO ASK THAT
LITTLE FLAME HAZE HER NAME.

305
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,375
HOW WILL I BRAG
ABOUT MY SUCCESS?

306
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,583
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
MY NAME?

307
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,791
I'M THE FLAMING-HAIRED,
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

308
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,583
AND MY NAME IS SHANA!

309
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,166
- FLAMING-HAIRED,
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

310
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,458
BUT THAT MEANS YOU'RE THE FLAME
OF THE HEAVEN'S--

311
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,750
- Alastor: WELL,
I GIVE YOU CREDIT

312
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,041
FOR RECOGNIZING
THE TITLE AT LEAST.

313
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,458
- I HAVE TO HEAL MY ARM.

314
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,166
I NEED POWER.

315
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,458
I NEED
POWER OF EXISTENCE.

316
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,458
- SHANA!

317
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,500
- IF THAT IS HECATE,

318
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,250
SHE WON'T LET THE DENIZEN
KILL HER.  WE'LL KNOW THE TRUTH.

319
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,250
- Yuji: THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HOLDING BACK?

320
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,041
- POWER.
POWER OF EXISTENCE.

321
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,208
- SHANA YOU CAN'T
DO THIS TO HER.

322
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,708
KONOE'S A HUMAN BEING.
FIGHT HIM.

323
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,000
- KONOE!

324
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,833
- BLOOD.

325
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,708
- SHE IS HUMAN.
- Alastor: YES.

326
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,875
- Yuji: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE
BAITING THAT DENIZEN

327
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,875
JUST SO YOU COULD
TEST KONOE.

328
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,875
- I ASSUMED THAT KASHA WAS
AVOIDING THE CITY

329
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,708
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY

330
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,958
WHERE THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
AND I WERE LOCATED.

331
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,708
BUT AS SOON AS THE CHANTER USED
AN UNRESTRICTED SPELL ON KONOE,

332
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,833
KASHA WAS FINALLY ABLE TO
SENSE US AND HE TOOK THE BAIT.

333
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:33,333
LUCKILY, IT ALL WENT
EXACTLY AS I HAD PLANNED.

334
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,875
- REALLY?  AND WHAT IF KONOE
HAD BEEN KILLED

335
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,875
BY THAT DENIZEN?
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE THEN?

336
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,208
- I SAVED HER, DIDN'T I?
SHUT IT.

337
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,875
- STILL...
- I HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE.

338
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,291
NOW WE KNOW FOR SURE SHE'S
HUMAN, SO YOU CAN CONCENTRATE

339
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,833
ON YOUR TRAINING AGAIN.
WILHELMINA'S WAITING.

340
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,000
- UH...
- YOU ARE READY, AREN'T YOU?

341
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,750
- SURE.

342
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,250
- I HAVE TRIED
MY HARDEST, MISTRESS.

343
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,750
I HOPE I DID WELL.

344
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,875
- INDEED.
YOU DID VERY WELL.

345
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,833
PERFECTLY, IN FACT.

346
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,750
IT'S JUST
WHAT I WANTED,

347
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,708
FECOR.

348
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,875
- THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
I'M GLAD.

349
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,916
AT LEAST WE KNOW
KONOE'S NOT A DENIZEN.

350
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,875
- NOPE.  SHE JUST HAPPENS
TO LOOK LIKE ONE.

351
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,791
- THAT'S AWESOME.
WE CAN GO BACK TO NORMAL.

352
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,416
OH, HEY THERE, KONOE.
GOOD MORNING.

353
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,375
- GOOD MORNING
TO YOU AS WELL.

354
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,000
I'M GETTING READY
FOR CLASS.

355
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,125
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
TAKING 'EM OUT ONE AT A TIME.

356
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,000
IT'S A LOT EASIER
THAT WAY.

357
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,500
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
A FEATHER IN YOUR HAIR.

358
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,750
- A FEATHER?

359
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,375
YEAH.  SORRY, IT'S PRETTY
TANGLED IN THERE.

360
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,333
CAN YOU TILT YOUR HEAD
TOWARD ME?

361
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,916
OKAY, ALMOST GOT IT.

362
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,125
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

363
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:31,041
- Yuji:
SHANA SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN UP

364
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,041
HER SUSPICIONS
REGARDING KONOE.

365
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,291
BUT EVERY TIME SHANA SEES HER
STANDING NEXT TO ME,

366
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,750
I CAN SENSE HER EMOTIONS
WELLING UP WITHIN HER.

367
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,583
THE SAME GOES
FOR YOSHIDA TOO.

368
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,583
I GUESS WE ALL
HAVE A HARD TIME

369
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:45,625
GETTING USED TO FEELINGS
WE'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE.

370
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,500
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II,"

371
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,500
"THE DISTRESSED GIRLS."
