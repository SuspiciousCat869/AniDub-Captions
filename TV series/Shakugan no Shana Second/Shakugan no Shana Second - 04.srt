1
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,541
- Alastor: SHANA
SUSPECTS THAT TRANSFER STUDENT

2
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,333
FUMINA KONOE MAY ACTUALLY BE
THE SUPREME THRONE HECATE,

3
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,041
FORCING A RISKY CHOICE
WHEN A DENIZEN APPEARS.

4
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,416
WHILE IN MORTAL DANGER
IN THE SEAL,

5
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,083
FUMINA DOESN'T MOVE AN INCH,
THUS CLEARING HER OF SUSPICION.

6
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,166
HOWEVER, WATCHING FUMINA AND
YUJI SPEND TIME TOGETHER

7
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,625
HAS CAUSED PANGS OF JEALOUSY
DEEP WITHIN SHANA'S HEART.

8
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,208
- ( theme song playing )

9
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,125
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,458
- ( birds chirping )

11
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,625
- SO, SINCE YOU'RE STILL GETTING
ADJUSTED TO MISAKI CITY,

12
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,958
WE'LL COME BY AND PICK YOU UP
FOR SCHOOL IN THE MORNINGS.

13
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,666
LET US KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING

14
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,958
AND WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE CAN
TO HELP YOU OUT.

15
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,375
- OH, THANK YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN SO HELPFUL.

16
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,750
- Teacher: KONOE,

17
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,750
ARE YOU HAVING A HARD TIME
OVER THERE?

18
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,208
I GUESS I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO ASK SOMEONE

19
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,208
TO LOOK AFTER HER
FULL-TIME.

20
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,000
HMM.

21
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,250
AH.

22
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,750
- HUH?  ME?
ARE YOU SURE?

23
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,333
- YOU'RE THE MOST
RESPONSIBLE KID IN CLASS.

24
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,666
KONOE, WHY DON'T YOU GO
TAKE A SEAT NEXT TO IKE?

25
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,291
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
GO AHEAD.

26
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,000
EH?

27
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,541
- WHY IS SHE SO ATTACHED
TO YOU, YUJI?

28
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,541
- GIVE HER A CHANCE,
WILL YOU?

29
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,458
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE'S TAKEN A LIKING TO ME.

30
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,166
- HMM.

31
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,166
- BUT UNTIL SHE GETS USED TO
HER NEW WAY OF LIFE HERE,

32
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,750
WE NEED TO HELP HER OUT
A LITTLE.

33
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,958
- HEY, YOSHIDA.
GOOD MORNING.

34
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,041
- I WAS WONDERING WHEN
YOU'D GET HERE.  GOOD MORNING.

35
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,416
- WHATEVER.

36
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,375
- HI, KONOE.
HOW ARE YOU?

37
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,708
- I'M FINE,
MISS YOSHIDA.

38
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,541
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

39
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,416
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
WAIT FOR US.

40
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,416
- I KNOW, BUT I COULDN'T
HELP BUT FEEL

41
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,083
KIND OF GUILTY
ABOUT IT ALL.

42
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,708
YOU WALKED WITH HER
THIS MORNING,

43
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,333
BUT I'M SUPPOSED TO
LOOK AFTER HER TOO.

44
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,125
- I TOLD YOU,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

45
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,125
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT.

46
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,166
HER HOUSE IS ON MY WAY.  YOU
LIVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

47
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,708
- STILL THOUGH...
- I TELL YOU WHAT:

48
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,458
I'LL WALK HER
TO SCHOOL,

49
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,000
BUT GIRL STUFF--
I'LL LEAVE THAT UP TO YOU.

50
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,625
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

51
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,500
- ( both chuckle )

52
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,916
- WE NEED TO GET GOING, OR
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CLASS.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,500
- WELL, ARE YOU READY
TO START THE DAY?

54
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,208
- SURE.
- ( clock chiming )

55
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,833
- SINCE WHEN DOES P.E. CLASS
MEAN CLEANING THE POOL?

56
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,166
AREN'T THERE CHILD LABOR LAWS?
- WHO KNOWS?

57
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,875
WELL, I GUESS IT'S BETTER
THAN SITTING AT A DESK.

58
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,333
- KONOE, LOOK OUT!

59
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,666
- ( sighs )
MAN, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

60
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,291
- Tanaka: HEY, WHAT'S UP?
- YOU'RE TOO COOL TO HELP, HUH?

61
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,708
( laughing )

62
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,833
- OKAY, YOU HOLD IT
BY THE HANDLE,

63
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,041
THEN PUSH DOWN
AS YOU MOVE FORWARD.

64
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,583
- Tanaka: HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.
- CAN'T CATCH ME!

65
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,041
- OH, YEAH?
PAYBACK!

66
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,750
- YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT
TO SHANA, WOULD YOU?

67
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,666
- ( groans )
- MM!

68
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,125
- TAKE THAT!

69
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,625
- HA-HA!  YOU MISSED ME!
- ARGH!

70
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,833
- Yuji: TANAKA!

71
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,041
- ( laughing )

72
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,291
- I'M GONNA GET YOU.

73
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,833
- Ogata: NYAH-NYAH!
- Tanaka: HEY!

74
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,375
- TAKE THAT!

75
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,875
- ( exclaims )

76
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,875
- ( laughs )
YEAH!

77
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,625
- RICE BALLS AGAIN?
YOU LIKE 'EM THAT MUCH?

78
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,583
- I LOVE 'EM.

79
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,000
RICE BALLS ARE SO TASTY.
THEY'RE MY FAVORITE FOOD.

80
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,000
- ( laughs )

81
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,583
- YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN, SAKAI.
I MEAN, TWO BOXED LUNCHES?

82
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,125
- ( chuckles )

83
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,166
SOMETHING WRONG?

84
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,833
WANT TO TRY SOME?

85
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,416
- PLEASE.

86
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,333
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, KONOE.

87
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,333
THAT'S NO ORDINARY
BOXED LUNCH.

88
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,083
KAZUMI WORKED REALLY HARD
TO MAKE IT JUST FOR SAKAI.

89
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,791
- OH, SHE CAN HAVE SOME.
I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,875
- WELL, JUST
A LITTLE TASTE.

91
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,958
- IT'S DELICIOUS.

92
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,250
- YOU WANT TO TRY?

93
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,875
- YES, PLEASE.

94
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,041
- IS THAT OKAY?
- WHY SHOULD I CARE?

95
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,666
IT BELONGS TO YOU NOW.
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT.

96
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,208
- WELL THEN,
HERE YOU GO.

97
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,250
- Yuji: WE'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW, YOSHIDA.

98
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,750
CAREFUL WALKING HOME.
- I WILL.

99
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,166
- THERE THEY GO.

100
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,625
YOU WANT TO GO
WITH THEM, HUH?

101
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOU SHOULD TAG ALONG.

102
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,458
YOU'RE PARTIALLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR HER.

103
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,291
AND THEY THINK
I'M THE RESPONSIBLE ONE.

104
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,958
- Shana: GREAT,
NOW YOSHIDA'S DECIDED

105
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,708
TO WALK HOME
WITH US TOO.

106
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,958
I USED TO HAVE YUJI
ALL TO MYSELF.

107
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,291
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.

108
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,333
THIS RESTAURANT
IS BRAND NEW, ISN'T IT?

109
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,500
- Yuji: SEEMS LIKE
A COOL PLACE.

110
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,500
LOOK, AND IT SAYS TOMORROW'S
THEIR GRAND OPENING.

111
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,916
HEY, WE SHOULD GET THE GANG
TOGETHER FOR A BITE.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,125
I THINK IT'D BE FUN.
- ME TOO.

113
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,916
- WHAT'S THIS?
SUPERSIZE HEAVEN?

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,333
WAIT A SEC.

115
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,083
WHERE DID KONOE
RUN OFF TO?

116
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,000
- Yuji: THERE SHE IS.

117
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,333
HEY, KONOE, WAIT UP!

118
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,875
- YOU CAN'T JUST
WANDER OFF LIKE THAT.

119
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,875
PERSONALLY I DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU,

120
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,416
BUT WE GAVE OUR WORD WE'D LOOK
AFTER YOU, SO AT LEAST TRY

121
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,375
TO STAY CLOSE TO US.
- JEEZ, SHANA.

122
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,416
- SORRY I UPSET YOU.

123
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,833
- YOU BIG BABY!
- Yuji: JEEZ, SHANA.

124
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,291
YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL AT HER.
- FINE.

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,541
- WHAT IS IT?

126
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,083
- WHAT THE HECK IS SHE DOING
OVER THERE?

127
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,375
- Kazumi: THAT'S AMAZING.

128
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,375
- ( bird chirping )

129
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,791
- Margery: I SEE.

130
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,333
SO IT TURNS OUT
THAT TRANSFER STUDENT

131
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,041
DIDN'T HAVE A SUSPICIOUS BONE
IN HER BODY AFTER ALL.

132
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,833
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.  IN FACT,
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY

133
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,541
SHE'S THE MOST HARMLESS PERSON
AT OUR SCHOOL.

134
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,750
- REALLY NOW?
DID YOU COME UP WITH ANYTHING?

135
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,750
WHAT DID OUTLAW
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT?

136
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,208
HAVE THEY
REPLIED YET?

137
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,666
- ( yells )

138
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,166
- INDEED THEY HAVE NOT,
MISS MARGERY.  THERE IS NO NEWS

139
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,708
REGARDING THE MOVEMENTS
OF BAL MASQUE AT THIS TIME.

140
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,333
- FIGURED AS MUCH.

141
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,583
THEIR RESEMBLANCE
IS JUST A COINCIDENCE.

142
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,416
WHY WOULD THEY EVER
SEND HECATE

143
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,916
TO A PLACE OCCUPIED
BY FLAME HAZE?

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,833
EVEN THAT FOOL BEL-PEOL
KNOWS BETTER, RIGHT?

145
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,125
- I DON'T--
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

146
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,125
WE'VE GOT TO BE MORE CAREFUL
NOW THAT WE KNOW

147
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,333
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
HAS A KEEPER ON IT.

148
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,875
- EXCUSE ME,

149
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,333
WHAT WAS THIS OUTLAW THING
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

150
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,916
- IT IS A SITE
WHERE FLAME HAZE GATHER

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,208
TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

152
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,125
- Tiamat: LIKE A SUPPORT
GROUP.

153
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,583
- Marcosias: SINCE FLAME HAZE
LIKE WORKING SOLO, THE OUTLAW'S

154
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,250
THE ONLY PLACE YOU'LL FIND
A FEW HANGING AROUND.

155
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,125
- NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF MY BUSINESS,

156
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,125
BUT DON'T YOU HAVE
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO

157
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,000
THAN SIT AROUND HERE
ALL DAY?

158
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,708
THE RUNT AND THAT MYSTES
MUST BE

159
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,708
IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAINING
BY NOW, RIGHT?

160
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:43,000
ARE YOU SURE IT'S OKAY
TO LEAVE THEM UNSUPERVISED?

161
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,000
- INDEED.
IT IS ONLY THIS ONE TIME.

162
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,666
- ( ice clinks )
- YEAH?

163
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,750
I THINK YOU MAY BE
GIVING YUJI TOO MUCH CREDIT.

164
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,166
- Tiamat: HE IS
PRETTY SLOW.

165
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,708
- WELL, IT SOUNDS
LIKE THOSE TWO

166
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,625
ARE GONNA HAVE
A GRAND OLD TIME TONIGHT.

167
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,750
I'LL HAVE A DRINK IN THEIR
HONOR.  TO SHANA AND YUJI.

168
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,250
- Sato:
SO SAKAI HAS BEEN TRAINING

169
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,375
AGAINST A FLAME HAZE
ALL THIS TIME?

170
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,416
- WATCH IT, SHANA.

171
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,333
WHY THE HECK ARE YOU BEING
SO HARD ON ME TONIGHT?

172
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,458
- GET UP
AND START FIGHTING!

173
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,333
- Shana:
WHY?

174
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,333
WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY?

175
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,500
- Alastor: ALL RIGHT, YUJI,
I WANT YOU TO TRY AND ANTICIPATE

176
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,958
SHANA'S ATTACKS
THROUGH HER SHIFTING MOVEMENTS.

177
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,625
- ( yells )

178
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,208
- ( screams )

179
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,166
ARGH.

180
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,583
- YOU'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO.
- Alastor: YUJI SAKAI,

181
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,958
YOUR SENSES
ARE INCREDIBLY SHARP.

182
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,958
AND I CAN TELL YOU HAVE
THE EQUIVALENT

183
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,833
OF A CRIMSON LORD'S
POWER OF EXISTENCE WITHIN YOU.

184
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,333
DEPENDING ON YOUR
PROGRESS IN TRAINING,

185
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,666
YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF
FOLLOWING A PATH

186
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,166
OTHER THAN THAT OF AN ORDINARY
TORCH OR MYSTES.

187
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,958
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
- IS THERE MORE I COULD DO?

188
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,958
- YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF
ON A PATH

189
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,000
ONLY YOU ARE CAPABLE
OF FOLLOWING.

190
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,375
- YOU'RE BECOMING
STRONGER, YUJI.

191
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,208
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

192
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,083
LONG AS YOU KEEP WORKING HARD
WITHOUT DISTRACTIONS, THAT IS.

193
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,541
- WHAT'S
A "SUPERSIZE HEAVEN"?

194
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,541
- Sato: I HEARD
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

195
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,750
- Ike: I DIDN'T THINK TANAKA AND
SATO WERE GONNA COME WITH US.

196
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,625
- SATO'D NEVER TURN DOWN A PLACE
CALLED "SUPERSIZE HEAVEN."

197
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,291
- Waitress: OKAY,
SUPERSIZE CURRY,

198
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,125
SUPERSIZE KATSU-DON,

199
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,125
SUPERSIZE RAMEN

200
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,083
AND ANOTHER
SUPERSIZE RAMEN.

201
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,125
- OH, KATSU-DON,
HOW I LOVE THEE.

202
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,083
BUT KNOW THIS:
I WILL DESTROY YOU.

203
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,666
- SAKAI, I CHALLENGE YOU!

204
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,458
( slurping )

205
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,541
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO PROVE, BUT YOU'RE ON.

206
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,875
- HEY, SHANA, ARE YOU GONNA
EAT ALL THAT BY YOURSELF?

207
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,083
- WELL, I'M CERTAINLY NOT GONNA
SHARE IT WITH YOU THREE IDIOTS.

208
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,291
- IF YOU ASK ME,

209
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,041
WHAT WE ORDERED IS MORE THAN
ENOUGH FOR ONE PERSON.

210
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,375
- Ike: DON'T PUSH YOURSELVES
TOO HARD, GUYS.

211
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,625
YOU MIGHT GET SICK.

212
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,500
- Tanaka: COME ON, SATO!

213
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,291
YOU CAN TAKE HIM!

214
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,416
- GO EASY,
OR YOU'RE GONNA HURL.

215
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,500
- ( bird chirping )

216
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,541
- WHOA, A TIE.
- EPIC MEAL TIME.

217
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,666
- ( Yuji groans )
- Kazumi: YOU OKAY, SAKAI?

218
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,333
- Sato: DAMN IT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T WIN.

219
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,041
- Kazumi: WAIT A MINUTE.
- Ike: WHAT'S THE MATTER?

220
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,041
- Kazumi: WHERE'S KONOE?
SHE WAS JUST HERE.

221
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,416
I NEVER EVEN SAW HER
LEAVE THE TABLE.

222
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,541
- Ike: WAS SHE IN THERE?

223
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,416
- HUH-UH.
WE LOOKED ALL OVER.

224
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,833
- WE CHECKED THE RESTROOM
AND EVERYTHING, BUT NO LUCK.

225
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,250
- SHE COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
TOO FAR FROM US, RIGHT?

226
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,041
- I SURE HOPE NOT.
LET'S FIND HER.

227
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,416
- Shana: WHY BOTHER?

228
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,166
- WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

229
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,541
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU HAVE TO GO LOOKING FOR HER.

230
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,541
- WELL, BECAUSE
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR HER.

231
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,250
- THAT'S ONLY
WHEN WE'RE ON CAMPUS.

232
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,541
- YEAH, BUT WE'RE STILL
ON OUR WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL.

233
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,291
AND I PROMISED
OUR TEACHER

234
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,000
THAT I'D MAKE SURE
SHE ARRIVES SAFELY.

235
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,416
- WE'VE ALREADY WARNED KONOE
NOT TO WANDER OFF.

236
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,958
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
WE'VE DONE ALL WE NEED TO,

237
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,458
AND IT'S NOT OUR FAULT
SHE GOT LOST.

238
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,625
- SHANA.

239
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,875
- SEE YOU.

240
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,875
- SHANA, WAIT UP!

241
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,250
WHAT ARE YOU
SO ANGRY ABOUT?

242
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,916
- I'M NOT ANGRY
ABOUT ANYTHING.

243
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,291
- DON'T LIE TO ME.
- I'M NOT LYING.

244
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,041
IT'S JUST THAT I--

245
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,041
- THAT YOU WHAT?
SHANA.

246
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,958
- I WISH YOU'D JUST
FORGET ABOUT HER.

247
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,958
- WHERE'S THIS HATRED
COMING FROM?

248
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,458
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S
A DENIZEN OR ANYTHING.

249
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,625
- IT'S NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT.

250
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,750
THE TRUTH OF IT IS...

251
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,541
- TELL ME.
- NO.

252
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,458
- WOW, I FEEL LIKE
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

253
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,791
- DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF, KAZUMI.

254
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,833
- I THINK WE SHOULD SPLIT UP
AND LOOK FOR HER.

255
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,041
- YEAH, ME TOO.

256
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,375
- MAYBE THAT'S
WHERE SHE IS.

257
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,708
- KONOE!

258
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,750
- ( cat screeches )

259
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,750
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

260
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,083
- ( chirping )

261
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,666
- DID YOU SAVE IT
FROM THAT STRAY CAT?

262
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
- LOOK, AND HE'S
FINE NOW.

263
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,250
- STILL CAN'T GET OVER
HOW MUCH SHE LOOKS LIKE HER.

264
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,291
- ARE YOU--?

265
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,916
- I SHOULD PROBABLY
PUREE THE CARROTS NEXT.

266
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,041
WHY AM I FEELING
SO JEALOUS OF HER?

267
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,750
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING,
NOT ONE BIT.

268
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,625
- I WONDER
WHERE SHANA IS.

269
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,250
- I'M SORRY, THE MISTRESS
IS NOT COMING TONIGHT.

270
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,958
I AM YOUR
SPARRING PARTNER

271
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,333
UNTIL MILADY SEES FIT
TO CONTINUE YOUR TRAINING.

272
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,083
- ( Fumina giggles )

273
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,708
- FROM WHAT
I COULD TELL,

274
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,916
THE BIRDS REALLY LIKED
THEIR NEW HOUSE.

275
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,250
- HOW COME SHANA ISN'T
WALKING WITH US?

276
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,875
- UH, IT'S A LONG STORY.

277
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,291
- Yuji:
SHANA DIDN'T SHOW UP

278
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,416
FOR MORNING TRAINING EITHER.
GUESS SHE'S STILL ANGRY WITH ME.

279
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,125
JUST WISH
I KNEW WHY.

280
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,041
- OH.

281
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,291
GOOD MORNING, YOSHIDA.

282
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,083
- ARE YOU HAVING
A GOOD DAY TODAY?

283
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,375
- I AM,
THANK YOU, KONOE.

284
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,208
- 'MORNING.

285
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,166
- SHANA?

286
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,833
AWKWARD.

287
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,125
- ( clock chiming )

288
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,500
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

289
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,375
- YOSHIDA HAD TO GO TO
A LIBRARY COMMITTEE MEETING.

290
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,583
- SHANA.

291
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,000
- AGAIN WITH
THE RICE BALLS.

292
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,250
- Yuji: I WONDER WHAT'S REALLY
BOTHERING SHANA.

293
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:15,333
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

294
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,791
- Yuji:
SHANA'S EMOTIONS ARE IN TURMOIL,

295
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,625
AND IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF KONOE.

296
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,500
WILHELMINA IS
COMPLETELY CONFUSED,

297
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,750
AND IT'S PUTTING A STRAIN
ON THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

298
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,875
ALL IT TOOK
WAS ONE LITTLE TIFF,

299
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,416
AND NOW SHE'S
ON SHANA'S BAD SIDE.

300
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,875
UNABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT
ON HER OWN,

301
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:45,583
WILHELMINA LOOKS TO MY MOM,
CHIGUSA, FOR HELP.

302
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,208
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II,"

303
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,166
"THE FAMILY DINNER TABLE."
