1
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,500
- Alastor:
YUJI REVEALED THE SECRET

2
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:56,041
OF THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE
SABRAC'S SEEMING
INVINCIBILITY-- 

3
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,125
HE HAD SPREAD HIS POWER
THROUGHOUT MISAKI CITY.

4
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:03,125
SHANA, MARGERY, AND WILHELMINA
CARRIED OUT YUJI'S PLAN.

5
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:06,291
AND THE VILLAINOUS SABRAC
WAS FINALLY DEFEATED.

6
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,791
- ( theme music playing )


7
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,416
- GOOD WORK OUT THERE,
SABRAC.

8
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,583
- YOU DID NOT EXAGGERATE.

9
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,166
THEY ARE INDEED
A POWERFUL GROUP.

10
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,291
IN MY ATTEMPT TO GET MY HANDS
ON THE MYSTES,

11
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:57,416
I HAD HOPED TO EXTERMINATE
THE THREE FLAME HAZE.

12
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,666
AH, BUT PLANS RARELY WORK OUT
THE WAY WE'D LIKE.

13
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,166
- IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

14
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,750
YOU ACCOMPLISHED
WHAT WE NEEDED FROM YOU.

15
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,041
THE REST IS UP TO US.

16
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,458
- MMM. IF MY SERVICES
ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED,

17
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,833
THEN I SEE NO REASON TO LINGER.

18
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:17,166
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
I SHALL TAKE MY LEAVE.

19
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,958
- Bel-Peol:
NOW LET THE FUN BEGIN.

20
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,500
- HERE GOES.

21
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,333
( sighs )

22
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:11,250
- Marcosias ( laughing ):
THAT WAS SURE A HEAVY SIGH,
KIDDO.

23
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:15,500
- WHAT'S GOT YOU RILED UP
THIS MORNING?

24
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,666
- I'VE DECIDED--

25
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,541
I WANT TO WORK FOR OUTLAW.

26
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,458
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
I'LL USE ANY ADVANTAGE I HAVE.

27
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:28,583
EVEN IF IT MEANS
ASKING THINGS OF PEOPLE

28
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,666
I DON'T WANT TO DEPEND ON.

29
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,666
- Marcosias:
HE HATES HIS FATHER,

30
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,958
AND HE'S REACHING OUT
TO HIM FOR HELP?

31
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,666
IF HE'S WILLING TO DO THAT,
HE MUST BE SERIOUS.

32
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,791
I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN STOP HIM, MARGERY.

33
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,041
- SO MUCH FOR TRYING
TO SCARE HIM

34
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,166
INTO CHANGING HIS MIND.

35
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,416
- Marcosias: HMM, YEAH,
A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD THAT DID.

36
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,291
IF ANYTHING, YOU JUST
STRENGTHENED HIS RESOLVE.

37
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,416
- Sato:
I DON'T WANT TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT I WOULD DO

38
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,875
IF YOU WERE TO DIE.

39
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,750
- HE REALLY IS AN IDIOT.

40
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,958
- EVERYONE SEEMS
TO HAVE CHANGED.

41
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,583
SATO AND TANAKA BARELY TALK
TO EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

42
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,458
SHANA AND YOSHIDA
ARE CHATTING LIKE BEST FRIENDS.

43
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,500
AND SAKAI--

44
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,416
I DON'T KNOW. HE DOESN'T
LOOK ANY DIFFERENT,

45
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,416
BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE
CHANGED THE MOST.

46
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,166
WHAT ABOUT ME?

47
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,916
- IKE!
THE PREZ WANTS TO SEE US.

48
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,708
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.

49
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,125
JUST A QUICK MEETING
BEFORE SCHOOL LETS OUT.

50
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,250
- OKAY.

51
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,333
GUESS I NEED A CHANGE TOO--
A BIG ONE.

52
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,333
- Boy: SEE YOU NEXT YEAR!

53
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,500
- Girl: ARE YOU GOING
TO THE NEW YEAR'S PARTY?

54
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,083
- THIS SEMESTER FLEW BY.

55
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,916
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY?

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,875
- I'M GOING
TO SHOW MY REPORT CARD
TO YOUR MOTHER

57
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,583
AND THEN I'M GOING
TO MEET UP WITH KAZUMI.

58
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,250
YOU'RE HANGING OUT?

59
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,208
- FOR A BIT, I GUESS.

60
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,625
- COOL.

61
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,541
- YO.

62
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,958
- DAD.

63
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,458
- ARE YOU SURE IT'S OKAY
FOR SHANA TO WALK HOME ALONE?

64
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,750
- YEAH, SHE'S HEADING
OVER TO VISIT MOM.

65
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:52,250
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING?

66
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,500
- I DO.

67
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,458
THE RIVER LOOKS SO PEACEFUL
IN THE WINTER.

68
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,541
I'VE TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD,

69
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,166
BUT THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE MISAKI CITY.

70
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,083
IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE HOME.

71
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,875
- Yuji: I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

72
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:16,708
CAN YOU STAY A WHILE
THIS TIME?

73
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,833
FOR NEW YEAR'S, AT LEAST?

74
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,083
- I REALLY WISH I COULD.

75
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,083
THIS WAS JUST A QUICK TRIP
'CAUSE OF AN URGENT CALL I GOT.

76
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,375
I HEAD BACK TOMORROW.
SUCKS.

77
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,416
- URGENT CALL?
FROM MOM?

78
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,458
- YEAH.

79
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:35,333
I MADE HER PROMISE TO CALL ME
WHENEVER SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

80
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,416
- WHAT-- IS SHE OKAY?

81
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,291
- I DON'T KNOW.

82
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,750
SHE KEEPS TELLING ME
THERE'S NO REASON TO WORRY,

83
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,875
BUT YOUR MOM'S
ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF CLUELESS

84
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,666
WHEN IT COMES TO HER HEALTH.

85
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,958
- HOLD ON, DAD.

86
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,500
WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE
IS SHE IN EXACTLY?

87
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,791
- DON'T GET ALL WORKED UP,
YUJI.

88
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,791
SHE JUST DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

89
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,041
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
- THAT'S FINE.

90
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,208
BUT I FEEL BAD.

91
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,500
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MOM WAS SO UPSET

92
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:15,333
SHE THOUGHT HAD TO CALL YOU.
I NEVER EVEN REALIZED THAT--

93
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,375
- HMM.  IT'S OKAY.

94
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,125
NOT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT,

95
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,333
BUT DO YOU THINK YOU COULD 
HELP ME OUT WITH SOMETHING?

96
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,166
- I GUESS.

97
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,250
- WELL, I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO COME UP

98
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:34,041
WITH A GOOD NAME
FOR YOUR NEW SIBLING.  CAN YOU?

99
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,458
- I'VE NEVER BEEN
VERY GOOD COMING UP WI--

100
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,083
HUH?!

101
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,500
UH, DID YOU JUST SAY,

102
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,541
"NEW SIBLING"?
- YEAH, I DID.

103
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,458
MOM'S PREGNANT.
- OH.

104
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,625
AWESOME.

105
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,458
CONGRATULATIONS.
WAIT A SEC.

106
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,000
THIS IS A GOOD THING,
ISN'T IT?

107
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,458
- IT IS.

108
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,125
CONGRATS TO YOU TOO,

109
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,583
BIG BROTHER.

110
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,250
- BROTHER.

111
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,875
HUH.

112
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,083
WHY WAS MOM SO WORRIED
ABOUT TELLING ME THAT?

113
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,083
- BECAUSE THERE'S A SECRET

114
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,916
THAT WE'VE BEEN
KEEPING FROM YOU.
- SECRET?

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,916
- WE DIDN'T THINK
WE'D EVER GET PREGNANT AGAIN.

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,458
OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
A LONG TIME AGO.

117
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,625
YOUR MOM WAS TOO NERVOUS
TO TELL YOU HERSELF.

118
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:33,416
SO I CAME BACK
TO LEND HER HAND.

119
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,875
AND HERE WE ARE.

120
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,916
- TELL ME.

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,041
I THINK I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO HANDLE IT.

122
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,375
- HMM.

123
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,125
THE REASON
WE GOT MARRIED SO YOUNG

124
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,833
IS BECAUSE YOUR MOM
GOT PREGNANT.

125
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,333
- WITH ME, RIGHT?

126
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,458
- THERE WERE COMPLICATIONS
DURING DELIVERY.

127
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:05,000
WHEN WE LOST THE BABY,
DOCTORS TOLD US

128
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,208
THAT WE'D NEVER
HAVE ANOTHER CHILD.

129
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,208
- BUT...
- THEY WERE WRONG.

130
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,166
IT TURNED OUT
TO BE A FALSE DIAGNOSIS.

131
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,875
IT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE,

132
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,583
BUT WE FINALLY
HAD A HEALTHY BABY BOY.

133
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,625
BASICALLY,
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS...

134
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,166
YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH TWO SONS.

135
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,000
- TWO?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

136
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,958
ONE SON WHO'S STANDING HERE
WITH ME NOW,

137
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,166
AND ANOTHER ONE
WHO DIDN'T SURVIVE--

138
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,875
YOUR BIG BROTHER.

139
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,500
WHEN WE WERE
CHOOSING A NAME FOR YOU,

140
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,916
WE WANTED TO FIND SOMETHING
THAT WOULD PAY HOMAGE

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,250
TO YOUR OLDER BROTHER
WHO HAD PASSED AWAY. 

142
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,541
BUT IT ALSO HAD TO CONVEY
YOUR STRENGTH

143
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,708
AS THE SON WHO SURVIVED.

144
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,708
IF YOU ASK ME,
WE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

145
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,666
THE NAME YUJI
MEANS COURAGEOUS SECOND SON.

146
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,416
IF I CAN FIND A NAME

147
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
THAT RELATES
TO THE NUMBER THREE,

148
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,416
I'D LIKE TO KEEP UP
THE TRADITION WITH THIS BABY.

149
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,291
MAY I?

150
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,625
- THANK YOU FOR SHARING
ALL THAT WITH ME, DAD. 

151
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,375
- WELCOME HOME, GUYS.

152
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,583
- Yuji: I'VE GOT DAD AND MOM

153
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,166
AND NOW A NEW SIBLING
ON THE WAY.

154
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,375
NOW MORE THAN EVER
IT'S CLEAR TO ME, 

155
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,916
I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,291
IT'S MY DUTY
TO PROTECT THIS CITY

157
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,500
AND THE PEOPLE I LOVE.

158
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,333
- ( doorbell ringing )

159
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,250
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

160
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,041
- I COULD REALLY
USE SOME ADVICE.

161
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,708
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

162
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,875
- YOU REALIZE YOU'RE EARLY.

163
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,666
- YEAH, BUT YOU'VE
OBVIOUSLY BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE.

164
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,208
SOMETHING WRONG?

165
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,875
- CAN YOU, UH, TELL ME 
WHERE BABIES COME FROM?

166
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,791
- WHY'RE YOU ASKING ME?

167
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,666
- OH, GREAT.
THAT SAME LOOK AGAIN.

168
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,000
WHY DOES EVERYONE
HAVE THAT FACE

169
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,541
WHEN I ASK 'EM THIS?

170
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,708
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

171
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,666
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU GO ABOUT MAKING A BABY.

172
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,000
- I THINK
WE'LL NEED PERMISSION

173
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,500
FROM YOUR GUARDIANS
TO TELL YOU THAT.

174
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,041
RIGHT, DEAR?
- YES.

175
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,500
I'LL GIVE ALASTOR
AND WILHELMINA A CALL.

176
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:56,416
I THINK THAT'D
BE FOR THE BEST.
- HMM?

177
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,166
I ASKED ALASTOR.

178
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,541
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?

179
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,500
- Alastor:
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.

180
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,958
- CHIGUSA SAID SHE'D TALK TO ME
ABOUT IT LATER.

181
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,541
BUT I DON'T WANT TO WAIT.
I WANT TO KNOW NOW.

182
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,958
- SO I'M ASKING YOU
'CAUSE I FIGURED YOU'D TELL ME.

183
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,541
PLEASE, I REALLY WANT TO KNOW.

184
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,625
- UH, THING IS...

185
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,500
HAVING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

186
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,458
IS MORE EMBARRASSING
THAN BEING NAKED IN PUBLIC.

187
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,875
- NAKED IN PUBLIC?

188
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,250
- YEAH SO, UM...
- MMM.

189
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,875
- HOW COOL.

190
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,791
SAKAI'S GONNA BE
A BIG BROTHER.

191
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,833
- YEAH, HE'S EXCITED.

192
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,875
GOT TO SAY,
HE'S DEFINITELY COME A LONG WAY.

193
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,041
HE'S GOTTEN SO MUCH STRONGER,

194
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,333
AND NOT JUST IN TRAINING,
BUT OVERALL AS A PERSON. 

195
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,208
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

196
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,791
YUJI AND I ARE NOT
GONNA BE LEAVING THE CITY.

197
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,541
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE
WITH HIS TRAINING.

198
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE HE GOES,
HE'LL BE TARGETED

199
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,958
BECAUSE
OF THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

200
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,291
- DOES SAKAI
KNOW HOW YOU FEEL?

201
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,916
- NO.

202
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,208
BUT I WILL TELL HIM
AND WE'LL SETTLE THIS.

203
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:31,041
TOMORROW IS DECEMBER THE 24th.
- IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

204
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,416
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN IN MIND?

205
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,458
- IF WE BOTH CONFRONT HIM
AT THE SAME TIME,

206
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,333
THEN IT'S JUST
GOING TO OVERWHELM HIM.

207
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,500
THAT'S WHY I SUGGEST
WE ASK HIM

208
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,208
TO MEET US
IN DIFFERENT PLACES.

209
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,666
AND WHOEVER YUJI
CHOOSES TO MEET 

210
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,541
IS THE WINNER OF HIS HEART.

211
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,458
- BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA
EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS TO HIM?

212
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,416
- TO AVOID INFLUENCING HIM,

213
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,833
SO HE CAN
MAKE AN HONEST CHOICE,

214
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,041
I THINK IT'S BEST
IF WE BOTH WRITE HIM LETTERS.

215
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,000
- YOU MEAN
LIKE LOVE LETTERS?

216
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,875
- IN FACT,
WE CAN WRITE THEM NOW.

217
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,583
I BROUGHT WRITING MATERIALS.

218
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,083
- UM, YEAH.

219
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,916
- WE CAN'T USE THAT PAPER.

220
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,791
WE NEED PRETTY STATIONERY

221
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,250
AND I KNOW THE PERFECT PLACE
TO GET IT.

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,833
Kazumi: "DEAR SAKAI,

223
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,708
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME
TO READ THIS LETTER."

224
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:27,750
- Shana:
"YUJI, YOUR INSTRUCTIONS
ARE WRITTEN BELOW.

225
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,708
PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY."

226
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,833
- Kazumi: "SHANA AND I
HAVE DECIDED

227
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,416
THAT IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO MAKE A CHOICE."

228
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,791
- Shana:
"TOMORROW, DECEMBER THE 24th,
AT PRECISELY 1900 HOURS,

229
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,333
COME TO THE ILLUMINATION FIESTA
BEING HELD AT THE CLOCK TOWER."

230
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,375
- Kazumi:
"WHEN YOU'VE MADE YOUR CHOICE,

231
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,166
PLEASE MEET ONE OF US THERE.

232
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,958
WE WANT TO SHARE OUR FEELINGS
WITH YOU."

233
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,125
- Shana: "I'LL BE WAITING
AT THE NORTH EXIT."

234
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,041
- Kazumi: "I'LL BE WAITING
AT THE SOUTH EXIT.

235
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,041
KAZUMI YOSHIDA."

236
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,583
- "SHANA."

237
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,791
- ( letters sliding )
- WHAT THE--

238
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,208
- I'M KIND OF SURPRISED

239
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,666
THAT SATO DIDN'T LAUGH
OR MAKE FUN OF ME.

240
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,500
BUT--

241
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,125
- IF YOU LIKE YOSHIDA,

242
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,958
I THINK
YOU SHOULD JUST TELL HER.

243
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,500
WHO CARES WHAT SAKAI
OR ANYBODY ELSE THINKS?

244
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:34,666
- I DON'T HAVE THE GUTS
TO FOLLOW HIS ADVICE.

245
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,916
I WISH I COULD JUST TELL HER
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

246
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,416
BUT I KNOW HOW
SHE REALLY FEELS
ABOUT SAKAI.

247
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,083
AND I CAN'T HELP
BUT TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

248
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,375
SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.

249
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,708
I NEED TO BE LIKE THE OTHERS.

250
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,708
- HEY, IKE,
DOING SOME SHOPPING?

251
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,625
- Ike: I--
I NEED TO CHANGE TOO.

252
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,500
COULD I HAVE A MOMENT 
OF YOUR TIME TOMORROW?

253
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,500
- SURE.
I'M FREE IN THE AFTERNOON,

254
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,250
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT
TO DO THAT NIGHT.

255
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,708
I'M KIND OF GETTING NERVOUS.

256
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:29,500
SHANA AND I DECIDED TO WAIT
FOR SAKAI IN DIFFERENT PLACES

257
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,458
AND HAVE HIM
CHOOSE BETWEEN US.

258
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,000
- OKAY, TOMORROW AFTERNOON
SHOULD BE PERFECT THEN.

259
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,125
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

260
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,458
- Kazumi: I HAD NO IDEA.

261
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:48,000
ALL THIS TIME
I THOUGHT IKE WAS TRYING 
TO PUSH ME TOWARDS SAKAI.

262
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,333
WHY'D HE HAVE TO TELL ME
THIS THE NIGHT

263
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,375
BEFORE MY HEART
IS PUT TO THE TEST?

264
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,416
IF I'M NOT CHOSEN TOMORROW,

265
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,958
WILL I STILL BE ABLE
TO USE THIS

266
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,583
FOR SAKAI AND SHANA'S SAKE?

267
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,333
- SO TODAY I'M--

268
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,500
I'M GONNA TELL YUJI
I LOVE HIM.

269
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,583
- THAT WOULD BE 
A POOR DECISION.

270
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,708
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY?

271
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,291
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

272
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,500
WILL YOU BE ABLE
TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE SOMEONE

273
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,125
WHO DOESN'T SHARE
YOUR FEELINGS?

274
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,458
EVEN IF HE WERE TO CONFESS
HIS LOVE TO YOU,

275
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,208
HE INDEED STILL CARES
FOR MISS YOSHIDA

276
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,875
AND THINKS OF HER FONDLY.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

277
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,416
YOU DON'T KNOW THEM
AS WELL AS I DO.

278
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,166
- THIS IDIOTIC ATTEMPT 
AT A FAIRY-TALE ROMANCE

279
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,500
COULD RUIN YOUR FRIENDSHIP.
- IT IS NOT IDIOTIC.

280
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,958
- YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME
ANY REASON TO THINK OTHERWISE.

281
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,958
- NOTHING YOU SAY
IS GOING TO STOP ME!

282
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,291
- STOP ACTING
LIKE A PETULANT CHILD

283
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,166
AND CONSIDER
WHAT'S AT RISK HERE.

284
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,916
- QUIT STICKING YOUR NOSE
IN MY BUSINESS!

285
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,625
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU! 

286
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,583
- YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN NOW,
MILADY,

287
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,750
AND THINK
ABOUT THIS RATIONALLY.

288
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,583
- I'LL CALM DOWN
SOON AS YOU STOP TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE!

289
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,375
- I'M YOUR GUARDIAN--
- I DON'T CARE!

290
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,875
- Tiamat:
ENOUGH, BOTH OF YOU.

291
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,750
- I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

292
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,125
- Tiamat:
YOU FELT THE SAME ONCE.

293
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,000
- INDEED, TIAMAT.

294
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,083
WHICH IS WHY
I WANT TO PROTECT HER.

295
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,625
I KNOW THE AGONY
OF UNREQUITED LOVE.

296
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,750
I THOUGHT THE FLAME OF HEAVEN

297
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,791
WOULD SPEAK UP IN MY FAVOR.

298
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,583
BUT HE DID NOT
BECAUSE I WAS AT FAULT.

299
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,833
- ( knock at door )

300
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,458
- WHAT?

301
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,458
- Wilhelmina: WHAT TIME
WILL YOU BE LEAVING?

302
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,083
- WELL, I NEED TO BE THERE
BY 7:00.

303
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,250
- HAVE YOU DECIDED
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR?

304
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,041
- UH, NO.

305
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,208
- IF YOU'RE GOING
TO CONFESS YOUR LOVE TO HIM,

306
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,708
YOU MUST INDEED
LOOK YOUR BEST, MILADY.
- YEAH.

307
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,208
- IF YOU CAN TELL ME
WHAT COLOR AND STYLE

308
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,458
YOU WOULD PREFER TO WEAR
THIS EVENING.

309
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,416
I'M HAPPY
