1
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,666
- Alastor: 
DESPITE MARGERY'S BEST EFFORTS

2
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,625
TO RESTORE THE DAMAGE
SHE CAUSED,

3
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,583
TANAKA IS TORTURED
BY THE MEMORY

4
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,583
OF OGATA'S LIFELESS BODY.

5
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,833
UNWILLING
TO FACE MARGERY AGAIN,

6
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,166
TANAKA BIDS FAREWELL
TO HIS FRIEND SATO.

7
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,750
ALTHOUGH THEY'D ONCE CHOSEN
TO FOLLOW THE SAME PATH,

8
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,583
THE BOYS
GO THEIR SEPARATE WAYS.

9
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,208
- ( theme music playing )


10
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

11
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,625
- ( static over radio )

12
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,208
- Zarovee: WHAT WAS THAT?

13
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,375
THIS CONNECTION'S BAD.
I CAN'T HEAR A THING
YOU'RE SAYING.

14
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,958
YES, I UNDERSTAND YOU FEEL

15
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,083
THAT THIS RECONNAISSANCE MISSION
IS SOMEHOW BELOW YOU.

16
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,875
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO SUCK IT UP

17
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,791
AND QUIT DRAGGING YOUR FEET
LIKE THIS.

18
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:04,625
OTHERWISE OUR PLAN
WILL INEVITABLY FAIL.

19
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,375
- ( static )

20
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:12,333
- COME ON, YOU DON'T WANT
TO BREAK LADY BEL PEOL'S TRUST
IN US, NOW DO YOU?

21
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,291
LIKE IT OR NOT,
WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER

22
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,500
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN,
BIFRONS.

23
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,291
- ( static ) 
- UGH, JEEZ,
SIGNAL SUCKS OUT HERE.

24
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,541
- Bifrons: IT IS NOT THE SIGNAL
GIVING YOU TROUBLE.

25
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,416
I HUNG UP UPON MY ARRIVAL.

26
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,625
COLLATION FLUX ZAROVEE.

27
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,083
- AWFULLY RUDE OF YOU.
HOWLING FANG BIFRONS.

28
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:37,375
- RUDE?  I AM HERE
AT THE PRESCRIBED TIME,
AS ALWAYS.

29
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,750
A LOWLY JAEGER
SUCH AS YOURSELF

30
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,500
CANNOT FATHOM THE GREATNESS
OF MY PRESENCE.

31
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:46,250
MY TREASURE TOOL, TARNKAPPE,
GRANTS ME STEALTH,

32
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,416
BUT ONLY WITH CONSTANT EXPENSE
OF ENERGY.

33
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,041
- YES, I REALIZE IT TAKES YOU
LONGER TO--

34
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,875
- RARELY DO I FIND REASON
TO RUSH.

35
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,666
- I'M NOT RUSHING ANYTHING.

36
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,333
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO WASTE TIME.

37
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,916
WE MUST DESTROY THE MYSTES
AND RETRIEVE THE TREASURE TOOL

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,541
TO BE ATTACHED
TO THE TAIMEI SHIHEN.

39
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,625
BEYOND THAT, WE MUST DISPOSE
OF ANYONE

40
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,750
WHO ATTEMPTS
TO GET IN OUR WAY.

41
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,166
NOT A MISSION
TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

42
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,458
- ( chuckling )
YOU NEED NOT WORRY.

43
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,083
I AM CAPABLE
OF SHOWING RESTRAINT.

44
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,916
I WON'T MASSACRE EVERYONE.
- WHY WOULD I WORRY?

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,041
( thinking )
AND THEY WONDER WHY I HATE
WORKING WITH WANDERERS.

46
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,000
- SHALL WE?
- YES, LET'S GET STARTED.

47
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,750
- NOW I WANT YOU TO TRY
WHAT I JUST TAUGHT YOU.

48
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,583
FIRST, YOU'LL NEED TO FOCUS
ON YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE.

49
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,583
HERE COMES THE HARD PART.

50
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,000
YOU NEED TO DELVE
DEEP WITHIN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS

51
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,291
AND TAKE CONTROL OF ITS FLOW.

52
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,791
- BE CAREFUL.

53
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,250
- Yuji: YOU THINK
I COULD BE A SPELL CASTER?
 - Wilhelmina: INDEED.

54
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:09,125
- WOULD I BE ABLE
TO CAST UNRESTRICTED SPELLS
LIKE MARGERY?

55
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,916
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
HAVE ENOUGH POWER OF EXISTENCE.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,833
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF TRAINING.

57
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,875
IT COULDN'T HURT
TO LEARN ANOTHER WAY
TO PROTECT YOURSELF,

58
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,291
ESPECIALLY IN YOUR SITUATION.

59
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,416
YOU'LL LEARN TO ATTACK
WITH YOUR FLAME.

60
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,958
- I COULD BARELY CAST A SEAL.
YOU SURE I CAN DO THIS?

61
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,666
- Alastor: POSITIVE.

62
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,333
YOU SIMPLY NEED THE TUTELAGE
OF A SKILLED SPELL CASTER.

63
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,416
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE DRAWING
UPON YOUR OWN POWER
OF EXISTENCE,

64
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,000
YOU WILL NEED TO LEARN
TO GAUGE THAT POWER,

65
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,791
OR YOU WILL SUFFER
DIRE CONSEQUENCES.

66
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,875
- YOU THINK THE CHANTER
OF ELEGIES WOULD TEACH HIM?

67
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,666
- I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO HARM
IN ASKING HER.

68
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,625
- WOULD YOU MIND TALKING TO HER,
WILHELMINA?

69
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,541
IF I CAN LEARN SPELL CASTING,
IT COULD SAVE MY LIFE.

70
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,916
- YES, BUT--
- PLEASE ASK HER.

71
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,041
WHAT IF YOU REMIND HER

72
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,625
I'M GOING TO BE
USING THE SILVER'S FLAME?

73
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,875
THIS IS HER CHANCE
TO WITNESS ITS POWER FIRSTHAND.

74
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,375
- Margery: OKAY.
THE NEXT THING YOU NEED
TO DO

75
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,750
IS COLLECT A SMALL AMOUNT
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE

76
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,541
IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.

77
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,625
WHOA, KID!
CAREFUL.

78
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,750
YOU DON'T WANT TO USE TOO MUCH
OR YOU'LL ZAP YOURSELF.

79
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,416
YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL FRACTION
OF WHAT YOU JUST COLLECTED.

80
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,208
GOOD.

81
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,625
NOW IMAGINE A FLAME
COMING FROM THAT POWER.

82
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,166
- Marcosias:
I GOT MY EYE ON YOU, PARTNER.

83
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,416
YOU'RE HERE TO TEACH THE KID.
DON'T DO ANYTHING SKETCHY.

84
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,625
- YOU REALLY THINK I'D RUIN
AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS?

85
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,916
I'M ONE STEP CLOSER
TO FINDING THE SILVER.

86
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,125
- YUJI, I WANT YOU
TO THROW YOUR FLAME

87
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,708
AND HIT THAT TARGET!
- WHAT?

88
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,000
BUT HOW DO I--
- DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,
JUST DO IT!

89
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,500
HURRY.
- UH, RIGHT.

90
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,375
THROW THE FLAME
AND HIT THE TARGET.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,041
- I GOT IT!

92
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,750
- YUJI!
- THERE'S NO NEED TO OVERREACT.

93
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,166
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BURN,
MILADY.

94
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,958
- ( grunts )

95
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,000
- WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU GOT ZAPPED?

96
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,291
IT'S BECAUSE YOU STILL
HAD POWER IN YOUR HAND.

97
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,666
YOU'VE GOTTA USE ALL OF IT
IN YOUR ATTACK.
- RIGHT.

98
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,375
- KEEP PRACTICING
TILL YOU CAN HIT
ALL THE TARGETS

99
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,041
IN UNDER FIVE SECONDS.

100
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,541
- I'VE NOTICED THAT YUJI
SEEMS TO BE TAKING HIS TRAINING
MORE SERIOUSLY LATELY.

101
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,291
- A WELCOME CHANGE INDEED.
- Tiamat: HE'S IMPROVING.

102
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,916
- ( Marcosias laughs )
I GOTTA SAY,

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THE KID DESERVES
A PAT ON THE BACK

104
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,708
FOR BEING ABLE TO KEEP UP
WITH MARGERY HERE.

105
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,916
- Alastor:
IT APPEARS HE'S COME TO GRIPS
WITH HIS SITUATION

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
AND IS DETERMINED
TO PERSEVERE.

107
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,000
- Margery: I'M NOT SO SURE.

108
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,041
- ( grunts )

109
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,083
- MAYBE IT'S JUST ME,

110
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,041
BUT I'D SAY HE'S TRAINING
AS IF HE'S POSSESSED.

111
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,833
- I DID IT.

112
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,958
DID YOU SEE THAT?
I HIT 'EM ALL.

113
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,791
- HMM.  NOT TOO SHABBY
FOR YOUR FIRST DAY.

114
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,250
- WHAT'S NEXT?
LET'S KEEP GOING.

115
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,583
I NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TAKE DOWN
A BIGGER TARGET.

116
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,791
CAN YOU TEACH ME?

117
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,166
- YUJI.
- JUST IN CASE

118
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,666
I COME FACE TO FACE
WITH ANOTHER DENIZEN.

119
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,083
- DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF,
BOY.

120
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,750
- ( laughing )
I'D LISTEN TO THE LADY
IF I WERE YOU.

121
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,125
DIDN'T ANYONE EVER TELL YOU
THAT PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE?

122
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,708
- RUSHING THROUGH YOUR TRAINING
WOULD BE MOST COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

123
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,291
- Tiamat:
SO TAKE YOUR TIME.

124
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,458
- OKAY.

125
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,125
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT,

126
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,416
YOU WANTED
TO CARRY BLUTSAUGER.

127
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,666
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS CREATE A MARKER FOR IT
IN YOUR MIND.

128
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,416
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CALL IT FORTH
WHENEVER YOU NEED IT.

129
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,833
- THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.
- WHATEVER.

130
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,041
NOW YUJI,
ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND--

131
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,125
YOU WON'T FIND YOUR RESOLVE
IN YOUR HEAD.

132
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,958
YOU HAVE TO FEEL IT
IN YOUR HEART.

133
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,958
- REALLY?

134
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,416
'CAUSE I DON'T SEE
WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES,

135
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,208
LONG AS I'VE FOUND IT.

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,375
- HMM.  I'M CANCELING
TOMORROW'S TRAINING.

137
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,291
YOU NEED SOME TIME
TO COOL OFF.

138
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,416
- HEY, YUJI, DO YOU WANT
TO COME OVER FOR A BIT?

139
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,750
- BUT YOUR HOUSE IS BACK
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

140
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,750
IT'LL BE MORE THAN "A BIT."
- NEVER MIND.

141
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:03,166
I'LL JUST GO
AND BUY SOME MELON BREAD.

142
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,458
YUJI, IS SOMETHING WRONG?
- UM...

143
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,250
- YOU SEEMED DIFFERENT
AT TRAINING.

144
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,166
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

145
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,166
- NO, I'M FINE.

146
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,833
I KNOW THIS
MIGHT SOUND WEIRD,

147
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:23,416
BUT I'M FINALLY REALIZING
WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

148
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:29,541
I KNOW I'M BOTH A TORCH
AND A MYSTES.

149
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,958
BUT THIS MESS
WITH THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

150
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,166
AND WHATEVER'S INSIDE OF IT
GOT ME THINKING.

151
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,000
I CAN'T CONTINUE
TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE

152
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,333
IN THIS CITY AS YUJI SAKAI.

153
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,750
I DON'T BELONG HERE.

154
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,833
I'M A PART OF THE WORLD
OF THE FLAME HAZE NOW.

155
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,583
AND I'M READY TO MOVE ON
FROM THIS PLACE WITH YOU.

156
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,375
BUT TO DO THAT,

157
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,708
I NEED TO BECOME STRONGER.

158
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,500
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOURSELF.

159
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,000
- YEAH.

160
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,500
- WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

161
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,083
- YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.

162
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:20,000
- ( echoing )
I'M READY TO MOVE ON
FROM THIS PLACE WITH YOU.

163
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,791
- MOVE ON WITH ME?

164
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,416
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

165
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,916
I SHOULD BE HAPPY RIGHT NOW,
BUT I'M NOT.

166
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,958
- I'M HOME.

167
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,416
YOU ALL RIGHT?

168
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,166
- YUJI, YOU'RE HOME.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

169
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,625
I MUST'VE DOZED OFF.
- THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

170
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,791
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE
COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING?

171
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,166
- I'M FINE.  OH!

172
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,666
I MADE SOME
ROASTED SWEET POTATOES FOR--

173
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,000
- MOM!

174
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,541
- I'M OKAY.

175
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,125
- MOM!

176
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,375
- THAT'S ODD.
SAKAI'S NEVER LATE.

177
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,291
OH, GOOD MORNING, SHANA.

178
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,875
YOU DIDN'T WALK TO SCHOOL
WITH SAKAI TODAY?

179
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,291
- NO,
WE DECIDED TO SKIP TRAINING.

180
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,333
- ANY IDEA WHY HE'S NOT HERE?

181
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,708
- HEY.

182
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,333
JEEZ.
I WISH HE COULD LET IT GO.

183
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,791
- MORNIN'!

184
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,916
SO I NEED TO DO
A LITTLE SHOPPING TOMORROW.

185
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,458
DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'D WANT TO COME?
- UH...

186
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,500
- UNLESS YOU HAVE PLANS.
- I'M FREE.

187
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,916
- THEN SAY YOU'LL GO.
PRETTY PLEASE?

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,583
I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR OPINION
ON STUFF.

189
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,500
THAT COOL?
- YEAH.

190
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,500
- AND SAKAI'S OUT TODAY.

191
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,458
APPARENTLY, HIS MOTHER
IS FEELING UNDER THE WEATHER.

192
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,166
HE SAID
IT WASN'T ANYTHING SERIOUS,

193
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,291
BUT SINCE HIS FATHER
IS AWAY ON BUSINESS.

194
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,541
HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST
TO STAY HOME AND LOOK AFTER HER.

195
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,500
- CHIGUSA'S SICK?

196
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,875
- GOSH,
I HOPE SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

197
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,625
- CHIGUSA.

198
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,500
- I FEEL BAD FOR SAKAI'S MOM.
- YEAH, ME TOO.

199
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:45,416
- ARE YOU GONNA GO VISIT HER?
- I MIGHT.

200
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,375
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT COOKING THEM DINNER
AND TAKING IT OVER THERE.

201
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,791
BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO THINK THAT I'M USING IT

202
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,875
AS A CHANCE TO GET CLOSER
TO SAKAI.

203
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,000
- WHAT?  NOBODY WOULD
EVER THINK THAT OF YOU.

204
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,458
- I DON'T WANT TO BE A BOTHER.
 - IF YOU ASK ME,

205
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,416
YOU'RE PUTTING
WAY TOO MUCH THOUGHT INTO THIS.

206
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,416
IF YOU WANT TO HELP SAKAI
AND HIS MOM, JUST DO IT ALREADY.

207
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,958
YOU SHOULDN'T CARE
WHAT ANYBODY ELSE THINKS.

208
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,708
- YOU THINK I SHOULD?

209
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,750
- YEAH, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

210
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,250
- YOU'RE RIGHT.  THANKS.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

211
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,541
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
JUST WHAT TO SAY.

212
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,750
BETTER GET STARTED
BEFORE IT GETS TOO LATE.
SEE YA!

213
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:29,791
- AW, MAN, I KEEP
THROWING HER INTO HIS ARMS.

214
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,791
- IKE'S RIGHT.

215
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,250
IF I WANT TO HELP SAKAI,
THEN I SHOULD.

216
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,000
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING ME.

217
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:47,375
I GUESS THE SAME GOES
FOR USING THIS.

218
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,666
I THOUGHT
JUST HAVING A TREASURE TOOL

219
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,000
WOULD MAKE ME A PART
OF SAKAI'S WORLD.

220
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,250
BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE.

221
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,250
IT DOESN'T CHANGE A THING.

222
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,500
BUT ONCE I USE IT,

223
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,625
I WILL BE
A PART OF HIS WORLD,

224
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,208
EVEN IF ONLY
FOR A BRIEF MOMENT.

225
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,666
I WAS WORRIED
I'D NEVER HAVE THE COURAGE
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

226
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,708
BUT IF I WANT TO SAVE SAKAI,
I HAVE TO.

227
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,208
NOTHING'S STOPPING ME.

228
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,666
- Yuji: I'VE GOT RICE AND SALT.

229
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,333
WHAT ELSE IS SUPPOSED
TO GO INTO PORRIDGE?

230
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,375
- YUJI!
HEY, WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

231
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,750
- SHE'S IN HER ROOM SLEEPING.

232
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,583
- ( grunting )

233
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,500
( knocking )

234
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,500
- SHANA, HEY THERE.
COME ON IN.

235
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,333
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

236
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,750
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY PAIN,
ARE YOU?

237
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,916
- I THINK IT'S JUST EXHAUSTION.

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,416
I'LL BE UP AND ABOUT AGAIN
BY TOMORROW.

239
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,458
I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WORRY YOU.

240
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,125
- IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

241
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,541
JUST LET ME KNOW
AND I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

242
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,500
YOU REST.
- THAT'S SWEET OF YOU.

243
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,875
THANKS.  JUST HAVING YOU HERE
MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

244
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,583
- I'LL COME BACK TOMORROW
WITH WILHELMINA!

245
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,291
- THAT'S OKAY.

246
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,958
THERE'S NO REASON TO BOTHER HER
WITH MY SILLY FATIGUE.

247
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,333
SHE IS A BUSY LADY.
- SHE WON'T MIND.

248
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:05,625
SHE'S THE GREATEST NURSE EVER.
ONE TIME I HAD A BAD FEVER,

249
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,625
SO SHE BROUGHT A GIANT BLOCK
OF ICE HOME

250
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,791
TO TRY AND COOL ME OFF.
- YEAH?

251
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:14,791
( laughs ) YOUR POSITIVE ENERGY
IS INFECTIOUS.

252
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,250
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN GET FOR YOU?

253
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,000
- UM, SORRY WE HAD YOU WORRIED.

254
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,541
- I'M JUST GLAD
IT WAS NOTHING SERIOUS.

255
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,250
- SHE MAY NOT LOOK IT,
BUT MOM'S PRETTY STRONG.

256
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,000
HER ILLNESS
DID GET ME THINKING THOUGH.

257
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,916
- ABOUT WHAT?

258
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,750
- WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO HER
WHEN I LEAVE TOWN.

259
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,375
MY DAD'S AWAY SO MUCH.

260
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,000
AND WE DON'T HAVE
ANY RELATIVES.

261
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,083
SHE'D BE ALONE A LOT.

262
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,625
WHAT IF SHE WERE
TO COLLAPSE AGAIN?

263
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,833
KNOWING HER,
SHE'D JUST GET RIGHT BACK UP.

264
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,750
HEY, I FORGOT,
ONE OF HER FRIENDS IS A NURSE.

265
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,833
SHE'LL BE IN GOOD HANDS.

266
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,750
- SO YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT LEAVING HER ALONE?
- NO.

267
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,166
WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO TO WORRY

268
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,041
WHEN I KNOW
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD HELP?

269
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,041
- OH, DEAR, THE LADY'S ILL?
- YEAH.

270
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,416
- THEN I MUST DO SOMETHING.

271
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,666
SHE'S DONE SO MUCH
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

272
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,291
THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS CREATE A REMEDY FOR HER.

273
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,458
- Shana:
YUJI SAID HE'S NOT WORRIED
ABOUT LEAVING HER,

274
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:30,041
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S BEING HONEST.

275
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,083
- I KIND OF THREW IT TOGETHER
AT THE LAST MINUTE,

276
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,500
SO I'M SORRY
IF IT'S NOT VERY GOOD.

277
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:39,041
BUT I MADE DINNER FOR YOU
AND SOME SOUP FOR YOUR MOM.

278
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,416
- WOW, YOSHIDA.
UM, THANK YOU.

279
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,041
- I HOPE SHE'S FEELING BETTER.
I'LL BRING MORE TOMORROW.

280
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,541
GOOD NIGHT.

281
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,125
- Yuji: I CAN'T LET THIS GO ON
ANY LONGER.

282
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,458
I HAVE TO TALK TO HER,
AND SOON.

283
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,708
- 'MORNING.
HOW'RE YOU FEELING?

284
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,416
- OH, MUCH BETTER.

285
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,125
I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR LOOKING AFTER ME YESTERDAY.

286
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,791
- NO PROBLEM.

287
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,208
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
SPEND TODAY IN BED TOO.

288
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,208
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

289
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,375
IT IS THE WEEKEND,
AFTER ALL.

290
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:37,291
- I KEEP GETTING
THIS WEIRD FEELING.

291
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,333
- HERE, WHY DON'T YOU GO
AND TAKE THIS MEDICINE
TO CHIGUSA?

292
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,666
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
ONCE MY PACKAGE FROM OUTLAW
HAS BEEN DELIVERED.

293
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,416
ALL RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

294
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,000
- I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
YOU SEEM A LITTLE DOWN, MILADY.

295
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,250
- NAH, I'M FINE.
REALLY.

296
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,875
SEE YOU THERE.

297
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,791
KAZUMI?

298
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,333
- Yuji: I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

299
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:14,916
YOU AND I
COME FROM TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS.

300
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,500
YOU SAW YOURSELF--

301
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,125
I'M NOT EVEN A HUMAN BEING
ANYMORE.

302
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,708
- I KNOW.

303
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,708
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE WAY I FEEL.

304
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,750
- THE LONGER I STAY HERE,

305
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,916
THE MORE TROUBLE
I'LL ATTRACT.

306
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,666
THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED
TO LEAVE TOWN WITH SHANA.

307
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,250
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHEN.

308
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,750
I'M AS GOOD AS GONE.

309
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,125
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR
TO KEEP TAKING GIFTS FROM YOU.

310
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,000
- SAKAI.

311
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,416
- I'M SORRY.

312
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,583
- WHY ARE YOU APOLOGIZING?

313
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,333
IF THE WAY I FEEL
BOTHERS YOU FOR SOME REASON,

314
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,083
THEN JUST SAY THE WORD.

315
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,666
TELL ME TO BACK OFF
AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

316
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,791
AT LEAST I WOULD KNOW
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL ABOUT ME.

317
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,625
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO AVOID THE SUBJECT.

318
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,875
I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE A NUISANCE, SAKAI.

319
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,541
I LOVE YOU

320
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,375
EVEN IF
YOU DON'T LOVE ME BACK.

321
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,666
- YOSHIDA.

322
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,416
WAIT!

323
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,166
SHANA.

324
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,583
- YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS?
YOU.

325
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,791
I KNOW WHY KAZUMI GOT MAD
BECAUSE I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

326
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,458
YOU'RE LYING TO YOURSELF.

327
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,625
DEEP DOWN YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR MOM

328
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,208
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

329
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,291
BUT YOU WON'T FACE THE TRUTH.
FORGET IT.

330
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,416
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

331
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,875
WHAT AN IDIOT.

332
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,833
- THEY WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

333
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,166
I'M FINALLY ABLE
TO DEAL WITH MY SITUATION.

334
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,125
I'M NOT LYING TO MYSELF.
I'M NOT.

335
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,750
- IS SOMETHING WRONG, MILADY?

336
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:17,250
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO TAKE THE REMEDY TO CHIGUSA?

337
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,458
- WHAT DO I DO?

338
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:25,125
I'VE NEVER SPOKEN TO SAKAI
LIKE THAT, BUT--

339
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,500
- HAVING A ROUGH DAY,
ARE WE?

340
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,375
THAT'S TOO BAD.

341
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,291
I'M AFRAID...
IT'S ABOUT TO GET WORSE.

342
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,916
- WHO ARE YOU?
- ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

343
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,666
MY NAME IS ZAROVEE.

344
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,250
I AM KNOWN
AS THE COLLATION FLUX.
- A DENIZEN?

345
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,958
- THAT'S RIGHT.  PLEASED
TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

346
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:55,458
- WHY DIDN'T I SENSE
HIS PRESENCE?

347
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,958
- ( theme music playing )


348
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:29,291
- Yuji: I'M AMBUSHED
BY THE CRIMSON DENIZEN ZAROVEE,

349
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,291
WHO HAS A STRANGE REQUEST.

350
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,541
EITHER I FOLLOW HIM
THROUGH THE CITY

351
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:37,125
OR HE'LL CONSUME ITS CITIZENS.
AS WE WALK,

352
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:40,041
I TRY TO COME UP WITH A WAY
TO ALERT THE OTHERS.

353
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,583
WHAT DOES ZAROVEE
WANT FROM ME?

354
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:45,666
AND WHAT TROUBLE
IS ON THE HORIZON
FOR SHANA TOO?

355
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,541
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA SECOND,"

356
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,208
"WHAT COULDN'T BE SAID."
