00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,458
SUDDENLY RETURNED HOME
SURPRISING EVERYONE.

3
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,208
CHIGUSA EXPLAINED
TO SHANA AND KAZUMI

4
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,166
WHAT IT FELT LIKE
TO BE IN LOVE.

5
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,041
LATER, KANTAROU TOLD THEM THE
SECRET TO A SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE.

6
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,500
THEIR WORDS AFFECTED THE GIRLS
IN SUCH A WAY,

7
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,541
THAT AFTERWARDS THEY FOUND
THEIR FEELINGS

8
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,541
FOR YUJI REIGNITED.

9
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,166

00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,541
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

11
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,666
- THERE YOU ARE.
GOOD MORNING, DEAR.

12
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,208
- OH, I DIDN'T HEAR YOU GET UP.
AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

13
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,791
I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY
'CAUSE I'VE GOT BREAKFAST READY.

14
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,250
- YUJI'S NOT EATING?

15
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,458
- HE ATE ALREADY,
BEFORE HE LEFT FOR SCHOOL.

16
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,458
- HE ALWAYS LEAVE THIS EARLY?

17
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,083
- NOT USUALLY, BUT
THEY'RE PREPARING FOR
THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL.

18
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,500
HE SAID THEY DON'T
EVEN HAVE CLASS TODAY.

19
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,250
AND THEY'LL BE STAYING OVERNIGHT
TO WRAP EVERYTHING UP.

20
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,708
- HMM, DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE MUCH FUN.

21
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,583
THANKS FOR THE FOOD.

22
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,791
- NOPE,
IT'S NOT QUITE STRAIGHT.

23
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,000
MOVE IT TO THE LEFT.
NO, YOUR OTHER LEFT.

24
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,666
ALMOST THERE.  THAT'S IT.

25
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,166
LOOKS GOOD.
- WE NEED ANOTHER DESK.

26
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,583
- WHY DON'T YOU GRAB ONE
FROM THE LIBRARY?

27
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,083
- YEAH, COOL.
- YOU GOT IT, DUDE?

28
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,708
- CAN YOU HAND ME
A THUMBTACK?

29
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,458
- HERE YOU GO.

30
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,250
- YEAH, NO.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT.

31
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,916
- WHAT'S "THE PERILS
OF LOVE" MEAN?

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,833
- ( playing notes )

33
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:24,041
- FESTIVAL'S SHAPING UP NICELY
THIS YEAR.  I CAN'T WAIT.

34
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,125
- YEAH, ME TOO.
- SOMETHING WRONG?

35
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:30,166
YOU DON'T SOUND TOO HAPPY.
- NO, I'M FINE.

36
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,875
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS?

37
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,666
- I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW.

38
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,250
- SILVER!
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU

39
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,708
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
PAINTED SILVER, NOT GOLD.

40
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,666
- OH, SORRY.  MY BAD.
- WELL...

41
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,416
NO REASON
TO WASTE MY TIME WORRYING.

42
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,833
- Boys:
ONE, TWO, THREE!

43
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,208
- AWESOME.
NOW ALL WE'VE GOTTA DO IS WAIT

44
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,958
FOR THE CREPE MAKING MACHINE
TO GET HERE.

45
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,208
- SO THE ONLY
MYSTERY'S MARGERY.

46
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,833
SHE GONNA SHOW?

47
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,833
- WHAT THE HELL IS
AN "AUTUMN FESTIVAL"?

48
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,583
NEVER HEARD OF
THAT KIND OF DENIZEN.

49
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,625
- THAT'S BECAUSE IT ISN'T ONE.

50
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,708
- IT'S AN EVENT AT OUR SCHOOL.

51
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,875
WE'D LIKE YOU TO COME,
IF YOU CAN.

52
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,583
- I'LL GO AS LONG AS
I CAN DRINK.

53
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,458
- SORRY,
THERE WON'T BE ANY BOOZE.

54
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,041
WE'RE UNDERAGE, REMEMBER?

55
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,375
- YEAH, NO, COUNT ME OUT.

56
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,541
- IF SHE CAN'T DRINK,
SHE WON'T SHOW.

57
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,666
- OH, YEAH.

58
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,625
- THIS IS GONNA LOOK SO AWESOME.

59
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,583
- DOES ANYONE KNOW
HOW TO MAKE A PATTERN?

60
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:54,250
- YOU FEELING OKAY? I DON'T WANT
YOU TO PUSH YOURSELF TOO HARD.

61
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,333
IF YOU WANT,
I CAN TAKE OVER FOR YOU.

62
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,958
NO, I'LL BE FINE.
DON'T WORRY.

63
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,833
- SO HOW ARE YOU
HOLDING UP, SHANA?

64
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,666
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP,
LET ME KNOW, OKAY?

65
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,083
- NAH, I'VE GOT IT.

66
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,500
- Chigusa:
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL.

67
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,791
LISTEN TO YOUR HEART,
IT'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

68
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,625
- IF YOU FIND YOU'RE
FEELING LOST,

69
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,416
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS REACH OUT.

70
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,791
YOU NEVER KNOW. THERE MIGHT
BE SOMEONE REACHING OUT

71
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,833
TO YOU AS WELL.
- I DON'T THINK IT'LL REACH.

72
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,458
AND I DON'T WANNA CUT IT
TOO SHORT.

73
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,708
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT?
- YEAH, SURE THING.

74
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,375
- ( sighs )

75
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,708
- ( laughing )

76
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,750
- ALL DONE.
CHECK IT OUT!

77
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,333
- OH, WOW!  YOU'RE SO FAST.

78
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,125
- IT'LL PROBABLY FALL APART
IN NO TIME.

79
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,500
- NAH, I'M JUST
A QUICK SEAMSTRESS.

80
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,583
BESIDES,
MAKING A LION COSTUME'S EASY.

81
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,833
TANAKA'S GONNA LOOK AWESOME.

82
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,583
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM IN IT.

83
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,291
- ( laughs ) ME EITHER.
I COULD USE A GOOD LAUGH.

84
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,250
- AHA!
TALK ABOUT GOOD TIMING.

85
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,000
COME WITH ME
FOR A SEC, WOULD YOU?

86
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,833
- UH...
WHAT'S GOING ON?

87
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:04,416
- Nakamura: OH, YOU MAKE
A PERFECT COWARDLY LION!

88
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,833
WHAT DO YOU THINK, OGATA?
HE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

89
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,875
- YEAH, NOT BAD.

90
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,375
HEY, I JUST REMEMBERED
I GOT SOMETHING TO DO.

91
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,541
- ( Ogata falls, shouts )
- Boy: ( laughs ) NICE ONE!

92
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,583
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

93
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,875
- I SWEAR, THAT GIRL COULD NOT
BE ANY MORE OBVIOUS

94
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,333
IF SHE TRIED.

95
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,333
- WELL, I GUESS
IT'S ALMOST TIME.

96
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,416
ARE WE ALL READY TO GET
THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD?

97
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,958
- WE DON'T HAVE LONG NOW.

98
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,416
- JEEZ,
WHAT ARE YOU FREAKED OUT FOR?

99
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,958
YOU REALIZE WE'RE ALL BASICALLY
GETTING TO SKIP CLASS.

100
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,541
SHOULDN'T YOU GUYS BE STOKED?
- Sato: YOU ALL RIGHT, IKE?

101
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,916
I'M WORRIED YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE IT TO THE FESTIVAL.

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,833
- Yuji:
YEAH, RIGHT?  ALL THAT WORK,

103
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,958
I SURE DON'T ENVY
YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

104
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,875
BUT AREN'T YOU WORRIED YOU'RE
WORKING A BIT TOO HARD?

105
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,166
- IT'S NOT ME.

106
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,541
IT'S THE PERSON WHO'S ABOVE ME

107
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,500
WHO'S WORKING ME TO DEATH.

108
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,208
 WE'LL ASK LOCAL SHOP OWNERS
TO PUT THESE FLYERS UP,

109
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,541
THEN WE'LL SEE HOW THE PROGRAM
IS LOOKING

110
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,666
AND TALK TO THE BROADCASTING
CLUB ABOUT A POSSIBLE

111
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,666
RADIO COMMERCIAL.
- WOW, FUJITA.

112
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,416
YOU SURE HAVE A LOT
ON YOUR PLATE.

113
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,000
- GUESS SO.  THIS IS MY FIRST
TIME DOING COMMITTEE WORK,

114
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,000
AND I DON'T WANNA
LET ANYBODY DOWN.

115
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,833
I'M ONLY TRYING TO KEEP UP
WITH YOUR AWESOMENESS, IKE.

116
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:24,500
-NAH, I THINK
YOU'VE GOT ME BEAT.

117
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,000
- WE NEED TO STORE
THESE SPARE MATERIALS,

118
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,166
CONFIRM THE PARADE ROUTE
WITH THE CITY

119
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,375
AND DOUBLE CHECK
EACH DEPARTMENT'S PROGRESS.

120
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,041
THEN WE CAN GO
FINISH UP OUR MANAGING
REPRESENTATIVE'S REPORTS.

121
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,875
- ALL THIS WORK
AND YOU'RE STILL CHIPPER.

122
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,500
- WELL,
THE WORK'S GOTTA BE DONE

123
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,000
SO I MIGHT AS WELL DO IT
WITH A SMILE, RIGHT?

124
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:44,000
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
I'LL TRY TO KEEP UP WITH YOU.

125
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,208
- WE'LL TAKE FUTONS
TO EACH CLASSROOM,

126
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,750
AND WE'LL INSPECT THE STANDS
OUTSIDE FOR ANY CODE VIOLATIONS,

127
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,125
THEN WE'LL WRITE UP THE BALLOTS
AND START PRINTING THEM OUT.

128
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:55,125
- DON'T YOU NEED A BREAK?

129
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,750
- NO, DON'T BE SILLY.
WHO HAS TIME TO THINK

130
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,833
ABOUT BREAKS WHEN THERE'S
SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE?

131
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,291
- YEAH, RIGHT.  SILLY ME.

132
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,833
- NO, I TOTALLY FORGOT
WE STILL HAVE TO RESERVE

133
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,500
ALL THE PARKING SPOTS
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

134
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,416
- OH!

135
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,708
- SOUNDS LIKE MORE TROUBLE
THAN IT'S WORTH.

136
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,666
- I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY,
BUT HERE.

137
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,791
I MADE SANDWICHES
FOR EVERYBODY 'CAUSE I KNEW

138
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,083
WE WOULDN'T HAVE
MUCH TIME FOR LUNCH.

139
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,000
YOU SHOULD EAT ONE WHILE YOU
HAVE A MOMENT.

140
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,166
- Ogata: YOU'RE THE GREATEST,
KAZUMI.  ISN'T SHE SWEET?

141
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,000
- SHE TOTALLY IS.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

142
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,791
THANK YOU FOR THE FOO--
- THERE YOU ARE, IKE.

143
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,666
WE'VE GOT BIG TROUBLE.  THE JAZZ
CLUB AND THE MANDOLIN BAND

144
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,500
ARE ARGUING OVER WHO'S GONNA
GET THE MOST STAGE TIME.

145
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,625
- YOU GOTTA FEEL SORRY
FOR HIM, YOU KNOW?

146
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,541
POOR GUY'S GOT
THE WORST LUCK EVER.

147
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,125
- THE MANDOLIN BAND GETS
THE STAGE FROM 10:00 TO 11:00.

148
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,750
COME ON, LET'S GO.

149
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,541
- Yuji: SEE YOU TOMORROW, KONOE.
BRIGHT AND EARLY.

150
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,458
- THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT
AND SEEING ME OFF.

151
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,666
I WAS THINKING.

152
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,375
I SURE WISH I COULD STAY
AND SPEND THE NIGHT HERE

153
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,666
WITH ALL OF YOU.
I BET IT'S GOING TO BE FUN.

154
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,125
- IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TOO OFTEN

155
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,416
AND WE'D LOVE
TO HAVE YOU JOIN US.

156
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,583
- I EVEN HAVE A DECK OF CARDS
IF WE GET BORED.

157
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,083
WHY DON'T YOU SEND
YOUR BUTLER HOME AND STAY?

158
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,125
COME ON, IT'LL BE A BLAST.

159
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,125
- WHILE I'M SURE SHE
APPRECIATES THE INVITATION,

160
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,833
I'M AFRAID MISS KONOE WILL
HAVE TO POLITELY DECLINE.

161
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,250
YOU KIDS HAVE
A GOOD EVENING NOW.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,416
- Fujita: GIRLS, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

163
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,250
SHOWER TIME FOR SECOND YEARS
IS 6:00.

164
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,208
WE SHOULD HEAD THAT WAY NOW
OR WE'LL MISS OUR TIME SLOT.

165
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,833
- WHOA.  TIME TO HIT
THE SHOWERS ALREADY?

166
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,541
GUESS WE'D BETTER GO.
- MM-HMM.

167
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,416
TANAKA,
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU LATER?

168
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,666
- MAYBE.

169
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,083
- IF YOU'RE FEELING LOST,
JUST REACH OUT.

170
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,583
LISTEN TO YOUR HEART.

171
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:31,041
IT'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

172
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,416
- Nakamura: WHOA, KAZUMI!  YOU
WENT AND GOT ALL CURVY ON US.

173
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,541
- EXCUSE ME?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

174
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,750
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING
THOSE BIG OLD BAZOOMBAS?

175
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,750
- ( laughing )
- OH, NO.

176
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,250
FUJITA,
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE?

177
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,791
- NO CAN DO.  I DON'T HAVE
MY GLASSES ON RIGHT NOW.

178
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,583
- PLEASE LET ME SHOWER IN PEACE.
- OH, I JUST WANNA SQUEEZE 'EM.

179
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,875
- COME ON,
DON'T BE CREEPY, NAKAMURA.

180
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,791
- CUT OUT THE HORSEPLAY
AND JUST SHOWER ALREADY.

181
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,208
- I WONDER WHY IT'S
TAKING ME SO LONG

182
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:01,208
TO ACCUMULATE EXCESSIVE FAT
IN MY CHEST.

183
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,791
- OH, SHANA.
- ( gasps )

184
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,291
I SAID CUT IT OUT!
- ( laughing )

185
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,000
- SHANA, YOU STILL AWAKE?

186
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,000
- YEAH, I AM.

187
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,416
- I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR WHAT YOU SAID.

188
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,583
- YOU'LL PLAY ROMEO TO KAZUMI'S
JULIET, AND THAT'S THAT.

189
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,291
I LIKE YOU.

190
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,666
BUT I WON'T LOSE TO YOU.

191
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,166
- I'M FINE WITH THAT.

192
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,500
I'M NOT STUPID.
I SEE THE WAY YUJI LOOKS AT YOU.

193
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,375
HE MAY NOT HAVE MADE
A DECISION YET,

194
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,541
BUT I KNOW WHO HE'LL CHOOSE.
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

195
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,458
YOU'D THINK I'D BE UPSET
ABOUT IT, BUT I'M NOT.

196
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,875
I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT CHOICE
FOR HIM.

197
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,916
THE TWO OF YOU HAVE BEEN
FIGHTING ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,625
ALL THIS TIME,

199
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,208
BUT I WON'T GIVE UP.

200
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,375
- THE TWO OF YOU HAVE BEEN
FIGHTING ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER

201
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:02,458
ALL THIS TIME.
- Yuji: YOU NEED A HAND?

202
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,208
IT DIDN'T TAKE US VERY LONG
TO SET UP THE CREPE STAND.

203
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,000
SO I'M FREE TO HELP.

204
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,791
"THE ROAD BEFORE
THE STATION," HUH?

205
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,750
AH, THAT'S WHERE IT GOES.

206
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,291
ARE YOU OKAY?

207
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,750
- YEAH, JUST DAYDREAMING.

208
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,166
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

209
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,625
YUJI AND I
ALWAYS MAKE IT THROUGH.

210
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,416
WE ALWAYS WILL.

211
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,750
- I'M ALL DONE.
- ( gasps ) OH!

212
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,666
- ( laughs ) CAN YOU TRY IT ON
FOR ME REAL QUICK, KAZUMI?

213
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,250
- OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

214
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,791
- I JUST WANNA SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON YOU.

215
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,166
I GOTTA MAKE SURE IT FITS.
- CAN'T WE GO SOMEWHERE PRIVATE?

216
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,375
- COME ON,
NO NEED TO BE MODEST.

217
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,125
- BUT SOFT.

218
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,416
WHAT LIGHT THROUGH
YONDER WINDOW BREAKS?

219
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
IT IS THE EAST
AND JULIET IS THE SUN.

220
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,500
ARISE, FAIR SUN,
AND KILL THE ENVIOUS MOON,

221
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,333
WHO IS-- SORRY.

222
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,500
I WAS SAYING ROMEO'S LINES.

223
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,541
O THAT I WERE A GLOVE UPON
THAT HAND

224
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,208
THAT I MIGHT TOUCH THAT CHEEK.

225
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,750
- ( gasping )

226
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,833
- WOW, KONOE,
THAT WAS AMAZING.

227
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,875
- HOW MUCH SHAKESPEARE
DO YOU HAVE MEMORIZED?

228
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,708
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, ALASTOR?

229
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,375
- I AM AFRAID YUJI SAKAI'S
SILVER FLAME

230
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,958
MEANS THERE IS A CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE TWO.

231
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,875
I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HEAR.

232
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,375
NO, BUT THAT DOESN'T

233
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,625
CHANGE HOW I FEEL.

234
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,416
- EVEN FLAME HAZE CAN
FALL VICTIM TO LOVE.

235
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,208
REMEMBER WHAT MRS. SAKAI SAID,

236
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,875
"LISTEN TO YOUR HEART.
IT WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO."

237
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,916
HER WORDS COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN MORE TRUE.

238
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,541
- I HAVE FINISHED MY
INVESTIGATION, MILADY.

239
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,458
- WILHELMINA.

240
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,625
- Yuji:
WHAT'S UP, SHANA?

241
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,458
CAN'T THIS WAIT UNTIL MORNING?

242
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,541
WILHELMINA.

243
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,166
- MY INVESTIGATION
OF THE KEEPER

244
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,375
ON THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

245
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,791
LED ME TO INFORMATION
I THINK YOU NEED

246
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:10,083
TO HEAR REGARDING
A POWERFUL CRIMSON DENIZEN.

247
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,875
- A DENIZEN?

248
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,166
- Tiamat:
PHELES, THE CAPRICE OF BEAUTY.

249
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,500
- SHE'S ONE OF THE CRIMSON
WORLD'S MIGHTIEST LORDS

250
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,291
AND THE CREATOR
OF THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

251
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:24,500
LONG AGO, PHELES DECLARED HER
DEVOTION TO HER ETERNAL LOVER.

252
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,625
A HUMAN NAMED JOHAN.

253
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,791
WHO BECAME THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD'S MYSTES.

254
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,708
TOGETHER, THEY ARE
THE PROMISED PAIR.

255
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,625
OTHERWISE KNOWN
AS ENGAGED LINK.

256
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,666
- WHY DIDN'T I KNOW THIS?

257
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,208
- Wilhelmina: PHELES WAS SO
IN LOVE WITH JOHAN,

258
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,291
SHE CREATED
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

259
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,625
SO THAT SHE WOULD NEVER
HAVE TO LEAVE HIS SIDE.

260
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,375
AMAZINGLY, SHE WAS ABLE

261
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,875
TO MANIPULATE TIME EVERY DAY

262
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,791
AT THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT.

263
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,666
HER LOVER'S POWER OF EXISTENCE
WOULD REPLENISH ITSELF.

264
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,208
THEY WOULD STILL
BE TOGETHER TODAY

265
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,458
HAD THEY NOT LOST
A BRUTAL BATTLE.

266
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,125
- THAT MUST'VE BEEN WHEN
THE TREASURE TOOL WAS RELEASED

267
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,666
AND SOMEHOW FOUND
ITS WAY INTO ME.

268
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,333
- THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
IS A TESTAMENT

269
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,291
TO THE ENGAGED LINK'S LOVE,

270
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,041
A MEMORY OF THE BRIEF TIME
THEY SPENT TOGETHER.

271
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,666
THE PROBLEM IS--
- Tiamat: SHE SURVIVED.

272
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,375
- INCREDIBLY, PHELES MADE IT
THROUGH THE BATTLE.

273
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:26,250
- SHE'S ALIVE?
SO WHAT'S THAT MEAN FOR ME?

274
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,041
I'M AFRAID IT MEANS SHE'S GOING
TO COME LOOKING FOR YOU.

275
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,416
TO COLLECT THE MEMENTO
OF HER ETERNAL LOVER.

276
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,041
I AM NOT CERTAIN,

277
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,083
BUT IT APPEARS PHELES PUT
THE KEEPER

278
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,041
ON THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
IN HOPES

279
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,708
OF PROTECTING IT
FROM BEING STOLEN.

280
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,791
I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT YOUR LIFE
IS IN GRAVE DANGER.

281
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,958
IF PHELES EVER GETS A HOLD
OF YOU, YOU'LL BE DONE FOR.

282
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,166
- Tiamat:
IT'S INEVITABLE.

283
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,666
- DOES MY FLAME--

284
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,208
DOES THE COLOR OF MY FLAME
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?

285
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,125
- PARDON.  I'M SORRY,
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

286
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,583
- Tiamat:
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

287
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,208
- MY SILVER FLAME.

288
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,708
I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO CAST
AN UNRESTRICTED SPELL,

289
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,291
BUT FOR SOME REASON
MY SEAL WAS SILVER.

290
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,083
- I DIDN'T HAVE THE CHANCE
TO TELL YOU.

291
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,625
WE WERE ALL COMPLETELY SHOCKED.

292
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,250
BUT IT DID HAPPEN.
- Wilhelmina: IMPOSSIBLE.

293
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,750
THERE'S NO WAY HE
COULD HAVE DONE THAT.

294
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,083
- Tiamat: DO NOT LIE TO US.
- WE'RE NOT LYING.

295
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,208
I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.
ALASTOR DID TOO.

296
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,750
- BUT THE COLOR SILVER.

297
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,875
- Alastor: THE CAPRICE
OF BEAUTY'S SEARCH

298
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,041
FOR THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO

299
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,791
WITH THE SILVER.

300
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,791
THEY ARE TWO ENTIRELY
SEPARATE ISSUES.

301
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,416
I WILL WARN YOU, YUJI SAKAI.

302
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,333
YOU ARE ABOUT
TO FACE TWO TRIALS,

303
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,791
THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU HAVE
NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE.

304
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,666
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
WE FINISHED IT ALL.

305
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,583
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
TOMORROW IS GONNA BE AWESOME.

306
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,250
- ( both laugh )

307
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,333
- ALL RIGHT, I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE
READY FOR A GOOD TIME TOMORROW.

308
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,625
- Both: YOU BETCHA.
- YOU FEELING OKAY?

309
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,000
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
SO HOT, MAN.

310
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,708
- I'M FINE.
I JUST NEED SOME REST.

311
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,541
NOW THAT ALL OUR WORK IS DONE,

312
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,958
I SHOULD FINALLY BE ABLE TO--
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, IKE.

313
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,958
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROPE

314
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,708
FOR THE PARADE TOMORROW
SO WE NEED TO GO BUY SOME.

315
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,500
- ( all groan )

316
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,541
- I SAID IT BEFORE.

317
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,125
WORST LUCK EVER.

318
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,333
- Wilhelmina: I'LL INDEED
SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT

319
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,375
ABOUT THE SILVER.

320
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,375
PHELES HAS ABSOLUTE POWER,
MILADY.

321
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,083
PROMISE ME YOU'LL BE CAREFUL,
AS YOUR LIFE MAY BE

322
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,666
IN DANGER AS WELL.

323
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,833
- ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANNA TELL US?

324
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,500
I GET THE FEELING YOU'RE
HOLDING SOMETHING BACK.

325
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,250
WILHELMINA?

326
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,916
- FIRST THE SILVER FLAME.

327
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,625
AND NOW I'M BEING HUNTED.

328
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:54,250
I MEAN, COME ON, WHAT NEXT?

329
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,666
WHAT THE HELL AM I?

330
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,458
- YUJI.

331
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,583
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME.

332
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,041
WHEN YOU MAKE A DECISION,

333
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,833
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

334
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,875
- BUT, SHANA.

335
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,208
I PROMISE.

336
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,958
NO MATTER WHAT,
I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU.

337
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,250
- PHELES, I'M BEGGING YOU.

338
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,250
DON'T COME AFTER HIM.

339
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,208
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU.

340
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,916
- Pheles: JOHAN.

341
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,916
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

342
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:30,000
- Yuji: THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL IS
UNDERWAY AND EVERYONE IS EXCITED

343
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,791
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PARADE,

344
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,333
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE HOPING
TO WIN THE GRAND PRIZE.

345
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:38,791
IF ONLY TIMES LIKE THESE
COULD LAST FOREVER,

346
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,791
BUT ALL GOOD THINGS
HAVE TO COME TO AN END.

347
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:45,541
SUDDENLY AN UNPLEASANT WIND
SWEEPS THROUGH MISAKI CITY.

348
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,958
NEXT TIME ON
"SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II"...

349
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,916
"THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL BEGINS."
