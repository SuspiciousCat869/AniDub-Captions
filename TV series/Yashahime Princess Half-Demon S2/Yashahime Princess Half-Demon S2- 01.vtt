TOWA: <i>Setsuna and I</i>
<i>are half‐demons,</i>

00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:12.223
<i>daughters of</i>
<i>the great demon Sesshomaru</i>

00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:14.394
and a human woman named Rin.

00:00:15.863 --> 00:00:19.004
<i>When we were little,</i>
<i>we lived in the forest.</i>

00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:23.712
<i>We were always together,</i>
<i>and we got along so well.</i>

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:28.389
But then, during a forest fire,
I let go of Setsuna's hand.

00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:31.028
<i>I was hurled</i>
<i>into the present day,</i>

00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:33.465
<i>where I was adopted</i>
<i>by the Higurashi family</i>

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.638
<i>and given the name</i>
<i>Towa Higurashi.</i>

00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:40.346
Ten years later,
Setsuna and I were reunited,

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.385
<i>but my own sister</i>
<i>didn't recognize me at all.</i>

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.024
<i>I also met Moroha,</i>

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:48.162
a quarter‐demon
who works as a bounty hunter,

00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:51.668
often in tandem with Setsuna,
who's now a demon slayer.

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:55.476
<i>Moroha's parents are</i>
<i>the half‐demon Inuyasha,</i>

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:56.879
our father's younger brother,

00:00:56.913 --> 00:01:00.252
and Kagome,
who's Papa Sota's older sister,

00:01:00.286 --> 00:01:04.160
<i>so I guess</i>
<i>that makes her our cousin.</i>

00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:08.135
<i>In order to help Setsuna</i>
<i>sleep and dream again</i>

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.373
<i>and to restore</i>
<i>her lost memories,</i>

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:12.577
we returned to the Feudal Era.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.018
<i>Along the way, a spirit</i>
<i>called the Tree of Ages</i>

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:19.491
<i>asked us to slay</i>
<i>the Beast King Kirinmaru.</i>

00:01:19.524 --> 00:01:21.061
<i>Arriving in the Feudal Era,</i>

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:24.167
<i>we spent our days</i>
<i>slaying demons for a living</i>

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.336
when we weren't being attacked

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.941
<i>by Kirinmaru's followers,</i>
<i>the Four Perils,</i>

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:29.744
<i>or by his sister, Zero.</i>

00:01:29.778 --> 00:01:32.750
<i>Oh, and we also</i>
<i>became friends with Riku,</i>

00:01:32.784 --> 00:01:34.922
<i>a beautiful, but odd pirate</i>

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:37.026
<i>who had said</i>
<i>he'd been washed ashore.</i>

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.631
<i>It wasn't easy,</i>
<i>but by working together,</i>

00:01:39.664 --> 00:01:42.236
we eventually managed
to defeat all the Four Perils,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.839
<i>and Setsuna killed Zero.</i>

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:46.578
<i>But then our father,</i>
<i>Sesshomaru,</i>

00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:50.419
used the Tenseiga to bring Zero
back to life for some reason.

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:51.722
<i>I don't get it.</i>

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:53.759
She's supposed to be our enemy!

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:59.270
<i>And that's just when he</i>
<i>decided to show up again,</i>

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:00.706

So now what do I cut with it?

‐ She did it!

00:12:24.253 --> 00:12:26.824
‐ Now if she only knew
what to use it on.

00:12:26.858 --> 00:12:27.760
‐ Eh?

00:12:28.996 --> 00:12:31.167
TOTOSAI: I'm guessing
she's still not able

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.939
to see the minions
of the netherworld.

00:12:33.973 --> 00:12:36.477

[dramatic music playing]

00:12:42.089 --> 00:12:44.493

Setsuna.

00:13:02.496 --> 00:13:04.200
Just hang on.

That must be it!

00:13:14.253 --> 00:13:16.190

You can't leave!

00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:33.725
[gasps] It hurts...

00:13:33.758 --> 00:13:37.299
but I need more demon power,

00:13:37.332 --> 00:13:39.837

that thing is extraordinary.

‐ What thing?

00:13:47.553 --> 00:13:49.623
‐ I'm talking
about the Blood Blade

00:13:49.657 --> 00:13:51.627
that she inherited
from Sesshomaru.

00:13:51.661 --> 00:13:55.402
Not only can it cut through
almost any physical object,

00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:58.475
that blade has the power
to sever, in a single stroke,

00:13:58.508 --> 00:14:00.880
the invisible strands of Fate.

00:14:00.913 --> 00:14:02.884
Her weapon was the weak link.

This human‐forged naginata

00:14:05.689 --> 00:14:09.196
was never capable
of channeling power like that.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.202
I should give her
a naginata worthy of such power

00:14:12.236 --> 00:14:14.908
to take with her
to the afterlife.

00:14:14.941 --> 00:14:16.879
‐ You there, Moroha.
‐ Eh?

00:14:16.912 --> 00:14:20.118
Since you're the daughter
of Inuyasha and Kagome,

00:14:20.152 --> 00:14:21.320
I can leave you to deal

00:14:21.354 --> 00:14:23.825
with all the evil spirits
and demons, right?

00:14:23.858 --> 00:14:26.831
‐ Huh? What the hell are
you talking about, old man?

00:14:26.864 --> 00:14:30.873
‐ I'll be working with
lapis lazuli crystals and ash,

00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:34.246
which will undoubtedly bring
forth the hordes of evil spirits

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.818
and demons who've inhabited
these parts for ages.

00:14:36.851 --> 00:14:38.221
And they're very annoying,

00:14:38.254 --> 00:14:40.425
so keep them away from me.
Got it?

Why, then, do you hesitate?

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.288
‐ Heads up. They're here.

00:15:45.322 --> 00:15:48.294
And do your fighting
somewhere else.

00:15:48.328 --> 00:15:49.898
Don't get in my way.

you exterminate them all.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.144
Do you mean I was dead?

00:19:55.455 --> 00:19:58.227

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:01.734
‐ [grunts] What's this?

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:04.373
‐ Yukari no Tachikiri,

00:20:04.406 --> 00:20:09.316
a naginata capable of severing
things that cannot be severed.

00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:11.220
It responds to the Blood Blade

00:20:11.253 --> 00:20:13.491
that Sesshomaru
entrusted to you,

00:20:13.524 --> 00:20:17.099
a fine blade,
if I say so myself.

00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:18.434
Though judging by the way

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.705
you handled
those mediocre demons just now,

00:20:20.738 --> 00:20:23.744
you've got a long ways to go
before you'll ever master it,

00:20:23.778 --> 00:20:26.550
so it's all up to you
from now on.

00:20:26.584 --> 00:20:30.458
‐ It's all up to me?

00:20:30.492 --> 00:20:34.133
‐ By the way,
tell Towa once she wakes up

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:36.036
she's wasting her time

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.612
trying to infuse demon power
into a weapon forged by humans.

00:20:40.645 --> 00:20:43.518
She should get her hands
on a Kyuyokon root.

00:20:43.551 --> 00:20:45.688
‐ A Kyuyokon root?

00:20:45.722 --> 00:20:48.761
Yep, that's what she's going
to need if she wants to have

00:20:48.795 --> 00:20:51.734
a fighting chance against
the great demon Kirinmaru.

00:20:51.767 --> 00:20:54.673
Remember, only a fool

00:20:54.706 --> 00:20:57.179
goes into battle
without a suitable weapon.

00:20:57.212 --> 00:21:00.385
It doesn't matter
how many lives you have.

00:21:01.587 --> 00:21:02.656
‐ You're right.

00:21:04.193 --> 00:21:06.564
Your point is well taken.

00:21:06.597 --> 00:21:09.303
‐ I'm saying this
for her own good.

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:13.611
Tell Towa to find a blade
that fits her needs. You got it?

00:21:13.644 --> 00:21:15.883
‐ But where must we go
to obtain it?

00:21:16.784 --> 00:21:19.456
‐ I would try asking Bokusen‐Oh.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.494
‐ Bokusen‐Oh?

00:21:21.527 --> 00:21:24.166
I think I've heard
that name before.

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:26.637
‐ Well, I'm outta here.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.476
‐ Wait! Don't I get anything?!

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.582
Some parting words
of wisdom at least? Huh?

00:21:32.616 --> 00:21:37.158

00:21:52.689 --> 00:21:53.959
Rest now,

00:21:53.992 --> 00:21:57.098
for we have much to do
when you wake up.

00:21:57.132 --> 00:22:00.171
‐ [murmurs] Setsuna.

00:22:00.205 --> 00:22:01.840
‐ Hey!

00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:04.346
How come everyone else
gets a cool new weapon

00:22:04.379 --> 00:22:05.682
and I don't get nothin'?!

00:22:05.715 --> 00:22:09.056
Not even a "thank you"
or anything!

00:22:12.462 --> 00:22:14.766
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:44.513 --> 00:23:45.615
TOWA: <i>Setsuna came back to life,</i>

00:23:45.648 --> 00:23:48.254
<i>and I can't tell you</i>
<i>how happy I was!</i>

00:23:48.287 --> 00:23:49.957
<i>But then she</i>
<i>just left me behind</i>

00:23:49.991 --> 00:23:53.297
to look for a Kyuyokon root
and some guy called Bokusen‐Oh.

00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.901
<i>That was pretty cold.</i>

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:56.905
<i>What? Women with</i>
<i>long, beautiful hair</i>

00:23:56.938 --> 00:23:58.207
<i>are being attacked?</i>

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.115
<i>Kirara, you know</i>
<i>where Setsuna is right now?</i>

00:24:02.148 --> 00:24:05.488
<i>Next time on</i> Yashahime,
<i>"Demon Spirit of the Sea."</i>

00:24:05.521 --> 00:24:07.792
I can't help
feeling sorry for her.

00:24:07.826 --> 00:24:09.496
She was a good demon once.
