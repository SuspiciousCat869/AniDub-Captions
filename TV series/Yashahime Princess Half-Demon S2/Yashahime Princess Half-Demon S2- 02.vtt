SETSUNA: <i>Towa and Setsuna.</i>

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:11.111
Between us half‐demon twins,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.747
<i>two different worlds</i>
<i>exist at the same time...</i>

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.749
<i>human and demon,</i>

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:16.950
<i>light and shadow,</i>

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:19.086
<i>feudal era and present day,</i>

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.388
<i>peace and war,</i>

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.189
<i>joy and sorrow,</i>

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.591
<i>dreams and reality,</i>

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.260
<i>now and forever,</i>

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:29.663
and finally, love and hate...

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.199
a Feudal Fairytale, Yashahime.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.034
<i>We'll keep moving forward,</i>

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.436
<i>overcoming</i>
<i>the hurdles of destiny.</i>

[liquid bubbling]

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.294
[demon laughs]

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:47.067
I have heard rumors, Riku.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.736
So you betrayed Kirinmaru, eh?

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.939
‐ Bravo, Mr. Mimisenri.

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:54.341
Your ears are
as sharp as ever, I see.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:58.078
‐ Yes, well, even you
can't evade Kirinmaru forever,

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.347
so what do you intend to do now?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.917
‐ Oh, don't worry. I have
no intention at all of running.

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:06.620
But as long
as I have my freedom...

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:10.057
I intend to do
whatever I please.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.360
‐ As in pursuing
Sesshomaru's daughters?

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:16.230
That is a flame that could burn.

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:18.632
‐ I'll get to them in due time.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.234
But before I settle that,

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:23.070
I must find
all seven Rainbow Pearls.

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.072
‐ The Rainbow Pearls?
‐ I can't beat Sesshomaru,

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:26.874
but his daughters
should be easy to beat.

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:28.342
‐ I've seen the blue one
in a forest in the east.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:29.710
‐ I saw the purple one
by the sea.

00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:31.378
‐ No, the blue one
is in the west.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.180
‐ ...we could torture Sesshomaru
into submission.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.248
‐ Didn't those girls
go toe‐to‐toe

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:35.449
against the great demon
Kirinmaru?

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.251
‐ Kirinmaru was going easy
on them to kill time.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:38.652
‐ ...Zero is having
small‐fry demons

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:39.920
go around
collecting them for her.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:42.122
‐ ...sank to the bottom
of the lake.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.957
‐ Some small fry must be
going around telling stories.

00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.959
‐ I'll tell you if you
give me something in return.

00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:47.160
‐ ...Sesshomaru's daughters.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.230
‐ Well, that's what
they're all saying.

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.499
‐ Thanks for the help.

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:58.272
‐ Now where have Setsuna
and Moroha wandered off to?

00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:02.809
I know she wants to find
a Kyuyokon root,

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:04.578
but she couldn't
have waited for me?

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.013
[children laugh]

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:08.549
‐ I'm so gonna get you!

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:09.616
‐ [laughs]
‐ Come on.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.018
Catch me if you can.

00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:12.920
‐ Oh, yeah?
You just wait and see.

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:13.921
‐ [wind blows]
‐ [winces]

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.422
‐ Whoa!
‐ [gasps]

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.590
[gasps]

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:17.691
‐ Cover up! Hurry!

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.626
‐ [both gasp]
‐ Eh?

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:21.695
‐ We got it.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:22.729
‐ Thank you.

00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:24.398
You're okay now.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.732
‐ Thanks.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:26.667
‐ [gasps]

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.906
SETSUNA: Towa! Towa, wake up!

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.075
‐ [murmuring]

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:39.613
Setsuna?

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.282
[gasps]

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:43.917
Setsuna!

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:45.419
[crying]

00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.423
‐ I think you've
slept long enough.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.424
Let's go.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.792
‐ Huh?

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:53.861
‐ We must find a Kyuyokon root.

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.330
‐ Huh?
‐ On your feet now.

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.100
‐ You would think she could have

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.703
at least let me
enjoy the moment.

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:03.704
Eh?

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:05.405
‐ There. You're safe again.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:06.507
‐ Thank you.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.608
‐ Excuse me!

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.611
What is it
that she's safe from?

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:16.783
‐ A Kyuyokon root.

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:20.621
‐ By the way,
tell Towa once she wakes up

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.122
she's wasting her time

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:26.426
trying to infuse demon power
into a weapon forged by humans.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.596
She should get her hands
on a Kyuyokon root.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.099
‐ A Kyuyokon root?

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:35.169
‐ Yep, that's what she's going
to need if she wants to have

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:38.906
a fighting chance against
the great demon Kirinmaru.

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.407
Remember, only a fool

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.177
goes into battle
without a suitable weapon.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.346
‐ But where must we go
to obtain it?

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.783
‐ I would try asking Bokusen‐Oh.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.585
‐ That old man's right.
I can't let Towa

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:54.454
continue fighting
with a broken weapon like that.

00:05:56.156 --> 00:05:58.091
MOROHA: Not bad,
huh, Mr. Jyubei?

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:02.296
And I brought down a lot more
than these. This is nothin'!

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.298
‐ Hmm.

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:06.433
‐ [giggles]

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:07.467
‐ There you go.

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:09.069
‐ Huh?! Wait! That's all?!

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:11.805
‐ What do you expect?
You bring me small fry,

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.907
you're gonna get
a small‐fry price.

00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:15.242
‐ [groans]

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:18.912
Well, guess it's
better than nothing.

00:06:18.946 --> 00:06:20.747
Oh, yeah. I just remembered.

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:23.517
Do you know the name Bokusen‐Oh?

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.052
‐ Bokusen‐Oh?

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:28.388
I think I might have
heard it somewhere.

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:29.456
Forget where.

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.124
‐ Oh. Uh...

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:35.362
‐ Bring me something better,
all right?

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.199
‐ I honestly would if I could,
but I've made up my mind

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:41.568
to help Setsuna
search for Bokusen‐Oh.

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:43.103
‐ Now you mention it,

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.072
there's a bounty out on a demon

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:47.207
that may know
something about Bokusen‐Oh.

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:49.476
‐ You mean it?!
What demon is that?!

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:52.946
‐ Actually, on second thought,
forget it.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.415
‐ This one's out of your league.
‐ [gasps]

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.086
Whoa, in case you forgot,
I'm Moroha the Demon Killer!

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.054
So just spill it!

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.223
‐ What I heard,
this one's serious trouble.

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:05.092
‐ Huh?
‐ There's no one alive

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.494
that even knows
what it really looks like.

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:10.130
‐ Hmm? And why is that?

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:13.100
‐ Because anyone who looked it
straight in the eye,

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:15.536
that was the last thing
they ever did.

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.104
‐ [gulps]

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:19.206
‐ When we're near the ocean,

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:21.742
we women must always
cover our hair.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:25.279
‐ They say something terrible
will happen to us if we don't.

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:26.647
‐ Huh?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.348
‐ It's true.
‐ [gasps]

00:07:28.382 --> 00:07:31.051
‐ There's a demon known
as the Sea Snake Woman

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:33.120
that lives
in the waters around here.

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:35.622
‐ Sea Snake Woman?

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:36.790
ELDER: She was originally

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:40.727
a benevolent demon spirit
named Watatsumi no Tamahi

00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:42.963
and protected these waters.

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:44.298
She saved many fishermen

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:47.201
thrown into the sea
when their boats capsized,

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:49.336
which happens quite often here.

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.239
But one day,
she suddenly started attacking

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:55.108
the locals, especially women.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:59.847
She seems to have a hatred of
those with long, flowing hair.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.316
‐ Women with
long, flowing hair...

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.053
Oh, no. Setsuna!

00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:07.921
MAN: Bokusen‐Oh?

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:10.057
Nope. Never heard of it.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.458
‐ All right, then.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.759
Thanks for your help.

00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:14.628
‐ MOROHA: Yo, Setsuna!
‐ Huh?

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.762
‐ Hey, good news!

00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:18.999
I think I got us a lead
on this guy we're looking for!

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.069
‐ So you have reason to believe

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:24.238
this demon will know
how to find Bokusen‐Oh?

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:27.174
‐ Yeah, according
to Mr. Jyubei.

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:28.809
I'll catch it, make it talk,

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.078
and earn myself a tidy sum
in the bargain!

00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:33.881
‐ But this demon sounds
like trouble, to say the least.

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:36.083
Not only do we not know
what it looks like,

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:38.285
we won't be able to look at it
when we do.

00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:39.753
‐ Yeah, that's the tricky part.

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:42.689
How am I supposed to kill it
without even looking at it?!

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:44.625
I can't figure it out.

00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:47.427
[woman groans]

00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:48.595
ALL: Huh?

00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:52.966
‐ Hey, you need some help there?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.936
‐ Oh, I'll be all right,
but thank you.

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:57.771
‐ [grunts] No problem.

00:08:57.804 --> 00:08:59.740
[grunts]

00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:01.241
Hoo!

00:09:01.275 --> 00:09:03.343
This stuff is
way too heavy for you.

00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:05.479
I'll take it
to wherever you're going.

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:06.613
Come on, Setsuna.

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:07.881
You grab that one there.

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:08.882
‐ Huh?

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:10.984
‐ It's very kind of you.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.987
[both grunting]

00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:18.992
‐ [ominous music plays]
‐ [chuckles]

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:30.437
MOROHA: How 'bout right here?

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.738
Is this all right?

00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:32.873
‐ Oh, yes.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.209
You have both been so helpful.

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.444
Thank you so very much
for your kindness.

00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:40.180
‐ No problem.
Well, we better get going.

00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:42.749
‐ Please wait! Stay a while.

00:09:42.783 --> 00:09:44.751
‐ Hmm?
‐ Mm?

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:46.086
‐ [gobbling]

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:47.354
‐ [mouth full] Oh, man.

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:50.057
All we did was help carry
a couple of sacks for you.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.026
I wasn't expecting
to get a banquet out of it.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.094
‐ It's nothing.

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:57.197
‐ Setsuna,
you're not gonna eat this?

00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:59.266
‐ I gotta say, though,
it must get kinda rough

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:01.735
living up here on a mountaintop
all alone, huh?

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.071
‐ Why do you live way up here?

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.606
‐ It is part of my training,

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:09.409
and because I love
the view of the sea from here.

00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:13.447
It reminds me of a beautiful
memory from the past.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.249
‐ Well, I envy you that.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:17.784
‐ Me, I haven't got
a single beautiful memory.

[murmurs]

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.622
‐ I can't help but notice,

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:25.192

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:26.760
‐ [gasps]
‐ Hmm?

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.196
KOHAKU: The Sea Snake Woman.

00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:31.098
Yes, I've heard of her before.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.166
‐ So what kind of demon is she?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.403
‐ They say when she sees a woman
with long, beautiful hair,

00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:39.072
she hunts her down
and lays a curse on her.

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:41.041
‐ Do you know
where Setsuna went?!

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.709
‐ No, I'm afraid not.

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:44.545
She left here
without telling me.

00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:47.114
‐ I'm worried.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.315

00:10:48.348 --> 00:10:49.516

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.853
Hey, do you know
where Setsuna went, Kirara?

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.154
‐ [meows]

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:59.126
‐ [groans] One more bite,
and I think I would've exploded.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.128
‐ I think I'm about to.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.630
‐ Such beautiful, long hair.
‐ [gasps]

‐ What is it that you want?

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:28.956
‐ You're kidding me!

00:11:28.989 --> 00:11:32.292
That's the demon who can tell us
about Bokusen‐Oh?!

‐ [gasps] Don't look at her!

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:27.147
‐ Are you really that stupid?

00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:29.449
How many times does she
have to say, "Don't look"?!

00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:32.085
Explain to me how we're
supposed to fight her, then!

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:36.390
‐ I curse all women
with long, beautiful hair!

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:39.993
‐ So what makes you think
Setsuna is in danger?

00:12:40.027 --> 00:12:43.397
‐ I've just got
this really bad feeling.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.801
<i>I can't put Setsuna</i>
<i>in any more danger.</i>

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:51.939
TAKECHIYO: Hey! Did anyone
ask me if I wanted to do this?!

00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:53.941
Oh, why did I eat so much?!

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:55.442
‐ Hang in there, Takechiyo!

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:57.945
‐ And do not look
at the Sea Snake Woman!

00:12:57.978 --> 00:13:00.447
‐ Don't worry!
If I look at anything,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.648
I think I'll throw up!

00:13:01.682 --> 00:13:04.084

SEA SNAKE WOMAN: Stop hiding.

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:07.454
Show yourselves.

00:13:07.487 --> 00:13:09.089
Look at me.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.657
Look into my eyes!

00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:14.595
‐ Yeah, I wouldn't be able
to see you even if I wanted to.

00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:17.898
‐ So what now? We can't do
a thing if we stay behind here.

00:13:17.931 --> 00:13:18.899
‐ Yes, I know!

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:20.834
‐ You may not be humans,

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:22.970
but you are
no different than they are.

00:13:23.003 --> 00:13:26.640
Because you fear me,
you want to kill me, don't you?!

00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:27.908
‐ You're wrong!

00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:29.910
It won't be because we fear you.

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:32.279
We'll stop you
so we can protect the innocent!

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.115
‐ You think
these humans are innocent?

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.050
Don't make me laugh.

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:39.786
I was once the guardian
of this sea.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:45.325
I rescued the local humans from
its waters time and time again,

00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:47.494
even that day...

00:13:47.528 --> 00:13:49.329
[melancholy music playing]

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:51.465
[waves crashing]

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:54.101
The weather
had suddenly turned bad,

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:56.036
and the ocean currents
near the shore

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:58.138
were even rougher than usual.

00:13:58.172 --> 00:14:02.276
There was one fishing boat that
became caught in the currents

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:04.311
and could not
make it back to port.

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:05.145
‐ [screams]

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:08.515
‐ The fisherman
was thrown overboard.

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:10.817
This was the man I loved,

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:13.086
the man I had watched
and longed for

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.589
from the ocean's waters
for years.

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:28.001
Luckily, he survived the ordeal.

00:14:28.902 --> 00:14:30.370
But after a while,

00:14:30.404 --> 00:14:33.607
I longed to see
my fisherman once again,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.946
so I ventured in close to shore
disguised as a sea snake.

00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:41.481
[fishermen conversing]

00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:46.587

‐ Kill it now!

00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:48.956
‐ There it is!
‐ Quickly!

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:50.657
SEA SNAKE WOMAN:
The fishermen believe

00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:54.661
that whenever a sea snake
shows its tail, a boat capsizes,

00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:56.797
so they see it as an bad omen.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.300
They blamed everything
on the sea snake.

00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:05.072
Worst of all,
it was he who put an end to me.

00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:06.106
‐ [gasps]
‐ No.

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:09.476
‐ I had saved his life,
and yet he...

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.145
Unforgivable!

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.656
‐ Yeah, I'd be pissed too.

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:23.657
‐ [gasps]

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.360
‐ And so, ever since that day...

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:43.310
Naturally, that fisherman too.

‐ If you already
had your revenge,

00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:13.173
why do you still come ashore
and attack women with long hair?

00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:15.509
‐ I can never be again

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:17.311
what I was in those days.

00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:20.480
This is how I will look
for all eternity.

00:16:20.514 --> 00:16:22.149
That is why I do it,

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.484
Because I cannot bear
to see women

00:16:24.518 --> 00:16:28.455

long hair that I once had!

no matter what!

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:49.776
