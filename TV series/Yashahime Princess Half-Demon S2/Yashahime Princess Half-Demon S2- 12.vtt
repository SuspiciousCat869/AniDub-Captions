to promise me one thing.

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:38.951
It's very important
that you don't use your powers

So what happened out there?

I'm really sorry.

didn't start the fight.

your full strength, right?

I was never lonely!

00:10:18.837 --> 00:10:21.208
BOTH: Happy,
happy birthday, Towa!

00:10:21.242 --> 00:10:22.678
‐ Hmm?

00:10:22.712 --> 00:10:25.016
What's a birthday?

00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:27.320
‐ That's the day
when you were born.

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:28.857
‐ We don't know
your real birthday,

00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:31.930
so we decided to make it
the day that we met you.

00:10:31.963 --> 00:10:34.636
Go on. You're supposed
to blow out the candles.

00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:35.905
‐ [sighs]

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:36.907
'Kay!

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.744
[inhales]

00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:43.452
Huh?

00:10:43.486 --> 00:10:45.123
BOTH: Uh...

00:10:45.156 --> 00:10:47.060
[laughing]

00:10:47.093 --> 00:10:49.298
‐ She blew out the candles,
all right!

00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:51.536
‐ She's got
amazing lung capacity!

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.607
She might become
an athlete someday!

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.476
SOTA: Boy, are we a mess.

00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:57.180
‐ [laughing]
‐ Sweetie, can you grab a towel?

00:10:58.416 --> 00:10:59.519
[laughing]

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:01.388
SOTA: Oh, if you
could only see yourself.

00:11:01.422 --> 00:11:03.326
[laughing]

00:11:05.029 --> 00:11:07.400
[boy screams]

00:11:08.904 --> 00:11:11.475
‐ [gasps]
‐ Higurashi!

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.246
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.916
[gasping]

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:15.784
Whoa!

00:11:15.818 --> 00:11:16.987
‐ [sighs]
‐ [screaming]

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.491
Huh? [yelps]

00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:22.264
‐ You'll never hit me
with that punch.

00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:25.470
GIRL: Wanna come over
to my house tomorrow?

00:11:25.504 --> 00:11:26.673
‐ Sure!
‐ Oh, great!

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:28.911
I really wanna show you this‐‐
[gasps]

00:11:28.944 --> 00:11:31.115
Look! Look over there.
It's Higurashi.

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:33.720
‐ She's so cool.
I wish I could be like her.

00:11:33.754 --> 00:11:35.991
‐ I like how she's
not part of any group.

00:11:36.025 --> 00:11:38.530
‐ I know, right?
She's like a lone wolf.

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.634
GIRL 3: Don't leave me, Sis!

00:11:40.668 --> 00:11:41.937
‐ [gasps] Setsuna?

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.007
‐ Come on. Hurry up, then!

00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:45.443
[both laugh]

00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:46.513
‐ Slowpoke!

00:11:46.546 --> 00:11:49.017
[both laugh]

00:11:53.594 --> 00:11:55.664
‐ I'm going this way, okay?

00:11:55.698 --> 00:11:57.234
‐ [chuckles]

00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:59.939
‐ Bye, Towa! See you!

00:11:59.973 --> 00:12:01.743
‐ You have fun now, okay?

00:12:06.385 --> 00:12:08.189
Yours was a makeshift family

00:12:08.222 --> 00:12:10.594
who smiled at you
out of pity, that's all,

00:12:10.628 --> 00:12:14.636
a well‐meaning, but typically
useless form of human behavior.

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:17.742
It must have made you
feel quite lonely, Towa.

00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:19.879
‐ You're wrong!
I never felt loneliness!

00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:22.050
And their smiles were genuine!

00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:32.003
‐ What's this? You even
crossed swords with Setsuna?

00:12:32.037 --> 00:12:35.176
And after you tried so hard
to find her too.

00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:36.211
‐ That was‐‐

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:37.447
[energy pulses]

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.817
No, that was‐‐

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:39.953
that was only...

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:42.157
because of a Hitokon's power.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:42.992
‐ Just admit it.

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:44.963
There's no place
for you anywhere.

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:47.768
‐ Stop talking. Just stop.

00:12:47.802 --> 00:12:50.340
‐ Even your own sister
forgot you existed.

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:53.045
‐ Knowing she was alive
was more than enough.

00:12:53.079 --> 00:12:56.753
‐ All those years,
you were so worried about her.

00:12:56.786 --> 00:12:59.859
‐ Stop it. One more word,
and I swear...

00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:03.366
‐ But in the end, you meant
nothing to your sister.

00:13:06.606 --> 00:13:08.042
‐ That's right.

00:13:08.075 --> 00:13:11.315
Setsuna didn't remember me...

00:13:11.348 --> 00:13:13.085
or care about me.

00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:18.830
[yells]

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:26.445
You'll pay for this.

00:13:26.478 --> 00:13:28.382
‐ Delicious. Delicious!

00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:32.357
Such exquisite sorrow!
Such delectable suffering!

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.764
‐ Bring out your hatred!
Let it flow, Towa!

00:13:35.798 --> 00:13:37.768
‐ I'll never forgive you.

00:13:37.802 --> 00:13:41.175
You'll pay for this,
both of you!

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:42.745
I'll kill you!

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:44.816
‐ [laughs]

00:13:44.849 --> 00:13:46.385
RIKU: This is too cruel, Madam,

00:13:46.418 --> 00:13:47.888
‐ even for you!
‐ [gasps]

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:55.303
‐ Sorry we're late.
Are you all right?

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:58.610
‐ I beg you, Aunt Zero,
stop all of this.

00:13:58.643 --> 00:14:00.914
‐ Riku. Rion.

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:20.286
[tense music playing]

00:14:20.319 --> 00:14:24.027
<i>‐ Lord Sesshomaru is flying</i>
<i>unusually fast today.</i>

00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:26.733
<i>Does this mean</i>
<i>he's trying to grant</i>

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:29.672
<i>Rin's dying wish</i>

00:14:29.706 --> 00:14:32.077
OGRE: Hey,
did you hear the news?

00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:34.782
There's a bunch of demon slayers

00:14:34.816 --> 00:14:36.452
traveling along
the northern road.

00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:39.559
‐ And that's not all. I heard
that one of those demon slayers

00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:41.763
is Sesshomaru's
half‐demon daughter.

00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:43.065
‐ Is that a fact?

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:46.105
If we could knock her off,
we'd make ourselves famous.

00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:48.209
‐ On the northern road, huh?

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.315
[Jaken yelps] Whoa!

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:54.087
<i>No, I guess he hasn't</i>
<i>given up on Rin after all!</i>

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:56.760
He must be going to get help

Oh, no!

‐ Man, I'm exhausted.
‐ [Jaken yelling]

00:15:07.113 --> 00:15:09.886

for a hot bath right now.

What the hell was that?

00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:19.204
‐ What just happened back there?

00:15:19.237 --> 00:15:20.440
‐ JAKEN: Hmm.
‐ [both gasp]

00:15:20.473 --> 00:15:22.978
‐ Jaken, you little demon,
that was you?

00:15:23.012 --> 00:15:24.749
You trying to kill us, or what?!

00:15:24.782 --> 00:15:27.721
‐ Huh? Oh, it's you,
Inuyasha's daughter.

00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:28.924
[gasps] Wait.

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:31.195
Why aren't Setsuna and Towa
with you right now?!

00:15:31.228 --> 00:15:34.301
‐ Hey, it's not like we're glued
together at the hip, you know.

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:35.804
‐ Yeah, that's right.
‐ [grunts]

00:15:35.838 --> 00:15:39.444
I need Setsuna's
Yukari no Tachikiri, and fast!

00:15:39.478 --> 00:15:40.313
Where is Setsuna?!

00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:42.751

more worked up than usual.

00:15:42.785 --> 00:15:43.954
What's going on here?

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:45.924
‐ It's Rin, in the‐‐

00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.193
the Tree of Ages!

00:15:47.227 --> 00:15:50.601
‐ Towa and Setsuna's mom?
What about her?

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:53.907
NANASUKE: What's taking
Setsuna and Hisui so long?

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.644
‐ Ahh. Not bad.

00:15:55.677 --> 00:15:57.080
‐ Don't let your guard down.

00:15:57.113 --> 00:15:59.852
I've heard rumors that demons
can show up in these parts.

00:15:59.886 --> 00:16:01.321
‐ OGRE: You heard right!
‐ Hmm?

00:16:01.355 --> 00:16:04.529
‐ And none of you is
getting off this road alive!

00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:07.500
‐ Now then, which one of you
is Sesshomaru's daughter?

00:16:07.535 --> 00:16:10.674
'Cause I want to make sure
I'm the one to destroy her!

ROKUTA: Where did
all these guys come from?!

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:23.667

completely surrounded.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.704
‐ Hiraikotsu!

00:16:25.737 --> 00:16:28.375

Your timing was perfect.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.299

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.538
‐ [chuckles] Of course
there's a lot of us.

00:16:42.571 --> 00:16:43.607
There's always a lot of us!

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.078
That's why we're called
swarming green ogres!

00:16:46.111 --> 00:16:48.583
‐ You with the long hair,
Sesshomaru's daughter,

00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:49.952
did you know that killing you

00:16:49.986 --> 00:16:51.823
will make
the Green Ogre Bunch famous?

00:16:51.856 --> 00:16:53.492

00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:57.535

‐ Ah, Kohaku.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.574
‐ It's been a while, sir.

00:17:00.607 --> 00:17:03.914
I assume something must have
happened to bring you here?

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:05.817
‐ So, Setsuna...
‐ [gasps]

00:17:05.851 --> 00:17:08.422
‐ have you mastered
its powers yet?

00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:09.424

00:17:10.861 --> 00:17:12.430
[gasps]

00:17:12.463 --> 00:17:14.969
Well, I did sever
one thread of fate.

00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:17.040
‐ Go to the Tree of Ages, then.

00:17:17.073 --> 00:17:18.977
Towa, she is crying.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.112
‐ [gasps]

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:22.417
Very well.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.389
All right, Chief,
Hisui, you got this?

00:17:25.423 --> 00:17:26.124
‐ We've got it.

00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:27.695
‐ Yeah, go on, Setsuna!

00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:29.431

‐ Well, sir, shall we...

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:33.640
deal with the rest of them?
[gasps]

00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:37.715
‐ Bakusaiga!

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:41.956
‐ Go! Quickly!

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.762
ZERO: I'm surprised
you were able to find us.

00:17:44.795 --> 00:17:47.166
‐ [earring chimes]
‐ It was the smell of lavender.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.339
We followed the delightful scent
of Lady Towa's hand cream.

00:17:50.373 --> 00:17:53.345
‐ Stop this, Aunt Zero!
It's not right!

00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:55.951

a little too late.

[both gasp]

00:17:57.086 --> 00:17:58.523

00:17:58.556 --> 00:18:00.226
You think
I'm just going to let you

00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:02.063
toy with my feelings this way?!

00:18:02.096 --> 00:18:03.165
‐ Lady Towa!

00:18:03.198 --> 00:18:04.769

What has she done to you,
my poor eternity bug?

00:18:30.353 --> 00:18:31.221
Agh!

00:18:31.254 --> 00:18:33.827
‐ Exactly what I'm
going to do to you!

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.831
‐ [whimpers]

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:37.735
‐ [yells]

00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:40.707
‐ [screams]

00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.210
[both gasp]

00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:43.546
‐ I've finally found the means

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.853
<i>of assuring my survival</i>
<i>to the very end.</i>

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:48.155
‐ Did she mean...

00:18:48.188 --> 00:18:50.059
Lady Towa, don't do it!

00:18:50.092 --> 00:18:52.765
‐ Go on. Let your anger out.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:53.900
Strike at me

00:18:53.933 --> 00:18:58.510
and be tormented by your sins
for the rest of your life!

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:08.228
‐ Tree of Ages, let me in.

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:16.211
[footsteps splashing]

00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:20.453
[gasps]

00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:29.471
The curse
has progressed this far?

00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:30.707
[gasps]

00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:32.343
Please forgive me.

00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:35.249
‐ RIN: Setsuna...
‐ [gasps]

00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:37.721
‐ I heard the music...

00:19:37.755 --> 00:19:39.324
that you played for me.

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:43.465
I watched you grow
through your dreams.

00:19:43.499 --> 00:19:45.002
‐ Mother!

00:19:45.036 --> 00:19:46.973
‐ Thank you for‐‐

00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:48.877
for coming.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:49.945
I'm glad...

00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:51.916
I could see you once more.

00:19:51.949 --> 00:19:53.285
‐ I won't let you die!

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:56.191
I'll save you
with the Yukari no Tachikiri!

00:19:57.093 --> 00:19:58.295
‐ No, it's...

00:19:58.328 --> 00:20:00.232
Towa that you must save.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.370
‐ Save Towa?

00:20:02.403 --> 00:20:06.211
What did my father mean
when he told me Towa was crying?

00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:08.783
‐ My only wish...

00:20:08.817 --> 00:20:10.821
my last wish...

00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:13.827
was to hold you both in my arms.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.962
‐ [gasps]

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.001
I understand.

00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:19.471
Yukari no Tachikiri,

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:21.809
show me the thread of fate
that binds them!

00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:23.378
[blade pulses]

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:30.259
[thread chiming]

00:20:30.292 --> 00:20:32.698
[threads chiming]

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:41.883
<i>I found it!</i>

00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:43.720
[yells]

00:20:43.753 --> 00:20:45.322
‐ No, don't!
‐ [gasps]

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.397
‐ Even if you sever that thread,

00:20:49.431 --> 00:20:51.769
the silver‐scale curse
won't be lifted.

00:20:51.803 --> 00:20:52.671
‐ What?!

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:55.644
‐ The curse
embodies Lady Zero's regrets.

00:20:55.677 --> 00:20:59.718
Unless you lift these regrets
from her, you cannot save her!

00:20:59.752 --> 00:21:01.188
‐ But she's your enemy!

00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:03.258
Why would you care
what happens to her?!

00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:07.166
‐ Setsuna,
save Towa and Lady Zero.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.070
‐ Save both of them? How?

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:10.707
‐ Setsuna...

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.578
deliver this to Towa.

00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:15.382
‐ But that's a...

00:21:17.053 --> 00:21:18.021
‐ Kirara!

00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:19.124
‐ [growls]

00:21:19.157 --> 00:21:22.096
‐ Quickly now!
Follow that thread to Towa!

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.499
[blade chimes]

00:21:24.668 --> 00:21:26.839
‐ [snarls]

00:21:26.873 --> 00:21:30.179
‐ How dare you go poking around
in my memories?

00:21:30.212 --> 00:21:31.716
I'll kill you for that!

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.920
[yells]

00:21:36.057 --> 00:21:38.028
‐ You mustn't, Lady Towa!

00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:40.266
‐ Out of the way right now!

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:41.903
‐ Listen! As hateful as she is,

00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:45.042
the Madam is still connected to
your mother by a thread of fate!

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:47.681
If you kill her,
you'll kill your mother!

00:21:47.714 --> 00:21:48.650
‐ I don't care!

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:50.587
‐ Lady Towa,
you don't mean that!

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.056
‐ [laughs]
‐ Get out of my way!

00:21:52.089 --> 00:21:56.532
‐ The time has come for me
to reabsorb the Rainbow Pearls.

00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:01.374
‐ [gasps]

00:22:01.408 --> 00:22:05.884
‐ Towa, I,
the great demon Zero...

00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:08.422
will now send you to hell.

00:22:11.796 --> 00:22:13.900
[singing in Japanese]

00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:42.978
[music playing]

00:23:43.011 --> 00:23:45.684
SETSUNA: <i>I must use</i>
<i>the Yukari no Tachikiri</i>

00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:47.554
to sever the thread of fate.

00:23:48.455 --> 00:23:49.858
But I've learned that even that

00:23:49.892 --> 00:23:53.498
<i>will not be enough</i>
<i>to save my mother or Towa</i>

00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:56.071
<i>or Zero, for that matter.</i>

00:23:57.608 --> 00:24:01.181
<i>Next time on</i> Yashahime:
<i>"Zero's Wish."</i>

00:24:02.985 --> 00:24:04.187
<i>These memories.</i>

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.790
<i>I understand now...</i>

00:24:05.824 --> 00:24:08.730
<i>you only wanted</i>
<i>to protect them.</i>
