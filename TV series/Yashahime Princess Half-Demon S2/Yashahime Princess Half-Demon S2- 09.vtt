00:10:29.258 --> 00:10:31.730
‐ Not by me, it won't.

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:35.604
So if it's my head you're after,
please feel free to take it.

00:10:35.638 --> 00:10:37.407
‐ Why are you
attacking the village?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.512
‐ I wish I knew why.

00:10:39.546 --> 00:10:41.716
I bear it no grudge
that I know of.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.223
Yet, for some reason,
I can't bring myself to leave.

00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:47.227
‐ Is that what you're after?

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.868
‐ No. The divine treasure
is of no importance,

00:10:50.901 --> 00:10:53.406
though it did
originally belong to me.

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:54.742
‐ It belonged to you?

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:58.550
Then the local deity, Mahiruma,
that once lived here...

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:00.788
‐ Yes, that was me.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.428
‐ Seems we weren't told
the whole story.

00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:06.465
‐ Would you care to hear it?

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:07.802
[rifle fires]

00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:22.464
‐ [energy surges]
‐ Hmph.

00:11:22.497 --> 00:11:24.401
‐ We dealt
with your Flame Bulls!

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.873
‐ Now we'll deal with you,
Mayonaka!

00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:29.478
‐ Stop! Kuzu! Yamata!

00:11:29.512 --> 00:11:33.185
Lord Mayonaka is not the evil
demon god we were told he was!

00:11:33.219 --> 00:11:36.593
‐ Goro, do not be taken in
by that girl's lies!

00:11:36.626 --> 00:11:38.496
‐ I knew we shouldn't
have trusted her!

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.001
‐ No! I'm the one
who betrayed you!

00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:42.738
The girl had nothing
to do with it!

00:11:42.772 --> 00:11:44.609
‐ VILLAGER: It's Mayonaka!
‐ [gasps]

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:46.178
‐ He made it into the village!

00:11:46.212 --> 00:11:47.748
‐ We're doomed, all of us!

00:11:47.782 --> 00:11:49.852
‐ It's all right, people!
Don't panic!

00:11:49.886 --> 00:11:52.257
The shaman
will drive the demon away!

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.527
‐ [grunts]

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.629
‐ This bickering.

00:11:54.662 --> 00:11:55.698
I'll hear no more!

00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:57.702
[villager yelp]

00:11:57.735 --> 00:11:59.839
[muffled murmuring]

00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:03.513
HISUI: Setsuna!

00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:04.749
‐ Hisui! Chief!

00:12:04.782 --> 00:12:06.051
Don't worry! I'm fine!

00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:08.356
Just leave us alone
for a moment!

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:10.026
‐ You sure?
‐ All right!

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:11.963
We'll go help
extinguish the fires!

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:13.533
I'll let you deal with him!

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:14.602
‐ But, Uncle.

00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:16.740
‐ It's okay.
Let's have faith in her.

00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:20.046
‐ These people had better
be unharmed, Mayonaka.

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:23.452
‐ Once they dry out, they will
be just as they were before.

00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:26.025
‐ Good. Now tell me your story.

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:29.464
‐ Humans, demons,
I trust neither one,

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:33.573
but a half‐demon like you
might understand how I feel.

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:36.613
Today they call me
a demon god,

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:39.051
but I am neither demon nor god.

00:12:39.084 --> 00:12:41.890
You and I, we both live
between two worlds,

00:12:41.923 --> 00:12:44.494
so you'll forgive
my long‐windedness.

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:48.369
The villagers who originally
lived in this place

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:49.839
were all good people.

00:12:49.872 --> 00:12:53.479
Over time,
I grew to be very fond of them,

00:12:53.513 --> 00:12:54.849
and so I blessed them

00:12:54.882 --> 00:12:57.320
with fertile fields
and abundant crops.

00:12:57.354 --> 00:13:00.661
Then one day,
a certain man and his daughter

00:13:00.694 --> 00:13:01.863
came to the village.

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:03.767
The man served the local daimyo,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.307
and his job was to collect taxes
from the locals.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.679
Before I knew it, he had
become the village headman

00:13:09.712 --> 00:13:12.785
and had taken control
of the villagers' lives.

00:13:12.818 --> 00:13:15.390
After a while, the daughter
of this village headman

00:13:15.423 --> 00:13:19.464
started visiting my shrine,
coming every day.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.068
<i>‐ Lord Mahiruma,</i>

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:23.172
please make our lives better.

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:24.976
<i>I beg you.</i>

00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:28.449
‐ Your lives are prosperous
enough already, I should think.

00:13:28.482 --> 00:13:31.322
<i>‐ No! There are still</i>
<i>people in the village</i>

00:13:31.355 --> 00:13:32.490
<i>without enough to eat.</i>

00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:34.662
<i>Please, sir.</i>

00:13:34.696 --> 00:13:36.298
‐ Touched by her plea,

00:13:36.332 --> 00:13:40.473
I lent her my divine treasure,
the Blessing of the Five Grains.

00:13:40.507 --> 00:13:43.814
But her father,
the village headman, was greedy,

00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:47.220
He seized it
and kept it hidden away.

00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:51.228
I had been deceived
by the young woman.

00:13:51.261 --> 00:13:52.865
[birds chirping]

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.936
‐ I took the form of a human

00:13:54.969 --> 00:13:57.775
and appeared before her
in that guise.

00:13:57.808 --> 00:14:01.015
‐ [gasps] <i>You're Lord Mahiruma,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:03.920
‐ Young woman, you must return
<i>the divine treasure.</i>

00:14:03.954 --> 00:14:06.191
<i>Without it, the local deity</i>

00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:09.197
<i>will soon be unable</i>
<i>to protect these lands.</i>

00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:10.466
<i>‐ I understand.</i>

00:14:12.705 --> 00:14:15.076
‐ The young woman
returned shortly,

00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:18.917
but she failed to bring me back
the Blessing of the Five Grains.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.119
<i>‐ Please forgive me.</i>

00:14:20.153 --> 00:14:21.790
<i>My father has hidden it!</i>

00:14:21.823 --> 00:14:23.527
<i>I can't find it anywhere!</i>

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.796
<i>‐ If it's not returned,</i>

00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:26.566
<i>who knows</i>
<i>what sort of calamities</i>

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:27.868
<i>might befall the village?</i>

00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:30.139
<i>‐ I will look again</i>
<i>and find it! I promise!</i>

00:14:30.173 --> 00:14:34.381
‐ Many times, she went away
and came back again,

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:35.918
until finally...

00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:39.458
‐ Lord Mahiruma, I am
going to leave this village!

00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:40.661
<i>Please come away with me!</i>

00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:43.265
‐ I was swayed by her words.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.704
After all,
without my divine treasure,

00:14:45.738 --> 00:14:47.942
my existence had no purpose.

00:14:47.975 --> 00:14:51.883
So I decided to abandon
everything and go with her.

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:54.454
[music playing]

00:14:57.193 --> 00:15:01.569
But on the day we were to leave,
she never showed up.

00:15:02.838 --> 00:15:06.378
I set off on a long
and wandering journey.

00:15:06.412 --> 00:15:09.786
Several decades later,
when I returned to this land,

00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:13.159
the once‐impoverished village
had flourished.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.533
It was now known
as Gokoku Village

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:18.737
and was very prosperous.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.139
[sighs]

00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:22.076
I learned that the young woman
who deceived me

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.947
was no longer of this world,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.853
so I will never know
why she tried to seduce me

00:15:26.886 --> 00:15:29.559
and lure me away
from this village

00:15:29.592 --> 00:15:31.261
when she wasn't in love with me.

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:34.367
[wails]

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:38.877
‐ [bellows]
‐ [screams]

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.313
<i>‐ A Flame Bull!</i>

00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:41.549
‐ Help!
‐ [villagers screaming]

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:44.020
‐ Fools! You have squandered

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:46.158
<i>centuries' worth</i>
<i>of blessed power</i>

00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:49.064
<i>in only a handful of years!</i>

00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:53.272
Just a few years more,
and this land will wither away!

00:15:57.147 --> 00:16:00.319
I just want to know
who or what I am.

00:16:00.353 --> 00:16:04.896
Until I do, I have no choice but
to linger on here in this world.

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:06.165
‐ [blade pulses]
‐ [chime rings]

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:10.607
<i>‐ The Yukari no Tachikiri</i>
<i>is sensing something.</i>

00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:13.379
Tell me,
this demon slayer, Goro,

00:16:13.412 --> 00:16:14.649
what is he to you?

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:16.753
‐ My son, apparently,

00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:19.257
born of that young woman
after I'd gone.

00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:22.665
‐ Then you're the half‐god child
of a deity and a human.

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:26.004
‐ My mother told me
she went to join you that day,

00:16:26.038 --> 00:16:28.108
but you had already gone.

00:16:28.142 --> 00:16:30.479
When I turned five, she died,

00:16:30.514 --> 00:16:33.385
begging your forgiveness
with her last breath.

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:34.589
‐ Pathetic.

00:16:34.622 --> 00:16:35.724
SETSUNA: Is it?

00:16:35.757 --> 00:16:39.732
Why does your heart still
keep you from moving on, then?

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:41.536
‐ I wonder that myself.

00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:43.072
Perhaps it's because my fate

00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:45.944
is still tied to
the Blessing of the Five Grains.

00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:47.681
‐ [blade pulsing]
‐ [chimes ringing]

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.217
<i>‐ The Yukari no Tachikiri,</i>

00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:52.190
<i>can I use it to sever</i>
<i>Mayonaka's threads of fate?</i>

00:16:52.223 --> 00:16:53.292
[sighs]

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:56.198
What happens if we return
your divine treasure to you?

00:16:56.231 --> 00:16:57.367
‐ [villagers protesting]
‐ At this point,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.306
even if I were to reclaim it,
it's too late.

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:02.377
I could never be
a local deity again.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.884
And revenge on this village
is not what I seek.

00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:08.790
This place is already doomed,
in any case.

00:17:08.823 --> 00:17:10.092
‐ [muffled grunting]
‐ SETSUNA: Doomed?

00:17:10.126 --> 00:17:11.763
‐ The result of these people

00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:13.967
keeping their harvest
for themselves

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.236
while their neighbors
in villages

00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:16.773
less than eight kilometers
from here

00:17:16.806 --> 00:17:19.177
have been suffering
from starvation.

00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:21.783
Come spring, these fields
will be as barren as the others,

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:25.991
because crops cannot grow on
a land sapped of its vitality,

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:27.193
‐ No!
‐ We'll starve!

00:17:27.227 --> 00:17:28.964
‐ You can save us, can't you?

00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:30.032
‐ Lord Mayonaka!
‐ We beg you!

00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:31.168
‐ It's too late for that.

00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:33.172
I can do nothing.

00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:36.980
‐ Tell me again, why did
you attack this village

00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:38.683
when you knew
it would wither away?

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:41.789
If you already have
all the answers you seek,

00:17:41.823 --> 00:17:43.660
what still binds you here?

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:48.737

00:17:59.959 --> 00:18:02.163
Am I supposed to sever this?

00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:06.973
<i>No, not to sever it,</i>

Where am I?

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.099
‐ Lord Mahiruma.

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.170
I know that, as a mere human,

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:24.040
I have no right
to say this to you,

00:18:24.074 --> 00:18:26.478
but I must!

00:18:26.512 --> 00:18:30.621
I am in love with you,
Lord Mahiruma.

00:18:30.654 --> 00:18:32.958
I'm sorry, truly sorry.

00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:34.027
‐ It's all right.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.365
It's all right, Oharu.

00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:02.751

MAYONAKA:
Can you do it, half‐demon?

00:19:17.213 --> 00:19:18.583

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.431
‐ Yukari no Tachikiri!

00:19:34.915 --> 00:19:35.817
‐ [gasps]

00:19:37.554 --> 00:19:39.424
[thread chimes]

00:19:41.662 --> 00:19:42.865
‐ What's this?

00:19:42.898 --> 00:19:44.467
‐ [grunts]

00:19:44.502 --> 00:19:45.804
No!

00:19:45.837 --> 00:19:46.939
‐ [gasps]
‐ [wood clatters]

00:19:46.973 --> 00:19:48.242
GORO: The shrine!

00:19:57.895 --> 00:19:58.963
No way.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.567
It's my mother!

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.105
SETSUNA: So she was
being used as a human vessel

00:20:03.138 --> 00:20:05.309
<i>for the Blessing</i>
<i>of the Five Grains.</i>

00:20:05.342 --> 00:20:07.046
‐ Oharu, my daughter.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.550
‐ [gasps]

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.554
[wind blowing]

00:20:10.587 --> 00:20:12.256
[music playing]

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:35.704
‐ Lord Mahiruma...
‐ [gasps]

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:36.906
<i>I've done it.</i>

00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:40.914
I have retrieved the Blessing
of the Five Grains for you.

00:20:40.947 --> 00:20:42.918
‐ [crying]

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.222
Now I understand.

00:20:45.256 --> 00:20:47.561
You were right here
this whole time.

00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:48.530
‐ [gasps]

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:50.834
‐ I've been waiting for you,
<i>Lord Mahiruma.</i>

00:20:50.867 --> 00:20:51.969
‐ Yes.

00:20:52.003 --> 00:20:54.842
I've been waiting, too, Oharu.

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:55.777
‐ [sighs]

00:21:00.486 --> 00:21:02.423
‐ Did I do the right thing?

00:21:02.457 --> 00:21:05.496
‐ My Ma loved my Pa
up until the very end,

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.168
and now at long last,
they're finally together!

00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:09.872
That's all that matters.

00:21:09.905 --> 00:21:13.245
When it comes to love,
there is no right or wrong.

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:17.988
KUZU: Gokoku Village is back
to being impoverished again,

00:21:18.021 --> 00:21:20.459
so naturally
we didn't get paid

00:21:20.493 --> 00:21:22.564
or even thanked,
come to think of it.

00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:25.369
YAMATA: Great. We came
all this way for nothing.

00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:28.776
Why did we ever agree to come
to such a remote area, anyway?

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.680
‐ Everyone, I'm sorry.

00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:34.320
I know I acted selfishly
and it's cost you all a lot.

00:21:34.354 --> 00:21:36.559
‐ Oh, no need to apologize,
really.

00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:38.530
‐ Yeah, Setsuna. Don't worry.

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:40.634
‐ Yeah, we didn't slay
the demon god,

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:43.606
but at least we did slay
something truly terrifying.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.677
‐ What's so truly terrifying?

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:46.879
[both chuckle]

00:21:46.913 --> 00:21:48.817
‐ Go on and tell 'em, Kohaku.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.152
‐ [clears throat]

00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:52.691
Something we call human greed.

00:21:52.724 --> 00:21:53.626
‐ Oh, I see.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.164
‐ Kohaku, you raised
good demon slayers,

00:21:56.198 --> 00:21:57.601
‐ I mean it.
‐ Thank you.

00:21:57.634 --> 00:22:00.707
KUZU: Let's go demon‐slaying
again sometime, Setsuna.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.511
‐ [chuckles]

00:22:02.544 --> 00:22:05.416
‐ [blade pulses]
‐ [chime rings]

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.688
<i>What's this feeling?</i>

00:22:11.829 --> 00:22:13.933
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:43.445
[music playing]

00:23:43.478 --> 00:23:46.117
MOROHA: <i>Okay,</i>
<i>time to kick some butt!</i>

00:23:46.151 --> 00:23:47.320
<i>Whoa, hold on.</i>

00:23:47.353 --> 00:23:49.190
<i>No way!</i>
<i>Mom and Dad were the ones</i>

00:23:49.223 --> 00:23:52.330
<i>who fought and sealed away</i>
<i>the Full Moon Raccoon Dog?</i>

00:23:52.363 --> 00:23:54.267
<i>In that case, Takechiyo,</i>

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.406
<i>leave this whole Mamidaira</i>
<i>family feud to yours truly!</i>

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.610
<i>I'll handle it!</i>

00:23:59.945 --> 00:24:01.181
Next time on Yashahime:

00:24:01.214 --> 00:24:03.886
<i>"Battle on the New Moon,</i>
<i>Part 1."</i>

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.692
<i>Wait. You mean</i>
<i>there's a Part 2?</i>
