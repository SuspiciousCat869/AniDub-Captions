to human abilities,

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:14.095

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:30.628
- I can only kill
the ones I love, Lady Towa.

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:34.335
And I would rather
you died by my hand than his.

00:00:35.605 --> 00:00:37.408
- Riku.

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:39.078

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:35.758
- What a shame.

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:39.465
I guess this means I won't be
the one to make you happy...

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.102
my Rion.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.352

the happiest of my life.

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:57.802

remember the day...

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:06.553
when you told me
that I was my own person?

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.291
When I heard those words...

00:02:09.325 --> 00:02:11.329
for the first time in my life,

00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:14.335
I felt thankful
for having lived so long.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:16.039
- Riku.

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:17.742

to have been able to save
your life at the very end.

00:02:23.453 --> 00:02:24.255
Lady Towa...

00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:27.461
you have to survive,

00:02:27.494 --> 00:02:30.768
if only to prove
that I once existed.

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:33.173
- I will.

00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:36.880
- You must see to it
that you save Miss Rion.

00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:39.085
And there is one thing
you should know.

00:02:39.118 --> 00:02:42.157

- [crying]

00:02:51.142 --> 00:02:54.883

Riku told me something...

I'm anything like a human?!

I cannot begin to imagine.

00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:21.362

Are you saying this is

00:09:30.674 --> 00:09:32.210

If I had only been stronger,

I didn't want to acknowledge
the painful truth

that I myself was to blame
for my daughter's death.

00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:47.194

being held back by her loss.

Now there's a worthy opponent.
