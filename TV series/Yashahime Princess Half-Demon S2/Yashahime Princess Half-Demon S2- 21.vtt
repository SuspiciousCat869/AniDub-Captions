she could again.

Setsuna and I

go to bed then too.

You want to use it

to suppress Kirinmaru's
demon powers, I suppose.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.458

00:10:42.276 --> 00:10:44.378
[sentimental music playing]

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.981
- Papa Sota...

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:50.150
thank you.

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:58.926
- I'm so happy
you found Setsuna. I am.

00:10:58.959 --> 00:10:59.960
- [grunts]

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:00.994
[chuckles]

00:11:01.028 --> 00:11:02.930
I wouldn't have
been able to find her

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:04.097
without your help.

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:07.401
- I'm glad, really.

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:18.946
These 10 years
we've spent with you

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:22.082
have brought us more joy
than you'll ever know.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.384
Now get going. Go on.

00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:25.419
- Right!

00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:27.020
I'm off!

00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:29.289
Setsuna! Moroha!

00:11:29.323 --> 00:11:30.090
- Yeah!

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:31.458
- Ready when you are!

00:11:33.327 --> 00:11:35.095
MEI: Bye-bye!

00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:37.030
And seriously, I'm not crying!

00:11:37.064 --> 00:11:40.100
Don't worry, 'cause I'm
gonna be strong from now on!

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.035
- Take care of yourselves.

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:45.005
- Fare you well,
my beloved great-grandchildren!

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.707
- [meows]

00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:57.451
- I'm sure we'll see them again.

00:11:57.484 --> 00:11:59.486
- Yes, dear, we will.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.097
- We made it!

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.598
- But what's going on here?!

00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:12.666
[demons growling]

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:13.834
MOROHA: The Grim Comet!

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:16.403
And it's spewing out
tons of demons!

00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:17.771
- I just don't get it.

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:20.474
What is it
Mr. Kirin's trying to do?

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.546
- It's the Grim Comet
that will grant us our wish.

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.980
- RIKU: Miss Rion!
- Hmm?

00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:30.083
- It's you!

00:12:30.117 --> 00:12:31.618
You're Kirinmaru's right arm!

00:12:31.652 --> 00:12:33.120
- Why, if it isn't Riku.

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:34.288
It's been a while.

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:35.522
- Don't trust him, Miss Rion!

00:12:35.556 --> 00:12:36.924
Don't listen to him!

00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:39.793
- Sorry you feel that way,
because all I want to do

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.296
is to help make Rion's wishes
come true.

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:44.298
- And what wishes
would those be?

00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:47.201
- Blooming flowers,
green fields,

00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:50.270
chirping birds,
animals running free,

00:12:50.304 --> 00:12:52.239
a world in which
all creatures on Earth

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.474
live together
in peace and harmony.

00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:55.375
- That's not it!

00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:57.511
I know what it is
Miss Rion wishes for--

00:12:57.544 --> 00:12:58.712
- RION: Riku!
- [gasps]

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:01.481
- I no longer have need of you.

00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:02.950
RIKU: You don't mean that!

00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:05.786
- Now then, Rion,
take the Kyuyokon fruit

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:07.921
and hold it up
towards the Grim Comet.

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.489
- All right.
- [Riku gasps]

00:13:09.523 --> 00:13:11.458
[tense music playing]

00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:29.142
[heart beats]

00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:38.051
That thing, what is it?

00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:41.054
- A life being born anew.

00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:43.590
- [heart beating]
- KIRIN: The Grim Butterfly.

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:46.593
[dramatic music playing]

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:04.645
- [warbles]

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:13.854
- So all this time, that's
what was inside the Grim Comet?

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:17.157
- Behold!
A new king has been born today!

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:24.631
Rion, I remember
how you adored the sky

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:26.900
and longed to fly like a bird.

00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:28.268
You can finally bid farewell

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:30.737
to that body made
out of bones and grave soil,

00:14:30.771 --> 00:14:33.173
for now you are completely free!

00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:35.108
From this moment
and for all time,

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:37.411
you can watch over
this precious world.

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:39.580
And by being linked
to the Grim Butterfly,

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:43.250
I will never die,
even if Kirinmaru does.

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:44.785
Riku...

00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:46.920
come link your fate
to the Grim Butterfly,

00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:49.957
and then you too
will be granted eternal life.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.626
- Thank you,
but that was never my wish!

00:14:53.594 --> 00:14:55.429
- So that's how it is.

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:57.965
Then you're really
of no use to me.

00:14:57.998 --> 00:15:01.735
And demons that this world
has no use for...

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:03.971
shall be destroyed!

00:15:05.706 --> 00:15:08.075
- [grunts]
- [earring chimes]

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.211
Hmph.

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.714
Now then, Rion,
come along with me.

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:21.355
[rumbling]

00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:23.557
- [murmurs]

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.925
[grunts]

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.560
[grumbles]

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:29.263
Osamu Kirin!

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:30.397
Hmm?

00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:32.900
What is that?

00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:34.434
Hmm?

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.475
- Eh? [chuckles]

00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:46.780
- What the devil are you up to?

00:15:46.813 --> 00:15:49.249
How dare you
lay hands on my daughter?!

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:51.418
[grumbles]

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:52.486
[grunts]

00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:57.424
[grunting]

00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:02.763
Rion!

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:06.600
[yells]

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:09.870
[Towa gasps]

00:16:09.903 --> 00:16:12.039
- That looks
like the Dream Butterfly.

00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:13.907
- Yeah, but a whole lot bigger.

00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:15.309
INUYASHA: Moroha!

00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:16.410
[all gasp]

00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:19.313
MOROHA: Mom! Dad!

00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:20.981
- All I gotta say
is you came back

00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:23.417
from the other world
with one hell of a souvenir.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.185
- What the heck
is going on here?!

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:30.023
- We don't know. It's like
it's absorbing the demons.

00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.159
[demons growling]

00:16:38.131 --> 00:16:39.900
- Mr. Kirin said it.

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:41.935
He said he would destroy
all the demons.

00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:43.437
- [earring chimes]
- [yelps]

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.205
[both groan]

00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:46.139
- Riku!

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.442
What's the matter? [gasps]

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.878
You're wounded!

00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:52.913
- Never mind.
It's not important.

00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:54.882
It's Miss Rion!
She's been taken away!

00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:57.451
- What do you mean?
What's happened?

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.490
[demons growling]

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.273
KIRIN: Yes, Rion.

00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:21.441
Destroy those weak
and useless demons

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:22.876
and absorb their energy.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.044
They won't be needing it.

00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:25.279
- [door bursts opens]
- Huh?

00:17:25.312 --> 00:17:26.446
- Rion!

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.249
What is the meaning
of this nonsense?!

00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:31.418
- That's a rude way
to talk to your ruler.

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:33.954
You should kneel
and bow your head to her.

00:17:33.987 --> 00:17:36.056
- You impertinent right arm.

00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:38.158
I don't take orders from you!

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:40.460
- [laughs]

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:43.931
- [growls]

00:17:43.964 --> 00:17:47.267
- Don't forget that I'm
still your real right arm.

00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:48.902
Do you really think
you can beat me

00:17:48.936 --> 00:17:51.438
with that shoddy substitute
you've got there?

00:17:55.542 --> 00:17:58.078
Come, Kirinmaru.
You should assist me in creating

00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:00.914
the world for your daughter
that she so wishes for.

00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:02.115
- [grumbles]

00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:04.918
Rion, open your eyes!

00:18:04.952 --> 00:18:08.055
- No, it is you
who needs to open their eyes.

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.757
You refused to heed the warning
of the Great Dog-Demon,

00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:13.360
and because of that,
Rion was killed.

00:18:13.393 --> 00:18:15.629
Did you even consider
the pain she'd feel

00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:16.930
being dragged into battle?!

00:18:16.964 --> 00:18:18.532
- What do you mean?

00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:21.368
- You always prioritized
your own desires,

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:24.638
with never a thought
for what your daughter wanted.

00:18:24.671 --> 00:18:26.607
You're a failure as a father.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:31.445
- Do you feel that way, Rion?

00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:34.348
- Kirinmaru...

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:37.417
the Dog-Demon Clan will try
to destroy Rion's dream.

00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:38.952
You must stop them.

00:18:38.986 --> 00:18:40.020
- Rion!

00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:41.121
- You want to be

00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:43.357
the most powerful demon
of all, don't you?

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.026
Well, you will be
if you defeat Sesshomaru.

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:49.029
You would be fulfilling
not only Rion's dream,

00:18:49.062 --> 00:18:51.131
but your own dream as well.

00:18:52.599 --> 00:18:54.735
- Is it true what he says...

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.771
Rion?

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.774
- Rion's been absorbed
by the Grim Comet?!

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:03.443
- I can't believe
Mr. Kirin would do that.

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:04.444
- He's using Miss Rion

00:19:04.478 --> 00:19:06.947
to eliminate
all the demons of this world!

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.016
- Well, then we don't have
any time to waste!

00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:10.184
Shippo, let's go!

00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:13.053
- Wha?! Wait a minute! Why me?!

00:19:13.086 --> 00:19:14.721
- Please, Shippo. Help us.

00:19:14.755 --> 00:19:15.822
- [groans]

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:18.592
- Towa! Setsuna! Moroha!
- [Jaken yelling]

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.394
[all gasp]

00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:21.395
- Takechiyo!

00:19:21.428 --> 00:19:23.964
- Towa, take this with you.
You'll need it.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.099
- Uh, wh-what is it?

00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:27.134
- We were given it

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.503
by the Deputy Shogun
of Kanto himself.

00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:32.272
It's the Kikujumonji.

00:19:32.306 --> 00:19:35.609
He wants you to save us
from the Degenerate Age.

00:19:37.945 --> 00:19:39.513
- Thank you very much!

00:19:39.546 --> 00:19:44.384
- Towa, you won't hear me talk
any more about not running away.

00:19:44.418 --> 00:19:46.453
You've overcome many hardships
with your attitude

00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:49.289
of never backing down,
so don't change now.

00:19:49.323 --> 00:19:50.757
Even so...

00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:53.293
just make sure
you come back alive.

00:19:53.327 --> 00:19:54.528
- Will do!

00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:56.096
[dramatic music playing]

00:19:56.129 --> 00:19:57.965
Well, let's go!

00:19:57.998 --> 00:19:58.999
BOTH: All right.

00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:10.577
- And what about you,
Master Jaken?

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:14.014
- I'm staying right here
to wait for Lord Sesshomaru.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:15.616
- Understood.

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.284
- Uncle, we should go.

00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:18.252
- [grunts]

00:20:18.285 --> 00:20:20.487
- KOHAKU: Kirara!
- [growls]

00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:26.126
- Lord Sesshomaru...

00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:40.974
- [gasps]

00:20:44.511 --> 00:20:46.280
Lord Sesshomaru!

00:20:46.313 --> 00:20:47.581
- Rin.

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:54.421
- Huh?

00:20:54.454 --> 00:20:57.491
- Let us go, Rin.
