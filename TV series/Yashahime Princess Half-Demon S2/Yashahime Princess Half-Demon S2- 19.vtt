00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:09.209
- You are not going anywhere!

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:10.110
[yells]

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.018
It is my destiny alone...

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.987
to transcend time!

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.560
Osamu Kirin,
my living right arm...

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.429
take my hand
and lead me to the Reiwa era!

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.432
[demons growling]

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.869
You bastards.

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:38.105
Did you think you can
keep my daughter and I

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.174
from going to the other world?!

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.043
[roars]

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.279
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.068
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.414
[mysterious music playing]

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:28.415
[demon screams]

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.754
OSAMU KIRIN:
Momotaro, Momotaro...

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:35.122
[rats squeaking]

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.791
those millet dumplings
in your hip pouch,

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.661
please, could you
share one with me?

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:48.235
Demons like you shouldn't exist,
even in a place like this.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.838
DEMON: Who the hell are you?

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.906
- I am Osamu Kirin,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.043
by day, a mild-mannered
middle-school teacher.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.179
But that's just a disguise
to hide my true identity,

00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:01.348
for by night, I punish demons

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.251
that lurk in the shadows
of this town.

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:07.654
- Who am I, you ask?
- [growling]

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.457
[all scream]

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.258
- [gasps]

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.193
- I'm the living right arm

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:16.263
of the great
Lord Kirinmaru of the Dawn.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:20.167
You see, I'm a demon,
just like you.

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:27.841
[all screaming]

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.143
- [grunts] I'm out of here!

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:35.148
[demon moans]

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:42.089
[tense music playing]

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:45.192
<i>- More demons</i>
<i>are popping up every day.</i>

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.362
<i>I wonder if it's</i>
<i>the Grim Comet's doing.</i>

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.965
<i>I'm pretty sure I sensed</i>
<i>a fragment of the Comet</i>

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.034
falling somewhere in this area.

00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:58.172
[overlapping chatter]

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:00.807
Tomorrow,
tens of thousands of people

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.110
will gather here
to see this concert.

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:07.247
It would be awful
if something were to happen.

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:09.750
However,
I haven't powers enough,

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:12.519
nor do I have
anyone else to help me.

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:15.155
I can only stand by
and watch things happen

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.559
as all of humanity is wiped
off the face of the Earth.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.894
Huh? What's that?

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:22.262
A demon?

00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:26.066
I definitely sense
a new presence nearby.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.101
But this presence...

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:31.371
it's almost like
I know it from somewhere.

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:33.874
Right now, the Grim Comet

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:36.176
is on the opposite side
of the planet.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.011
At the rate it's moving,
it will probably

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:40.247
come crashing to Earth
tomorrow night.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.951
There may not be much
in the way of time left,

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:45.853
but until that comet comes,

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:48.722
I will protect this world.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.659
TOWA: <i>"The Blackout."</i>

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:56.763
[birds chirping]

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.467
[energy chiming]

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.971
[pinwheel clacking]

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.110
- We're here!

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.678
We're in the Reiwa era!

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:12.813
- Oh, yeah!

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:14.615
This place
even smells familiar.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:15.849
- Hold on.

00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:17.451
Where is the Grim Comet?

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.887
TOWA: You're right.
There's no sign of it.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.055
MOROHA: Yeah,
what the hell is going on?

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.491
Was it all just a big lie?

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.059
- No, it couldn't be.

00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:28.929
Anyway, we have
to find Mr. Kirin.

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:30.597
- He'll be at school.
- [footsteps approach]

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:31.865
- MEI: Towa?
- Huh?

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:33.700
- I don't believe it!

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.435
- Uh, M-Mei?

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:36.770
- [whimpers]

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:38.071
Towa!

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.240
- Hey, there!
- [laughs]

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:41.708
- Welcome back, Towa!
- [chuckles]

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:43.076
What are you doing here?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.213
I come here every day
before school to say a prayer

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:48.382
that you and the others
would come back again.

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:50.450
- That's really
sweet of you, Mei.

00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:54.288
- And a welcome back to you too,
Setsuna and Moroha!

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.189
- Yeah.

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:57.090
- It's been a while, huh?

00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:58.458
- Towa! You know,

00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:01.228
you really should have
warned me you were coming back.

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:02.129
- Uh...

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:03.230
- Oh, that's right!

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:05.132
Mom has a concert today!

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:06.967
You have to go to it, okay?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.335
A concert? Really?

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.170
- GRAMMY: Is that Towa?
- [gasps]

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:11.405
- [chuckles]
- TOWA: Grammy!

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:14.241
- And Setsuna and Moroha
as well, I see.

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:15.776
What brings you all here?

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.011
- Uh, well, you see...

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:20.781
GRANDPA: I'm glad to see you
all looking so well.

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:23.016
Moroha, good to see you.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.985
- You too, Grandpa!

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:27.721
- It's so wonderful
having you all back again.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.791
- Good to be back.
- [Buyo purrs]

00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:34.228
- Aww. Hey, Buyo!
How have you been doing?

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:36.196
MEI: He's been waiting
for you too.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.699
- Oh, you have?
Well, here we are!

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.501
- [meows]

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:41.869
- Oh, wait. Sorry.

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.437
We haven't got time for this.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.073
So what's going on
with the Grim Comet, anyway?

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:48.275
ALL: "The Grim Comet"?

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:50.444
- The comet that's headed
straight for Earth.

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:52.412
- You haven't
heard anything about it?

00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:55.115
GRANDPA: Hmm.
No, I don't recall

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:57.017
hearing anything like that
on the news.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.019
- ALL: Huh?!
- [Towa sighs]

00:06:59.052 --> 00:07:02.723
- I'm starting to think
it's all a bunch of nonsense,

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.091
the whole thing.

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:06.026
- There is
something strange about it.

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.529
- Wait, what has
Mr. Kirin been up to?

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:12.566
- Actually, we've been seeing
a lot of Mr. Kirin lately.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.401
- Fact, he came by yesterday.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.904
- He's always there
staring up at the Sacred Tree!

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.006
- Is that right?

00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:21.875
- [Buyo grunts]
- Well, anyway,

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:23.410
we should all
head to the school.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.411
[both grunt]

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.646
- We'll see you later.

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:27.247
- Wait! Moroha, Setsuna,

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.449
you can't go dressed like that!

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:32.853
You'll stick out
like a couple of sore thumbs.

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:34.855
- [meows]

00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:35.956
GRAMMY: There!

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:38.725
Oh, those look so good on you,
both of you!

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:39.893
- [laughs]

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:43.263
- They might stand out
even more now. [laughs]

00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:46.466
GRAMMY: That's my old coat that
you've got on there, Setsuna,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.868
and yours, Moroha,

00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:50.037
is a winter coat
that Kagome used to wear.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.039
- No wonder
it looks so good on me!

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.173
[chuckles] Thanks a lot!

00:07:53.207 --> 00:07:55.642
- Well, then, we'll be off.

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:57.377
- All right! See you later.

00:07:58.445 --> 00:07:59.913
They just got back,

00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:02.850
and the first place
they want to go to is school?

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:04.751
[students chatting]

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.859
- [grunts]
- GIRL: Towa?

00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:12.826
- [gasps]

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.028
- I haven't
seen you for a while.

00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:16.697
- Oh. Uh, hi.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.665
- [gasps] Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:20.200
She actually spoke to us!

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:22.069
- So you're all recovered now

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:24.538
from your rheumatism
and neuralgia and all?

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:25.939
- Must have been awful!

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:28.375
- What? My rheumatism?

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:30.277
And neuralgia? Uh...

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.346
oh, right! I'm fine, thanks.

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:35.048
- Well, you just be sure
and take care of yourself.

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:36.550
GIRLS: Goodbye, Towa!

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.986
- Bye. [chuckles]

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:45.893
- Mr. Kirin.
- Huh?

00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:48.495
Ah. Well, well,
if it isn't Miss Higurashi.

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:49.530
It's been a while.

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:51.965
I hope your chronic pain
condition has improved.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:54.034
Your father
told me all about it.

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:55.402
- My chronic--

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:56.937
Oh. Yeah.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.072
Never mind that!
Tell me about the Grim Comet!

00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:01.675
- How do you know about that?!

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.677
- Um, uh...

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.879
what? What is it?

00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:06.880
KIRIN: Hmm.

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:08.415
- I see.
- Uh...

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:09.716
- Ah, so that's it!

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.785
It all makes sense to me now.

00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:14.588
You're a half-demon.
That explains it.

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:18.192
And those two are half-demons
as well, I assume.

00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:21.628
So it was your presence
I sensed last night.

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:24.531
I have much room
for improvement.

00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:27.201
What's more, I had no idea

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:30.003
that I was the foreign entity
in this world,

00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:31.271
the one who is responsible

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:34.508
for drawing the Grim Comet
here to the Reiwa era.

00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:36.543
- Yeah, but where is it?

00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:38.979
We haven't seen
any sign of a comet yet.

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:41.515
- It's on the far side
of the Earth now.

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:43.350
You know,
the Earth actually rotates.

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:45.052
I would have thought
you might have learned

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.987
- about that in school.
- Uh...

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.223
- If you look
up in the sky late tonight,

00:09:49.256 --> 00:09:51.024
you'll be able to see it.

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:53.794
- So it wasn't nonsense
after all.

00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:56.296
- Which means
we must remove him!

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.598
- [grunts]

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:03.003
- I am truly sorry.

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:05.572
This has all happened
because of me.

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:06.773
ALL: Huh?

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:09.142
- So you don't want
this world destroyed?

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:12.179
That's hard to believe, coming
from the right arm of Kirinmaru.

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:14.047
- But you must believe it.

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:15.682
Yes, I began as his right arm,

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:19.086
but since then, I've come
to love this modern world

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:23.090
and especially the race
of human beings who inhabit it.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.958
They've built
an advanced culture here,

00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:26.560
and they deserve
every opportunity

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:28.228
to continue it, develop it,

00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:30.197
and to live
on this Earth in peace.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.599
- I still find it
hard to believe.

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:35.536
- Yeah! It'll take more
than a pretty speech

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:36.904
to get us to--[gasps]

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:38.438
- [squawking]

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:39.840
[all gasp]

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:41.842
- Get back! [grunts]

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:42.976
[yells]

00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:45.445
[gasps]

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:48.549
TOWA: <i>Mr. Kirin</i>
<i>just attacked a demon.</i>

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:51.852
- Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:54.087
- Scourge of Swallows!

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:58.525
- [exhales]

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:01.361
I'm so glad
you girls were around to help.

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:04.264
As the Grim Comet
draws nearer to the Earth,

00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:08.535
the number of demons
appearing in town increases.

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:09.503
I suspect there are demons

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:12.439
running wild somewhere
out there right now.

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:16.043
When the Comet finally hits,
there'll be demons everywhere,

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:18.478
killing everyone they see!

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:19.880
And I'm utterly powerless!

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:22.182
I can do nothing
to keep it from happening!

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:23.851
SETSUNA:
It's too soon to give up!

00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:24.852
- Huh?

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.053
- The reason we're here

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.754
is to destroy the Grim Comet.

00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:30.123
- That's right!
I mean, no offense,

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:32.759
but we didn't travel
through time just to see you.

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:35.762
- Yes, you're right.

00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:37.097
We mustn't give up hope

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.966
while there's
still a chance left.

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:42.002
"Man proposes, God disposes."

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.538
Do your best
and trust in Providence.

00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:45.873
An excellent saying.

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:48.342
TOWA: Right! Now we're
off to get that Comet!

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.244
- Aren't you
being a little hasty?

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:51.044
TOWA: Hmm?

00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:52.846
- If I'm not mistaken,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.114
none of you can fly.

00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:56.116
And as for
those weapons of yours,

00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:58.051
they won't even
be able to reach it.

00:11:58.085 --> 00:12:00.587
You'll be much better off
staying on the ground.

00:12:00.621 --> 00:12:03.957
In fact, I have a job
that you could help me with.

00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:05.392
- Hmm?
- Eh?

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:06.793
- Several fragments

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:08.996
have already fallen
from the Grim Comet.

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:12.199
I can sense
their presence in the area.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.468
There's a very popular
musical event

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:16.537
that's going
to be held here tonight.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.239
Should the demons
decide to strike then,

00:12:19.273 --> 00:12:21.275
there would be many casualties.

00:12:21.308 --> 00:12:23.744
I'd like to prevent that.

00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:24.845
- Towa! Look at this!

00:12:24.878 --> 00:12:25.846
- Huh?

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:28.048
[gasps] Mama Moe!

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.018
That concert Mei
was talking about,

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:32.186
this has to be it!

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:34.121
- If the demons do come,

00:12:34.154 --> 00:12:36.156
I could certainly
use your help.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.359
- What do you think?

00:12:39.393 --> 00:12:42.829
- My instincts tell me
Mr. Kirin's telling the truth.

00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:46.466
Anyway, we can't leave
Mama Moe in danger.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.568
- Yeah, Towa's right.

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.837
We should go check it out.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.271
- All right, Mr. Kirin.

00:12:51.305 --> 00:12:53.841
If you want our help,
you can have it.

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:55.676
- Oh, thank you!

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:57.010
You don't know how I've longed

00:12:57.044 --> 00:13:00.380
to have some loyal retainers
to follow me into battle!

00:13:00.414 --> 00:13:02.182
- Huh?
- Uh...

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:03.984
[overlapping chatter]

00:13:04.017 --> 00:13:07.187
TOWA: Well, it looks like
this is the concert venue.

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.356
- I can sense demon energy.

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:10.924
- Yeah, there's something here.

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.193
- Let's split up
and look around.

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:15.262
[dramatic music playing]

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:19.867
- [yells]

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.535
- [screams]

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.938
- BOTH: Towa!
- [gasps]

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.673
- So there are demons here.

00:13:26.707 --> 00:13:29.409
- Yeah. Mr. Kirin was
telling the truth after all.

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:31.245
- Well, about that part,
at least.

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:33.914
- It looks like they ran
into the building.

00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:35.349
But wait.

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:38.051
I sense an energy
even stronger than theirs.

00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:39.186
- This is bad.

00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:41.855
we've gotta get them
to cancel the concert!

00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:43.257
- MEI: Towa!
- [gasps]

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.124
- M-Mei!

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.692
- Hey, what are you
doing way back here?

00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:49.029
Did you get lost? Were you girls
trying to get backstage?

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:51.265
- Oh, uh, y-yeah.

00:13:51.298 --> 00:13:53.033
I hope you're here
to see my mom's concert too,

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:56.003
Moroha and Setsuna,
'cause it's gonna be a good one!

00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:57.905
- Y-Yes, I'm sure it will.

00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:00.140
- Unless it's canceled.
- Oh, don't worry.

00:14:00.174 --> 00:14:02.543
Come on, come on! I'll show you
Mom's dressing room!

00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:03.777
- Hey, wait a sec, Mei! Wait!

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.512
- Uh, uh...

00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:06.914
[both sigh]

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.016
[overlapping chatter]

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.561
- There. How's that?

00:14:20.594 --> 00:14:22.029
- Perfect. Thank you!

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:23.564
- [door opens]
- MEI: Mom!

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:24.631
- Eh? What is it?

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:27.467
- I've brought Towa
and the others to see you.

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:28.836
- I'm glad you did.

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:31.738
- Oh, is this your daughter,
Ms. Higurashi?

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:33.207
- Yes. This is Mei.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.843
- Wow, it's Julian in person!

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:37.110
- Nice to meet you, Mei.

00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:39.713
- [gasps] And all
the other members of ROCKS!

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:42.349
- So it's true! The three
of you really did come back!

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.917
- [nervous laugh]
- Uh, yeah...

00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:45.919
but we've got a little bit
of an emergency.

00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:47.921
- It's so good to see you again!

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:50.257
I hope you're all doing well.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.058
- Yep!

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:53.694
- Setsuna,
how's the violin going?

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:54.695
- Fine.

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:55.929
- Oh, I'm so glad.

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:57.097
- Look, I'm sorry,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.132
but right now, you've
gotta stop this concert!

00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:01.401
- What on Earth
are you talking about?

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:02.769
- Demons are coming!

00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:04.505
A swarm of demons
will be here soon!

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:07.107
- Oh, that was
supposed to be a surprise.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.375
- [all gasp]
- [knock at the door]

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:11.178
- They're ready.
It's sound-check time.

00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:12.613
- 'Kay!

00:15:12.646 --> 00:15:14.181
- I'll go and let 'em know.

00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:15.883
- Sorry to cut this short,

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:17.751
but I really have to do
this sound check.

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:18.752
- Uh--
- We'll talk later!

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:19.887
No, hang on! Wait!

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.889
[footsteps fading]

00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:23.090
KIRIN: I see.

00:15:23.123 --> 00:15:24.992
Well, in that case,

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:27.761
we'll just have to protect them
the best that we can.

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:28.762
TOWA: <i>Okay.</i>

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:33.700

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:35.502
<i>My right arm!</i>

00:15:35.536 --> 00:15:36.670
- Huh?

00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:37.671
[winces]

00:15:37.704 --> 00:15:39.606
[overlapping chatter]

00:15:49.516 --> 00:15:51.285
- There. Do you feel that?

00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:52.486
- Yeah.

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:54.087
- They're up there!

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:56.023
[gear rattling]

00:15:56.056 --> 00:15:58.292

00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:28.722
- So many!

00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:29.723
- Ugh! Yeah!

00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:31.291
I wish they'd stop multiplying!

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:34.995
- They won't,
not 'til we destroy the Comet.

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:37.531
- Ah, I see.

00:16:37.564 --> 00:16:41.101
These Spider Heads
are just a diversion.

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:44.605
The ringleader's
inside the hall.

00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:46.974
That makes things a bit tricky.

00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:52.546
KIRINMARU: <i>My right arm,</i>

00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:54.781
<i>lead me to the Reiwa era.</i>

00:16:54.815 --> 00:16:57.584

pounding in my head.

KIRINMARU: <i>Can't you</i>

00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:04.091
<i>I am the one who will</i>
<i>strike down the Grim Comet.</i>

00:17:04.124 --> 00:17:07.060
- Yes, perhaps you would be able
to destroy the Grim Comet

00:17:07.094 --> 00:17:09.363
and save this world
if I were to guide you here,

00:17:09.396 --> 00:17:11.465
but then I would be
letting you bring about

00:17:11.498 --> 00:17:14.067
the Degenerate Age
in your own world!

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.571
- Right arm.

00:17:17.604 --> 00:17:19.573
[growls]

00:17:19.606 --> 00:17:21.475
Do as I say!

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.679
Obey me,
you worthless appendage!

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:26.680
[grunts]

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.482
Riku.

00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:30.984
- Lord Kirinmaru...

00:17:31.018 --> 00:17:33.353
if you think I will allow you
to treat Lady Towa

00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:35.889
as a mere vessel,
you're very much mistaken.

00:17:35.923 --> 00:17:39.293
And as for Miss Rion,
I'll look after her!

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:40.394
- [scoffs]

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:45.032

Madam Zero!

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:46.300
- What's that?!

00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:50.370
Rion!

00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:52.039
- Apologies.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.774
- Come back here, Riku!

<i>plays beautifully.</i>

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.709
[demons snicker]

00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:29.910
[all gasp]

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.312
- That big one
must be the ringleader!

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:34.715
JULIAN: <i>Wow. It looks so real.</i>

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:37.751
Aha!
I'm not afraid of you, ogre!

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:38.919
Prepare to die!

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.754
[fans cheering]

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:43.724
- Get him, Julian!
Whack that ogre!

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:44.925
[demon yells]

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.528
- [gasps]

00:18:48.762 --> 00:18:50.030
[both scream]

00:18:51.765 --> 00:18:53.767
[crowd cheers]

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.235
MOE: <i>I wish</i>
<i>the girls had told me</i>

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:57.037
<i>they'd be making</i>
<i>a surprise appearance.</i>

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.207
But then, I guess it
wouldn't have been a surprise.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.911
- Yay! You go, Towa! Get him!

00:19:03.944 --> 00:19:06.880
- Let's take
this fight outside! Now!

00:19:06.914 --> 00:19:07.981
Cyclone Burst!

00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:08.982
[demon screams]

00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:10.050
TOWA: Come on. Let's go!

00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:11.051
MOROHA: Right!

00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:13.253
- That was so real.

00:19:13.287 --> 00:19:15.455
[prop roars]

00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:19.159
Wait, so then what the heck
was that other thing?

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:22.563
[demons yell]

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:25.065
- Take this! Sacred Arrow!

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:28.202
- Sacred Arrow?

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:30.871
Is that the legendary
priestess' arrow?!

00:19:30.904 --> 00:19:32.272
- [yells]

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:35.108
- Very impressive.

00:19:35.142 --> 00:19:37.644
That's no ordinary naginata!

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:38.879
[flute plays]

00:19:38.912 --> 00:19:40.180
- Zanseiken!

00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:44.585
- [roars]

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:46.887
- [winces]

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.888
SETSUNA: Towa!

00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:49.923
Stop using the Zanseiken!

00:19:49.957 --> 00:19:52.292
- Don't worry!
I've got it under control!

00:19:52.326 --> 00:19:54.761
- Wait, that sword's
the Zanseiken?

00:19:54.795 --> 00:19:58.098
Then, that power
comes from the Kyuyokon!

00:19:58.131 --> 00:20:00.667
What unbelievable luck!
I've acquired

00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:03.804
some pretty formidable
loyal retainers for myself!

00:20:03.837 --> 00:20:05.372
[fans cheering]

00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:07.508
JULIAN: Thank you!
Thank you very much!

00:20:12.813 --> 00:20:15.782
- Ah, that was great!
Thank <i>you!</i>

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:18.085
KIRIN: That was wonderful!

00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:20.053
Thanks to your combined efforts,

00:20:20.087 --> 00:20:22.489
the demon energy
in this area is gone.

00:20:22.523 --> 00:20:24.091
- What about the Comet?

00:20:24.124 --> 00:20:26.994
- That's a different story.
- [all gasp]

00:20:33.767 --> 00:20:34.768
[all gasp]

00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:36.136
- Whoever named it
the Grim Comet

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.671
came up with the right name!

00:20:37.704 --> 00:20:39.273
- Look at the size of it!

00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:41.708
- Yeah, it's not
looking good, is it?

00:20:41.742 --> 00:20:43.043
- [gasps]

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:44.878
Have you noticed something,
Towa?

00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:46.079
- What?

00:20:46.113 --> 00:20:49.283
- Why is everyone in this world
acting so calm,

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:51.285
as if nothing were happening,

00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:53.720
with that thing
barreling right towards them?

00:20:53.754 --> 00:20:55.088
[casual chatter]

00:20:55.122 --> 00:20:56.290
- Yeah, you're right.

00:20:56.323 --> 00:20:58.525
- That is strange, isn't it?

00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.993
- Of course they're calm.

00:21:00.027 --> 00:21:03.230
They're calm because
they're unable to see it.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.732
- So if we don't destroy
the Grim Comet,

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:10.571
all of these people will die
without even knowing why or how.

00:21:10.604 --> 00:21:12.673
- Yes. We should go.

00:21:17.344 --> 00:21:18.779
[all grunt]

00:21:18.812 --> 00:21:20.747
[dramatic music playing]

00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:41.869
- You ready?

00:21:41.902 --> 00:21:43.203
- Yeah!
- Yes!

00:21:43.237 --> 00:21:45.472
- Let's destroy the Grim Comet!

00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:48.709
- That's the spirit!
Forward to victory!

00:21:48.742 --> 00:21:49.776
- It's up to us!

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.478
We're the only ones
who can do this!

00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:53.714
- Yes, indeed.

00:21:53.747 --> 00:21:55.015
- That's right!

00:21:55.048 --> 00:21:57.985
I will protect this world,
whatever the cost!

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.232
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.355
[dramatic music playing]

00:23:41.388 --> 00:23:44.358
- I'm Osamu Kirin,
a normal schoolteacher by day,

00:23:44.391 --> 00:23:47.327
<i>but in truth, the former</i>
<i>right arm of Kirinmaru,</i>

00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:49.263
<i>the Beast King</i>
<i>of feudal Japan!</i>

00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:50.931
<i>My hobby is demon slaying!</i>

00:23:50.964 --> 00:23:52.499
MOROHA: <i>Man,</i>
<i>this guy's really into it.</i>

00:23:52.533 --> 00:23:54.902
SETSUNA: He's a foreign entity
that must be exterminated!

00:23:54.935 --> 00:23:56.069
TOWA: <i>But wait! Wait!</i>

00:23:56.103 --> 00:23:58.138
<i>He also happens to be</i>
<i>my homeroom teacher!</i>

00:23:58.172 --> 00:24:02.142
Next time on Yashahime:
"When the Grim Comet Falls."

00:24:02.176 --> 00:24:05.479
KIRINMARU: <i>My right arm,</i>
<i>you will obey me!</i>
