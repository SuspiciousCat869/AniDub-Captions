- What?!

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.086
- The curse
embodies Lady Zero's regrets.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.956
Unless you lift these regrets
from her, you cannot save her.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.261

I'll kill you for that!

the Madam is still connected to
your mother by a thread of fate!

that ordered Homura to burn down
the forest you lived in,

to you and your sister?

Don't let her provoke you,

Setsuna wouldn't
have lived her life

I'm getting paid for this.

the silver-scale curse
will soon kill Rin.

that's the way to get in?

- Of course!
I've done it before!

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:44.144

- He's making this up
as he goes along.

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:51.885
- You would question the word
of a great demon such as myself?

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.520
- I don't know about "great."

00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:56.490
- Yeah, heightwise,
you're not that great at all.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.659
- Height has nothing to do
with greatness!

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.195
Anyway, I'm a lot taller
than you are, little pipsqueak,

00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:02.396

Now let us bring this to an end!

You shall know what it's like

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.119
to feel the power
of a great demon!

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:28.088
- Lady Towa, stop!

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:31.325
If you kill Madam now
out of blind rage and hatred,

00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:33.760
you will be scarred
for the rest of your life!

00:06:33.794 --> 00:06:37.064
And she will live on in your

That is what she wants!

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.170
- The reason Zero
hates half demons so much

00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:46.540
is because she still regrets
what happened the day I died.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:50.110
It comes from her love for
her younger brother Kirinmaru,

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:52.613
my father, and her desire
to protect him.

00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:56.149
If it were possible to free her
from her sense of regret

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:57.684
and bring her peace...

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:59.386

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.223

to consider calling it quits.

- Inuyasha and Kagome
are within that pearl.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.603
- What? So my mom and dad are--

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:24.838
They're still alive?

00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:27.207

should know it was my idea

00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:28.942
to seal them in the Black Pearl!

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:31.578
Left to their own devices,
Inuyasha and Kagome

00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:34.448

Kirinmaru and killed Zero!

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:37.184

with taking them out?

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.987
Kirinmaru and Zero are
the bad guys here, aren't they?

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.288
- You fool!

00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:44.691

then Rin will die as well!

I don't care anymore!

00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:34.007

is a memory of mine

that our mother sealed away.

But don't you worry!

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.755
I, Jaken, will make sure

That's why
I kept them away from you.

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:19.860
- that you die, Kirinmaru!
- of the Shikon Jewel,

00:19:19.893 --> 00:19:22.663
Kirinmaru will also be
killed by a half demon.

00:19:22.696 --> 00:19:23.664
[warrior groans]

00:19:23.697 --> 00:19:27.434
- That is the reason
why Kirinmaru despises them.

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:29.036
[Rion gasps]

00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:32.439
KIRINMARU: <i>I commend you</i>
<i>for your courage, at least.</i>

00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:35.642
- [warrior grunts]
- [wails]

00:19:35.676 --> 00:19:37.244
ZERO: Rion!

00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:39.646
- [gasps]
- Hold still!

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.814
ZERO: Rion!

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:42.549
Let go of her, half demon!

00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:43.984
- Shut up!

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.553
You're going to pay
for what you did to my master!

00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:51.091
- A warrior who takes hostages
is beneath contempt.

00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:56.563
- [gasps]

00:19:56.597 --> 00:19:57.564
[grunts]

00:19:57.598 --> 00:19:59.766
- [gasps]

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.435
KIRINMARU: No...

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.005
- [chuckles]
Guess that's what you get

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.608
for bringing a child
to the battlefield.

00:20:10.477 --> 00:20:12.179
Forgive me, daughter.

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:15.749
The Dog-Demon of the West
said this would happen.

00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:17.584
He was right.

00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:19.753
I did this to you. [shudders]

00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:21.421
I'm sorry, Rion.

00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:23.423
Please forgive me.

00:20:26.493 --> 00:20:27.961
ZERO: Dear brother...

00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:30.063
these Half-Demon Princesses

00:20:30.097 --> 00:20:32.966
are not the half demons
that you so despise.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.169
Yes, the Shikon Jewel foretold

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:38.238
that you may someday
be felled by a half demon,

00:20:38.272 --> 00:20:41.175
but these two
may be able to save you

00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:43.710
or rather, save Rion.

00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:44.845
Remember that.

00:20:44.878 --> 00:20:46.947
- Save my daughter?

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.450
Rion, what are you
not satisfied with?

00:20:50.484 --> 00:20:52.286
- I'll see you again...

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:53.520
in Nirvana.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.858
- [crying]

00:20:57.891 --> 00:20:59.459
Madam.

00:20:59.493 --> 00:21:02.162
- [crying] Aunt Zero.

00:21:04.898 --> 00:21:05.966
[both gasp]

00:21:05.999 --> 00:21:07.334
- Flowers?

00:21:08.502 --> 00:21:09.703
- [laughs]

00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:11.305
<i>If there exists a demon</i>

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:14.274
<i>so foolish as to</i>
<i>fall in love with a human,</i>

00:21:14.308 --> 00:21:16.143
then I guess I may be allowed

00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:19.580
to fall in love with
such a demon, fool that I am.

00:21:19.613 --> 00:21:22.749
<i>Right, half-demon sisters?</i>

00:21:22.783 --> 00:21:24.685
[singing in Japanese]

00:21:26.753 --> 00:21:27.654
[clunks]

00:21:41.435 --> 00:21:43.337
- [sighs]

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.606
Lord Sesshomaru...

00:21:49.877 --> 00:21:51.678
they've done it.

00:21:51.712 --> 00:21:54.047
Our girls saved Lady Zero.

00:21:54.948 --> 00:21:57.684
[Jaken crying] I'm so glad.

00:21:57.718 --> 00:21:58.719
[Rin laughs]

00:21:58.752 --> 00:22:01.121
[song continues]

00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:05.025
- It's inappropriate
to speak ill of the dead,

00:22:05.058 --> 00:22:07.694
but did you have to tell them
everything, Sister?

00:22:07.728 --> 00:22:08.629
- [pinwheel clicking]
- [gasps]

00:22:20.941 --> 00:22:22.509
- [sighs]

00:22:22.543 --> 00:22:24.912
- I don't know
why you're even hesitating!

00:22:24.945 --> 00:22:27.714
Your parents
are inside there, right?

00:22:27.748 --> 00:22:29.783
- Yeah, but it's just that...

00:22:29.816 --> 00:22:32.786
I don't wanna just suddenly
drop in on 'em out of the blue.

00:22:32.819 --> 00:22:34.721
I wouldn't even know
what to say to them.

00:22:34.755 --> 00:22:36.123
- Oh, stop thinking about it!

00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:37.824
Who cares what you say to them?!

00:22:37.858 --> 00:22:39.626
You've been dying to see them!

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.727
- [chuckles] It's weird,

00:22:40.761 --> 00:22:42.796
when you always thought
you didn't have any parents,

00:22:42.829 --> 00:22:44.531
to find out you were wrong.

00:22:44.565 --> 00:22:46.133
Okay, I've decided!

00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:47.234
If I run into them,

00:22:47.267 --> 00:22:49.503
I'll roll the dice
and hope for the best!

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:50.504
Hmm?

00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:52.139
Hello. Who are you?

00:22:52.172 --> 00:22:53.907
Okay, that was random.

00:22:53.941 --> 00:22:55.609
- Wait, did I miss something?

00:22:55.642 --> 00:22:56.810
Who are you talking to?

00:22:56.844 --> 00:22:58.912
- Huh? You didn't see
that little kid

00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:01.014
with the pinwheel
go running by just now?

00:23:01.048 --> 00:23:02.950
- As I thought...
- [both gasp]

00:23:02.983 --> 00:23:05.752
- members of the Dog-Demon Clan
can see him.

00:23:05.786 --> 00:23:06.820
MOROHA: That's...

00:23:06.854 --> 00:23:09.389
Kirinmaru!

00:23:09.423 --> 00:23:10.324
- Hah!

00:23:11.425 --> 00:23:12.326
- [gasps]

00:23:13.727 --> 00:23:17.231
- The Black Pearl that leads
to where his corpse lies.

00:23:17.264 --> 00:23:19.132
- Kirinmaru, you bastard!

00:23:19.166 --> 00:23:20.934
Give me that pearl back!

00:23:20.968 --> 00:23:23.904
- The pinwheel
Akuru was carrying,

00:23:23.937 --> 00:23:25.706
steal it and bring it to me,

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:28.008
or you will never see
your parents.

00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:29.610
- Damn you!

00:23:29.643 --> 00:23:31.545
- [laughing]

00:23:40.254 --> 00:23:42.456
This Black Pearl is connected

00:23:42.489 --> 00:23:44.791
to where the Great Dog-Demon
<i>was laid to rest.</i>

00:23:44.825 --> 00:23:46.960
<i>But now his half-demon son</i>

00:23:46.994 --> 00:23:48.996
<i>and the priestess</i>
<i>who erased the Shikon Jewel</i>

00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:50.464
<i>are sealed within it.</i>

00:23:50.497 --> 00:23:52.966
<i>If you want this back,</i>
<i>quarter demon,</i>

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.435
find Akuru and bring him to me.

00:23:55.469 --> 00:24:00.407
<i>Next time on</i> Yashahime:
<i>"Kirinmaru of the Dawn."</i>

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.742
<i>Windmill of Time,</i>

00:24:01.775 --> 00:24:05.112
take me to the world that lies
<i>beyond space and time.</i>

00:24:05.145 --> 00:24:07.748
Let the Degenerate Age begin.
