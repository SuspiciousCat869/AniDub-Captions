[music playing]

00:00:10.822 --> 00:00:12.258
- You have done well

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:15.464
in preventing the onslaught
of the Degenerate Age.

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:18.336
Knowing you and your daughters
as I do, however,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.378
I knew you all would be
strong enough to accomplish it.

00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:25.685
I am grateful to you,
Sesshomaru.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.351
[birds chirping]

00:00:42.384 --> 00:00:44.957

- [tools pounding]

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.894
BOTH: Ready, and...

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:49.566
- Here we go! Up!
- Heave!

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.236
- What a battle.

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.874
Hope it's the last one
I ever see.

00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:55.812
[tools pounding]

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:06.266
- So that's it, then.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.771
Riku is actually dead.

00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:11.109
TOWA: May he rest in peace.

[Japanese music playing]

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:05.671
TOWA: <i>"A Never-Ending Future."</i>

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:08.811
[violin playing]

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.412
[violin continues]

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.767
[door slides]

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.902
- Moe.
- Eh?

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:39.806
- Do you feel
like taking a break?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.008
I made some coffee.

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:43.313
- Thank you. Be right there.

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:46.285
- [murmuring] Towa...

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.722
MOE: Aw! She fell asleep?

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:50.227
- She was working
so hard on that drawing,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.066
trying to get it just right,
she wore herself out.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.903
- Oh? Let's have a look.
- [Buyo meows]

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:56.205
[Grandpa chuckles]

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.009
Quite a good likeness.

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:01.215
SOTA: It's funny, Mei's been
different ever since Towa left.

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.353
She's been
a lot more self-assured.

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:04.523
- I overheard her saying

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.227
that she wants to be
as cool as her big sister.

00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:09.766
I just hope that, wherever
she is in the other world,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.839
Setsuna's still practicing
and enjoying the violin.

00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:14.208
- And wherever Moroha is,

00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:16.914
I hope she's living happily
there with her parents.

00:04:16.947 --> 00:04:20.020
- The fact that all of us here
are living in peace

00:04:20.053 --> 00:04:22.725
must mean that they've done
pretty well for themselves.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.297
In fact, I'm sure
all three of them

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.902
are having a great time
over there right now.

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:30.675
[crashes echoing]

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:31.844
- [grunts]

00:04:31.877 --> 00:04:34.850
- Hey, hey! That's not
a very warm reception!

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:36.452
- [snarls]

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:38.323
- He's headed your way, Dad!

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:39.960
- All right! I'm ready for him!

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.235
I'll skin this cat
with one stroke!

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:46.907
- [roars]

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.611

00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:52.217
[groaning]

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:54.823
- Hah! That all you got?!
- [ice cracks]

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:56.760
Well, try this!

00:04:56.793 --> 00:04:58.931
Wind Scar!

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:04.208
Huh? It deflected it!

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:07.247
- Well, you gotta
fight ice with fire!

00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:08.717
Crimson Dragon Wave!

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:09.686
[dragon roars]

00:05:11.623 --> 00:05:12.892
- [squealing]

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:14.328
- Do it, Dad!

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:17.869
- [grunts]
- [blade pulses]

00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:25.952
Adamant Barrage!

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.356
- [wails]

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.028
- Purifying Arrow!

00:05:38.343 --> 00:05:41.717
Yes! We got it!
The Ice Sword of Un'ei.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.056
- The two of them
are in perfect sync.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.627
What?!

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.031
What do you mean
you're in debt, Moroha?!

00:05:49.064 --> 00:05:51.068
- Well, it's kind of
a long story.

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:52.437
I won't bore you with it.

00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:54.441
- What do you owe, and to whom?!

00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:56.479
- Oh, uh, Mr. Jyubei,
the corpse dealer,

00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:58.016
and I don't owe him
all that much.

00:05:58.049 --> 00:06:00.453
Anyway, I've been paying him
back by killing demons

00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:02.190
and bringing him
their heads and treasures,

00:06:02.224 --> 00:06:03.694
- and we're almost even--
- What do you owe?

00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:07.669
- Well, I think maybe, like,
one ryou, something like that.

00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:09.706
- I see.
- Huh?

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:10.708
- Inuyasha!

00:06:10.741 --> 00:06:11.710
- Huh?

00:06:11.743 --> 00:06:13.179
- Go slay a demon!

00:06:13.213 --> 00:06:17.387
I will not allow a daughter
of mine to be in debt to anyone!

00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.293
- Yes! Right! Understood.

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:22.899
<i>- We're here for you now,</i>
<i>Moroha.</i>

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:23.901
- Oh, man!

00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:26.740
My hand's still numb
from that frosty bastard.

00:06:26.773 --> 00:06:27.709
- Dad?
- Yeah?

00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:31.717
- Thanks for helping me
to defeat that thing.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.821
- Aw, that pussycat was nothing.

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:36.158
All in a day's work.
It was no big deal.

00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:37.562
MYOGA: Boing! Boing!

00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:40.433
Oh, it's been so long,
Lord Inuyasha!

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.435
Ha ha! [slurping]

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:42.972
- Why, it's old Myoga.

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:44.475
- [groans]

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:47.047
You haven't changed a bit,
have you?

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.149
- [grunts]
- [pop]

00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:49.519
Whoa!

00:06:49.552 --> 00:06:52.625
- It's funny. The entire time
we were fighting Kirinmaru,

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.063
you were nowhere to be found,
Grandpa Myoga.

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:58.537
- Well, they say discretion
is the better part of valor!

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.407
But I can't tell you
how nice it is

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.912
to taste Lord Inuyasha's
blood after so long!

00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:06.152
Though it's not as delicious
as yours, Lady Moroha!

00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:07.387
- What did you say?!

00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:09.158
- [murmurs]
- Uh...

00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:11.362
- [whispering] Save me. Save me.

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:13.032
- Give me a break.

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:14.168
Whoa, Dad!

00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:16.707
Your hand's all frostbit.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.176
- Huh?
- Let me warm it up.

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:21.115
- Oh, don't worry about it.
It'll be fine in no time.

00:07:21.148 --> 00:07:22.919
- Just let me help you out, Dad.

00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:25.323
- Oh, a-all right.

00:07:25.357 --> 00:07:28.429
[music playing]

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.939
- Well, Dad, Mom, I'm off!

00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:33.974
- Okay.

00:07:34.008 --> 00:07:35.343
- Be careful, now.

00:07:35.377 --> 00:07:37.047
- I'll see you soon.

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:42.558
[bird screeches]

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:44.929
MOROHA: Here you go, Mr. Jyubei!

00:07:44.963 --> 00:07:48.537
The Ice Sword of Un'ei,
as you requested.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.144
- Really? You were able
to get that all by yourself?

00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:53.914
- [gasps] I suppose

00:07:53.947 --> 00:07:56.285
I might have gotten
a little help from my dad.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:58.757
- What's that?
I couldn't hear you.

00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:00.460
- [grumbles]

00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:03.266
Okay, so my dad
helped me out a little!

00:08:03.299 --> 00:08:04.268
That a problem?!

00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:05.604
- Not at all.

00:08:05.638 --> 00:08:08.744
You've got some nice parents,
don't you, Moroha?

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:09.746
- Uh...

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:11.215
[laughs]

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:12.652
- JYUBEI: All right, then.
- Eh?

00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:16.158
- I'll give you one ryou
for that sword, so we're even.

00:08:16.192 --> 00:08:17.862
Your debt's been paid.

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:19.465
- Yes! Finally!

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:22.237
A pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Jyubei!

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.976
- Way to stick with it, Moroha.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.147
- Yeah, way to go, Moroha!

00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:29.485
- Pardon me.

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:33.159
Do you accept requests
to slay demons here?

00:08:33.192 --> 00:08:35.564
- Hang on. You're...

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.334
[birds chirping]

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:38.971
RIN: Here you go!

00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:40.106
SETSUNA: What are these?

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.379
I made them for you
out of a very special fabric.

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:45.985
I got it from Lord Sesshomaru.

00:08:46.018 --> 00:08:48.156
- Whoa, it's beautiful!

00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:49.793
But it's so fancy.

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:53.132
- I don't feel worthy
of such fine clothes.

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:56.973
- Your father knows
you've both worked very hard.

00:08:57.007 --> 00:08:59.879
I'm sure this is
his way of rewarding you.

00:08:59.913 --> 00:09:01.850
- [sighs]

00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:03.286
Did Sesshomaru--

00:09:03.319 --> 00:09:07.127
Did our father ever worry
about what might happen to us

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.496
if we didn't succeed?

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.333
After all, the Tenseiga

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:13.005
can only bring
someone back to life once,

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:16.178
so Setsuna
won't have a second chance.

00:09:16.212 --> 00:09:17.682
- Aren't you forgetting, Towa,

00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:20.220
your soul
has already died as well.

00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:22.491
- It seems like...

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:24.796
if Father
had helped us out earlier,

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:25.965
then maybe neither of us

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:28.202
would have had
to go through any of that.

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:29.304
- Hmm.

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:31.208
RIN: As a matter of fact,

00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:33.881
I've also experienced death.

00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:35.016
- Eh?
- Huh?

00:09:35.049 --> 00:09:39.726
- This era is just filled
with nasty things, isn't it?

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:42.230
You can't do anything
about them.

00:09:42.264 --> 00:09:44.702
And since you're
both half-demons,

00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:47.942
I'm sure you'll have to face
many more of them along the way.

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:51.650
Oh, yes. You'll run into demons

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:53.554
that will try to make
your lives difficult

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:56.358
just because you're
the daughters of Sesshomaru.

00:09:56.392 --> 00:09:57.662
- Let them try!

00:09:57.695 --> 00:09:59.465
We'll put the whole lot of them
in the ground!

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:01.035
- Yeah, that's right!

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:04.374
And not only that,
we've got Moroha with us too!

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:06.780
- Towa, Setsuna...

00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:10.888
[no audible dialogue]

00:10:13.994 --> 00:10:15.931
[laughs]

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:18.804
You both have grown up
to be so strong!

00:10:18.837 --> 00:10:21.943
Your father is so proud of you.
I know he is.

00:10:21.977 --> 00:10:22.945
[laughing]

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:24.649
- Uh...
- Huh?

00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:45.123
[Takamaru warbles]

00:10:45.156 --> 00:10:47.060
[laughter and chatter]

00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:52.103
- Wow! That was amazing, Shippo!

00:10:52.137 --> 00:10:53.272
Now do another one!

00:10:53.306 --> 00:10:56.478
- Okay, calm down.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

00:10:56.513 --> 00:10:58.784
[clears throat]

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:02.792
Now for an example
of transformation!

00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:05.731
- [murmuring]
- [laughs]

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:07.000
RACCOON DOG DEMON: So round!

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:10.206
- Amazing! That was
even better than the last one!

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.008
- Now let's go over

00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:13.680
the fundamentals
of transformation.

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:16.987
[birds chirping]

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.460
I tell you, being a teacher
is a tough job.

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:22.497
We should definitely
get paid more. [gasps]

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:25.571
- Who would have ever thought
Shippo would become a teacher?

00:11:25.604 --> 00:11:27.775
- I wouldn't have!
But I'm so proud of you!

00:11:27.808 --> 00:11:30.213
- Oh, no! Kin'u! Gyokuto!
- [laughter]

00:11:30.246 --> 00:11:33.820
- Shippo's become
a mature young man, hasn't he?

00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:36.626
Hisui could really learn
from his example.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.329
- Let's hope he does.

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:39.666
Did you hear the good news?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.237
Shippo did well
on his fox demon exams.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.507
He's in the 19th rank.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.176
- You're just like your parents!

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.513
Agh! Hey! Hey!

00:11:46.546 --> 00:11:49.519
Miroku, Sango,
get them off of me!

00:11:49.552 --> 00:11:51.623
- [laughs]
- Let's let them have their fun.

00:11:51.656 --> 00:11:53.660
We'll get Lady Kagome
to comfort him later.

00:11:53.694 --> 00:11:55.531
- KIN'U: Let me hold him!
- I'm good with that.

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:56.533
- Hey, don't touch me!

00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:59.706
Miroku! Sango!
S-Save me, please!

00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:00.841
- GIRLS: Little Shippo!
- SANGO: All right.

00:12:00.874 --> 00:12:02.511
- Little Shippo!
- All right, now.

00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:04.348
- [screeches]

00:12:04.381 --> 00:12:07.454
[waves crashing]

00:12:15.003 --> 00:12:18.242
- Without city lights, you can
see a lot more of the stars.

00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:22.785
- City lights? Well, I guess
I'll take your word for it.

00:12:22.818 --> 00:12:25.390
- Shouldn't Moroha be here?

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:27.060
- Yeah, she's late, huh?

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:29.565
- [gasps]

00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:31.435
Hey, Setsuna...

00:12:31.468 --> 00:12:32.972
was Mother saying
that our father

00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:35.143
meant for us
to go through all that?

00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:38.884
Could it have been some kind of
rite of initiation or something?

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:42.190
- Of courage and cowardice.

00:12:42.223 --> 00:12:45.798
- A rite of courage
and cowardice?

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:48.737
- We half-demons
have many enemies.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.375
So yes, perhaps it was a test

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:55.784
to see if half-demons like us
could survive on our own.

00:12:55.818 --> 00:12:58.022
- He thought
we might be too weak?

00:12:58.055 --> 00:13:01.295
MOROHA: Man,
what a depressing discussion!

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:03.299
- You're late, Moroha!

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:04.736
- Yeah, sorry about that.

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:08.009
I was negotiating
a business deal. [laughs]

00:13:08.042 --> 00:13:10.614
- It must be nice
when things are so simple.

00:13:10.648 --> 00:13:11.616
- Wha?!

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.752
- Really.

00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:13.954
Plus, your father

00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:16.025
is a lot less complicated
than the one we have.

00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:18.764
- Listen, guys!
If things seem complicated,

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:20.534
it's 'cause
you're thinking too much!

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:21.703
And I don't just mean

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:23.807
that rite of whatever
you were talking about.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.178
You're overthinking everything!

00:13:26.211 --> 00:13:27.213
- You think so?

00:13:27.247 --> 00:13:30.086
- Yeah! Come on. It's really
not that complicated.

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:32.223
Your dad put you through
some extreme training,

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:35.096
not because he's mad at you,
but because he cares about you

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:37.535
and wants you to be able
to stand up against anything.

00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:39.939
Because you guys can't see
where he's coming from, though,

00:13:39.972 --> 00:13:42.243
you end up hating him
for making you go through it.

00:13:42.277 --> 00:13:45.450
- So you're saying
it was because he loves us

00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:47.521
that he put us through all that?

00:13:47.555 --> 00:13:48.924
- That was
more than just training

00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:50.059
that he put us through!

00:13:50.093 --> 00:13:51.596
It practically
killed the both of us!

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:54.969
- In fact, it did, and if we
were to die one more time...

00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:57.040
- Yeah, well, I don't know
all the details,

00:13:57.073 --> 00:13:59.645
but I think it shows
he believed in you guys

00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:01.248
and knew you'd come through.

00:14:01.281 --> 00:14:02.083
[both sigh]

00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:04.454
<i>- Your father</i>
<i>is so proud of you.</i>

00:14:04.488 --> 00:14:06.058
<i>I know he is.</i>

00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:09.164
- Huh?

00:14:09.197 --> 00:14:10.567
Shit! I knew it!

00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:12.470
I took it too far, didn't I?

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:14.207
I'm sorry. I was out of line.

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:16.980
Huh?

00:14:17.013 --> 00:14:18.817
- Moroha, thank you.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.723
- For fighting by our side
and for just being there!

00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:23.760
- Where's all this coming from?

00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:25.764
- We really mean it, Moroha.

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:28.603
You are
a truly valuable friend.

00:14:28.637 --> 00:14:30.507
- A friend?

00:14:33.647 --> 00:14:35.216
[groans]

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.519
Agh!

00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:37.988
All right, I get it! I get it!

00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:39.124
Stop squeezing me!

00:14:39.157 --> 00:14:41.629
- She's embarrassed!
Look! That's so cute.

00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:43.633
- I am not! Get outta here!

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:45.203
- [both laugh]
- [Moroha grumbles]

00:14:45.236 --> 00:14:47.440
- Anyway, forget that.
- Huh?

00:14:47.474 --> 00:14:49.812
I know a way we can all
make some good money,

00:14:49.846 --> 00:14:51.348
if you're interested.

00:14:52.651 --> 00:14:54.555
[bird warbling]

00:14:57.494 --> 00:14:59.364
- Do you know who that man is?

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:00.166
- Yeah, I know.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.870
That's what
makes it interesting.

00:15:01.903 --> 00:15:03.940
- So you're the client, huh?

00:15:03.974 --> 00:15:04.942
And your name is...

00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:08.149
- You may call me Kai.

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:10.721
- He's got a demon
that needs slaying.

00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:12.591
- The place is a long way out,

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:16.365
and the only way to get there
is by boat, right, Mr. Kai?

00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:19.104
- Yes. Merchants
plying the Western seas

00:15:19.137 --> 00:15:21.810
have been troubled by a monster
that's appeared there.

00:15:21.843 --> 00:15:24.982
When I heard there were skilled
demon slayers here in the East,

00:15:25.016 --> 00:15:26.686
I came to hire some.

00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:28.723
- Sounds like quite the problem.

00:15:28.757 --> 00:15:30.594
Tell us more about the monster.

00:15:30.627 --> 00:15:33.867
- We should let people know
we might be away for a while.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.971
Moroha, come help me
spread the word.

00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:38.677
- Okay.
You get the details, Towa.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:39.912
- And we'll make sure

00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:42.450
they get home safely,
won't we, Takechiyo?

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:43.954
- Oh! Sure thing!

00:15:46.225 --> 00:15:49.297
- Now then, on the subject
of the monster itself,

00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:50.399
it's a--[gasps]

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:52.137
[shudders]

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.711
- Oops. I'll have to apologize
to Mr. Jyubei for the wall.

00:15:55.744 --> 00:15:57.046
- Lady Towa,
what are you doing?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.219
- Riku, did you think you
could fool me with that getup?

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:01.656
- [gasps]

00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:03.325
What was it that gave me away?

00:16:05.062 --> 00:16:06.833
- I recognized your scent.

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:07.835
[gasps]

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:09.639
- Of course. You're...

00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:10.908
a dog demon.

00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:12.277
Anyway, I was embarrassed

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.782
to leave you all believing
that I was dead,

00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:18.824
because, as you can plainly see,
I didn't actually die after all.

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:19.826
Sorry.

00:16:19.859 --> 00:16:21.930
- Don't be.

00:16:21.963 --> 00:16:24.635
I'm just really grateful
that you're still alive.

00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:27.240
- I appreciate it.

00:16:27.273 --> 00:16:30.647
And I am grateful
to see you again.

00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:32.551
[both grunting]

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:35.289
Now try this!

00:16:35.323 --> 00:16:36.225
- [gasps]

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:41.603
Okay, okay, you win.

00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:44.007
That was a strong move.
I'll give you that, Setsuna.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.613
- You still have
a long way to go, Hisui.

00:16:46.646 --> 00:16:47.681
- Watch it!

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.852
I'll surpass you
before you know it.

00:16:49.886 --> 00:16:52.558
Okay! So a rematch tomorrow?

00:16:52.591 --> 00:16:54.227
- I'm sorry.
- Huh?

00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:57.267
- I've been requested
to slay some demons.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.137
I'm departing for the West soon.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.743
- What? For how long?

00:17:01.776 --> 00:17:04.481
- Can't say.
But I figured I would do

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:07.788
a bit of traveling
as part of my training.

00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:09.157
I must get stronger.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.130
- What? Even stronger
than you are now?

00:17:12.163 --> 00:17:15.269
So I guess it's goodbye
for a while, huh?

00:17:15.303 --> 00:17:17.307
- Oh, that's right.
I almost forgot.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.048
Princess Aiya asked me
to deliver a message to you.

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:23.185
She wants you
to visit her tomorrow.

00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:25.557
She has a request to make.

00:17:25.591 --> 00:17:28.863
- Another one?
Why is she always asking me?

00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:30.934
- Oh, how dense can you be?

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:32.337
She's smitten with you.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.775
Play it right,
and you'll be a lord one day.

00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:35.844
- Wha?!

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:37.881
No! You're the only one that I--

00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:39.384
- Oh, no!
- Huh?

00:17:39.417 --> 00:17:41.923
- I need to hurry up
and get packed and ready!

00:17:41.956 --> 00:17:43.627
Take care of yourself, Hisui!

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.998
- Unbelievable.

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.467
And she calls me dense.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.572
KOHAKU: She's a tough one,
that's for sure.

00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:50.574
- Eh?

00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:52.645
Oh, Uncle! Uh, hi!

00:17:52.678 --> 00:17:53.680
I didn't see you there.

00:17:53.713 --> 00:17:55.951
- But then, she is
Lord Sesshomaru's daughter,

00:17:55.984 --> 00:17:57.988
after all. She's formidable.

00:17:58.022 --> 00:18:00.059
- I respect her for it.

00:18:00.092 --> 00:18:02.798
So, Uncle, I want you
to help me get stronger

00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:04.802
by the time she returns here.

00:18:04.835 --> 00:18:08.208
- I admire your spirit.
[chuckles]

00:18:08.242 --> 00:18:10.747
MOROHA: I've accepted
a demon-slaying job

00:18:10.781 --> 00:18:12.818
from a client of Mr. Jyubei's,

00:18:12.851 --> 00:18:14.588
so to make a long story short,

00:18:14.622 --> 00:18:16.926
I'm headed for Iyo Province
in the West.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.429
- That's a long way out.

00:18:18.462 --> 00:18:20.701
- But you paid off
your debt, didn't you?

00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:23.607
And you're still gonna
keep on slaying demons?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.443
- Yeah, I figured, why not?

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:28.148
I see it as an opportunity
to make myself even stronger

00:18:28.182 --> 00:18:29.317
and get paid for it!

00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:31.522
- Like a training exercise.

00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:33.760
Are Towa and Setsuna
going along with you?

00:18:33.793 --> 00:18:34.862
- Yeah!

00:18:34.895 --> 00:18:37.568
And the three of us together
are damn near invincible.

00:18:37.601 --> 00:18:40.941
- Well, just see
that you do your best, Moroha.

00:18:40.974 --> 00:18:43.145
- Hey, would you guys--

00:18:43.178 --> 00:18:46.953
would you mind if--
if I gave you, like, a hug?

BOTH: Hmm?

00:18:48.489 --> 00:18:49.959

You both... take care
of yourselves, all right?

SETSUNA: That foolish Riku.

00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:10.466
Did he really forget
that you and I are dog demons?

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:13.372
- Maybe he just had
a lot on his mind or something.

00:19:13.405 --> 00:19:16.078
- How is it he's still alive
in the first place?

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:18.783

just as surprised as we are.

00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:47.040

that's what happened.

00:19:47.073 --> 00:19:49.010
- How's that even make sense?!

00:19:49.044 --> 00:19:51.048

- We will, Mother!

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:14.628
- And when we do, Father,

00:20:14.662 --> 00:20:16.966
we can all sit down
and have a talk!

00:20:18.068 --> 00:20:19.972
- Let us go, Rin.

00:20:20.005 --> 00:20:21.108
- All right.

00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:23.212

there'd be this many!

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.901

There's human blood
mixed in with it,

00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:39.230
but I know that smell!

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:41.936
