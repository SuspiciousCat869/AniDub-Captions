KIRINMARU:
After the Dog-Demon of the West

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:11.256
severed my right arm,
it was tossed

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.563
into the Bone Eater's Well,
where it transcended time.

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:17.602
That arm is living in human form
in the Reiwa Era

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:20.340
under the name Kirin Osamu.

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:23.748
Five hundred years from now,

00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:27.923
the true Grim Comet
will come crashing to the Earth.

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:29.993
When it does,
all the inhabitants

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:32.331
of this world
will be demon fodder,

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:35.037
and the human race
will become extinct.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.141
And I, Kirinmaru,

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:40.047
am the only one who can
prevent that from happening.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.017

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:26.426
SESSHOMARU: However, the fact is
Akuru hasn't chosen you.

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.430
- That's true. He hasn't,

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:32.037
because he's not been convinced
that I am the strongest.

00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:36.212
<i>But once I defeat you,</i>
<i>Sesshomaru...</i>

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:38.584
<i>and destroy the Dog Clan...</i>

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:41.890
I will have to be recognized
as the strongest of all,

00:02:41.924 --> 00:02:47.101
and then the Tree of Ages will
<i>choose me without hesitation.</i>

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:48.938
- Why are we standing around?!

00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:50.073
Come on!

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:51.877
- Hang on! where are we going?

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.281
- Inside of my dad's stomach!

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:55.785
- Follow me!
- Okay!

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:56.787
- Okay!
- Right!

00:02:57.922 --> 00:02:59.826
[wind blowing]

00:03:16.727 --> 00:03:18.631
- Lord Sesshomaru!

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.970
- He hardly even
has enough strength left

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:23.173
to stand on his feet.

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:26.680
Of all the times
to face a duel to the death!

INUYASHA: We're here.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.635
Both the Tessaiga
and the Tenseiga

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.040
were originally forged
from my dad's fang,

00:03:40.073 --> 00:03:41.577
so it stands to reason
if you call out

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.848
to the Tenseiga
from inside his belly,

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:45.818
it's bound to come running.

00:03:52.297 --> 00:03:55.638
The Tenseiga chooses its owner,
after all.

00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:57.040
Towa...

00:03:57.074 --> 00:03:59.546
you brought Setsuna
back to life.

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.447
You can do this.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.386
- Well, all right. I'll try.

00:04:11.937 --> 00:04:14.341
<i>Call to it with my mind.</i>

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:16.312

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:18.149
- You can do this, Towa!

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:19.218
- You can do it!

00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:20.922
- Yeah, come on! You got it!

00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:22.892
- Just believe
in your own power!

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:24.228
- Thank you, all.

00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:26.600
Just let me focus, okay?

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:30.708

- Huh?

00:04:45.437 --> 00:04:48.343
Is this some kind of joke,
Sesshomaru?

00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:50.413
You can't fight
with the Tenseiga.

00:04:50.447 --> 00:04:52.552
It's merely a healing sword.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.070
<i>- Tenseiga.</i>

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:04.275

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:39.913
I know that power!

00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:43.787
[grunting]

00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:46.560
It's the power
of the Dog-Demon of the West!

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:50.333
Why?! Why must he
always get in my way?!

00:05:58.016 --> 00:05:59.118
[both gasp]

00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:00.955

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.994
- Are you all right?

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:05.397
What should we do?

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.967
- Get him to safety.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.473
We must hurry and get him inside
the Tree of Ages while we can.

00:06:10.508 --> 00:06:11.977
- Yes, all right!

00:06:13.681 --> 00:06:14.849

00:06:30.313 --> 00:06:32.017
- You summoned the Tenseiga!

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.353
- Nice, Towa!

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:35.123
Now grab it,
and let's get going!

00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:36.425
- All right!

What's the matter, Towa?

00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:49.184
- It won't budge!

00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:50.888
I can't get it out of here!

00:06:50.922 --> 00:06:52.792
- Inuyasha, didn't you say

00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:55.665
we have to have the Tenseiga
with us at the gate?

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:58.202
- That's right,
or the gate won't open.

00:06:58.236 --> 00:06:59.873
- You can do it!

00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:01.042
Pull the damn thing out!

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:04.048

00:07:23.186 --> 00:07:24.488
Hmm?

00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:26.560
- Mm, the "Up, up and away"
part's okay.

advanced fox magic

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:33.239
if you're gonna get airsick
whenever you use it?

00:07:33.272 --> 00:07:35.477
It's wasted on you.

I guess I was thinking

00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:41.355
about the Demon Slayers'
village just now.

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.261
I wonder how Sango
and the others are doing.

Hey, Sango, are you here?!

How have you been doing?

GYOKUTO: It's been ages!

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.871
So how did
your fox magic exams go, huh?

00:08:05.905 --> 00:08:07.842
- You meet
any cute girls out there?

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:10.413
- Or boys?
Meet any cute fox boys

00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:11.917
you could introduce me to?

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.019
- Poor guy.

00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:15.591
They're treating him
like he's a toy or something.

00:08:15.624 --> 00:08:16.927
- Little Shippo!
- But never mind that!

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.505
Hey! Moroha, Towa, Setsuna,
are you all right in there?!

00:08:22.538 --> 00:08:24.576
- Let me go right now! Enough!

00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:26.445

- Huh?

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:28.984
- Ohh!
- Sango!

00:08:29.018 --> 00:08:30.521

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.792
[gasps] Wait,

00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:36.032
you haven't found Kagome
and Inuyasha, have you?

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:37.000
- Huh?

00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:38.637
- No, I'm afraid not.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.144
However, I did learn
something very interesting.

00:08:42.177 --> 00:08:43.647
It seems their daughter Moroha

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.818
is making a killing
as a demon bounty hunter, and--

00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:47.722
- I know
where Moroha's parents are!

00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:49.859
They're right here,
inside this Black Pearl!

00:08:49.893 --> 00:08:51.028
- Huh?

00:08:51.062 --> 00:08:51.997
And by the way,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.268
Moroha isn't
making any money at all.

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.771
In fact, she's drowning in debt!

00:08:55.805 --> 00:09:00.013
- What'd you say?! Inuyasha and
Kagome are inside that thing?

00:09:00.046 --> 00:09:01.449

It's just like before!

00:09:37.387 --> 00:09:40.628
You've gotta pour all your
demon energy into the Tenseiga!

00:09:40.661 --> 00:09:42.130
- Like before?

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:45.336
- Right, when you brought
Setsuna back to life!

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.840

- It's just as if
the New Moon had begun!

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.965
That shows you how difficult
it is to wield the Tenseiga.

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:18.570
- I never knew
what she went through

00:10:18.604 --> 00:10:20.741

00:11:30.013 --> 00:11:31.282
- [gasps]

00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:36.693
- You did it!

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:39.398
- [gasps]

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:40.801
It really worked.

00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:43.139
- 'Course it did! Piece of cake.

00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:46.580
- Towa, do you still
have some power left?

00:11:46.613 --> 00:11:49.586
- I do. I wouldn't,
if it weren't for you two.

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:50.988
- Ah. [laughs]

00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:52.792
KAGOME: Are you all okay?

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:54.027
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

00:11:54.061 --> 00:11:55.230
- All right!

00:11:55.263 --> 00:11:57.602
Then let's hurry up
and get out of here!

00:11:57.635 --> 00:12:00.139
[ominous music playing]

00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:13.132
[Sesshomaru winces]

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.606
- Lord Sesshomaru.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.013
- Ohh. I can't believe
this is happening.

00:12:20.046 --> 00:12:23.352
At the rate
his Haku is draining away,

00:12:23.386 --> 00:12:25.390
he cannot last much longer.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.862
- Don't worry.

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:31.035
I'm sure that Towa's
on her way right now.

00:12:31.068 --> 00:12:32.838
- How can you be sure of that?

00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:36.211
- Because the Tenseiga
has gone to get her

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:37.447
and bring her here!

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.850
- Huh?

00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:40.888
- Have faith, Master Jaken,

00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:44.394
in Towa and the Tenseiga.

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:47.167
[birds chirping]

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.206
SANGO: You're saying
that Kagome and Inuyasha

00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:52.210
are trapped
within that Black Pearl?

00:12:52.243 --> 00:12:54.983
- That's right.
And now, on top of that,

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:57.788
Kirinmaru is trying
to kill them.

00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:01.663
- Well, then, girls...

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:03.667
- Yes, Mother?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.871
- It would seem
the time has finally come

00:13:05.904 --> 00:13:07.975
to put a certain
something to use,

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:11.983
the weapon I created
with your help,

00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:13.787
the Black Hiraikotsu.

00:13:15.023 --> 00:13:17.795
I shall send word to Miroku
to come at once.

00:13:17.828 --> 00:13:20.534
I want you two
to contact Kohaku and Hisui.

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:21.803
BOTH: All right!

00:13:21.836 --> 00:13:25.176
- I'll wait for Inuyasha
by Gozu and Mezu's gate.

00:13:25.209 --> 00:13:27.882
- I'd like to come along
with you, if that's all right!

00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:30.688
- Ah. You bet it's all right!

00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:32.257
Climb aboard!

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.426
Fox Magic!

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:36.031

SISTERS: Bye, Shippo!

00:13:44.716 --> 00:13:46.986
Take care of yourself!

- [gasps]

00:13:58.175 --> 00:13:59.077
I'm ready!

00:14:18.182 --> 00:14:19.151
- All right!

00:14:19.184 --> 00:14:21.321
Cross the bridge,
and we reach the gate.

00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:22.758
- [grunts]

00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:25.496

- [panting]

00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:33.112
- No offense, but are you sure

00:14:33.145 --> 00:14:35.483
you took the right exit
for the Black Pearl?

00:14:35.517 --> 00:14:36.519
- Positive!

00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:38.022
When we were on the border

00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:41.930
between this world and the next,
we came out through here!

00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:44.234
INUYASHA: Hey! Gozu and Mezu!

00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:46.271
We brought the Tenseiga with us!

00:14:46.305 --> 00:14:48.944
So come on!
Hurry up and let us through!

00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:50.881

[rumbling]

00:15:01.603 --> 00:15:04.341
- Look at that. Opened right up!

00:15:04.374 --> 00:15:08.215
- Finally. We can
get out of here at last.

00:15:08.249 --> 00:15:09.652
- Yeah.

00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:20.908
[gate slams]

00:15:25.016 --> 00:15:26.553
- Tenseiga...

00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:29.792
we thank you for helping us.

00:15:29.826 --> 00:15:31.696

- [grunting]

00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:43.553
- Towa, what's wrong?!

00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:47.962
- The Tenseiga, it's telling me
that I'm needed somewhere.

00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:50.066
- What's it mean?

00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:51.736
Why would it do that?

00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:53.874
Unless something's
happened to our father.

00:15:53.907 --> 00:15:55.243
- Like what?

00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:58.783
- Well, he was
fighting Kirinmaru, wasn't he?

00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:00.687
Hurry!
There's no time to waste!

00:16:00.721 --> 00:16:01.756
Come on!

00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:03.292
- Right!
- Right!

00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:05.531
[both panting]

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:06.699
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:08.002
INUYASHA: You all right?

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:09.070
KAGOME: Yeah.

00:16:09.104 --> 00:16:12.076
- Hey, Kagome! Inuyasha!

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.982
- Why, if it isn't Shippo.
How 'bout that?

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.218
- Hello, Shippo!

00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:17.855
- Kagome, are you all right?!

00:16:17.888 --> 00:16:19.692
- I'm fine.
- Hey, come on.

00:16:19.725 --> 00:16:21.729
Weren't you worried
at all about me?

00:16:21.763 --> 00:16:22.765
- No, not really.

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:25.303
- Moroha! Setsuna! Towa!

00:16:25.336 --> 00:16:26.305
- Yo!

00:16:26.338 --> 00:16:27.207
- Takechiyo!

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.710
- Oh, look what I've got!

00:16:28.743 --> 00:16:30.446
The Black Pearl,
I protected it!

00:16:30.479 --> 00:16:33.419
It wasn't easy
when Kirinmaru came after it,

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:34.254
I can tell you that!

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:36.826
- Hey, good for you, Takechiyo!

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.630
I couldn't have
done it better myself!

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:40.767
Hey!

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:42.203
- Unbelievable.

00:16:42.237 --> 00:16:43.540
When I think
of all the trouble

00:16:43.573 --> 00:16:45.409
this thing's been
for Kagome and me, I wanna--

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:47.380
- Wait, what are you doing?!
- Stop, Inuyasha!

00:16:47.413 --> 00:16:50.119
Your father's grave
lies within that pearl.

00:16:50.152 --> 00:16:52.223
- I'm sick of the sight
of his grave!

00:16:52.257 --> 00:16:54.060
- If you don't want it,
I'll take it.

00:16:54.094 --> 00:16:55.564
- Huh?
- But why?

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:59.839
- Well, I mean, after all,
you two spent 14 years in there.

00:16:59.872 --> 00:17:01.776
There's a lot of memories
in that pearl,

00:17:01.809 --> 00:17:04.281
and they're all precious to me.

00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:05.483
- Moroha.

00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:09.725
- There we are.

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:13.867
Now Grandpa's grave can rest
safely in Grandma's rouge.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.839
I figure that ought
to make them both happy.

00:17:16.873 --> 00:17:19.812
- You're a very kind girl,
Moroha.

00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:22.350
- Oh, you think so? [laughs]

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.156
- Right! Shippo...
- Huh?

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:26.893
- take us
to the Bone Eater's Well!

00:17:26.926 --> 00:17:28.295
- Wha?!

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:31.001
- Let's go! We gotta hurry!
It's urgent!

00:17:31.034 --> 00:17:32.504
- No way!
It's out of the question!

00:17:32.538 --> 00:17:34.842
I can't carry
that many passengers!

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:36.011

[stammers]

00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:40.721
I...

00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:46.031
Why do I get the feeling
I don't have a choice?

00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:48.369
- Oh, please!
Please, Mr. Shippo!

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:50.172
- [growls]

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:51.776
All right, then! I'll try it,

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:53.613
but don't say I didn't warn you!

00:18:30.954 --> 00:18:31.956
- Huh?

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.927
Moroha, you're not
going with them?

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.396
- Huh?

00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:36.666
Uh...

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:38.002
oh, well...

00:18:38.035 --> 00:18:39.237
- They're just gonna be dealing

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.408
with a lot
of tricky family issues,

00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:45.717
and you don't want
to get in their way, right?

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:46.919
- Right.

00:18:46.953 --> 00:18:48.823
- [chuckles]

00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:54.134

- [groans]

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.275

for just a little bit longer.

00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:01.916

they will be here very soon.

[footsteps splashing]

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.842

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:17.180
Could it be?

the silver-scaled curse?

00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:49.244
Are you all right?

00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:52.150
- I am.

00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:54.087

drained almost all of his Haku.

00:20:01.803 --> 00:20:04.642
At this rate,
he cannot last much longer.

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:07.848
You must absorb the demon energy
with the Kyuyokon!

00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:09.350
- Right, I understand!

00:20:09.384 --> 00:20:12.223

out of him!
