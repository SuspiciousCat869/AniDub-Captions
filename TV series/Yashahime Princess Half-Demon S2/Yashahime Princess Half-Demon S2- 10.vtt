00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.217
‐ So tomorrow's
the coming‐of‐age ceremony

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.952
for the Young Lord Kikunosuke?

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:21.522
‐ That's right.
And once the ceremony is over,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.091
he'll officially be
the leader of the clan.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:27.327
‐ I'm guessing that young lord's
your little brother, right?

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.063
‐ Yeah, he is.

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:33.200
But unlike me, he's timid
and easily manipulated,

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:36.270
so he's become the puppet of
the head elder, Shogen Mamiana!

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.305
‐ All the local
raccoon dog demons

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.208
reluctantly serve
and obey Shogen as well,

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.678
even as the taxes he demands
get heavier and heavier.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.280
‐ You're raccoon dogs.

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:48.849
Can't you just disguise
pebbles and leaves as money

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.284
and pay your taxes with that?

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:53.187
‐ That won't work against
another raccoon dog demon.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.689
‐ Anyway, what's the deal
with this damn Shogen

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.291
and his Full Moon Raccoon Dog?!

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:59.826
I still can't believe
my Crimson Backlash Wave

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.028
had no effect on them!

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.297
And that stupid eyeball
that can paralyze you

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.066
with a beam of light,
that's like cheating!

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.268
TAKECHIYO: Yeah, we can't get
anywhere near that tower

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:10.204
while the moon is out.
It's too risky.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.206
‐ Uh, wait.
We're running out of time here,

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.142
and now you're saying the place
is off limits to us at night?

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.245
‐ Only when the moon's out,
and it won't be out tonight.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.480
‐ Huh?
‐ Last night was a dark moon,

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:22.916
which means there will be
a new moon tonight.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.318
That changes everything.

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.118
BOTH: Ah.

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:27.721
MOROHA: A new moon, huh?

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.724
Great! Tonight it is, then!

‐ Ah, that's it.

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:31.078
I'd sensed Lady Towa's
demon power getting weaker.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.947
Must be the New Moon.

00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:38.085
TOWA: I see.
So tonight's my New Moon.

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:40.654
[gasps]
I wonder if Setsuna's okay.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.190
‐ Hmm? What makes you say that?

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.092
‐ She doesn't know
what it's like,

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:47.461
losing her powers
during a New Moon,

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:51.632
because the Dream Butterfly
was stealing her dreams before.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:52.833
But tonight...

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:55.068
‐ In other words,

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:58.872
she's becoming fully human
like Lady Towa right about now.

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.542
‐ Ohh! I can't believe it!

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:04.444
I should have been by her side
at a time like this.

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:06.346
What should I do?

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.748
‐ Lady Towa.

RIKU: <i>Such feelings of guilt</i>

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:15.189
I remember Madam
once having similar feelings.

KOHAKU: So this is Yukinyudo.

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:08.842

the demon's brought trouble to.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:11.512
He's terrorizing
all the villages in the area!

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:13.313

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.653
so I'm bringing
the young lady upstairs

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.321

be without my demon powers.

<i>What a terrible feeling.</i>

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:34.968
Did Towa feel
this same sense of helplessness

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:36.703

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.706

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.208
why don't you put these on?

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:43.710
It's going to be cold tonight.

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:45.512
They're of high quality.

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:48.882
A court noble who often stays
here leaves these as payment,

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:51.418
but they're far too nice
for us to wear.

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.520

I dislike these nights
of the new moon.

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:45.973

For no particularly deep reason.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.311

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.323

00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:27.981
we both know if you return
the Rainbow Pearls to your eyes,

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:30.350
you would have
even greater demon powers.

00:07:30.384 --> 00:07:32.886
So why, then,
haven't you done so?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.322
‐ They have grown
stronger than ever,

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:37.090
but at the cost of being infused

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:40.093
with memories
I do not care to see.

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:43.697
Hence, I will only use them
as a last resort.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.001
However, that being said,
this Silver Rainbow Pearl

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:52.272

that I find very interesting.

There's nothing I can do but
to just keep believing in her.

00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:01.949

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.653
What a day. I remember it well.

00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:07.521
‐ What?

00:08:07.554 --> 00:08:09.756
Riku, are you saying
that you were around

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.358
when Setsuna and I were born?

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:12.893
‐ [laughs]

00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:15.395
I've often been told
I look young for my age.

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:18.298
There was also a lunar eclipse

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:25.506
‐ Well...

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:27.374
‐ It's really no surprise.

00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:30.511
After all, Riku has the very
same memories as my father,

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:33.413
and my father traveled
all over the world.

00:08:33.447 --> 00:08:34.982
‐ What do you mean?

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.350
‐ Oh, didn't you know?

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:39.686
Riku was created from a piece
of my father's broken horn.

00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:47.361
[sighs]

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:49.396
Yes, it's absolutely true,
Lady Towa,

00:08:49.429 --> 00:08:51.899
and I would have told you
in my own good time.

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:55.068
‐ I had no right.
I'm sorry, Riku.

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:57.237
‐ So that's what you meant

00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:59.439
when you called yourself
an imitation

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:02.676
and kept saying that your master
had abandoned you.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.179
‐ I imagine that...

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:06.880
you must hate me now.

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:08.482
‐ Why would I?
‐ [gasps]

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:12.119

I told you once before,

00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:14.788
you are who you are.

00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:16.523
So you're not perfect.

00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:18.292
It's not a big deal.

00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:20.294
‐ [gasps]

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:23.096
Lady Towa,
you are much too kind.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.134
[sighs] I'm sure tears
aren't good for my injured eyes.

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:28.669

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:30.070

RIKU: Please, Miss Rion,
don't laugh.

00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:35.709
It's in very poor taste,
you know.

[pen scribbling]

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:43.617
‐ As you can see, I'll be
practically useless tonight

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.485
because of the New Moon.

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.287
But unfortunately...

00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:49.990
that won't stop demons
from coming after me.

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:51.992

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:53.627

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.528
I realize that‐‐

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:57.364
that it's a lot
to ask of the rest of you,

00:09:57.397 --> 00:09:59.666
and I hate
to burden you with it.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.970
[sighs] But it will only be
for this one night.

00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:05.873
And if it's any compensation,

00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:08.675
I've written down
several countermeasures

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:11.278

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:16.350

whether to use them or not.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:22.890
I had no idea

00:10:22.923 --> 00:10:26.593
just how exhausting it is
to go without sleep.

00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:34.067
‐ She wrote a list
and then went to sleep.

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:36.136
‐ A list? What kind?

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.572
‐ This kind. They're
suggested countermeasures

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:41.742
for dealing with the demons
that will be showing up tonight.

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:43.577
‐ Hmm. I see.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.381
She put all this together
in that short amount of time?

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:48.582
I'm impressed.

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:50.684
‐ [breathing softly]

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:53.420
[waves crashing]

00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:56.023
‐ I don't get it!
What is this thing?!

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:58.992
‐ They call it a hang glider
in the other world.

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:01.128
The notorious "Phantom Thief"
uses one of these,

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.829
and I know that,
because I saw him

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:04.331
on this thing they call a TV!

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:07.301
‐ My, you're so knowledgeable
about so many things.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.970
You truly are
Lady Kagome's daughter.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.072
‐ I don't care
how knowledgeable you are!

00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:14.107
‐ Hmm?
‐ We saw how well you did

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:16.176
against Shogen Mamiana
the last time you took him on!

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.412
Why would it be
any different this time?!

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:19.913
Oh, this whole thing
is pointless!

00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:21.281
We might as well just give up

00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:22.983
and go back
to the corpse dealer!

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:26.086
‐ I'm not one to give up
'til the job is done!

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:27.387
Speaking of which...

00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:29.489
I still can't get my head
around my parents

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:31.992
doing a job
on the Full Moon Raccoon Dog.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.494
‐ Well, it was
Lady Kagome's spirit power

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:35.696
that really did the trick.

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:37.764
‐ My mom's spirit power?

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:39.132
You mean it wasn't my dad

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:41.301
who defeated
the Full Moon Raccoon Dog?

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:44.671
‐ No, Shogen was the one
your father, Inuyasha, defeated.

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:48.575
‐ Yeah. Now that you mention it,
that sounds familiar.

00:11:48.609 --> 00:11:51.278
‐ Hey, if Moroha's parents
could defeat them, who knows?

00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:53.514
Maybe we can, too!
How did they do it, Hachi?

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:57.251
‐ Very well, then.
I shall tell you the story.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.933
HACHI: This all happened
more than a decade ago.

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:15.202
I was already assistant
head elder of the clan,

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:19.106
a position my family has held
since my grandfather's time.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:20.674
When I was younger, however,

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:24.044
I liked to tag along with
Master Miroku on his adventures,

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.747
which led me to develop
a wanderlust of my own.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.881
[no audible dialogue]

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:30.584
So that's why I had
very little interest

00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:34.087
in the internal conflicts
of the Mamidaira Clan.

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.490
That is, until one night,

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:38.492
when we were holding
a funeral ceremony

00:12:38.525 --> 00:12:41.161
for our former lord,
who had just passed away.

00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:43.564
It took place
during a full moon.

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:44.498
‐ Eh?

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.568
BOTH: Where's the party?!

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.203
‐ Eh?
‐ [laughs]

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:50.704
‐ ♪♪ Cherry blossoms and bamboo ♪♪

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:52.239
♪♪ We have got a dance to do ♪♪

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.141
♪♪ We have come
to dance for you ♪♪

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:55.976
♪♪ Shogen, want to join us two? ♪♪

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:57.311
Sho‐gen! Sho‐gen!

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:59.413
‐ [grumbles]
‐ Sho‐gen! Sho‐gen!

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:00.514
‐ [wails]
‐ Sho‐gen!

00:13:00.547 --> 00:13:01.315
‐ Sho‐gen!
‐ [cheering]

00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:02.816
SHOGEN: Hell, why not?! [laughs]

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.418
‐ Yeah!
‐ Yeah!

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.687
HACHI: Unable to contain
their excitement,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.023
the raccoon dogs began to party
like there was no tomorrow.

00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:11.725
‐ [grunts]
‐ HACHI: At last,

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:13.894
Shogen Mamiana
got so carried away

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:16.096
that he revealed
his true intentions.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.565
‐ From this moment,
I, Shogen Mamiana,

00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:21.235
take complete control
of the Mamidaira Clan!

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:23.036
Henceforth,
everyone will be taxed

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.738
at a higher rate than ever!

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:26.440
‐ But Shogen, sir,
be reasonable!

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:29.743
‐ [murmuring]
‐ Anyone who defies me...

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:31.311
[both yelp]

00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:32.246
[coughing]

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.748
‐ will end up like those two!

00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:36.049
[laughs]

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:37.551
MIROKU: Hold it right there!

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:40.754
Since you've finally shown
your true colors,

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:43.357
then so shall we!

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.558
‐ What the...

00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:45.759
‐ [rumbling]
‐ Huh?

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:47.027
[Inuyasha grunts]

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.565
‐ Who are you people?!

00:13:51.598 --> 00:13:55.269
‐ Well, this fellow to my left
is Hachiemon of Awa...

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:58.038
and we're all
his merry teammates!

00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:01.408
‐ All right then.

00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:03.610
Let's get this
over with, shall we?

00:14:03.644 --> 00:14:05.145
‐ Hiraikotsu!

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:08.615
‐ Wind Scar!

00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:11.351
‐ [wails]

00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:17.057
You cursed wretch, how dare
you disfigure my face?!

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.259
You'll pay for that!

00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:22.062
‐ [growling]

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:24.898
‐ There is so much demon energy
around that creature.

00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:26.567
It's almost overwhelming.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.336
‐ Yeah, this might not
have been the best idea!

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.904
‐ Pull yourself together, Hachi!

00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:33.240
It's your people
that we're trying to save!

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:34.641
‐ [laughs]

00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:35.909
‐ Eh? Huh?

00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:37.444
‐ [yelps]

00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:38.445
[women laugh]

00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:41.181
‐ Well, well!
Aren't you a pretty sight?

00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:44.117
‐ Hachi, do not let
your heart be seduced!

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:45.686
‐ You must fight off
the temptation

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.821
with fearless,
unwavering courage!

00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:49.022
‐ Yes, sir.

00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:51.792
‐ Wow, it would seem
your years of hard training

00:14:51.825 --> 00:14:53.861
are finally paying off, Miroku.

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.796
‐ It's not just that, Sango.

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:57.931
I already have you by my side.

00:14:57.965 --> 00:15:01.835
There is no spell that can make
my heart waver in its devotion!

00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:03.437
‐ Strange time to be flirting.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.771
‐ That's what I thought.

00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:05.973
‐ [Sango grunts]
‐ [both yelp]

00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:08.575
‐ [Miroku grunts]
‐ [women wail]

00:15:08.609 --> 00:15:09.776
‐ That was too easy.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.211
‐ That was extraordinary!

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.046
‐ Yeah, right.
If I hadn't been here,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.282
you probably would have
run off with one of them.

00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:17.184
‐ Anyways, as for you, Shogen...

00:15:17.217 --> 00:15:19.920
Vengeful spirit, begone!

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:21.488
‐ Hmm? [growls]

00:15:21.522 --> 00:15:22.523
Ohh!

00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:26.693
Not bad, Monk. [growls]

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:28.095
‐ [Miroku gasps]
‐ Hey!

00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:29.396
The big one's getting away!

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:36.470
‐ [panting]
‐ HACHI: Huh?

00:15:36.503 --> 00:15:38.405
‐ [growling]

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:41.675
‐ Hachi, you help Lady Kagome.

00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:42.676
‐ Right.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:45.145
‐ Lady Kagome,
please rely on Hachi.

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:46.780
‐ Right. I'm on it.

00:15:46.813 --> 00:15:49.283
‐ [sighs]
Wish I had my Wind Tunnel.

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:52.486
I'm counting on you
to seal that apparition away!

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.654
‐ Leave it to me!

00:15:54.922 --> 00:15:57.191
‐ To us raccoon dog demons,

00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:59.560
the Full Moon Raccoon Dog
is a guardian spirit,

00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:02.696
so it might be problematic
if you purified him.

00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:04.998
‐ Yes, Hachi, I know.
Don't worry!

00:16:05.032 --> 00:16:06.633
Get ready!

00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:08.402
Arrow of Sealing!

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:13.707
‐ Lady Kagome, watch out!
‐ Huh?

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.709
‐ [growls]

00:16:15.742 --> 00:16:16.710
‐ Whoa!

00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:26.553
‐ If you're hit
by that beam of light,

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:28.422
you'll be unable to move!

00:16:28.455 --> 00:16:32.059
‐ Wait. Go up higher and
get us directly above them!

00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:34.061
‐ Directly above?!

00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:36.330
Now, Hachi!

00:16:36.363 --> 00:16:38.932
Turn around
and dive straight at them!

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:41.568
‐ Aye, aye, ma'am! Hang on!

00:16:43.871 --> 00:16:45.739
‐ [yells]

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:59.286
‐ [roars]

00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:03.290
‐ We did it! We defeated him!

00:17:03.323 --> 00:17:07.194
‐ Not quite. That seal
won't hold him forever.

00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:09.096
‐ You all right, Kagome?

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:11.798
‐ Don't worry about me.
What happened to Shogen?

00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:14.368
SANGO: I'm afraid he got away.

00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:17.371
MIROKU: When we finally managed
to repel his demon magic,

00:17:17.404 --> 00:17:19.173
he was gone.

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:22.009
‐ You're going to regret this,
I promise you!

00:17:23.577 --> 00:17:26.446
HACHI: After that,
Master Miroku and Lady Kagome

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.049
worked together
to fashion a more powerful seal

00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:32.085
to place
on the Full Moon Raccoon Dog.

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:34.121
‐ That was quite a story, Hachi.

00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:35.222
Thanks for sharing.

00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:37.024
‐ Yeah, it was real nice.

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:38.759
But anyways, you two,
we can't do anything

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:41.962
'til I recover my bow and arrows
from Shogen Mamiana‐‐

00:17:41.995 --> 00:17:44.164
[gasps] Hey, wait a second!

00:17:44.198 --> 00:17:46.567
You said my dad repelled
Shogen's demon magic,

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.835
but you didn't say how.

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:49.536
‐ Well, I can't say for certain,

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.838
because I didn't witness it.

00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:52.573
I suppose
you'd really have to ask

00:17:52.606 --> 00:17:54.208
someone who was on the scene.

00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:55.742
‐ Yeah, but I
thought you told me

00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:57.244
that both my parents were dead.

00:17:57.277 --> 00:17:59.213
‐ I actually didn't see that,
either.

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:02.049
‐ We could always ask
Monk Miroku or Lady Sango.

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.050
They were there.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.819
‐ Maybe, but how do we ask them?

00:18:05.853 --> 00:18:07.621
‐ [whistles]

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:09.423
‐ [squawks]

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:11.758
‐ We'll let Takamaru
take care of it!

00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:14.328
‐ Yeah, I hadn't
thought of that!

00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:15.596
‐ [squawks]

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.332
‐ Oh, yeah!

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:21.134
‐ Man, look at this view!
‐ [Takechiyo grumbles]

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:22.970
‐ Go on, Takamaru!

00:18:23.003 --> 00:18:24.538
‐ [squawks]

00:18:26.139 --> 00:18:29.209
‐ So, Mr. Hachi,
what's the rest of the story?

00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:31.311
‐ Oh, right. Where was I?

00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:33.981
Ah, yes.
All would have been fine

00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:36.917
if Lady Kagome's seal
had held up forever,

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.352
but one fateful night,

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:42.022
a terrible storm swept in
and hit this island.

00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:47.427
That's when
Shogen Mamiana returned

00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:50.330
and freed
the Full Moon Raccoon Dog.

00:18:50.364 --> 00:18:52.533
‐ [crying]

00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:56.970
‐ He then quickly seized control
of the Mamidaira Clan.

00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:00.741
‐ [laughing]

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:04.411
‐ What's more, Shogen even tried
to kill the rightful heir,

00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:08.048
Master Takechiyo,
by placing a curse on him.

00:19:08.081 --> 00:19:09.716
[laughter continues]

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.618
[snoring]

00:19:13.053 --> 00:19:15.556
‐ There.
I managed to remove the curse.

00:19:15.589 --> 00:19:19.927
‐ [sighs] Now Master Takechiyo
has no one left in the castle

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.696
to protect him,
aside from my unworthy self.

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:24.231
‐ That's a problem.

00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:27.100
And with Lady Kagome
and Inuyasha gone,

00:19:27.134 --> 00:19:28.402
we have no way of sealing

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:30.304
the Full Moon Raccoon Dog,
either.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.673
If he remains here
on this island,

00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:36.109
the young lord is
not destined to live very long.

00:19:36.143 --> 00:19:37.878
‐ What should we do?

00:19:37.911 --> 00:19:39.246
‐ Hmm.

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:43.684
There is one place I could
take him where he might be safe.

00:19:43.717 --> 00:19:46.420
HACHI: And that's
the whole story.

00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:49.323
TAKECHIYO: Yeah, Monk Miroku
took me to Mr. Jyubei.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.191
He made
the corpse dealer promise

00:19:51.225 --> 00:19:53.227
that he'd keep me
hidden and safe.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.762
‐ Wow. So that's what happened.

00:19:55.796 --> 00:19:56.930
‐ [wind gusts]
‐ [gasps]

00:19:56.964 --> 00:19:58.432
Whoa!

00:19:58.465 --> 00:19:59.800
Hey! An updraft!

00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:00.801
Now we're talkin'!

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:02.269
BOTH: Whoa!

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:03.203
MOROHA: Look!

00:20:03.237 --> 00:20:05.105
That eyeball thing
on top of the tower

00:20:05.138 --> 00:20:06.406
is sleeping on the job!

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.709
Now's my chance to get
my bow and arrows back

00:20:08.742 --> 00:20:09.810
from Shogen Mamiana!

00:20:09.843 --> 00:20:11.745
[both yelling]

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:16.750
[breathing softly]

00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:20.387
[rumbling]

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.622
[Yukinyudo laughs]

00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:23.190
So that inn down there

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.592
is where Sesshomaru's daughter
is staying?

00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:27.027
‐ [jabbering]

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.729
[chime rings]

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.532
‐ [gasps]

00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:33.233
Rion, stay back!

00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:36.036
‐ Lady Towa, you might have
forgotten you won't be able

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:38.739
to use the Zanseiken
or the Kyuyokon tonight,

00:20:38.772 --> 00:20:42.209
so I think it might be better
if we left this to him.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.678
‐ But Riku can't fight, either.

00:20:47.748 --> 00:20:48.715
[chime rings]

00:20:53.654 --> 00:20:55.389
‐ That was brilliant, Riku.

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:56.223
‐ Amazing.

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.825
Not a single movement
was wasted.

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:02.196
‐ There.
That should take care of it.

00:21:02.229 --> 00:21:04.631
[gasps]

00:21:04.665 --> 00:21:07.601
Did Madam release these papers?

00:21:07.634 --> 00:21:09.903
Get Lady Towa away from here,
Miss Rion, quickly!

00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:12.673
[both gasp]

00:21:12.706 --> 00:21:14.341
[ominous music playing]

00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:17.744
‐ What is this?!

00:21:17.778 --> 00:21:19.346
‐ Lady Towa!

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:20.614
‐ Rion, get away!

00:21:23.784 --> 00:21:24.885
‐ Lady Towa!

00:21:24.918 --> 00:21:26.520
No.

00:21:26.553 --> 00:21:27.988
‐ Miss Rion, it would seem

00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:30.524
that the Madam
has taken Lady Towa away.

00:21:30.557 --> 00:21:32.025
‐ My Aunt Zero?

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.831
‐ Where am I?

00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:39.933
‐ [Zero laughs]
‐ [gasps]

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:40.934
Zero!

00:21:40.968 --> 00:21:42.503
‐ [laughs]

00:21:42.536 --> 00:21:44.137
Without your demon power,

00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:46.907
you're easy prey
for my illusion spell.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.141
‐ [gasps]

00:21:48.175 --> 00:21:51.111
‐ My, my. What a strange
little girl we have here.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:55.916
The sorrow in her eyes
is subtle, but intense.

00:21:55.949 --> 00:21:59.686
‐ A grieving heart
and tears of distress.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.988
What a feast.

00:22:01.021 --> 00:22:04.558
Enjoy your meal,
Lord Nanahoshi.

00:22:04.591 --> 00:22:06.493
[both laughing]

00:22:10.531 --> 00:22:12.633
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:40.487 --> 00:23:42.422
[music playing]

00:23:42.456 --> 00:23:44.958
SETSUNA: <i>Tonight is</i>
<i>my first New Moon,</i>

00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:48.061
<i>when I become human</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:51.064
<i>Towa, be careful</i>
<i>of the eternity bug.</i>

00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:54.434
<i>And, Moroha, you will</i>
<i>need Takechiyo's help</i>

00:23:54.468 --> 00:23:58.172
if you're to counter Shogen's
World Reversal technique.

00:23:58.205 --> 00:23:59.873
Next time on Yashahime:

00:23:59.907 --> 00:24:03.010
<i>"Battle on the New Moon,</i>
<i>Part 2."</i>

00:24:03.043 --> 00:24:06.346
<i>I leave the rest</i>
<i>in your hands, Hisui.</i>
