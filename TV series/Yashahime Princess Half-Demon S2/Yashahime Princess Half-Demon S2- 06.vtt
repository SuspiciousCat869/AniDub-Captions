TOWA: <i>Soon after we were born,</i>

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.478
Kirinmaru's sister Zero
placed the silver‐scale curse

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:13.947
<i>on our mother Rin.</i>
<i>It's a fatal curse</i>

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.583
that causes the victim's body
<i>to rot away.</i>

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:19.853
<i>What's more, Zero bound</i>
<i>our mother's life to hers</i>

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:22.523
<i>by a thread of fate,</i>
<i>making it impossible</i>

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.491
<i>to kill one</i>
<i>without killing the other.</i>

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.127
<i>Since then, our mother</i>
<i>had been surviving</i>

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.595
<i>within the Tree of Ages,</i>

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:31.565
<i>using the Dream Butterfly</i>
<i>to receive Setsuna's sleep</i>

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.934
<i>and stall the progression</i>
<i>of the curse.</i>

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.270
<i>But when Sesshomaru</i>
<i>killed the butterfly,</i>

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:39.206
<i>time began</i>
<i>to move again for her.</i>

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.842
<i>To save our mother,</i>
<i>we must track down Zero</i>

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.544
<i>and sever</i>
<i>their shared thread of fate</i>

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.045
<i>before we can defeat her.</i>

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.880
<i>With the curse</i>
<i>progressing again,</i>

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:49.216
<i>there's no time to waste!</i>

A Feudal Fairytale, Yashahime.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.420
<i>We'll keep moving forward,</i>

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.689
<i>overcoming</i>
<i>the hurdles of destiny!</i>

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.627
[birds chirping]

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.735
It's been two days now.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.505
I wonder if she'll ever wake up.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:54.308
‐ [breathing softly]

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.944
‐ She is catching up
on all the sleep she lost

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:59.913
because of the Dream Butterfly,
I guess.

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:02.783
‐ Towa, would you mind
coming outside for a moment?

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.017
‐ Sure.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.588
Setsuna, I'll be back
in a little bit,

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:09.289
so sweet dreams, okay?

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.525
[sighs]

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:19.933
‐ [breathes softly]

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:22.636
‐ Word is that something's
been ravaging the fields

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.204
in the next village over.

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:26.240
People are saying
it might be the work

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:27.908
of an apparition or worse.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.177
‐ Got it. I'll check it out.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.892
‐ Aha! So you're finally awake!

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:47.694
‐ [grunts] Princess Aiya,
what are you‐‐

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:48.996
And where...

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.798
‐ I had you carried
to my father's mansion.

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:52.733
‐ [grunts]

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.269
What have you got me in?!

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:58.405
‐ Oh, I think you look
real nice in that. Take a look.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:01.708
‐ In a kimono?! Ridiculous!

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.043
‐ Shh!

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.711
Don't make a fuss.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:07.681
‐ Give me back my clothes! Now!

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:08.682
‐ Wait!

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.484
[crying] Please...

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:14.555
won't you at least listen
to what I have to say?

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.490
[crying]

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:17.991
‐ [sighs]

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:22.896
What? You want me
to take your lessons for you?

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.165
‐ Luckily,
not only are you and I

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.967
just about
the same age and height,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.169
but the nun who's coming here
to teach me etiquette

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:31.371
has never met me in person
before today.

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:34.875
So in other words,
you are the perfect body double!

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:36.543
‐ No chance!

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:37.544
‐ Wait!

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:39.646
[crying] Please.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.015
I hadn't quite finished.

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:43.917
Just hear me out, I beg you.

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:45.419
‐ [sighs]

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.355
‐ The life of a princess
might seem lovely and elegant,

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:52.059
but it's actually
very lonely and miserable.

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:55.629
We're just a tool for arranging
marriages of convenience.

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:58.432
‐ Marriages of convenience, huh?

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.535
‐ From the time we are little
until we come of age,

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:03.136
we spend every waking hour

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.072
being forced to learn
deportment and etiquette

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.975
and the rituals and traditions
of a samurai family,

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:09.343
all so we can be married off

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:12.613
to some lord that we've
never even met before.

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.081
From the moment I was born,

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.383
I have never had
a shred of freedom.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:20.020
Oh, what a miserable
and lonely life I've led!

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:23.190
All I'm asking

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:25.993
is for you to help me
enjoy one day of freedom!

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:27.928
Oh, please! I'm begging you!

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:30.531

Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup...

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.371
‐ Hah! Free at last!
‐ [servant continues grunting]

00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:40.073
Free from having to deal
with some bothersome old nun

00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:41.909
shoving etiquette lessons
down my throat!

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:43.143
‐ Princess, please!

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:44.745
You must not show
your face here.

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:46.013
People will recognize you!

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:47.915
‐ Sorry. I got excited.

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.550
‐ So where to, Your Highness?

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:50.817
‐ The harbor!

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.953
‐ The harbor? But why?

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:55.522
‐ I heard that a strange
and dangerous creature

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:56.657
keeps showing up there,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.526
and that is something I am
just dying to see in person,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.661
so pick up the pace!

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:03.263
[laugh echoes]

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:07.100
‐ [grumbles]

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:10.604
‐ [high‐pitched]
Very pleased to meet you.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:12.673
My name is Kin'u,

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:16.610
and I will be your instructor
in etiquette today.

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.812
‐ And I am Aiya.

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:20.147
[gasps]

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.215
‐ Huh?

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:23.183
‐ Hisui?

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:25.319
‐ [normal] Wait. Setsuna?!

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:26.486
[birds chirping]

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.621
HISUI: I see.

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:31.124
Sounds like Princess Aiya's
up to her old tricks again.

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:32.693
‐ I should have known.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.562
To think she actually had me
feeling sympathy for her.

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:37.164
How gullible can I get?

00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:40.501
‐ [chuckles] Looks like
being with Towa has changed you.

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:43.737
I never expected to hear you say
you felt sympathy for anyone.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.639
‐ Towa has
nothing to do with it!

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.341
So why are you here, anyway?

00:06:47.374 --> 00:06:50.043
‐ My older sister
forced me into this.

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:53.046
‐ Your sister?
You mean the equipment maker?

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:56.850
‐ No, no, not Gyokuto,

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:58.785
but Kin'u,
my other older sister.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.488
My sisters are actually twins,
like you.

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:05.926
‐ [purring]

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.394
‐ Oh, Hisui!
‐ Hmm?

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.097
‐ It's been a while, hasn't it?
How are you?

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.199
‐ Oh, hello, Kin'u.

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:14.935
‐ Grooming Kirara, huh?

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.304
Well, you're just
as busy as ever, I see.

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:20.440
‐ Oh, not really, no.
Well, a little bit.

00:07:20.474 --> 00:07:21.842
Uh, so anyway, Sister,

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.777
what brings you
all the way out here?

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.779
‐ I had a favor to ask,

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.916
but I can see you're busy
with your grooming job and all,

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.785
so I probably shouldn't
even bother you with it.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.687
‐ [sighs]

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.789
What? What do I have to do?

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.257
‐ Really?! You'll do it?!

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:39.393
What a good brother you are!

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:43.163
[laugh echoes]

00:07:43.197 --> 00:07:45.799
‐ My sister's being
well paid by His Excellency

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.201
to give his daughter
etiquette lessons,

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:49.803
but she's getting me
to do all the actual work

00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:52.739
because she's got
"matters to attend to."

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:54.074
‐ What matters?

00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:56.677
‐ Nothing actually important,
I bet.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.612
‐ [rooster crows]
‐ [market chatter]

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:03.083
[children cheer, laugh]

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:05.719
HISUI: Knowing my sister,
she's probably out having fun

00:08:05.752 --> 00:08:09.489
spending the large advance
she got for the job I'm doing.

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.130
‐ Here is
the weapon you ordered.

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:19.132
‐ Thank you for your trouble.

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:21.602
‐ Oh, it's our pleasure,
really.

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:22.970
‐ One more thing.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:26.206
Tell your Uncle Kohaku
I have a job for him.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.608
‐ Eh?

00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:31.211
‐ [sighs] My sister's such
a smooth‐talking manipulator.

00:08:31.245 --> 00:08:33.247
She's just like
my father that way.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.916
‐ Your father, Monk Miroku?

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:38.919
‐ Oh, yeah.
My father, my sisters,

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:40.354
even my mother,

00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:43.123
frankly, they're
a handful to live with.

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:45.526
‐ [wood clatters]
‐ Someone's coming.

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:51.231
[grinding]

00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:54.801
[high‐pitched] Now let's begin
by composing some waka poetry.

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:57.471
‐ You expect me
to write a whole poem?

00:08:57.504 --> 00:09:01.275
‐ Indeed. It's all a part
of a princess's education.

00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:03.343
Waka poetry is just as important

00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:05.445
as the etiquette
of a tea ceremony.

00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:06.413
‐ Uh...

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.452
‐ So many nuns have tried

00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:14.388
and failed to teach
my daughter etiquette,

00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:17.024
but I finally have
a good feeling about this one.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.425
Her fee was enormous,

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.627
but I'm starting
to think it was worth it.

00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:22.529
[laughs]

00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:26.667
[both sigh]

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.269
‐ [normal] Now that you
have prepared the ink, Princess,

00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:31.839
why don't you try
composing that poem?

00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:34.208
‐ He's gone now,
so you can drop the charade.

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:36.176
‐ Well, we might as well
finish the job,

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.911
since, you know,
I'm already here.

00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:40.047
‐ I wouldn't even
know how to begin!

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.250
‐ "Good poetry is less
about skill or education

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:46.186
"than what lies
in the poet's heart, people say,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.523
but it is with practice
that one gains proficiency."

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:50.324
‐ [grumbles]

00:09:50.357 --> 00:09:52.492
‐ The words
of Fujiwara no Tameie.

00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:55.229
Now why don't we have you
read some waka poetry first

00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:58.031
to familiarize you
with the form?

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.434
‐ I'm back.

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:01.969
Huh?

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:03.437
She's gone.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.404
Setsuna?

00:10:05.506 --> 00:10:06.573
Setsuna!

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:08.141
Hey, Setsuna!

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:09.309
‐ What's the matter?

00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:11.245
‐ It's Setsuna.
She's disappeared!

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:14.915
‐ Oh, well, perhaps she just
woke up and went out for a walk.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.318
There's no need to worry.
I'm sure she's fine.

00:10:18.352 --> 00:10:20.020
‐ Setsuna.

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:25.259
‐ I've read it.

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:26.326
‐ Well done.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.962
‐ Why are we doing this
when we don't have to?

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:31.031
‐ It's good to do
once in a while.

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:33.166
My father and mother
always had this to say,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.703
"Never neglect one's education
and cultural enrichment."

00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:38.305
‐ Monk Miroku said that?

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:41.041
‐ Uh‐huh. I know it's
kind of hard to believe,

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:44.478
but he always insisted on me
getting a good education.

00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:47.247
I always thought I'd grow up
to be a monk like him,

00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:49.583
so I made sure
not to neglect my studies

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:51.585
and did my best to learn.

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:54.054
‐ So why didn't you
follow in his footsteps

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:55.589
and become a Buddhist monk?

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:58.659
‐ Because my sister Kin'u
got there before I did.

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:02.429
Then my other sister Gyokuto
took over my mother's workshop,

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:05.966
so before long, I realized
I had nowhere to go.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.869
I felt as though
I'd lost my path in life.

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:13.273
My uncle was the one who finally
helped me to get back on track.

00:11:13.307 --> 00:11:15.576
‐ [shrieks]

00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:18.846
‐ [gasps]

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:20.280
‐ [grunts]

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:21.982
‐ [roars]

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.750
[warbles]

00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:25.285
‐ [gasps]

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:26.587
[panting]

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.255
[yelps]

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:29.756
‐ [laughs]

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.860
‐ [panting]

00:11:32.893 --> 00:11:34.561
‐ [roars]

00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:35.662
‐ Hisui!

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.264
‐ [gasping]

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:39.266
‐ [chuckles]

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:40.667
‐ [gasps]

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.369
‐ [groans]

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.705
‐ Hisui, are you all right?

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:47.374
‐ I'm fine, Uncle. Thank you.

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:48.475
‐ Take cover!

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.778
‐ [laughs]

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:53.981
[shrieks]

00:11:57.618 --> 00:11:59.987
‐ [roars]
‐ [yells]

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:05.292
[winces]

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:06.293
‐ Uncle!

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:08.896
[narrating] My uncle
never thought of giving up.

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:10.664
Even when his face got scarred,

00:12:10.697 --> 00:12:14.067
he kept on fighting to save
the villagers from that demon.

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:17.638
Seeing his bravery
sparked something inside me.

00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:21.175
That's when I knew I wanted
to be a demon slayer like him.

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:23.777
‐ So that's what happened.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.345
‐ Yeah. And to be honest,

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:27.347
it was good
to get away from my family.

00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:30.484
You know, as the youngest of
the siblings, I'm always treated

00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:33.020
like the baby of the group
when I'm around them.

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:37.591
[chuckles] Grateful as I am,
family can be a real pain.

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:40.360
‐ Is that so?

00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:43.063
I don't really know what
it's like to have a family.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.299
It's a foreign concept to me.

00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:46.900
‐ [panting]

00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:48.669
‐ Someone's coming again.

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:49.903
‐ Help us!

00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:52.072
A demon has captured
the princess!

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.473
BOTH: Wait! What?!

00:12:53.507 --> 00:12:54.875
‐ Setsuna!

00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:56.877
Where are you, Setsuna?!

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.545
[panting]

00:13:00.681 --> 00:13:02.015
Oh, man.

00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:04.952
Where's Moroha
when you need her?

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:07.654
Did she really have
to go bounty hunting now?

00:13:07.688 --> 00:13:09.189
ALL: Run for it! Run!

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:11.358
It's Moroha the Demon Killer!

00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:14.394
‐ Hey, hold on! Come back!
[panting]

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:17.197
Just when I finally got
my debt down to one ryou.

00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:19.399
What the hell is going on here?

00:13:32.513 --> 00:13:33.847
HISUI: Unbelievable.

00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:35.382
She goes off to see a demon

00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:37.384
and ends up
getting caught by it.

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.587
That princess is nothing
but trouble for everybody.

00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:42.222
‐ All right, let's move.

00:13:42.256 --> 00:13:43.423
‐ No.

00:13:43.457 --> 00:13:46.527
Keep on playing the princess
in case someone looks in on us.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.630
One dummy might deceive them,
but not two.

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:50.664
‐ But I‐‐

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:52.099
‐ You have my word.

00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:55.235
I will bring Princess Aiya
safely back here.

00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:58.272
Don't worry.

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:01.241
You can count on me,
Princess Setsuna.

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:06.046
‐ [screams]
‐ [roars]

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:08.048
ALL: Oh! Princess Aiya!

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:10.551
‐ Don't just stand there
shouting my name!

00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:11.652
What good is that?!

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.854
Do something
before I get eaten!

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:15.856
[screams] Save me!

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:16.857
Save me!

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.158
‐ We're on it, Princess!

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:19.626
One of us has gone for help!

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.562
‐ Well, tell him to hurry up!

00:14:21.595 --> 00:14:23.497
Agh! Before I‐‐

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.498
[groans]

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.633
ALL: Princess Aiya!

00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:32.306
‐ [wails]

00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:36.043
‐ [gasps]
You're that demon slayer.

00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:37.845
Well, hurry up! Do your job

00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:39.646
and save me! [groans]

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:43.417
‐ Huh?

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.320
[Takonyudo groans]

00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:49.990
[roars]

00:14:50.023 --> 00:14:51.158
‐ Hiraikotsu!

00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:52.960
‐ [yelps]
‐ [gasps]

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.294
‐ Kirara!
‐ [Kirara roars]

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.363
‐ Hey! Where do you
think you're going?!

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.899
Get back here
and save me this instant!

00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:00.567
‐ That's an order! Whoa!
‐ [growls]

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:04.037
‐ [gurgles]

00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:06.874
[gasps] Stupid octopus demon!

00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:08.909
Do you have any idea
who you're dealing wi‐‐

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:10.043
[groans]

00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:12.212
[dizzy] I'm going
to have you put in a pot

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:15.015
and make a big bowl
of octopus soup out of you.

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.783
ALL: Princess Aiya!

00:15:16.817 --> 00:15:17.985
‐ [yelps]

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:19.286
‐ Don't move, Princess!

00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:21.288
You're making it harder
for me to get a clean shot!

00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:23.457
‐ Excuse me, but does it
really look to you

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.493
like I have any control
over the situation?! Come on!

00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:28.395
‐ Kirara, get behind it!

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.698
‐ Hiraikotsu! Whaah!
‐ [yelps]

00:15:31.732 --> 00:15:33.634
‐ [Takonyudo groans]
‐ Hello?

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:35.002
You got the wrong tentacle!

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:36.970
I'm in this tentacle,
right here!

00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:38.372
‐ This is a problem.

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.373
Eh?

00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:41.608
[Takonyudo groans]

00:15:41.642 --> 00:15:44.478
[wails]

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:46.280
‐ Wait. Kin'u?!

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:52.286
‐ [groans]

00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:54.221
[coughing]

00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:57.057
‐ Hmm.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.593
Looks like this batch
turned out very nicely.

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:02.396
‐ Huh? You're here too, Gyokuto?

00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:03.730
‐ Hi, Hisui!

00:16:03.764 --> 00:16:05.632
We'll keep Mr. Octopus
busy for you...

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:08.735
‐ While you save that princess
or at least try to!

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:09.770
[laughs]

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:13.173
‐ Kin'u, this is
no laughing matter!

00:16:13.207 --> 00:16:15.375
‐ [Aiya yelling]
‐ [Takonyudo growling]

00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:16.343
‐ Hiraikotsu!

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:18.245
‐ [gasps]
‐ Wow! This is amazing!

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:20.547
Come swooping in
like that again!

00:16:20.581 --> 00:16:23.183
‐ Please, Princess, try
to keep as still as possible,

00:16:23.217 --> 00:16:24.985
or I won't be able
to get a clean shot.

00:16:25.018 --> 00:16:26.553
‐ I'm sorry,
but it's not every day

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:29.756
I get to see a battle up close,
let alone be a part of it!

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.058
It's just all so very exciting!

00:16:31.091 --> 00:16:33.060
So come on! Do that
swoopy, shouty thing again

00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:34.661
and really
let this demon have it!

00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:36.563
‐ [groaning]

00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:39.266
‐ That's right, Hisui!

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:41.335
The princess told you
to go for it, so go for it!

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:43.270
‐ Yeah, slowpoke,
we haven't got all day!

00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:45.005
Hurry up and get it over with!

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.009
‐ [coughs] Damn you!

00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:50.711
‐ More! More! I love it!

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:57.117
[Takonyudo groans]

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.020
‐ He's got to have
a weak spot somewhere!

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:02.422
‐ [gurgles]

00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:04.124
‐ That must be it!

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.230
Now! Hiraikotsu!

00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:12.599
‐ [groans]

00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:15.369
‐ Amazing! You really
nailed him that time!

00:17:15.402 --> 00:17:18.405
‐ [gurgling]
‐ Oh, this is truly spectacular!

00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:20.541
[laughs]

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:21.542
[gasps]

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:24.711
[screams]

00:17:24.745 --> 00:17:26.547
[winces]

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.915
Uh...

00:17:27.948 --> 00:17:29.283
[gasps]

00:17:30.184 --> 00:17:32.586
‐ You're not hurt now, are you?

00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:34.521
‐ [gasps]

00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:36.557
Uh, n‐no, I'm, uh...

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.492
I'm fine, thank you.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.133
‐ Honestly, all this trouble

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:47.968
just because you
didn't want to stay home

00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:49.269
and do your etiquette lesson.

00:17:49.303 --> 00:17:51.572
‐ Wait. How did
you know about that?

00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:54.174
‐ Because I was supposed to be
your etiquette instructor,

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.109
‐ that's how.
‐ What?

00:17:56.143 --> 00:17:59.213
But I thought a nun was
going to teach me, not a monk.

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:01.114
‐ Princess,
don't let him fool you.

00:18:01.148 --> 00:18:03.083
My brother would make
a very excellent nun.

00:18:03.116 --> 00:18:05.886
‐ Yeah, and a cute one too,
because he has our looks.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.487
‐ Cut it out!

00:18:07.521 --> 00:18:10.290
ALL: Princess!
We're so glad you're safe!

00:18:10.324 --> 00:18:13.794
‐ Now then, isn't it about time
they took you home, Princess?

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:15.128
‐ I suppose,

00:18:15.162 --> 00:18:17.598
but I don't wanna go back
in that thing.

00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:18.799
‐ Huh?

00:18:18.832 --> 00:18:20.000
‐ Huh?
‐ Eh?

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:23.670
‐ Come on. Do I have
to spell it out for you?

00:18:23.704 --> 00:18:24.838
I‐I want to...

00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:26.874
go back with you.

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:27.875
[both snicker]

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:28.876
‐ But why?

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:30.043
‐ You heard the princess.

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:31.445
She chose you personally.

00:18:31.478 --> 00:18:34.515
‐ Yeah, she wants to get on
there with you and take a ride.

00:18:34.548 --> 00:18:35.883
[both giggle]

00:18:35.916 --> 00:18:37.084
‐ Oh, I get it.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.486
You want to see what it's like
to ride on Kirara.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.554
Sure thing.

00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:42.055
‐ No, that wasn't‐‐

00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:45.158
[groans] Oh, never mind.

00:18:46.593 --> 00:18:48.962
‐ Okay, now hold on tight.

00:18:48.996 --> 00:18:50.063
‐ 'Kay! [giggles]

00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:52.533
‐ Okay, you two. See you later.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.872
‐ Our baby brother
sure has grown up, hasn't he?

00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:00.908
‐ Right before our very eyes.

00:19:00.941 --> 00:19:02.042
[both giggle]

00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:03.877
‐ Now, on top
of my tutoring fees,

00:19:03.911 --> 00:19:05.946
I'll get a reward
for slaying that demon!

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:08.081
‐ Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup...
‐ [laughter echoing]

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.188
‐ Oh, come to think of it,

00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:16.690
I never found out what it was
that was so important

00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:17.891
that my sister forced me

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:19.726
to take her place
as your instructor.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.094
Forgot to ask her about that.

00:19:21.128 --> 00:19:22.563
‐ This is unbelievable!

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:24.364
We're actually flying!

00:19:24.398 --> 00:19:26.700
‐ [laughing]
‐ Princess, please.

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:28.202
I told you to stay still.

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:29.570
You don't want to fall again.

00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:32.172
‐ How can I fall when I'm
holding on to you so tightly,

00:19:32.206 --> 00:19:33.407
just like you said I should?

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.476
‐ Let's not keep
the other princess waiting.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.511
Now, shall we?

00:19:37.544 --> 00:19:40.514
‐ [laughing]

00:19:40.547 --> 00:19:42.516
[insects chirping]

00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:49.523
Where did that girl go?
Did she leave?

00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:51.925
[gasps]

00:19:51.959 --> 00:19:54.528
F‐Father?!

00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:56.964
‐ What am I going
to do with you, Aiya?

00:19:56.997 --> 00:20:00.033
‐ [yelps] So I guess
you found out?

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:03.403
‐ You are going to get
such a lecture from me today!

00:20:03.437 --> 00:20:05.205
‐ [winces]

00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:06.840
[crying]

00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:09.209
Forgive me, Father!

00:20:09.243 --> 00:20:10.644
[crying]

00:20:10.677 --> 00:20:12.312
‐ So he found out, huh?

00:20:12.346 --> 00:20:14.515
‐ He did shortly after you left.

00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:17.784
‐ Well, I doubt she'll ever be
the daughter he's looking for.

00:20:17.818 --> 00:20:21.722
That poor man. [laughs]

00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:29.363
‐ [grunting]

00:20:35.135 --> 00:20:38.205
‐ [panting]
‐ [bamboo clatters]

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:44.878
‐ Now you will finally
be able to sleep once again.

00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:47.881
<i>However, there is</i>
<i>no time for that.</i>

00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.917
<i>‐ Tell me,</i>
<i>how can I break the curse?</i>

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.019
<i>‐ That is up to you.</i>

00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:54.188
‐ I know that training alone
<i>won't teach me</i>

00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:56.089
<i>how to sever</i>
<i>the threads of fate,</i>

00:20:56.123 --> 00:20:57.824
<i>but what else can I do?</i>

00:20:57.858 --> 00:20:58.825
‐ [panting]

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:00.961
‐ [gasps]
‐ Setsuna!

00:21:00.994 --> 00:21:03.430
I finally found you!
Thank goodness.

00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:06.433
‐ Hey, hey! What do you think
you're doing?! Cut that out!

00:21:06.466 --> 00:21:09.036
‐ You're kidding! I've been
looking everywhere for you!

00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:10.704
When I left,
you were fast asleep,

00:21:10.737 --> 00:21:12.439
and when I got back,
you were gone!

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.808
‐ A lot happened today.

00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:16.510
‐ Like what?

00:21:16.543 --> 00:21:17.978
‐ [sighs]

00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:20.514
Nothing good
comes from sleeping.

00:21:20.547 --> 00:21:22.583
‐ Huh?
‐ Never mind.

00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:26.420
‐ Wait. Setsuna,
what's the matter?

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:28.322
‐ Hey, wait up!

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.093
[insects chirping]

00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:43.103
[playing violin]

00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:12.599
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:45.058
MOROHA: Surprise!
This Moroha the Demon Killer

00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:47.895
<i>you guys are talking about</i>
<i>is none other than me!</i>

00:23:47.928 --> 00:23:50.364
<i>Hey! Wait! Wait!</i>
<i>Don't run away!</i>

00:23:50.397 --> 00:23:53.567
<i>Aw, damn it! So that's</i>
<i>why business is slow.</i>

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.736
<i>It's because of my parents!</i>

00:23:55.769 --> 00:23:58.939
<i>What? You want to hire me?</i>
<i>Really?</i>

00:23:58.972 --> 00:24:02.910
<i>Next time on</i> Yashahime,
<i>"Takechiyo's Request."</i>

00:24:02.943 --> 00:24:04.144
<i>You're telling me</i>

00:24:04.178 --> 00:24:06.413
<i>you're the young lord</i>
<i>of the Mamidaira clan?!</i>
