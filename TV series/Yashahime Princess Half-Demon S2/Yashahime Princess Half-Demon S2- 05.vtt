00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.110
‐ I am Kirinmaru's daughter,
Rion.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.813
‐ The daughter of Kirinmaru?

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.884
‐ The Kyuyokon root you seek
is right here.

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:19.386
It is yours to take
if you want it.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.156
[Japanese music playing]

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:52.646
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.159
TOWA: <i>"The Girl Named Rion."</i>

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:13.667
‐ Behold the Kyuyokon root.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.135
Many demons and apparitions

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.872
have come here like you
seeking it, but they were all

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:21.808
swallowed up by the barrier
and disappeared.

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:24.645
The Kyuyokon
is the ultimate weapon.

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.313
It can absorb and expel

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.448
unlimited amounts
of demon power.

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:32.719
It is the one thing that
my father, Kirinmaru, fears.

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:35.422
That is why I offer it to you.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:38.392
‐ Hold on. Are you really sure
you want to let us have it?

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:41.228
‐ Yeah, Kirinmaru's
not gonna like it.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.896
‐ [sighs]

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.631
My father can't be satisfied

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.467
unless he's facing
the strongest of opponents.

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:50.737
To be considered worthy,
they must possess two things‐‐

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:52.206
first, the physical strength

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.208
to break through
the barrier at Mount Musubi,

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:58.011
and second, a kind heart
to understand and choose

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.614
what to protect
and what to let go of.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:01.782
[Moroha and Setsuna gasp]

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:04.017
‐ And you're saying that's us?

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:06.486
‐ Yes. One of you three,
I'm certain,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.156
will be able
to put an end to my father.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:11.959
[wind blowing]

00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:14.361
‐ Are you sure
it's Sesshomaru's daughters

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.230
that have come poking
around this mountain?

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:20.234
‐ Yeah, just take a whiff.
The place reeks of half‐demon.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.502
‐ But I didn't even think

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.737
there was anyone who could
even get into this place.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.205
‐ I heard that too!

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.541
[all gasp]

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:31.945
‐ Dear me, I keep running into
the shabbiest‐looking riffraff.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.714
‐ Who the hell are you?!
‐ [Riku scoffs]

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.851
If those loincloths
are your idea of evening wear,

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:39.520
you have very poor taste.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.623
I can't allow you to have
an audience with the princesses

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.024
dressed like that.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.626
‐ Oh, you can't, huh?!

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.327
‐ How dare you?!

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:50.531
‐ Fine, then we'll
get rid of you first!

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:51.532
‐ [chuckles]

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:52.633

[bodies thump]

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.375
‐ They even show poor taste
in the way they die.

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:04.144
Lady Towa,

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:07.314
unfortunately I myself
cannot enter Mount Musubi.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:10.884
But please
do not concern yourself.

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:13.620
Your quest for the root
will not be impeded.

00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:17.457
‐ [growling]

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:25.132
I will keep these small‐fry
demons from bothering you.

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:28.969
‐ I mean, Kirinmaru's
your father, after all.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:32.239
You really want us to kill him?

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.207
‐ Yes.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.443
You see, I am already dead.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.311
‐ You're what?

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:41.348
‐ I lost my life
almost 600 years ago.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.350
My time should have ended there,

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.353
but my father
refused to accept my death.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.759
Ever since then, my soul has
been trapped in this astral body

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:55.262
and sealed away
here in Mount Musubi.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.464
[all gasp]

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:01.235
Not only that, but by using
the Dream Butterfly,

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:04.638
my father has forced me
to meet him in his dreams.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.940
‐ He's kept you here
all this time?

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.276
‐ For 600 years
after your death?

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.246
‐ Sheesh. Talk about being
an overprotective parent.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.450
‐ I cannot tolerate my father's
selfishness any more.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:20.320
I beg you, free my soul
and send me to the afterlife.

00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:22.656
And more importantly,

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.092
put a stop
to my father's ambition.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:26.994
He seeks to destroy everything

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:29.963
and bring about
the Degenerate Age.

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.866
My father has visited
every corner of this world,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.268
but for one place,

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.738
and that would be the realm
that lies beyond space and time.

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.406
MOROHA: Beyond space and time?

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.942
‐ Does she mean the future world
I was living in?

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.510
RION: To achieve this,

00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:47.047
he hopes to find and capture
a spirit named Akuru

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.982
to move the Windmill of Time.

00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:51.351
But it is said that,
should that ever happen,

00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:54.121
the world of the living
will come to an end.

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:55.322
[Moroha and Towa gasp]

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.524
‐ So that's the Degenerate Age,

00:05:57.558 --> 00:06:00.994
RION: Flowers, trees,
insects, animals,

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.730
all the living things
I love and cherish in this world

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:05.766
will immediately cease to exist.

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:06.934
TOWA: No way.

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.135
[Rion sighs]

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:10.838
That is the one thing
I must stop him from doing,

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:12.973
no matter what it takes.

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:14.107
[Towa gasps]

00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:16.443
I'm sorry for all the pain
you've had to‐‐

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:18.312
[yelps]

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:20.814
I'm sorry for your suffering,

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:23.417
that you've been burdened
with so much pain.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.321
You were forced to spend
centuries all by yourself.

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:30.724
I can't imagine
the sheer loneliness.

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:33.694
RION: Are you shedding tears

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.129
for someone like me?

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:39.032
‐ Towa, remember who it is
you're dealing with.

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.401
She is Kirinmaru's daughter.

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:42.803
‐ So what?

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:44.505
Why does that matter?

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:48.609
‐ [sighs] You are truly
a kindhearted person, Lady Towa.

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:51.979
‐ Don't sweat it, okay?

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:53.914
We'll get you
out of this place, Rion.

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:55.616
I promise you that!

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:57.317
‐ [laughs]

00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:59.219

‐ [gasps]

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:03.323
[thread chimes]

00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:04.591
A thread.

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.695
[blade pulses]

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.631
[dramatic music playing]

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.311
Is this a thread of her fate?

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:25.312
‐ It can't be.

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:27.214
You can actually see
the thread of fate

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:29.516
that binds me
to someone I am close to?

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.718
‐ Yes, somehow this naginata

00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:34.121
has given me
the power to see them.

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:37.357
Rion, who does this thread
connect you to?

00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:40.027
‐ I can't believe
it could be anyone else

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.829
but my father, Kirinmaru.

00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:45.098
What you see is the evil bond

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:48.101
that has tied me to him
for 600 years.

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:50.103
Please, you must sever it!

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:53.340
‐ I've never tried to before.

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:58.111
‐ Sever it and free me so I
may set out for the afterlife.

00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.847
‐ [gasps] But wait!

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.114
You would die, Rion!

00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:03.050
‐ I already died long ago.

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:04.785
Please, I beg you.

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.920
I think, by severing the thread,

00:08:06.954 --> 00:08:09.356
you might also
put a stop to Kirinmaru.

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.326
‐ Very well then.

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:26.640
[grunts]

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.375
If I can't cut this thread,

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:30.310
I'll never be able
to sever the thread

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:32.546
that ties my mother Rin to Zero.

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:35.616
Time to put it to the test.

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:37.551
I won't know unless I try!

00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:41.088
[yells]

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.530
‐ The Dream Butterfly.

00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:54.935
‐ I'm sorry.
It seems my aim was off.

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:56.003
‐ It's all right.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.639
‐ Hey, is that
Setsuna's Dream Butterfly?

00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:02.009
‐ No, it's not. It's mine.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.913
That butterfly
is what Kirinmaru has used

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:07.514
to keep me in this place.

00:09:07.548 --> 00:09:08.916
[ship creaks]

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:10.617
KIRINMARU: Rion...

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:14.288
are you saying that you find
your father's love irritating?

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:19.326
‐ But why? Is it that
I am not proficient enough yet?

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.228
‐ [rumble]
‐ [Moroha and Towa gasp]

00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:25.132
MOROHA: The cocoon,
it fell apart.

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:27.067
And what the hell's that?

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.902
RION: It is
the vessel for my soul

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:31.705
made out of my bones
and soil from my grave.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.173
‐ You mean
you've been locked away

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:35.309
in that thing for 600 years?!

00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:36.643
‐ Yes.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.646
[dramatic music playing]

00:09:43.617 --> 00:09:46.353
KIRINMARU: Rion. Rion!

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:49.356
It is dangerous
for you to leave the cocoon.

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.692
Get back inside
like a good girl.

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:54.394
You must never leave
Mount Musubi.

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:55.495
‐ [whimpers]

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:01.502
‐ He stuffed her back inside!

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:02.503
‐ Rion!

00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:04.404
‐ No, Father.

00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:08.041
I have already escaped
the shackles you put on me!

00:10:09.543 --> 00:10:10.544
[grunts]

00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:13.213
I will make myself move...

00:10:13.247 --> 00:10:15.649
and get away from here!

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:18.185
I will defy fate.

00:10:18.218 --> 00:10:22.322
I will take this body you made
from my bones and grave soil,

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:25.025
and I will use it to rise again!

00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:32.499
From now on, I will travel
on my own strength, my own path!

Lord Sesshomaru,
I sense that Akuru is near!

00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:57.658
‐ Just ignore it, Jaken.

00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:59.226
‐ [sighs] <i>Ignore it?</i>

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:01.161

Let the barrier be undone!

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:31.992
[chime rings]

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:40.634
[cracking]

00:11:42.336 --> 00:11:44.004
[energy surges]

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.539
[energy humming]

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:46.507
[humming stops]

00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:50.244
‐ The barrier, it disappeared.

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:51.678
‐ [flute playing]
‐ [gasps]

00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:04.091
‐ [flute melody ends]
‐ Rion.

00:12:08.862 --> 00:12:11.632
RION: <i>Farewell, my dear father.</i>

00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:14.468
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:17.971
<i>‐ Take a good look, Rion.</i>

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:21.508
This world is one big sphere.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.879
<i>‐ It's amazing, Father!</i>

00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:28.248
[gasps]

00:12:28.282 --> 00:12:30.284
[laughing]

00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:37.357
<i>You have given me so much,</i>

00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.993
<i>but I have had</i>
<i>more than enough.</i>

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:48.168
Lady Towa, allow me once again
to present this to you.

00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:52.773
What was a Kyuyokon root before
is now the Star‐Slicer Flute.

00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:55.576
‐ This came from that?

00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:58.378
But it's just a flute.

00:12:58.412 --> 00:13:02.282
‐ You will understand when
you play it, I can assure you.

00:13:02.316 --> 00:13:04.585
‐ Uh...

00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:07.421
‐ In exchange for it,
I ask only one thing,

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:10.090
that you will let me
travel with you. Please!

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:14.027
‐ Sure thing!
It's like they all say.

00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:16.563
Any trip worth taking's
worth taking with friends.

00:13:16.597 --> 00:13:18.398
‐ Welcome to the team, Rion.

00:13:18.432 --> 00:13:19.566
‐ [gasps]

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.134
Oh, thank you so much.

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:22.769
SETSUNA: We're not
out of the woods yet.

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:24.171
All the evil demon energy

00:13:24.204 --> 00:13:26.406
that was surrounding
this mountain until a moment ago

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.377
has gathered in one spot
and is now heading this way!

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.183
[growling]

00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:38.652
‐ A demon spirit beast!

00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:39.987
‐ A what now?

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.056
RION: Kirinmaru must have
had it ready just in case.

00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:46.593
The instant we try
to escape this mountain,

00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:47.394
it will attack!

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:48.929
‐ Then we
just have to destroy it!

00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:51.331
‐ Well, this ought to be easy!

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:53.267
‐ [roaring]

00:13:56.637 --> 00:13:58.672
MOROHA: Uh, maybe not that easy.

00:13:58.705 --> 00:13:59.606
‐ Watch your back!
‐ [gasps]

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:03.510
‐ It's just attacking aimlessly!

00:14:03.544 --> 00:14:06.513
‐ Oh, really? Now tell us
something we don't know!

00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:09.016
‐ This is a nasty opponent!

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:11.151
‐ [roaring]

00:14:12.452 --> 00:14:14.388
‐ You all right
back there, Rion?

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:17.224
‐ Lady Towa,
play the Star‐Slicer Flute!

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:18.692
‐ Huh?

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:19.626
Okay!

00:14:20.761 --> 00:14:22.663
[playing melody]

00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:28.702
[melody fades]

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.542
[dramatic music playing]

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.615
[roars]

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.819
‐ Lady Towa,
you are worthy of wielding

00:14:45.853 --> 00:14:48.021
the legendary blade Zanseiken.

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:49.923
‐ You mean this?

00:14:49.957 --> 00:14:51.225
No way.

00:14:51.258 --> 00:14:54.027
RION: The Zanseiken
is a blade that pairs

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:57.030
with the Bakuseiken
wielded by Kirinmaru.

00:14:57.064 --> 00:14:59.867
In ancient times,
Amatsumikaboshi,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.202
the god of stars,
gifted two swords.

00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:05.539
I have heard that
the Bakuseiken and the Zanseiken

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.007
were those two swords.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.410
‐ So this one's the Zanseiken!

00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:11.879
‐ It's coming, Towa!

00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:12.980
‐ Leave it to me!
‐ Huh?

00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:15.048
[beast roaring]

00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:20.254
‐ [yells]

00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:22.189
Oh, wow.

00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:24.424
So this is the power
of the Kyuyokon!

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:26.326
And it's getting stronger
by the second!

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.695
‐ Setsuna,
you just gonna stand around

00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:30.564
and let Towa steal the show?

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:31.365
‐ I should say not!

00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:34.635
‐ No! Let me
handle this one myself!

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:36.236
‐ Okay, fine.

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:41.708
‐ Twin Azure Dragon Wave!

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:44.077
[dragons roaring]

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.218
[beast groaning]

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:55.656
‐ [whimpers]

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.425
Hmm?

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.593
[gasps]

00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:01.695
‐ [chuckles]

00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:02.696
‐ [sighs]

00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:03.697
‐ [chuckles]

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.232
‐ Oh, yeah!
‐ Oh, yeah!

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:08.635
RION: That was amazing!

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:09.670
With power like that,

00:16:09.703 --> 00:16:12.172
you will certainly be able
to bring down my father!

00:16:12.206 --> 00:16:14.241
‐ I wouldn't be so sure of that.

00:16:14.274 --> 00:16:16.944
Your old man
is a whole lot stronger

00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:18.679
than that demon spirit thing.

00:16:18.712 --> 00:16:20.013
‐ Hey, you never know.

00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:22.216
We might just stand
a better chance this time.

00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:23.917
‐ Get real. Have you
forgotten what happened

00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:25.219
‐ the last time we fought him?
‐ [chuckles]

00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:26.820
MOROHA: Tell her, Setsuna.

00:16:26.854 --> 00:16:28.121
‐ Leave me out.

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:30.591
It's not for me to say
one way or the other,

00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:32.292
because I'm the one he killed.

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:33.160
‐ [gasps]

00:16:33.193 --> 00:16:35.529
I apologize
on behalf of my father.

00:16:35.562 --> 00:16:36.630
[Setsuna gasps] Stop that.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:40.100
‐ Yeah, no one blames you
for the sins of your father.

00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:41.768
‐ [gasps]
‐ TOWA: Besides,

00:16:41.802 --> 00:16:43.303
didn't you
just make up your mind

00:16:43.337 --> 00:16:45.606
that you're going
to stand up to Kirinmaru?

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.476
‐ Yes. Yes, you're right.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.611
‐ Okay, then!

00:16:50.644 --> 00:16:53.881
We got what we came for,
so I say it's time we head home.

00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:54.882
‐ Yeah.
‐ Right.

00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:57.217
MOROHA: Man, I am starving.

00:16:57.251 --> 00:16:58.585
TOWA: What else is new?

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:03.991
‐ [all gasp]
‐ Huh?

00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:09.496
TOWA: Sesshomaru.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.298
‐ Yukari no Tachikiri...

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.967
have you mastered
its powers yet?

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.371
‐ Not yet.
It seems my aim was off.

00:17:17.404 --> 00:17:21.575
‐ I see. It appears
you still lack resolve.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.680
‐ The Tenseiga?!
What are you gonna do with that?

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.315
‐ [gasps]

00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:33.687
‐ Is that the Dream Butterfly
that's been stealing her sleep?

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.088
‐ What is going on here?

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:36.890
‐ That Butterfly
that possessed you

00:17:36.924 --> 00:17:39.393
was delivering
your sleep and dreams to Rin.

00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:41.828
It's what has kept
your mother alive

00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:44.798
by holding
the silver‐scale curse in check.

00:17:44.831 --> 00:17:48.602
‐ If I cut it down now,
you will be able to sleep again,

00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:51.939
but the silver scales will start
to spread over Rin's body,

00:17:51.972 --> 00:17:53.674
and she will soon die.

00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:55.209
‐ No.

00:17:55.242 --> 00:17:57.344
SESSHOMARU: What will it be?

00:17:57.377 --> 00:17:59.313
‐ Cut it down.

00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:00.547
I will save her.

00:18:02.015 --> 00:18:03.183
SESSHOMARU: Are you sure?

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:06.587
‐ [grunts]

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:08.722
‐ [gasps]

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:09.990
[blade slices]

00:18:28.008 --> 00:18:31.178
‐ Now you will finally
be able to sleep once again.

00:18:31.211 --> 00:18:34.081
However, there is
no time for that.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:36.617
‐ Tell me,
how can I break the curse?

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.886
‐ That is up to you.
‐ What?

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:41.688
‐ Moroha, did you meet Inuyasha?

00:18:41.722 --> 00:18:44.725
‐ Huh? Wait.
How did you know that?!

00:18:44.758 --> 00:18:45.759
‐ I see.

00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:48.695
‐ Eh? We're leaving?

00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:51.465
Wait for me, Lord Sesshomaru!

00:18:51.498 --> 00:18:52.399
‐ [sighs]

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:55.369
It is up to me?

00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:03.243
‐ [sighs]

00:19:03.277 --> 00:19:05.746
Well, it looks like
that's about it, then.

00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:10.651
‐ Huh?

00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:11.652
Riku?!

00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:14.655
‐ Oh? Why, Lady Towa!

00:19:14.688 --> 00:19:15.856
Fancy that!

00:19:15.889 --> 00:19:18.058
‐ Riku? It's been so long!

00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:21.595
‐ What? Miss Rion,
can it really be you?

00:19:21.628 --> 00:19:24.598
‐ [gasping]

00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:25.999
Oh, Riku!

00:19:26.033 --> 00:19:27.901
‐ [gasps]

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:29.903
But how is this possible?

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:33.207
‐ [laughs] This here
is an artificial body I'm in.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.076
It's so good
to see you again, Riku.

00:19:36.109 --> 00:19:37.845
Tell me, how have you been?

00:19:37.878 --> 00:19:39.713
‐ Oh, well, you know...

00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:41.515
[gasps] No, don't look at me!

00:19:41.548 --> 00:19:42.749
You mustn't look!

00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:44.551
If you show yourself to me,
Miss Rion,

00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:48.455
then you'll be showing yourself
to your father as well!

00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:50.023
‐ Oh, that's all right.

00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:51.258
‐ Is that true?

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:53.260
‐ It is, so you must be careful,

00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:54.995
because everything
that I see and hear

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:56.830
gets right back to Kirinmaru.

00:19:56.864 --> 00:19:58.332
‐ Really?

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:00.934
So if I say something,
Kirinmaru will hear it?

00:20:00.968 --> 00:20:03.403
‐ Uh, exactly.

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:06.073
Hmm?

00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:08.509
‐ [gasps]

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:10.711
H‐Hold on. L‐Lady Towa?

00:20:10.744 --> 00:20:12.513
‐ Hey, Kirinmaru,
can you hear me?!

00:20:12.546 --> 00:20:15.115
You in there?! I hope so,
'cause I wanna tell you

00:20:15.148 --> 00:20:17.918
that we freed your daughter Rion
and she's with us right now!

00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:19.920
And if you
got a problem with that,

00:20:19.953 --> 00:20:22.489
‐ you know where to find us!
‐ Oh, brother.

00:20:22.523 --> 00:20:23.323
[Rion sighs]

00:20:23.357 --> 00:20:25.893
We'll take you on
anytime, anywhere!

00:20:25.926 --> 00:20:27.628
We're not gonna run or hide!

00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:32.132
[echoing] So bring it on!

00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:36.103
‐ Hmph. Interesting.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.706
‐ That was magnificent,
Lady Towa.

00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:41.975
‐ [gasps]

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:43.610
‐ One thing, though.

00:20:43.644 --> 00:20:47.414
Allow me to look after Miss Rion
for a short while.

00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:49.149
‐ What?
‐ But why?

00:20:49.183 --> 00:20:51.151
‐ If you're not able
to move about freely,

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:54.221
you might become
a hindrance to Lady Towa.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:56.723
But that is why I am here.

00:20:56.757 --> 00:20:58.025
