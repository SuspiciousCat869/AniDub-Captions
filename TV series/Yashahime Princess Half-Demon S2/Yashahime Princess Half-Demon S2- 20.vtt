- Yeah!
- Yes!

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.944
- Let's destroy the Grim Comet!

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.547
- Nobody else can do it.
It's all up to us!

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.148
- Yes, indeed.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:18.151

Forward to victory!

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:22.256

whatever the cost!

so don't let me down.

The hour's at hand.
The time has come!

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.096
- Okay, I knew
it was big, but...

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.265
- What a monstrous thing.

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.403
- I'm not letting it destroy
the world my mom's from! No way!

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:50.537
- How do we stop it?

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:53.740
- I have no idea, but we've
gotta figure something out.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:55.709
- Wait, hold on!
- Eh?

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:59.179
- Just striking at it blindly
won't do us any good.

00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:01.715
Let me go first
and do some reconnaissance.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:05.686
You stay here and slay
any demons that fall to Earth.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.120

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.568
One breath of this
would kill a human instantly.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.539
Such pure demon energy!

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.040
When this comet hits,

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:30.677
it will produce enough demons
to cover the entire planet!

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:31.979
MOROHA: They're drawn to us,

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.681

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:46.960
She's drawing them
all together into one place!

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.226
Now I see.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.196
That's the true identity
of the Grim Comet.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:29.069

I could depend on you

take care of the rest of 'em?

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:59.760
Can you exorcise
their evil energy?

Miss Rion?

- Deep within Mount Musubi,

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:10.264
there lies a power
that can suppress Kirinmaru.

If we can find and extract it...

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:15.636

Is that the apple seed
you got from Lady Towa?

- It is.

exactly as I say

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:43.764
to have a chance
of pulling this off.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:44.765
- All right!

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:45.966

KIRIN: First, Miss Towa
and Miss Setsuna,

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.703
I need the two of you

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:52.706
to clear away that miasma
surrounding the Grim Comet.

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:55.008
- BOTH: Okay!
- Next, Miss Moroha,

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.444
you eliminate the demon energy
with your Sacred Arrow.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.645
- No problem there.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.782
KIRIN: Then I need
the three of you

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.750
to attack the main body
of the Grim Comet

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:05.853
and make it
as small as possible.

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.087
- Okay.
- All right.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.158
- At that point, I just
might be able to stop it.

Absorbing that demon energy
will sap your Kon!

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.094
absorb as much of it as I can

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:04.698

What's wrong?!

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:29.583
- [grunts]

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:31.385

[panting]

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:39.426
KIRIN: What a profound act
of self-sacrifice,

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:41.562
to put
your very existence at risk

00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:43.497
for the sake of this world.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.968
I find that
just so incredibly moving!

00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:50.971
[grunts] It's my turn now!

00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:53.440
I will stop it in its tracks!

00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:57.711
Amazing...

00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:05.419
[yells]

00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:10.057

[yelling]

00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:34.515
...Power!

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:36.483
- Holy shit!

00:13:36.517 --> 00:13:38.418
[dramatic music playing]

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:49.530
[music ends]

00:13:49.563 --> 00:13:51.532
Are you all right?

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:53.033
- Yeah, I'm fine...

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:55.402
just a little worn out.

00:13:57.938 --> 00:13:59.907
- Don't ever use
that sword again!

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.175
- [chuckles]

00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:01.975
[winces]

<i>- My living right arm...</i>

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:06.113
go and dispose
of those half-Demon princesses!

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:09.416
- Not that voice again.

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:11.818
Miss Setsuna is right.

00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:13.187
It would be a fatal mistake

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.822
to attempt that sort
of stunt in the future.

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:18.525
You should get rid
of that sword now.

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:21.061
- But Rion gave me this sword

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:24.264
to defeat Kirinmaru,
and I promised her I would!

00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:26.834
- Ah, tell me,
how is Rion these days?

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.035
She's well, I hope?

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:30.037
- Quite the opposite.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.739
- Rion has been dead
for a while now.

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:33.907
- Wait...

00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:36.543
you mean she's gone?

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:39.346
[tense music playing]

00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:43.750
RIKU: There. It's done.

00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:45.152
- Mount Musubi...

00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:47.955
please grant me the use
of your hidden power,

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:51.091
the power of the Kyuyokon
that dwells within you!

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:02.135
- Whoa.

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:03.971
- [energy chimes]
- [sighs]

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:07.007
With this,
now I can stop my father.

00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:10.878
<i>- Rion...</i>

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.713

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.448
<i>I had no idea.</i>

00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:15.749
- She seemed like...

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:18.051
she was in a lot of pain.

00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:20.954
- Very well, then.

00:15:20.988 --> 00:15:22.556
I shall save her.

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:23.957
SETSUNA &amp; TOWA: What?!

00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:25.959
[Towa gasps]

00:15:25.993 --> 00:15:28.896
- Sorry, but I need
to borrow this.

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:30.330
I know it well.

00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:34.268
I wielded the Zanseiken when I
was still Kirinmaru's right arm.

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:35.536
- But...

00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:39.406
KIRIN: This is the Sword
of Amatsumikaboshi.

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.142
It is an object foreign
to you people of Earth,

00:15:42.176 --> 00:15:43.911
so you probably
will never be able

00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:45.546
to use it to its fullest extent.

00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:48.749
- But like I said,
I was only given that sword

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.551
because I made
a promise to Rion!

00:15:50.584 --> 00:15:53.654
- And I assure you
I will fulfill that promise.

00:15:53.687 --> 00:15:54.655
- [gasps]

00:15:54.688 --> 00:15:58.258
I shall defeat Kirinmaru.

00:15:58.292 --> 00:15:59.359
[all gasp]

00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:01.428
KIRIN: I will take
the Grim Comet

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.864
and transport it
to the feudal era.

00:16:03.897 --> 00:16:05.866
- Wait, what are you saying?!

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:07.901
- I should be able
to defeat Kirinmaru

00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:10.337
if I have something
as powerful as this.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.538
- With the Comet?!

00:16:11.572 --> 00:16:12.806
- That's right.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.107
You've all done your job,

00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:16.810
so now you can watch
as I save the world!

00:16:16.844 --> 00:16:18.612
[laughs]

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.380
KIRINMARU: <i>My living right arm,</i>

00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:23.083
<i>rid me of those</i>
<i>Half-Demon Princesses!</i>

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:26.553
KIRIN: Very soon, Kirinmaru
will pry open the Doors of Time

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:28.355
and enter this world.

00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:31.692
If Kirinmaru is allowed
to move through time and space,

00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:34.061
the results
would be catastrophic.

00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:35.162
- What do you mean?

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:37.164
- But not to worry,

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:40.167
for I shall become
the savior of the human race.

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:43.237
- What is that?!

00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:48.442
- Living right arm,
why are you taking so long?!

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:49.843
- [gasps] Kirinmaru!

00:16:49.877 --> 00:16:51.645
- Demons, however...

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.882
are not a race
that's worth saving.

00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:56.783
I bid you all farewell.

00:16:56.817 --> 00:16:58.952
I'm off to kill Kirinmaru.

00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:00.754
I'm headed to the feudal world

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:02.756
to slaughter every demon
I can find.

00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:04.458
- Uh, well...

00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:05.259
okay...

00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:07.227
- Miss Towa, please make sure

00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:09.263
to continue reading
your history books,

00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:11.164
because I'm going
to do my very best

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.367
to leave my own mark
on history!

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.435
- Oh. All right.

00:17:15.469 --> 00:17:17.938
- You girls have been
an enormous help.

00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:19.940
It's very much appreciated.

00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:21.942
And now goodbye.

00:17:21.975 --> 00:17:25.279
Momotaro, Momotaro...

00:17:25.312 --> 00:17:28.248
just wait till you see
what I'm bringing you,

00:17:28.282 --> 00:17:31.985

Well, we know
this world is saved,

00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:52.973
at the very least, right?

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:54.608
- Supposedly.

00:17:54.641 --> 00:17:56.643
- [sighs] I need a nap.

00:17:56.677 --> 00:17:58.712
[both laugh]

00:18:00.013 --> 00:18:01.682
- [gasps] Wait a sec!

00:18:01.715 --> 00:18:05.586
He said he was gonna
slaughter every demon, right?

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:06.987
- Did he mean...
- Wait...

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.490
he doesn't mean my dad
and Sesshomaru too, does he?!

00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:14.127
Well, he's gonna find out my dad
isn't that easy to take down!

00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:15.362
SETSUNA: I wonder what exactly

00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:17.331
he's planning to do
with the Grim Comet.

00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:20.200

to the feudal era! Come on!

Don't look now,

00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:52.232
but something terrible
is coming!

00:18:52.266 --> 00:18:53.834
- That's the Grim Comet!

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.602
What's it doing here?!

00:18:55.636 --> 00:18:57.538

something terrible!

TAKECHIYO: Whoa!

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.517
Where do we go? What do we do?

00:19:10.551 --> 00:19:13.187
- Fly like the wind!
Head for the Tree of Ages,

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.721
where Lord Sesshomaru is!

00:19:14.755 --> 00:19:15.956
- Right! Understood!

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.091
I just hope Moroha is okay!

00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:19.393
And the others!

KAGOME: Is that the Grim Comet
that was in the other world?!

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.173
- It's like
the heavens are falling!

00:19:33.207 --> 00:19:35.809
- It's beyond belief.

[both gasp]

00:19:37.911 --> 00:19:40.180

the Degenerate Age has come?

The Grim Comet of Reiwa.

00:19:56.864 --> 00:19:58.999
KIRIN: Yes.
But leaving that aside,

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.335
it's been quite a while,
hasn't it?

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.970
- So you're Kirin.

00:20:03.003 --> 00:20:05.973
- That's right. I'm Osamu Kirin.

00:20:06.006 --> 00:20:07.341
Greetings.

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:10.577
I have so looked forward
to meeting you in person.

[deck creaking]

00:20:14.248 --> 00:20:16.483

- [groans]

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:20.521
- Damn you.
You are my right arm,

00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:22.990
so why the hell don't you
obey my commands?!

00:20:23.023 --> 00:20:25.158
- It's funny
you should mention that,

00:20:25.192 --> 00:20:28.595
because I have come here
expressly to grant your wish.

00:20:28.629 --> 00:20:29.796
- Have you?

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.033
- I've gone to a lot of trouble
to bring you the Grim Comet.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:35.669
I know just how much
you want to destroy it.

00:20:35.702 --> 00:20:37.638
- So that's for me, is it?

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:39.273
- That's not all.
- Hmm?

00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:41.441
- Didn't you once say
you wanted to show Rion

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:44.878
all the wonders
of the great, wide world?

00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:47.714
I brought this from
the other world, a souvenir.

00:20:47.748 --> 00:20:48.649
- Huh?

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:51.785
- These are scenes I gathered

00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:54.588
during my travels there
in the Reiwa era.

00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:57.791
Rion will get a real kick
out of looking through them.

00:20:57.824 --> 00:20:58.892
Don't you think so?

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:00.961
- [scoffs]

00:21:00.994 --> 00:21:04.198
- Yes, the Grim Comet
continues to fall.

00:21:04.231 --> 00:21:07.701
I would suspect only
the Bakuseiken can destroy it.

00:21:08.802 --> 00:21:10.003
I have no doubt

00:21:10.037 --> 00:21:12.573
you'll make the whole world
tremble at your power.

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:15.075
- Spoken like a true right arm.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.010
You do understand.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.481
- Please hurry!

00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:22.482
- Right!

00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:24.818
- I must stop them both,

00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:28.388
Kirinmaru and the Grim Comet!

- Tree of Ages, open!

00:21:45.372 --> 00:21:48.075
Allow us to return
to the feudal era!

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.180
- Hey, come on, Tree of Ages!
It's important!

00:21:53.213 --> 00:21:55.382
- Please,
you must let us go back!

00:21:58.719 --> 00:22:00.254
TOWA: No way.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.162

00:23:49.196 --> 00:23:51.632
