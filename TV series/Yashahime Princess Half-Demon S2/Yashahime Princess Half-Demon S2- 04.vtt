the rage within me will be
etched deeper into my heart!

And this rage
does not arise from hating him,

00:07:15.437 --> 00:07:18.042
but from disgust
at my own inexperience!

00:07:18.076 --> 00:07:21.883
I was defeated tonight
because I neglected my training.

and thus discarded.

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:39.686

was quite right

about Rion.

You must stop taking her
with you wherever you go.

fight as a warrior.

No matter
how strong my enemy may be,

not to lecture me, Sister.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.514

to say, say it to Riku here!

All right, then, Riku,

00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:18.029
Go and dispose of this arm.

Turn my back for a minute,

00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:09.364
Ah, well. They're probably

Nice to meet you.

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:16.753

Then are you
the one I've been waiting for

00:11:18.857 --> 00:11:22.330

Towa! Setsuna!

00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:05.818
‐ They are trapped
within Mount Musubi's barrier.

00:12:06.753 --> 00:12:08.456
Left as they are now,

00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:10.026
I'm afraid that the two of them

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:12.197
will never be able
to find their way out.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.003
‐ Well, then we can't
leave 'em as they are, can we?!

00:12:15.905 --> 00:12:17.909
‐ Do you wish to save them?

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.648
‐ Of course!
They're my friends, damn it!

00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:22.217
I have to save them!

00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:27.494
TOWA: <i>This place isn't real.</i>

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:31.536
It's just some kind of illusion
<i>created by the barrier.</i>

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:32.939
[slash whooshes]

00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:35.911
I can't use my demon power
here either.

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:37.047
Great.

00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:40.754
[water flowing]

00:12:40.788 --> 00:12:42.792
‐ Who's this?

00:13:03.432 --> 00:13:07.207
‐ So if I enter this portal,
it'll take me to where they are?

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.977
‐ In theory.

00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:11.750
Once inside, you may
be asked by the barrier

00:13:11.783 --> 00:13:13.654
to name those things
you wish to protect

00:13:13.687 --> 00:13:15.524
and those
you are willing to let go of.

00:13:15.557 --> 00:13:17.728
‐ Is that some kind of riddle?

00:13:17.762 --> 00:13:19.297
‐ Within the Kyuyokon,

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.302
there is a corridor
through which you can cross

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:23.607
the rift between the past
and the future,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.844
as well as the Border
of the Afterlife.

00:13:25.878 --> 00:13:28.650
You won't be able to use
your demon powers,

00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:30.219
so please be careful.

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:32.591
‐ Well, what about
my spirit powers?

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:33.527
Will they still work?

00:13:35.664 --> 00:13:36.766
Uh...

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.837
[yelps]

All right!

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:54.936
I'm countin' on you,
Sacred Arrow!

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:02.017
Damn it! I should be stopping,
shouldn't I?!

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:02.818
[gasps]

00:14:02.852 --> 00:14:04.622
What the?

00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:07.427
What is that giant skeleton?!

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.297
‐ Hmm?

00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:10.834
‐ What is it, Inuyasha?

00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:12.404
‐ [heart beating]
‐ It's the Tessaiga.

00:14:12.437 --> 00:14:15.511
I sense my dad's fang
is trying to tell me something,

00:14:15.544 --> 00:14:17.447
but what?

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.884
‐ Huh? [gasps]

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.253
Up there! Look!

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.760
[arrows rattling]

00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:25.063
‐ Whoa, whoa.

00:14:25.096 --> 00:14:28.302
Why are my Sacred Arrows
getting jumpy all of a sudden?

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:29.438
[gasps]

00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:30.541
W‐Wait.

00:14:30.574 --> 00:14:31.943
<i>Was that...</i>

00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:36.452
I saw them in the photo album
<i>Papa Sota showed me.</i>

00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:38.089
<i>Mom and Dad!</i>

00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:40.961
‐ [inaudible]
‐ <i>It's really them!</i>

00:14:40.994 --> 00:14:43.165
<i>It's my Mom and Dad!</i>

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.571
‐ That was Moroha, wasn't it?

00:14:45.604 --> 00:14:46.840
It was our baby girl!

00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:48.109
‐ Yeah.

00:14:48.142 --> 00:14:51.448
And can you believe
just how much she's grown?

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.926
<i>I know I must still be</i>

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.164
<i>in the Feudal Era</i>
<i>right now, but...</i>

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:04.141
the present has been
recreated here so accurately.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.145
Did they look into my memories?

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:12.591
<i>It's the last school</i>
<i>I attended.</i>

00:15:13.693 --> 00:15:15.196
I was here less than a week,

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:17.601
<i>so I don't have</i>
<i>many memories of it,</i>

00:15:17.635 --> 00:15:19.505
but the details are so exact.

00:15:20.507 --> 00:15:22.878
OSAMU KIRIN:
<i>Still don't have an answer?</i>

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:26.619
This world you see
is the thing you must protect.

00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:29.659
<i>It is also</i>
<i>what you must let go.</i>

00:15:29.692 --> 00:15:31.863
‐ That voice, it almost sounds

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:34.167
<i>like Mr. Kirin,</i>
<i>my homeroom teacher.</i>

<i>‐ It has been a while,</i>
<i>Half‐Demon Princess.</i>

00:15:40.113 --> 00:15:42.484
‐ You're the Tree of Ages?

00:15:42.518 --> 00:15:47.427
‐ You are in the rift between
life, death, and space‐time.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.897
<i>How did you get here?</i>

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.070
<i>Ah, I see.</i>

00:15:52.103 --> 00:15:54.876
<i>You have acquired</i>
<i>the Yukari no Tachikiri.</i>

00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:58.215
That would explain
how you were able to get here.

00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:03.058

<i>‐ That's such</i>
<i>a beautiful melody.</i>

00:16:28.008 --> 00:16:29.946
Wherever did you learn that?

00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:31.749
<i>‐ I don't know.</i>

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.054
It's like my body remembers it.

00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:39.064
Could it be
I learned it from this woman?

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:40.399
TREE OF AGES: <i>How does it feel</i>

00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:43.439
<i>to meet your mother again</i>
<i>after all these years?</i>

00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:44.542
‐ Mother?

00:16:44.575 --> 00:16:45.744
She's my mother?!

00:16:45.777 --> 00:16:47.347
That's impossible!

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.317
How could she still be so young?

00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:53.994
‐ As I understand it, she was
18 when she was sealed inside.

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:55.463
‐ Sealed inside?

00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:58.503
<i>‐ That is correct.</i>
<i>Your mother, Rin,</i>

00:16:58.537 --> 00:17:02.076
<i>has not aged a day</i>
<i>in the last 14 years.</i>

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.684
‐ Tree of Ages, is there
no way to undo the seal?

00:17:06.853 --> 00:17:08.790
<i>‐ Do you wish to save her?</i>

00:17:10.727 --> 00:17:12.798
‐ My heart, it feels...

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:16.071
<i>‐ Is it pity?</i>

00:17:16.104 --> 00:17:19.779
And does that pity fill you
with a desire to protect her?

00:17:22.952 --> 00:17:24.789
[playing melody]

00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:28.229

<i>I've known this place</i>
<i>since I was a child.</i>

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:49.037
That's weird.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.410
I'm not sad, so why am I crying?

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.194
‐ Moroha?

00:18:01.228 --> 00:18:04.134
‐ Towa! Where's Setsuna?
Is she with you?

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:07.307
‐ No. I've looked all over,
but I can't find her anywhere.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.948
And you know we can't bring her
back to life if she dies again.

00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.952
‐ Calm down
and pull yourself together.

00:18:12.985 --> 00:18:14.454
It's just an illusion.

00:18:14.487 --> 00:18:16.626

‐ Setsuna.

00:18:34.427 --> 00:18:37.300
‐ Are we all
inside the Tree of Ages?

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:38.703
‐ Yes.

00:18:38.737 --> 00:18:42.176
TOWA: I've seen that woman
before in my dreams.

MOROHA: Hey, Tree of Ages,
explain something to me!

00:18:58.743 --> 00:19:00.079
I saw my mom and dad

00:19:00.112 --> 00:19:02.317
while I was passing
through the barrier just now.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.522
Just what the hell
was that place they were in?

00:19:04.555 --> 00:19:08.630
‐ It was the border between
this world and the afterlife.

00:19:08.663 --> 00:19:10.232
‐ Afterlife?

00:19:10.266 --> 00:19:13.540
‐ Tree of Ages,
you know, don't you?

00:19:13.573 --> 00:19:16.144
What is it that I must do
to save my mother?

00:19:16.178 --> 00:19:19.985
<i>‐ You must use</i>
<i>the Yukari no Tachikiri</i>

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:22.958
<i>to sever the fate</i>
<i>she shares with Zero.</i>

00:19:22.991 --> 00:19:25.664
‐ The Yukari no Tachikiri.

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:28.770
All right. Then I will
see to it she is saved!

00:19:28.803 --> 00:19:32.276
KIRINMARU: <i>So you have all</i>
<i>found your answers.</i>

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.947
‐ Is that Kirinmaru?

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.151
KIRINMARU: <i>Very well.</i>

00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:40.259
I will allow the three of you
<i>to enter Mount Musubi.</i>

00:19:40.292 --> 00:19:45.837
Go on then and
keep my daughter Rion company.

00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:47.240
‐ Your daughter Rion?

00:19:47.273 --> 00:19:49.177
You mean that girl I met?!

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.283
‐ Wait. So Kirinmaru
has a daughter, and she's here?

00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:55.624
‐ Then you don't care
if we acquire the Kyuyokon root?

00:19:57.528 --> 00:20:02.103
KIRINMARU:
Rion, you have some visitors.

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:03.573
[ears twitch]

00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:09.952
‐ Look. Your friends
have escaped the barrier.

00:20:09.985 --> 00:20:11.789
‐ Oh, great! You both okay?

00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:15.764
‐ I think so. It seems like we
were all having the same dream.

00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:19.003
‐ You're kidding?
All of that was just a dream?

00:20:19.037 --> 00:20:21.408
‐ Actually no,
it was not a dream.

00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:22.210
‐ Huh?

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:23.412
‐ Who are you?

00:20:23.445 --> 00:20:26.318
‐ I am Kirinmaru's daughter,
Rion.

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:27.855
Delighted to meet you.

00:20:27.888 --> 00:20:28.857
‐ It's true, then?

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.428
He wasn't just making that up
when he said that?

00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:35.035
‐ No, there was
no lie or deception.

00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:38.308
‐ So you really are
Kirinmaru's daughter.

00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:41.516
‐ The Kyuyokon root you seek
is right here.

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:44.421
It is yours to take,
if you want it.

[bird squawking]

00:20:49.899 --> 00:20:52.236
‐ Oh! Why, if it
isn't Mr. Kirin.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.640
If this is about Towa,

00:20:53.673 --> 00:20:55.811
you'll find Sota
over at his apartment.

00:20:55.844 --> 00:20:58.616
‐ Thank you, but no.
I'm actually here today

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.254

at the shrine.

‐ Hello, Mr. Kirin.
Nice of you to come.

00:21:10.072 --> 00:21:12.243
‐ Oh, Head Priest.

00:21:12.276 --> 00:21:13.980
Ah, that reminds me.

00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:16.986
Do you have any of those
Shikon Jewel keychain amulets

00:21:17.019 --> 00:21:18.756
you used to sell here?

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.560
‐ "Shikon Jewel"?

00:21:20.594 --> 00:21:23.967
Are you sure that we ever
really sold such a thing?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.436
‐ Oh, my mistake.

00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:27.674
I must have heard wrong. Sorry.

00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:32.383

<i>No doubt about it.</i>

00:21:48.448 --> 00:21:50.452
I'm the only one who remembers.

00:21:50.486 --> 00:21:52.591
<i>I've become</i>
<i>an anomaly in this world.</i>

00:21:54.227 --> 00:21:56.966
<i>Well, then,</i>
<i>what should I do about it?</i>

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.408
Please tell me what to do...

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.013
Tree of Ages.

00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:47.420
RION: I cannot tolerate my
father's selfishness any more.

00:23:47.453 --> 00:23:50.392
<i>I beg of you,</i>
<i>please defeat Kirinmaru</i>

00:23:50.426 --> 00:23:52.998
and protect this
beautiful world that I love.

00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:56.271
I believe you are worthy
of wielding this Kyuyokon root

00:23:56.304 --> 00:23:59.010
and also the Star‐Slicer Flute.

00:23:59.043 --> 00:24:02.985
TOWA: <i>Next time on</i> Yashahime,
<i>"The Girl Named Rion."</i>

00:24:03.018 --> 00:24:04.622
<i>All these years...</i>

00:24:04.655 --> 00:24:07.093
<i>it must have been</i>
<i>so lonely for you.</i>
