00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.352
- Is it really you?

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:11.055
- Moroha.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.134
I've missed you.

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:19.438
I've missed you so much.

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:22.512
MOROHA: <i>Her scent,</i>
<i>it's so familiar.</i>

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.552
<i>I remember it</i>
<i>from a long time ago.</i>

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.191
- Hey, Kagome!

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:32.331
I couldn't find anything
over that way.

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:33.801
- [gasps]

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:34.870
D-Dad?

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:36.472
- Hmm?

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.212
Moroha?!

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:42.652
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.764
[Japanese music playing]

TOWA: <i>"Moroha and Family,</i>
<i>Together Again."</i>

00:02:27.394 --> 00:02:30.233
- Oh, come on. Why are you
getting so emotional about it?

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:33.340
- Well, why shouldn't I be?
It's Moroha!

00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:34.342
- Hmm?

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:35.578
[sniffs]

00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:38.316
I thought I smelled
Sesshomaru's scent around here,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.855
and now I know why.
It's you two!

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:41.857
[both gasp]

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.462
- Sesshomaru's scent?

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.165
- Let me introduce my friends.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.938
This is Towa and Setsuna.

00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:50.307
- Say what?!

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.510
But then, that means...

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:52.378
- Huh?

00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.649
- you two must be
Rin's twin daughters!

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:55.952
BOTH: We are.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.156
- Rin is our mother.
That's correct.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.262
- Well, you're much bigger
than I remember.

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:02.565
- Eh?
- [laughs]

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.571
I helped to deliver the two
of you when you were born.

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:06.372
- Really?

00:03:06.406 --> 00:03:08.309
- You helped deliver us?

00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:09.780
I never knew that.

00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:13.554
- Still, there's
something else familiar here.

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:15.023
Wait a minute.

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:17.762
I've seen outfits
like yours before.

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:18.798
Where was it?

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.402
It's a Shoyo Middle School
uniform, isn't it?

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:24.275
- Yes, but I'm
not there anymore.

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.714
I've transferred
to St. Gabriel Academy.

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:29.753
- I see. You're obviously
very smart, then.

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:32.091
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:35.631
- Wait, so how do you know
who I am, anyway?

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:38.103
Where exactly were you living
in the other world?

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.541
- Well, long story,
but basically

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:43.647
I ended up being found and
raised by the Higurashi family.

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:44.816
- What?!

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.854
You were raised by my family?!

00:03:46.887 --> 00:03:47.856
- Yeah.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.458
- Hey, Inuyasha!

00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:53.066
Turns out Towa here's been
living in the other world!

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.135
- Hmm?
- Huh?

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:56.239
[both growling]

00:03:57.942 --> 00:03:59.044
- What are you doing?!

00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:00.213
What's going on over there?

00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:02.986
- [growling]

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.255
- Inuyasha!

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:06.092
What wrong with you? Grow up!

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:08.798
Haven't you got anything at all
to say to your own daughter?!

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.966
- Uh, yeah.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.670
I-I-I was just...

00:04:11.703 --> 00:04:13.574
I was getting ready
to say something to her,

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:16.112
and I would have said it
if you gave me a chance!

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:18.183
- Same for you, Moroha.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.454
I mean, you're finally
meeting your dad.

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:21.890
- Yeah, I know! I know!

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.527
Don't you think I know that?!

00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.696
- Uh...

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.733
so, Moroha...

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.506
uh, how you been?

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.340
- Er...

00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:32.779
oh, uh, fine, I guess.

00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:35.518
Yeah. How about you, Dad?

00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:36.987
[sighs]

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.391
They're father and daughter
all right.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.697
Towa, give me a hand, will you?

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.732
- 'Course!

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:43.868
BOTH: Uh...

00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.072
- Oh, stop being so bashful!
- Oh, stop being so bashful!

00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:47.709
- Whoa!
- Uhh!

00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:48.944
[both stammer]

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:50.781
[both gasp]

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:53.153
- [chuckles]
Look how grown up you are!

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:55.525
My little baby
isn't a baby anymore.

00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:56.660
- Uh...

00:04:56.693 --> 00:05:00.668
- I can tell you've gotten
strong, too, haven't you?

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.739
- [gasps]

00:05:02.772 --> 00:05:04.643

- [sighs]

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:27.622
- Moroha...

00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:31.697
your mother and I
talked about you every day

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.870
and about how, one day,
we'd see you again.

00:05:36.138 --> 00:05:39.345
There was never a moment when
you weren't in our thoughts.

00:05:40.247 --> 00:05:42.150
<i>- What's going on?</i>

00:05:42.184 --> 00:05:45.023
<i>I've never felt</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:47.929
<i>I feel so, so warm.</i>

00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:49.866

- [continues crying]

[energy chiming]

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.404
- Lord Sesshomaru!

00:06:42.437 --> 00:06:43.473
- Oh, dear!

00:06:43.507 --> 00:06:46.078
Lord Sesshomaru,
are you all right?!

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:50.320
- What's happening, Jaken?

00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:53.126
- This is even worse
than I feared.

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:55.865
That demon fireball
Kirinmaru released

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:58.837
is stealing
Lord Sesshomaru's Haku!

00:06:58.871 --> 00:06:59.639
- His Haku?

00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:02.077
- Our Haku is our life force.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.647
It's what powers our bodies.

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.452
- There has to be some way
that we can save him!

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:07.956
- We might be able to save him

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:11.897
if we remove the demon energy
surrounding his body, but...

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.869
we haven't a chance,
no chance, none,

00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:18.176
not without the Kyuyokon
or something of that kind.

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:19.646
[gasps] Wait!

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:21.583
I just remembered
Towa and her Zanseiken!

00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:24.856
She might be able
to save Lord Sesshomaru!

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:27.461
- Then we need to find her
and bring her here right away.

00:07:27.494 --> 00:07:31.870
- Sadly, I have absolutely
no idea where she is.

00:07:31.903 --> 00:07:34.074
- None at all?

00:07:34.108 --> 00:07:35.076
[gasps]

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.682

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.186
Lord Sesshomaru.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.525
[no audible dialogue]

00:07:42.558 --> 00:07:43.894
The Black Pearl?

00:07:43.927 --> 00:07:47.067
- Of course!
Towa's inside the Black Pearl!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.473
Then I can search for her
using the Staff of Two Heads!

00:07:50.508 --> 00:07:52.244
- Let's go, Master Jaken!

00:07:52.277 --> 00:07:53.747
- Right!

00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:56.185
- KIRINMARU: Sesshomaru!
Are you there?

00:07:56.218 --> 00:07:57.421
[both gasp]

00:07:57.454 --> 00:07:59.091
- Answer me!

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:01.462
If you refuse to come out,

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:03.499
then I'm going to claim this
as a victory!

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:06.072
[Jaken groans]
He can claim it all he wants.

00:08:06.105 --> 00:08:06.907
Doesn't make it true.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.546
All the same,
we don't want Kirinmaru

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:10.781
finding him like this.

00:08:11.883 --> 00:08:14.088
Jaken, Jaken!

00:08:15.357 --> 00:08:17.027
- It doesn't matter.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.102
If left untreated,
Sesshomaru will soon be dead.

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.743
I will have shown Akuru
that I'm the strongest,

00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:26.479
especially once I've put an end

00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:28.249
to those members
of the Dog-Demon Clan

00:08:28.282 --> 00:08:30.420
who were sucked
into the Black Pearl.

00:08:30.453 --> 00:08:33.560
Then I will be chosen
by the ages!

00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:36.566
[water lapping]

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:41.075
- [snoring softly]

00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:46.052
- [gasps] I don't believe it.

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:48.857
Is that really what mobile
phones look like these days?

00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:51.663
- Yeah, but we
call them smartphones now.

00:08:51.696 --> 00:08:53.534
- The one I used to have...

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.738
it folded up like this.

00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:58.944
- Yeah, what we used to call
a flip phone, right?

00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:00.848
- A "flip phone"?

00:09:02.518 --> 00:09:03.620
Wait! Wait!

00:09:03.654 --> 00:09:05.658
Towa, is that Sota?

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:07.862
Sota became a father?!

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:11.001
- He did.
That's Mama Moe next to him,

00:09:11.035 --> 00:09:12.972
and Mei is the name
of their daughter.

00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:15.443
When I was transported
to the other world,

00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:16.847
they took me in.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.184
I had been living
with them for 10 years.

00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:20.821
- So that's what happened.

00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:23.761
Oh, that wife and daughter
of his are adorable!

00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:26.499
[gasps] Mom and Grandpa!

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:28.871
Ahh! And even Buyo!

00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:30.206
Oh, I'm so glad.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.576
Everyone's doing well.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.979
[sighs] Thank goodness.

00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:37.588
My, it's hard to believe
it's been 14 years since then.

00:09:37.622 --> 00:09:39.859
[Moroha snoring]

00:09:39.893 --> 00:09:41.897
KAGOME: She's grown so big.

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:45.604
Meanwhile,
the years seem to pass

00:09:45.638 --> 00:09:49.111
in the blink of an eye
for us here in this pearl.

00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:50.681
Oh! But look!

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:51.983
I've hardly aged at all

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:53.921
since I've been in here,
so no wrinkles.

00:09:53.954 --> 00:09:57.360
Skin as smooth and soft as ever.
Amazing, isn't it?

00:09:57.394 --> 00:09:58.463
- Uh...

00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:01.435
- Yeah, I suppose
that's kind of amazing.

00:10:01.469 --> 00:10:02.404
- 'Course it is.

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:04.576
Just wait 'til you're older.

00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:05.911
- INUYASHA: Hmph.
- Huh?

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:08.684
- Seems to me you two
are awfully good-natured

00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:10.521
for being
the daughters of Sesshomaru.

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:11.623
- [gasps]
- Huh?

00:10:11.656 --> 00:10:14.461
- Well, I guess
they must take after Rin.

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:16.533
Speaking of whom,
how is your mother?

00:10:16.566 --> 00:10:18.069
- Safe, I hope.

00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:21.442
At least she's been freed
from Zero's curse.

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:23.146
- Still...

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:26.318
[music playing]

00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:30.126
[both sigh]

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.630
- Hmm.

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.700
- Yeah, you know,
I'm not really buying it

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:35.403
that Sesshomaru
would let himself

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:37.274
get trounced
by Kirinmaru like that.

00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:38.577
[both gasp]

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.815
- Trust me, it would take
a lot more than that

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:42.450
to get rid of my brother.

00:10:42.484 --> 00:10:43.787
He's too damn stubborn.

00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:45.023
- [both gasp]
- Inuyasha!

00:10:45.056 --> 00:10:47.695
- Hah! Don't worry about him.
He's fine.

00:10:47.728 --> 00:10:49.164
- Inuyasha...

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:50.466
sit, boy!

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.536
- [yelps]

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.638
BOTH: Uh...

00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:54.742
- How can you
make light of it like that?

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:57.113
Towa and Setsuna are really
worried about their father.

00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:59.384
Be a little more considerate,
will you?

00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:00.621
- Okay. [groans]

00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:03.459
- Anyway, we all
need to get out of here.

00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:05.598
You say that
like it's an easy thing.

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:07.400
If we could
just get out of here,

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:09.137
we would have done it long ago.

00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:10.340
- That's true.

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:16.252
- Inuyasha.

00:11:16.285 --> 00:11:17.387
- Hmm?

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.690
- I'm curious.

00:11:18.724 --> 00:11:21.228
How could you be so sure
she was really your daughter?

00:11:21.262 --> 00:11:22.532
BOTH: Huh?

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:24.167
- Well, after all,

00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:27.107
how long has it been
since you've seen Moroha?

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.577
A long time,

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.048
yet you knew it was her
the moment you met?

00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:32.150
- Oh.

00:11:32.183 --> 00:11:34.154
- Ah. Well, you see...

00:11:34.187 --> 00:11:36.325
- [panting]

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:42.204
Moroha must be reuniting with
her parents right about now!

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:43.640
[yelps] Ow!

00:11:43.674 --> 00:11:45.109
Ooh! Ow!

00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:46.613
Ow, ow, ow!

00:11:46.646 --> 00:11:47.949
Hey, I had the right of way!

00:11:47.982 --> 00:11:49.351
Why don't you
watch where you're--

00:11:49.384 --> 00:11:50.320
[shrieks]

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:54.428
K-K-Kirinmaru!

00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:56.332
- Ah, the Black Pearl.

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:58.035
So that's where it went.

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:59.037
[chuckles]

00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:01.308
- [shrieks]

00:12:01.342 --> 00:12:04.314
[energy pulsing]

00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:06.853
- Yes. It's definitely that way.

00:12:06.886 --> 00:12:08.055
- Then let's hurry.

00:12:09.157 --> 00:12:11.061
[flames crackling]

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.075
- Where are we?

00:12:18.109 --> 00:12:20.313
KAGOME: The Lake
of the Staff of Two Heads.

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:21.315
- [gasps]

00:12:21.348 --> 00:12:23.019
- I can see something there

00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:25.323
- at the bottom of the lake.
- [gasps]

00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:28.396
INUYASHA: They're the faces
of an old man and a woman

00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:31.435
who are said to be linked
to the Staff of Two Heads.

00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:35.476
TOWA: The Staff of Two Heads?

00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:38.517
That's the staff that belongs
to that demon Jaken, right?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.451
INUYASHA: You got it.

00:12:43.392 --> 00:12:44.729
- Why this place?

00:12:44.762 --> 00:12:46.365
Why have you brought us here?

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:47.902
- Moroha's life,

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:50.440
we've watched it unfold
on the lake's surface.

00:12:50.473 --> 00:12:51.743
[both gasp]

00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:56.051
- Inuyasha! Look!

00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:57.153
- I see it!

00:12:57.187 --> 00:12:59.091
[Moroha laughing]

00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:03.165
- Is that...

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.669
- It's our daughter.

00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:06.873
It's Moroha!

00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:12.283
- But how?

00:13:12.317 --> 00:13:13.820
- Jaken.

00:13:13.854 --> 00:13:15.490
We think he was
the one who allowed us

00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:18.797
these occasional glimpses
of how our daughter was doing.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.701
BOTH: I see.

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.938
- What a bastard
that Sesshomaru is,

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:24.909
keeping us in here
all these years.

00:13:24.942 --> 00:13:26.980
No offense, girls,
but the first thing I'm gonna do

00:13:27.013 --> 00:13:29.184
when I get out of here
is clobber that dad of yours!

00:13:29.217 --> 00:13:32.390
- We're sorry for what
our father did to you.

00:13:32.424 --> 00:13:33.794
- [stammers]

00:13:33.827 --> 00:13:37.033
- There's no need for you
to apologize, Setsuna.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:40.273
Inuyasha! These girls
have done nothing wrong!

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:41.208
- [shudders]

00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:43.346
Besides...

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.316
I'm sure he had his reasons.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.553
- Hmph!

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:48.022
Well, meanwhile, we're no closer

00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:50.226
to getting out of here
than we ever were!

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:53.032
KAGOME: Hmm.

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:57.307
- Oh, man.
If only we had the Tenseiga.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.712
- The Tenseiga?

00:13:59.746 --> 00:14:02.551
- [panting]

00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:04.421
- [stamps foot]
- [shrieks]

00:14:04.454 --> 00:14:07.427
- Hand it over, little one.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.734
- I'll spare your life
if you give me the pearl.

00:14:10.768 --> 00:14:13.039
- I'd really rather not,
actually.

00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:16.045
- RIN: Don't give it to him!
- [gasps]

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:19.251
- He hasn't defeated
Lord Sesshomaru yet!

00:14:19.284 --> 00:14:20.053
- Hmm?

00:14:20.086 --> 00:14:21.288
- Oh, thank goodness!

00:14:21.321 --> 00:14:23.560
Y-You don't mind
if I stand here, do you?

00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:28.169
Well, well, if it
isn't Sesshomaru's wife.

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:30.507
- [whimpering]
- My duel with him is over,

00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:31.843
and I've won.

00:14:31.876 --> 00:14:34.314
In a few hours,
the last of his Haku

00:14:34.347 --> 00:14:37.555
will have been drained away,
and he will die.

00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:39.559
[Jaken growls]

00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:42.430
- Well, if so...

00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:44.468
I will fight you myself!

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:05.176
- To be unbridled
and free means

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:08.717
that you won't have to be
held back by anyone or anything

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.086
and that you'll
follow your spirit

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:11.723
wherever it leads you.

00:15:11.756 --> 00:15:14.361
- Oh! Question, Master Shippo!

00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:15.229
- Yes?

00:15:15.263 --> 00:15:18.637
- What does the word
"unbridled" mean?

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.008
- It refers
to a horse running free

00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:23.312
without reins
or saddle or rider.

00:15:23.345 --> 00:15:25.450
I want you all
to go out in the world

00:15:25.483 --> 00:15:28.489
and face life with
the same unbridled spirit.

00:15:28.523 --> 00:15:29.458
STUDENTS: Yes, sir!

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:32.898
- And that concludes
my lecture for today.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.504
Now, who is gonna go home
and practice on their own

00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:36.806
so they're ready for the test?

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.610
- Me!
- I will!

00:15:38.643 --> 00:15:41.014
- Bye!
- Thank you!

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:43.452
- Make sure
you give it your all.

00:15:45.223 --> 00:15:46.225
Good grief.

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:47.460
Prepping all these students

00:15:47.494 --> 00:15:51.168
for the Demon Promotion Exam
is exhausting.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.174
[chimes tinkling]

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:57.748
- Huh?

00:15:57.781 --> 00:16:00.654
- How are things going, Shippo?

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:05.731
- They're going well, Ms. Kyubi.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.335
I'm sure those kids
will do just fine.

00:16:08.369 --> 00:16:09.639
But forget them.

00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:13.445
You leave me breathless
as always with your beauty.

00:16:13.479 --> 00:16:14.615
- [laughs]

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:18.355
Transformations and flattery
will get you nowhere with me.

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:20.159
- No, I suppose not.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.367
I haven't reverted
to this form for a while.

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.438
- Well, you wouldn't
have gotten many students

00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:28.877
if you hadn't looked
like a wise old master.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.716
- I studied for that exam
for a long, long time,

00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:35.691
but once I got to the 19th rank,
I'm afraid I just hit a wall.

00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:38.395
- Be that as it may,
I really can't thank you enough

00:16:38.429 --> 00:16:41.603
for agreeing to fill in
for my husband as an instructor.

00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:42.838
- Ah, no biggie.

00:16:42.872 --> 00:16:44.609
I've got nothing but free time.

00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:46.278
Don't give it a second thought.

00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:49.251
- Oh, by the way, about those
people you were searching for,

00:16:49.284 --> 00:16:51.488
Lord Inuyasha and Lady Kagome...

00:16:51.523 --> 00:16:53.092
- What? Did you find them?

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:55.531
- No. At least, not yet.

00:16:55.564 --> 00:16:57.300
But I have heard rumors.

00:16:57.333 --> 00:16:59.237
Apparently their daughter
has been building

00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:02.010
quite a reputation
for herself as a bounty hunter

00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:03.980
and making a killing at it,
I gather.

00:17:04.014 --> 00:17:07.120
- Inuyasha and Kagome's daughter
is a bounty hunter?!

00:17:07.153 --> 00:17:09.725
- And making a killing at it,
I hear.

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:11.629
- No kidding? Really?

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:14.735
Okay, well, I'll believe that
when I see it for myself.

00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:17.708
- Well, as it happens,
we'll be on break for a while.

00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:18.910
- Right.

00:17:18.944 --> 00:17:20.981
Take care of things here,
Ms. Kyubi.

00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:23.587
Fox Magic!

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.624
Up, Up and Away!

00:17:25.657 --> 00:17:30.066
This can transport me only
to places I have memories of.

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:34.709
A place where I have memories
of Inuyasha and Kagome...

00:17:34.742 --> 00:17:36.913
That's the place I want!

00:17:36.946 --> 00:17:38.583
Go! Go! Go!

00:17:38.617 --> 00:17:41.756
[yelling]

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:43.025
- [yelling fades]
- [ding]

00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:44.461
- Huh?!

00:17:44.494 --> 00:17:47.534
You're saying you were actually
killed by Kirinmaru, Setsuna?!

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:48.904
- Yes.

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:52.143
- Yeah, but then I was able
to bring her back to life again

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:53.713
with the broken Tenseiga.

00:17:53.747 --> 00:17:55.817
- With the broken Tenseiga?!

00:17:55.851 --> 00:17:57.655
Are you for real?!

00:17:57.688 --> 00:17:58.924
- [murmurs]
- Huh?

00:17:58.957 --> 00:18:00.827
- She's for real.
- Uh...

00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:02.831
- Good morning, Moroha.

00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:04.502
- Towa used her demon power

00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:07.641
to extend the blade
after Zero had broken it.

00:18:07.675 --> 00:18:11.214
- Hmm. I'm still having trouble
even believing that Sesshomaru

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:13.954
would actually lend
the Tenseiga to anyone,

00:18:13.987 --> 00:18:17.026
let alone that Towa
was able to use its powers

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.462
while it was broken.

00:18:18.495 --> 00:18:20.066
- Dad, what is it?

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.638
- Hmm. Wait a minute.

00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:23.640
[laughs]

00:18:23.673 --> 00:18:24.875
I've got it!

00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:26.846
Congratulate me,
'cause I just figured out

00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:28.215
how we're gonna get out of here!

00:18:28.248 --> 00:18:30.152
- [all gasp]
- How, Inuyasha?

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:31.856
- Listen up, Towa.

00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:33.660
I need you
to summon the Tenseiga

00:18:33.693 --> 00:18:34.962
and bring it to us here.

00:18:34.996 --> 00:18:37.635
- What? Summon the Tenseiga?!

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.276
- I derive little joy
from fighting the weak.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.982
- You may find out
I'm not as weak as you think.

00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:46.552
- Enough, Your Ladyship.

00:18:46.586 --> 00:18:48.288
I'm losing patience.

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:51.428
- Whatever your reasons are,
the day will never come

00:18:51.461 --> 00:18:54.401
when I let you lay a finger
on either of my children!

00:18:55.303 --> 00:18:57.541
- Then you leave me no choice.

00:18:59.277 --> 00:19:00.179
Hmm?

00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:03.218
[grunts]

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.489
[sighs]

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:08.596
Sesshomaru.

00:19:09.699 --> 00:19:11.401
BOTH: Lord Sesshomaru!

00:19:12.303 --> 00:19:13.606
[Shippo babbling]

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.709
- Huh?

00:19:14.742 --> 00:19:16.111
- Wait, what's going on?

00:19:16.144 --> 00:19:17.380
- Fox Magic!

00:19:17.413 --> 00:19:18.917
Whoa! Whoa! Make it stop!

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.121
Make it stop! Make it stop!

00:19:21.154 --> 00:19:22.825
BOTH: Mr. Shippo?

00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:25.496
- Whoa! That's enough, already!

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.398
Stop spinning!

00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.603
- I'm getting dizzy!
- Fox magic! [grunts]

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:29.437
- [yells] Hey!

00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:30.941
Who said you could get on?!

00:19:30.974 --> 00:19:34.147
- I see that you're able to use
some highly advanced fox magic.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.784
That's great.
Then you can use it

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:37.420
to get us the hell out of here!

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:40.126
- What's going on?
Why do we wanna get out of here?

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:41.495
- Agh! Never mind!

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:43.132
- Just hurry up and go!
- ...all right, already!

00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:45.136
Stop squeezing so hard,
will you?!

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:46.138
Fox Magic!

00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:48.475
- [screaming]
- Up, Up and Away!

00:19:49.578 --> 00:19:50.747
- [growls]

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.722
I knew you would come,
Sesshomaru,

00:19:54.755 --> 00:19:58.763
but I'm not sure that was wise,
with your Haku nearly gone.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.646
INUYASHA: That's the gate
between this world and the next.

00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:09.919
If we have the Tenseiga,

00:20:09.952 --> 00:20:13.693
we can get past the guardians
of the gate, Gozu and Mezu.

00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:16.098
So come on! Let's get going!

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:17.634
- Where are we going?

00:20:17.668 --> 00:20:18.937
- Isn't it obvious?

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.072
My dad's grave.

00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:21.408
- SETSUNA: What's happening?
- Huh?

00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:25.316
- [gasps]
- Sesshomaru!

00:20:26.384 --> 00:20:28.021
KIRINMARU: Ah, I see.

00:20:28.055 --> 00:20:30.392
You're summoning
the last of your strength

00:20:30.426 --> 00:20:33.733
in order to protect
your wife and the others.

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:36.238
- Why all this?

00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:39.712
Why are you so determined
to transcend the ages?

00:20:40.814 --> 00:20:41.749
- [scoffs]

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:44.522
Since you're dying,
I might as well tell you.

00:20:45.524 --> 00:20:47.460
Five hundred years from now,

00:20:47.493 --> 00:20:51.368
the Grim Comet will appear
in this world once again.

00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:54.441
That Grim Comet that you
and Inuyasha destroyed

00:20:54.474 --> 00:20:57.848
while I was sleeping
was but a mere fragment.

00:20:57.881 --> 00:21:02.056
This time, its size
will be beyond imagining.

00:21:02.089 --> 00:21:03.993
And this time,
the true Grim Comet

00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:06.264
will come crashing
to the Earth.

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.170
When it does, all
the inhabitants of this world

00:21:09.204 --> 00:21:10.740
will be demon fodder,

00:21:10.774 --> 00:21:13.780
and the human race
will become extinct.

00:21:13.813 --> 00:21:15.282
- Become extinct?

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.487
- And I, Kirinmaru,

00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:20.493
am the only one who can
prevent that from happening.

00:21:20.527 --> 00:21:21.596
- Oh?

00:21:21.629 --> 00:21:23.900
You want to save humanity,
do you?

00:21:23.933 --> 00:21:27.273
- [scoffs] I'm not
so much interested in that.

00:21:27.306 --> 00:21:29.043
But defeating the Grim Comet

00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:31.314
will prove
that I am the strongest.

00:21:32.216 --> 00:21:35.089
Demons will tremble
in fear of me,

00:21:35.122 --> 00:21:38.630
and the humans
will worship me as a god.

00:21:38.663 --> 00:21:42.136
- How do you know what will
happen so far in the future?

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.340
- After the Dog-Demon
of the West

00:21:44.374 --> 00:21:46.546
severed my right arm,
it was tossed

00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:50.486
into the Bone Eater's Well,
where it transcended time.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.593
That arm is living
in human form in the Reiwa era

00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:56.298
under the name Kirin Osamu,

00:21:56.331 --> 00:21:59.270
and he has assured me
that the Grim Comet

00:21:59.304 --> 00:22:02.009
will be falling very soon.

00:22:02.043 --> 00:22:04.314
- My homeroom teacher's the...

00:22:04.347 --> 00:22:06.418
right arm of Kirinmaru?

00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:37.935
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:41.207 --> 00:23:44.147
[music playing]

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.019
KAGOME: Towa, will you tell me
more about the other world?

00:23:47.053 --> 00:23:48.488
TOWA: <i>Oh, sure. Um--</i>

00:23:48.523 --> 00:23:51.227
KAGOME: What do you think
of this slouch-socks trend?

00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:52.430
TOWA: <i>"Slouch" what?</i>

00:23:52.463 --> 00:23:54.635
INUYASHA: <i>This is no time</i>
<i>for idle chitchat!</i>

00:23:54.668 --> 00:23:57.239
<i>We need the Tenseiga</i>
<i>to get us out of here!</i>

00:23:57.273 --> 00:23:59.612
<i>Come on, Towa.</i>
<i>Summon the Tenseiga!</i>

00:23:59.645 --> 00:24:02.450
TOWA: <i>Right! But, uh, how?</i>

00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:05.055
KAGOME AND INUYASHA:
Next time on Yashahime:

00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:06.892
"The Three Princesses Escape!"

00:24:06.926 --> 00:24:08.596
<i>See you soon!</i>
