a quarter‐demon.

‐ Yes, of course.

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:40.374
But for now, we must hurry
and find Lady Towa.

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:42.309
[flute playing]

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:52.553
TOWA: <i>Why did Setsuna say that?</i>

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:55.289
<i>Does she hate</i>
<i>being with me that much?</i>

00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.558
<i>Even after</i>
<i>all this time together,</i>

00:10:57.591 --> 00:11:00.994
<i>it seems she still can't</i>
<i>think of me as her sister.</i>

00:11:01.028 --> 00:11:02.696
[blade whooshing]

00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:05.299
‐ [yells]

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:07.935
‐ You can't protect Lady Towa.

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.270
<i>You're just</i>
<i>not good enough yet.</i>

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.406
‐ [sighs]

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:14.575
<i>He's right. I'm not.</i>

00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:16.510
[birds chirping]

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:20.047
[footsteps shuffling]

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.315
‐ Uncle Kohaku.

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:22.182
‐ Hmm?

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:25.919
So did Gyokuto already tell you?

00:11:25.953 --> 00:11:28.622
‐ Yes. Something about a request

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:31.525
from the leader of
the demon slayers in the north?

00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:32.492
‐ Their leader is the one

00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:35.896
who trained me
to become a demon slayer.

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:37.764
‐ Hard to believe
there was ever a time

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:38.999
when you were in training.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.934
‐ Of course there was.

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:42.836
‐ So what is he requesting?

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.472
‐ Our help
in a large‐scale expedition.

00:11:45.506 --> 00:11:48.275
‐ Will Setsuna and Towa
be coming along?

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:51.879
They seem to have
their hands full at the moment.

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:52.980
‐ They could be of help,

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:55.582
so I'd like to take them
with us if we can.

00:11:57.017 --> 00:11:59.486
‐ On the opposite side
of Mount Hakone,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.555
you'll see Mamiana Island.

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:02.456
‐ And you say this island

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.858
is the place you were born
and grew up in?

00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:06.059
‐ Yup, that's right.

00:12:06.093 --> 00:12:07.494
‐ Man! No offense,

00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:09.663
but I never would've guessed
that you're the young lord

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:12.566
of the famous raccoon dog
demon clan, the Mamidaira.

00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:16.737
‐ Well, "the ex‐young‐lord"
would be a bit more accurate.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.405
‐ Yeah, well, not for long!

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:21.074
Just 'cause you got forced out
on account of some family feud,

00:12:21.108 --> 00:12:22.943
that doesn't mean
you have to live with it!

00:12:22.976 --> 00:12:25.479
You just leave everything
to me, Takechiyo!

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:28.081
I'll bring those evil elders
to their knees

00:12:28.115 --> 00:12:31.351
and get you restored to your
rightful position in no time!

00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:32.953
‐ [groans]

00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:35.055
‐ [playing flute]

00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:39.026
‐ [whooshing]
‐ <i>Huh?</i>

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:40.527
<i>That sound.</i>

00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:41.461
[grunts]

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:43.697
What the...

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.698
Hiraikotsu?

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:46.700
‐ [grunts] Sorry about that.

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:47.935
I scare you?

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:51.205
‐ [angry] Very funny!
That was dangerous, Hisui!

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:54.942
‐ I just wanted to confirm that
my uncle was right, and he was.

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.978
Towa, you really don't know
how to avoid a fight

00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.047
by backing down
or running, do you?

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.816
‐ Hey! I thought
I did pretty well just now!

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.152
KOHAKU: That's dodging,
not running.

00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:08.689
You refuse to run, yet you
leave yourself open to attack.

00:13:08.722 --> 00:13:09.957
‐ I gotta agree.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.358
‐ What?

00:13:24.438 --> 00:13:27.541
HISUI: You're unable to see
the thread of fate at will?

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:28.475
SETSUNA: No.

00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:31.645
I am still lacking
in skill and awareness.

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:35.015
Until I master this naginata,

00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:37.751
I can't save my mother, Rin,
from the curse.

00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:39.920
‐ To truly master a weapon,

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:42.356
you must first learn
to trust your weapon.

00:13:43.757 --> 00:13:45.659
‐ Trust my weapon?

00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:49.496
‐ Yes. It's what
my mother told me,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.133
to trust Hiraikotsu and
to strengthen my bond with it.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:56.470
But it's not something
that's easily done overnight.

00:13:57.571 --> 00:13:59.940
Setsuna, being a demon slayer

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:02.442
gives you the opportunity
of mastering it.

00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:04.845
So just look at it
as something to work on

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:06.747
through experience in battle.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.681
‐ [grunts]

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.287
Strengthen my bond with it.
I see.

00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:16.256
‐ [seabird calling]
‐ [Moroha sighs]

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.225
The air's so clean and fresh!

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:21.395
‐ Boy that flight was long.
I'm exhausted!

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:22.663
‐ Wow.

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.898
So that's Mamiana Island, huh?

00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:26.500
‐ Yeah, and that high point

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.936
is where
the Mamidaira Clan's castle is

00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:31.738
and the Full Moon
Raccoon Dog Tower.

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:34.107
‐ Well, that's good to know,
I guess.

00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:35.943
‐ [bird squawks]
‐ Huh?

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:39.546
‐ Young Lord!
Master Takechiyo!

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.714
‐ Who's that?

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:42.382
‐ [squawks]

00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:43.550
‐ [grunts]

00:14:43.584 --> 00:14:44.384
‐ [chirps]

00:14:44.418 --> 00:14:46.620
‐ This is my trusted elder,
Hachiemon,

00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:48.322
and my vassal, Takamaru.

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:49.356
‐ [squawks]

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.557
‐ Young Lord!

00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:52.960
How wonderful that you
have returned at last!

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.761
‐ It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:14:54.795 --> 00:14:56.763
‐ And this young lady with you?

00:14:56.797 --> 00:14:58.565
‐ I hired her to help us out.

00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:00.567
Meet Moroha the Demon Killer!

00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:01.535
‐ Yo!

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.171
‐ What?! No way!
‐ Huh?

00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:07.641
‐ When I think of how long
it's been, Lady Moroha...

00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:08.642
‐ Wha?

00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.444
‐ Huh?
‐ [questioning squawk]

00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:13.213
‐ Your father and mother
entrusted you to my keeping

00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:14.982
when you were but an infant.

00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:17.351
And it was none other
than myself, Hachi,

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:20.053
who escorted you
to the Wolf‐Demon Tribe.

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:22.489
‐ Oh, so you did that? Really?

00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:24.458
Hey, wait a second!
Are you telling me

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.627
that you actually knew
my mom and dad?!

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.461
‐ Oh, yes.

00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:30.564
Your parents
were truly fine people.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:31.765
‐ [gasps]

00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:33.166
So they're dead?

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.136
‐ Well, I actually didn't
witness it with my own eyes,

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.406
But it was Kirinmaru and
Sesshomaru they were facing,

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.075
and considering there's
been no sign of your parents

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:45.012
ever since,
it seems likely that they...

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:47.748
‐ So when I saw
the two of them...

00:15:49.216 --> 00:15:51.518
that was the afterlife?

00:15:51.552 --> 00:15:52.719
[no audible dialogue]

00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:54.655
[shuddering]

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.025
[nervous chuckle]

00:15:58.058 --> 00:15:59.760
What's wrong? Why so glum?

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.461
‐ You sure
you're still up for this?

00:16:01.495 --> 00:16:03.397
‐ Well, of course she is,
Young Lord.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.800
You made the right choice in
hiring Lady Moroha to help you.

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:09.169
After all,
it was her mother's arrow

00:16:09.203 --> 00:16:13.407
that originally sealed away
the evil Full Moon Raccoon Dog.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.108
‐ It was? Really?

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:17.611
‐ My mom did that?

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.080
‐ That's right, and now
that we have the daughter

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:23.250
of Lady Kagome on our side,
we have nothing to fear!

00:16:23.283 --> 00:16:25.152
Our victory is guaranteed.

00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:27.955
‐ Well, not to boast
or anything, but I agree.

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:29.523
‐ That's the spirit!

00:16:29.556 --> 00:16:30.691
‐ So when do we start?

00:16:30.724 --> 00:16:32.025
‐ [squawks]

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:33.093
[chain whooshing]

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:35.629
‐ Towa!
Ready to go another round?

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:37.531
‐ Yes, please!

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:39.633
‐ Attack!

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.502
‐ [yells]

00:16:41.535 --> 00:16:42.436
‐ [grunts]

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:45.305
‐ [gasps]

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:48.675
‐ [gasps]
‐ Now choose quickly, Towa!

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:51.645
‐ [grunts]

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:52.646
[yells]

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:53.780
[gasps]

00:16:53.814 --> 00:16:55.282
‐ [grunts]

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.585
‐ All right, I give up.

00:16:58.619 --> 00:17:00.787
‐ You should have avoided it.

00:17:00.821 --> 00:17:03.123
‐ Fighting against
a sickle and chain,

00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:04.591
it's tougher than I thought.

00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:05.792
‐ That's not it.

00:17:05.826 --> 00:17:06.793
‐ Huh?

00:17:06.827 --> 00:17:09.263
‐ As I said,
your one true weakness

00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:12.900
is your refusal to even consider
retreating as an option.

00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:15.369
‐ But retreating is... [sighs]

00:17:15.402 --> 00:17:17.971
‐ You think it's
somehow shameful to run.

00:17:18.005 --> 00:17:20.307
I don't know
what happened in the past,

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.176
but I think,
deep in your heart,

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:25.012
there's a regret for having
run away from something.

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:29.883
‐ A regret for having
run away from something?

00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:31.885
‐ Back when I was very young,

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:34.788
I traveled around
with all sorts of people.

00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:36.323
But there were only two I met

00:17:36.356 --> 00:17:38.926
who never backed down
from anyone,

00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:42.062
Lord Sesshomaru and Lady Kikyo.

00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:44.665
They always stood tall,
with dignity.

00:17:44.698 --> 00:17:46.400
They were unassailable.

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:50.103
When I watch you fight,
Towa, you look so...

00:17:50.137 --> 00:17:51.572
reckless, I worry.

00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:52.506
‐ [gasps]

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:55.742
‐ As you are a daughter
of Lord Sesshomaru,

00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:56.910
you have many enemies,

00:17:56.944 --> 00:18:00.480
and your life
will often be threatened.

00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:02.149
So don't be ashamed.

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:04.852
Sometimes it's all right
to run away, Towa.

00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:06.253
‐ [gasps]

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:10.457
‐ I've decided to only take
Setsuna on this expedition.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.491
‐ [sighs]

00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:13.393
‐ For the time being,

00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:15.796
focus on the work
you're doing here.

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:17.030
‐ Yes, sir.

00:18:17.064 --> 00:18:19.566
But please,
take care of Setsuna.

00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:29.977
[insects chirping]

00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:33.280
MOROHA: So that's
the castle, huh?

00:18:33.313 --> 00:18:36.650
Wait. What's that weird thing
floating over there?

00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:39.319
‐ Where?
Oh, that's a sentinel eye.

00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:41.421
‐ What happens if it spots us?

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:44.892
‐ Every guard in the castle
will attack us at once.

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:47.995
‐ Well, then we should
plan some kind of strategy
