00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:25.785
Hi there. Are you lost?

Rion! Riku!

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:36.272
Huh? Uh...

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:39.312
‐ What is it
that you're looking for?

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:41.416
‐ That little boy
who was just right here.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.088
‐ Oh? As far as I could tell,
you were alone.

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.092
‐ Yes, and you shouldn't be.

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.600
I hope you will permit us both
to accompany you.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:50.969
‐ Uh, why's that?

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:52.739
‐ Because of my Aunt Zero.

00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:54.977
She has put a target
on your life.

00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:01.295
<i>It is a fitting place</i>

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.734
<i>and escape from one's</i>

00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:07.107
‐ Welcome to my mansion.

00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:09.546
My name is Nanahoshi,

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.786
and by reading
the movements of the stars,

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.123
I am able to grant your wish.

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:17.094
‐ [laughs]

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:19.098
And for granting me my wish,

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.904
what do you ask for
in return, Lord Nanahoshi?

00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:27.649
‐ I desire only the pain and
sorrow that burden your heart.

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:30.053
You see,
those bitter tears of anguish

00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:31.222
that are shed by commoners

00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:34.663
are a most exquisite delicacy
to me. [laughs]

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:38.103
‐ I'd heard you have
a very peculiar diet.

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.273
‐ [grunts] If you
have no business here,

00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:42.478
then I will
simply take your tears.

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:45.818
‐ Go on, then.
Please, do help yourself.

00:03:48.323 --> 00:03:51.329
‐ This piece of the finest
aromatic wood in the world

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:53.032
is the Mini Galaxy.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.636
Provide it
with people's sorrows,

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.809
and it releases
the most splendid fragrance.

‐ Oh, what's the matter?

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:13.406
Do you not like what you see,
good sir?

00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:16.312
‐ There's no sorrow
in your heart.

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:18.717

is that possible?

I have sealed it away
in these Rainbow Pearls of mine,

00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:31.008

I can't move my body!

What's the meaning of this?

00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:43.233
What do you want with me,
you infernal witch?!

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:44.936
‐ I'm going to set
a little trap,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.874

to be part of it,

00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:48.878

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:03.741
‐ It's called "hand cream,"
I guess.

00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:07.882
<i>‐ Here, Setsuna.</i>
<i>Take this with you.</i>

00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:10.387

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.324
<i>It smells like lavender.</i>

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:15.865
<i>‐ What is "hand cream"?</i>

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:16.934
‐ [chuckles]

00:05:24.081 --> 00:05:25.918
<i>‐ Anyway...</i>

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:27.655
<i>take care of yourself.</i>

‐ This stuff here?

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:42.719
It's called "hand cream."

00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:44.221
‐ Huh?
‐ Uh, no.

00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:46.259
I wasn't talking to you, Hisui.

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:47.662
‐ Uh...

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:25.270
What're you doin'?
Let me outta here! I'm innocent!

00:06:25.303 --> 00:06:28.611
‐ Yeah, you're innocent.
And I'm a honey badger!

00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:30.581
‐ Hey, I was just passing by!

00:06:30.615 --> 00:06:32.251
You guys have
some kind of law against that?

00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:33.486
‐ Save your breath.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.025
We know you're working
for that traitor, Takechiyo.

00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:38.029
You're in big trouble.

00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:42.337
‐ Okay, so I guess they're
not as dumb as they look.

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:43.607
And if that's the case,

00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.546
arguing's not
gonna get me anywhere.

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.353

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:55.497
‐ Huh? Oh, you mean this thing?

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:57.936
They call it a bicycle
where I'm from.

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:01.309
‐ Oh, yes.
That is extraordinary as well,

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:04.214
but actually I was
referring to you, Lady Towa.

00:07:04.248 --> 00:07:05.551
‐ To me?

00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:06.987
Well, yeah. I suppose...

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.026
I'm not your typical person
of this time period.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.472
‐ I have no other choice but
to follow at a safe distance.

00:07:16.506 --> 00:07:18.376
Otherwise Kirinmaru
will find out

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:20.313
where they are for sure.

00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:21.315
Huh?

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:24.355
‐ [wind blowing]
‐ Oh, my.

00:07:24.388 --> 00:07:27.729
It would appear that
my efforts were for naught.

00:07:27.762 --> 00:07:30.868
‐ You're a very kind person,
Lady Towa,

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:34.542
but also you're
a very strong person.

00:07:34.576 --> 00:07:37.214
That is why
I have complete confidence

00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:39.753
that you are
just the person to rely on.

00:07:39.786 --> 00:07:41.556
‐ [gasps]
‐ You think so?

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.727
I'm not so sure anymore.

00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:47.367
I've been told that my skills
still need a lot more practice.

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:49.171
‐ Do they, now? Well, what I say

00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:52.645
is that you are the light
that gives us hope, Lady Towa.

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:56.419
‐ I hope you will forgive me for
interrupting your conversation,

00:07:56.452 --> 00:07:59.559
but I'm afraid we have
an unwelcome visitor.

00:07:59.592 --> 00:08:01.963
‐ [gasps]
‐ Who are you talking about?

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:03.901
[tense music playing]

00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:08.944
Kirinmaru!

00:08:08.977 --> 00:08:09.913
‐ Father!

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:14.556
‐ Stay right where you are!

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:17.094
I will give my life
to defend you.

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:21.603
[wind blowing]

00:08:23.272 --> 00:08:25.678
[gear rattling]

00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:28.684
‐ This is an impressive row
of houses.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.255
HISUI: These people
seem pretty well off.

00:08:31.288 --> 00:08:33.894
‐ But of course they are.
After all,

00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:36.700
they were able to hire
outside demon slayers like us.

00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:39.572
‐ Uh, sir, why is it
the people in this area

00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:41.275
are so wealthy, anyway?

00:08:41.308 --> 00:08:43.514
‐ Well, from what I hear,

00:08:43.547 --> 00:08:46.152
it's all because
of their local village shrine.

00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:47.588
It holds the divine treasure

00:08:47.622 --> 00:08:49.425
known as the Blessing
of the Five Grains,

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:52.632
which is said to bring
good fortune to the land.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.571
‐ And this place
is the Gokoku Village

00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:57.307
that requested our services?

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.677
KOHAKU: That's right.

00:09:03.286 --> 00:09:05.256
‐ Hey, it's Kohaku!

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.094
‐ Kuzu and Yamata!

00:09:07.127 --> 00:09:08.597
It's been a long time.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.133
How have the two of you
been doing?

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:13.607
‐ Oh, we're doing just great.
What's it been, like 15 years?

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.743
‐ The chief of the north

00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:16.780
sends you his best regards,
by the way.

00:09:16.813 --> 00:09:19.786
‐ You mean your chief's
not gonna be here himself?

00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:23.025
‐ The one thing
he can't fight is old age.

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:25.497
This man Goro
has come in his stead.

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.568
‐ It is an honor to meet you.

00:09:28.937 --> 00:09:31.510
These here are Rokuta, Nanasuke.

00:09:31.543 --> 00:09:34.281
That's Hisui and lastly Setsuna.

00:09:34.314 --> 00:09:36.920
‐ A female demon slayer?

00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:39.491
Haven't seen one of those
since Lady Sango.

00:09:39.526 --> 00:09:41.797
‐ Come on. She's only a kid.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.334
You want us to believe
she's really ready for this?

00:09:44.368 --> 00:09:46.272
‐ She may be young,
but trust me.

00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:49.211
Her skills already rival
those of my older sister.

00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:52.652
‐ [scoffs] Yeah, well,
I'll believe that when I see it.

00:09:52.685 --> 00:09:54.388
‐ Then allow me to show you.

00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:56.526
I will take you on
anytime you want.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.229
‐ Ah, he's not worth it.

00:09:58.262 --> 00:10:00.333
‐ This will not be an easy job.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:01.736
To stop all the mayhem,

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.642
we have to get rid
of a large herd of Flame Bulls.

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:06.212
‐ Flame Bulls?

00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:07.648
‐ Cattle demons.

00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:12.992
They go around burning houses,
farms, even whole forests.

00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:14.529
‐ But wait a minute.

00:10:14.562 --> 00:10:16.733
I thought Flame Bulls
always obeyed their master,

00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:18.002
who's the local deity,

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:20.206
so why are they
running wild, then?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.177
‐ 'Cause they are obeying him.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.516
‐ Yeah. It's their master,
the local deity,

00:10:24.549 --> 00:10:26.887
who sent the Flame Bulls
on a rampage.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.393
‐ That changes things.
So to stop the Flame Bulls,

00:10:30.426 --> 00:10:33.299
we have to appease
the local deity first?

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:36.071
‐ You still think
you're up to it?

00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:37.508
‐ Hmph!

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:39.011
‐ [whoosh]
‐ Help! A Flame Bull!

00:10:39.044 --> 00:10:41.215
‐ [all gasp]
‐ A Flame Bull is here!

00:10:41.248 --> 00:10:43.085
[villagers yelling]

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:46.726
‐ No!
‐ Look!

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:50.200
‐ [bellows]

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.605
‐ Hiraikotsu!

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:55.143
‐ [bellows]

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:56.378
‐ It blocked it!

00:10:56.412 --> 00:10:58.382
‐ Kirara, wait here.
‐ [meows]

00:10:58.416 --> 00:11:00.420
‐ Scourge of Swallows!

00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:05.196
‐ [bellows]

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.369
‐ She defeated that Flame Bull
with her first shot.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:10.106
‐ Very impressive.

00:11:10.139 --> 00:11:13.580
I see what you mean now
about her rivaling your sister.

00:11:13.614 --> 00:11:16.185
‐ Help them put out the fire.
Give 'em a hand.

00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.387
‐ Yes, sir!
‐ Yes, sir!

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.657
‐ [meows]

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.405
‐ You've raised a fine
demon slayer there, Kohaku.

00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:29.278
‐ Thank you.
And she's still growing.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.290
‐ Now seems like a good time.

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:37.929
‐ [click]
‐ Ta‐da!

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.933
They may have confiscated
my bow and arrows,

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:42.939
but they missed
this handy‐dandy thing.

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:44.141
[chuckles]

00:11:44.174 --> 00:11:46.913
[grunting]

00:11:46.947 --> 00:11:48.584
Eh...

00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:49.719
‐ [click]
‐ [laughs]

00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:51.623
Yes!

00:11:51.656 --> 00:11:54.361
Okay, am I a genius or what?

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:58.436
[tense music playing]

00:11:58.469 --> 00:11:59.672
[Riku and Rion gasp]

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:01.943
TOWA: <i>My gut tells me</i>
<i>we should run away.</i>

00:12:01.977 --> 00:12:04.949
<i>I know that would be</i>
<i>the right thing to do,</i>

00:12:04.983 --> 00:12:07.588
<i>the smart thing to do,</i>

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:08.857
<i>but for some reason</i>

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.763
<i>no matter how hard</i>
<i>I try to convince myself,</i>

00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:13.499
<i>I just can't do it!</i>

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:30.133
COURTIER: His Young Excellency!

00:12:34.007 --> 00:12:37.280
[scraping]

00:12:37.314 --> 00:12:38.517
‐ [grunts]

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.652
Ah. [chuckles]

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:41.823
<i>Now let's see.</i>

00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:43.359
<i>Hey! That's my bow!</i>

00:12:43.392 --> 00:12:46.800
‐ So what have you done with
that intruder from last night?

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:50.774
<i>‐ What the hell?! He looks</i>
<i>exactly like Takechiyo!</i>

00:12:50.808 --> 00:12:53.580
‐ Your Excellency,
we locked her in the dungeon.

00:12:53.614 --> 00:12:57.320
‐ If she is indeed the daughter
of that vile priestess Kagome,

00:12:57.354 --> 00:13:00.360
then she is an enemy
of the Full Moon Raccoon Dog.

00:13:00.393 --> 00:13:04.267
Furthermore, if her father's
that accursed Inuyasha,

00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.608
she's the spawn of the fiend
who scarred my face!

00:13:07.642 --> 00:13:10.413
‐ Whoa! These people hate me,

00:13:10.446 --> 00:13:12.183
<i>like, really hate me.</i>

00:13:12.217 --> 00:13:14.822
‐ But, Shogen,
are you absolutely certain

00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:17.093
that she's working
for my older brother?

00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:23.306
that‐ Oh, yes.king
There can be no mistake.
‐ Ah, my dear brother,
how I miss him so.

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:25.243
‐ Lord Kikunosuke!

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:26.211
Takechiyo is the villain

00:13:26.245 --> 00:13:28.850
who nearly brought ruin
to the Mamidaira Clan.

00:13:28.884 --> 00:13:31.388
He is no longer
a brother to you or anyone.

00:13:31.422 --> 00:13:33.326
‐ Yes, of course. You're right.

00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:34.161
Forgive me.

00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:35.363
‐ [screen slides]
‐ [retainer gasps]

00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:37.167
Sir! Sir! The intruder,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.837
they've just escaped
from the dungeon!

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.208
‐ All of you,
spread out and find her!

00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:43.346
‐ COURT: Yes, sir!
‐ [Moroha groans]

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:46.051
Guess I'll have to fetch
my bow and arrow later.

00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:50.393
‐ It's been a long time,
my daughter.

00:13:50.426 --> 00:13:52.865
‐ Not that long, Father.

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.535
Have you already forgotten

00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:57.173
how the two of us met
in your dreams every night?

00:13:57.207 --> 00:14:01.683
‐ Dreams are one thing.
Reality is another.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.687
As long as you're enjoying
the sensation

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.657
of walking this earth
on your own feet,

00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:06.893
that is enough.

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:09.364
‐ You call this real?

00:14:09.398 --> 00:14:12.772
This body is just a vessel
made of bones and grave soil!

00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:15.878
‐ Do you despise me that much,

00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:17.515
your own father?

00:14:17.548 --> 00:14:19.051
‐ Yes, my own father

00:14:19.084 --> 00:14:21.723
who kept me prisoner
on Mount Musubi for centuries!

00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:23.292
‐ [sighs]

00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:25.931
Can't you see
I did this all for you?

00:14:25.964 --> 00:14:27.568
But no matter.

00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:31.241
No one will keep me
from my dream

00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:35.216
of journeying beyond space
and time, not any of you.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:38.222
Not even
my most beloved daughter.

00:14:38.255 --> 00:14:40.728
‐ [gasps]
‐ We'll see about that.

00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:42.130
‐ And as for you two,

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:44.635
do you think
you can protect Rion from me?

00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:48.275
[flute playing]

00:14:50.748 --> 00:14:51.616
‐ [grunts]

00:14:53.787 --> 00:14:56.726
I can and will protect her!

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.663
‐ That sword.

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.500
You gave it to her?

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:02.437
If I'm facing the Zanseiken,

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.412
then I guess I don't need
to hold back now, do I?

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.123
‐ Come on!
I'll fight you one on one!

00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:13.025
‐ [scoffs]

00:15:13.058 --> 00:15:15.463
Watch, Rion,
and you'll begin to understand

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:18.436
just how much more powerful
your father has become.

00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:20.139
‐ How shameless he is.

00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:23.312
‐ Lady Towa, this might not be
the time to cross swords.

00:15:23.345 --> 00:15:25.316
‐ I won't run away!

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:27.153
‐ But, Lady Towa...

00:15:27.187 --> 00:15:28.623
‐ [yells]

00:15:28.657 --> 00:15:30.861
[gasps]

00:15:30.894 --> 00:15:31.863
That was close.

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:34.367
[pinwheel clicking]

00:15:35.671 --> 00:15:36.840
It's that kid again.

00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:37.942
‐ What is it?

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:39.645
What was it you just saw?

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:42.952
[gear clicking]

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.488
‐ Tell me, Miss Rion,

00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:47.293
do you see or sense anything?

00:15:47.327 --> 00:15:49.866
‐ No, not a thing.

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:51.636
[gear clicking]

00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:53.874
‐ So she can see Akuru.

00:15:53.907 --> 00:15:55.376
‐ Eh?

00:15:57.882 --> 00:15:59.017
[eyes twitch]

00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:01.188
[chuckles]

00:16:02.157 --> 00:16:04.261
‐ [pinwheel clicking]
‐ Uh...

00:16:04.294 --> 00:16:05.496
he's gone.

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:08.002
All right, come on!

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:09.037
Let's do this!

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.674
‐ The child you saw...

00:16:10.707 --> 00:16:12.477
was he carrying a pinwheel
in his hand?

00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:14.882
‐ Why are you even asking?

00:16:14.916 --> 00:16:16.485
Yeah, of course he was.

00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:20.594
‐ You truly are
Sesshomaru's daughter.

00:16:21.863 --> 00:16:23.232
[all gasp]

00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:26.171
‐ Not everyone can see Akuru.

00:16:26.205 --> 00:16:27.407
The ability to see him

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.745
might very well
be unique to your clan.

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:31.014
‐ Huh?

00:16:31.048 --> 00:16:32.483
‐ Clearly, Father,

00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:36.325
the Windmill of Time
no longer favors you.

00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:38.697
In fact,
your time's already over.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.335
‐ Then let's see you
try to end it.

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:43.974
‐ I believe
the world we have yet to see

00:16:44.007 --> 00:16:46.679
lies with Lady Towa
and not with you!

00:16:46.713 --> 00:16:49.184
Only time will tell.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.791
However, as you have
chosen to defy me,

00:16:52.825 --> 00:16:55.697
be prepared
for a difficult path ahead.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.541
‐ Kirinmaru, you can't run!

00:17:00.574 --> 00:17:01.543
‐ Lady Towa‐‐

00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:03.078
‐ [winces]
‐ Riku!

00:17:04.782 --> 00:17:06.485
KIRINMARU: We will meet again...

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:08.957
Sesshomaru's daughter.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.727
‐ Riku! I'm sorry!

00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:11.963
That was my fault.

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:14.467
‐ [gasps] I let my guard down.

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:17.942
My eyes, I can't see anything.

00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:20.379
[both gasp]

00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:32.370
‐ First a shaman,
now demon slayers.

00:17:32.403 --> 00:17:35.911
Such foolish people.
They never learn.

00:17:35.944 --> 00:17:37.213
‐ [music playing]
‐ [rustling]

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:39.919
KOHAKU: Excuse me, sir,
but what is that shaman doing?

00:17:39.952 --> 00:17:41.990
‐ I asked him
to summon a blizzard

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:44.094
and surround our village
with it.

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:46.398
‐ So this snowstorm is...

00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:48.302
‐ The result
of his prayers, yes.

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:52.443
It's unlikely the Flame Bulls
will attack during a blizzard.

00:17:52.477 --> 00:17:53.412
The cold and snow

00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:55.449
will greatly weaken
the flames of their horns.

00:17:55.483 --> 00:17:57.688
‐ Sounds like you
solved things already,

00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:59.759
so why bother to call us in?

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:02.363
‐ Well, it isn't that simple.

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:06.338
We can't go on living our lives
in a perpetual blizzard forever.

00:18:06.371 --> 00:18:08.108
‐ No, of course you can't.

00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:10.279
But the minute
you call off the blizzard,

00:18:10.313 --> 00:18:12.851
the Flame Bulls
will start attacking again.

00:18:12.885 --> 00:18:13.853
Is that right?

00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:15.456
‐ Exactly.

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:18.362
‐ The eight of us will split up

00:18:18.395 --> 00:18:21.368
and guard the village from
an attack in any direction.

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:24.140
Fending off the Flame Bulls
should be doable,

00:18:24.174 --> 00:18:27.146
but their master,
the local deity's, the problem.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.152
‐ Yes, Mayonaka simply
cannot be reasoned with.

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:31.823
He is a problem indeed.

00:18:31.856 --> 00:18:35.363
‐ Mayonaka?
So he's the local deity?

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:36.799
‐ Yes.

00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:37.968
‐ But why?

00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:40.172
Why would he
be attacking the village?

00:18:40.206 --> 00:18:42.377
There has to be
some reason for it.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.617
‐ I have no idea!
It's an utter mystery.

00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:46.686
‐ [grunts]

00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:50.493
By the way, if I remember right,
wasn't there once

00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:53.399
a local deity named Mahiruma
who lived in this land?

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.769
‐ [gasps]

00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:56.606
So you know about him, do you?

00:18:56.639 --> 00:19:00.046
‐ The divine object you call
the Blessing of the Five Grains,

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:02.518
would we be able to see it?

00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:03.820
‐ [sighs]

00:19:03.853 --> 00:19:05.691
Very well, then.

00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:08.295
[wind blowing]

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:11.234
‐ [wind fades]
‐ [birds chirping]

00:19:11.268 --> 00:19:15.142
NANASUKE: It's as if the sun
was shining on this spot alone.

00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:17.648
HEADMAN: Thanks to
this divine treasure,

00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:20.319
every village in this area
enjoys the benefits

00:19:20.353 --> 00:19:24.227
of fertile fields
and abundant crops.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.766
KOHAKU: So this is
the Blessing of the Five Grains.

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:30.741
‐ I'll bet you anything
this is what Mayonaka is after.

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:32.911
‐ I can definitely see why too.

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:34.515
Not just him, either.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:37.420
Warlords, demons,
other deities from far off,

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:39.157
who wouldn't covet such a thing?

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.727
‐ Exactly!

00:19:40.761 --> 00:19:42.698
Please help us, demon slayers.

00:19:42.731 --> 00:19:45.336
If you do, you will be
rewarded most handsomely.

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:47.908
‐ What do you think?

00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:49.144
‐ Hmm.

00:19:49.177 --> 00:19:51.214
If the leader
of the northern demon slayers

00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:53.152
was willing to sign on, then...

00:19:53.185 --> 00:19:55.657
‐ All right! Then let's
start setting some traps

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:56.893
for those Flame Bulls.

00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:58.897
‐ Got it. That's a good idea.

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.636
‐ Tell me. What if you

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:05.042
just handed this treasure over
to Mayonaka? What then?

00:20:05.076 --> 00:20:06.846
‐ Ridiculous!
If we did that,

00:20:06.879 --> 00:20:09.084
this village
would cease to exist!

00:20:09.117 --> 00:20:11.656
Where would we be
without our divine treasure?

00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:12.791
[birds squawking]

00:20:12.825 --> 00:20:14.360
TOWA: I'm really sorry, Riku.

00:20:14.394 --> 00:20:16.098
This is all my fault.

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:19.437
‐ No, it isn't.
Riku was injured because of me.

00:20:20.607 --> 00:20:23.145
‐ Please stop.
You're both wrong.

00:20:23.178 --> 00:20:25.082
I'm the one
who let his guard down.

00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:27.253
But Kirinmaru...

00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:28.623
is also blind now.

00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:31.996
He can't use me as a way to
pinpoint our location anymore,

00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:34.735
so in a way,
it's a blessing in disguise.

00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:37.541
‐ But if only I'd been
a little more careful...

00:20:37.574 --> 00:20:39.712
‐ Please stop blaming yourself,
Lady Towa.

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:42.951
The fact is,
sometimes being able to see

00:20:42.985 --> 00:20:45.322
can cause you
to overlook the truth.

00:20:46.258 --> 00:20:47.561
‐ [panting]

00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:49.230
[guards yelling]

00:20:49.264 --> 00:20:50.801
‐ [chuckles]

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.005
Hey, I know you're
all just doing your job,

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:54.608
and I really
don't wanna hurt you,

00:20:54.642 --> 00:20:56.979
so make sure
you dodge this, okay?!

00:20:57.013 --> 00:20:58.950
Crimson Dragon Wave!

00:20:58.983 --> 00:21:00.019
[dragon roars]

00:21:00.052 --> 00:21:01.622
[guards scream]

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:02.958
‐ [laughs]

00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:03.993
Huh?

00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:05.329
[energy hums]

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:09.772
‐ [laughs]

00:21:09.805 --> 00:21:12.845
So many years,
I have waited for revenge!

00:21:15.015 --> 00:21:16.118
‐ [laughs]

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.821
So you finally showed up, huh...

00:21:17.855 --> 00:21:20.694
Full Moon Raccoon Dog.

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:24.434
With this rouge,

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:27.440
I become Beniyasha,
Destroyer of Lands!

00:21:27.473 --> 00:21:29.845
‐ Wait, Moroha! Hold on!
‐ Huh?

00:21:29.879 --> 00:21:31.448
‐ If you use your rouge now,

00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:34.354
then you'll be unconscious
for an entire day!

00:21:34.387 --> 00:21:36.324
‐ That's all in the past,
Takechiyo.

00:21:36.358 --> 00:21:38.362
I've learned how to control it.

00:21:41.536 --> 00:21:45.142
Now bear witness to the power of
the new and improved Beniyasha!

00:21:45.176 --> 00:21:46.478
‐ [growls]

00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:48.516
[roars]

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:52.390
‐ Crimson Backlash Wave!

00:21:59.772 --> 00:22:01.709
[dragon roars]

00:22:05.851 --> 00:22:06.919
‐ [laughs]

00:22:06.953 --> 00:22:08.723
‐ [stammers]

00:22:11.829 --> 00:22:13.900
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:44.113
[music playing]

00:23:44.147 --> 00:23:47.253
TOWA: The demon slayers
try to protect Gokoku Village

00:23:47.286 --> 00:23:49.625
<i>from a local deity</i>
<i>named Mayonaka.</i>

00:23:49.658 --> 00:23:52.363
But they soon find out there's
<i>a traitor in their midst!</i>

00:23:52.396 --> 00:23:55.737
Wake up, Moroha!
This is no time for sleeping!

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:56.906
<i>We need to listen carefully</i>

00:23:56.939 --> 00:23:58.943
<i>if we're going to uncover</i>
<i>the hidden truth!</i>

00:23:58.977 --> 00:24:03.051
<i>Next time on</i> Yashahime:
<i>"Mayonaka the Visitor."</i>

00:24:03.085 --> 00:24:06.993
What? You're going to try and
use the Yukari no Tachikiri?
