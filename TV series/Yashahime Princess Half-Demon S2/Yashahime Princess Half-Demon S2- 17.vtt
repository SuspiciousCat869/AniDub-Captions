MEI: Grandpa, I'm home!

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:16.617

- Ah, Mei!

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:19.720
Welcome back. [laughs]

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.822
- She missed you.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.123
- [sirens passing]
- Oh, dear me.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.025
It sounds like there's
been more trouble.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.261
- That's happened a lot lately.

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:28.428
- Hmm.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:29.429
- Grandpa?

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:30.864
GRANDPA: Hmm.

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:32.399
- What is it? What's wrong?

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:33.800
[sirens passing]

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.202
Oh, not again.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.037
- [gasps] Grammy, I forgot

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.872
I promised
to meet up with Itsumi!

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:40.107
[gasps] I've gotta be going!

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.609
- The world
is going topsy-turvy,

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:43.911
so you be careful!

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:45.746
- Don't worry! I will!

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:49.183
- There are
some disturbing shadows

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.185
on the trunk
of the Sacred Tree.

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:54.421
That can't be anything
but an ominous sign.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.390
- Kagome and Towa,

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.026
do you think
they're all right over there?

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.694
- I don't know.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.530
I just don't know.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:04.965
But I get the feeling

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.602
that something even worse
might be approaching.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.071
[ominous music playing]

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.441
KIRIN: The Grim Comet
is clearly visible to me now.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:17.911
And yet, despite being
a foreign entity in this world,

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:20.013

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:21.915

- Eh?

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:22.983
- Hup!

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.052
See you later, Mr. Kirin!

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.287
- Well, hello and goodbye, then.

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:28.522
- Bye-bye!

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:29.523
[panting]

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.491
<i>- So young and innocent.</i>

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:34.228
I can't bear the thought of
so many young lives like hers

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:38.532
being snuffed out in an instant
<i>by the Grim Comet.</i>

JAKEN: His Haku
is draining away.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.009
At this rate,
he cannot last much longer.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.744
- Help me, Kyuyokon!

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.846
Draw the demon energy out!

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.082
- Towa, stop now,

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:36.984
or else you will die.

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:38.218

Towa?

There's something wrong!
Towa! Towa!

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:09.983
Oh, wait!

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:12.986
No! Her Kon has been drained!

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.055
- Her Kon?
- That inner power

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.925
that allows your heart to beat
and your mind to function.

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.494
Your Kon,
otherwise known as your soul.

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:23.030
SETSUNA: And what happens
when your Kon is all gone?

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:24.965
- [Rin gasps]
- Well, in short,

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.734
it means that your mind is dead.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.369
[Rin gasps] Towa!

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:33.440
No! That--That isn't possible!

- Wait, aren't you...

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:44.718
JAKEN: The sound of a pinwheel.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.453
Akuru is here!

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:47.287
SETSUNA: Akuru?

00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:50.090
- He's a Time Spirit
who's visible

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.526
only to members
of the Dog-Demon Clan.

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.896

I'm fine, Setsuna.

- [all gasp]
- Hmm?

00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:48.182
- It would appear that Akuru
has acknowledged the two of you.

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:51.785
- The Spirit
of the Tree of Ages.

Sesshomaru's okay.

- Ah, he's fine.
- Hmm?

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:10.003
- How can you be so sure?

00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:12.306

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:17.311
INUYASHA: He probably hid
inside the Tree of Ages.

we're sitting on.

00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:28.188

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:34.995
- Hmm?

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:37.397

00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:39.199
for Inuyasha and me.

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.000

- Here. Take it.

00:06:53.447 --> 00:06:54.781
- Hmm?

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.450
Uh...

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:57.384
where's this from?

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:01.088
- Your father and I
made this for you.

00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:06.693
That time
we caught a glimpse of you,

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.695
we saw you could use a new one.

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.097
- What time was that?

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.500
- Remember? The time you went
zipping right over our heads?

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:14.468
- Oh!

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:17.037
<i>It's my Mom and Dad!</i>

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:20.541
So then that wasn't
just an illusion.

00:07:20.574 --> 00:07:21.942
It was really you.

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:24.044
- It's made out of...

00:07:24.077 --> 00:07:25.445
- Ow! [grumbles]
- Hmm?

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.048
- ...your father's hair
and other special things,

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:30.284
things we gathered
from your grandpa's grave.

00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:32.052
- You could have
just told her that!

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:34.154

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.457
[sighs]

00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:41.662
- That old bow of yours,
it's too small for you.

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:44.064
- [laughs]

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:45.966
- We thought
you should have a bow

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:47.367
that will protect you well.

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:49.036

[water flowing]

00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:53.440

will soon come crashing to Earth

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.842
in the Reiwa era.

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:57.578
It is your duty to destroy it

00:07:57.611 --> 00:07:59.680
and remove the foreign entity

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:02.049
who does not belong
in that place.

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:03.217
- And who is that?

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.452
- I think
she must mean Mr. Kirin.

SPIRIT: There is
not a moment to lose.

00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:12.092
You must hurry
to the Windmill of Time.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.928
- As always,
you enjoy bossing us around.

00:08:14.962 --> 00:08:16.663
It's so annoying.

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.832
- The fate of this world

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:21.635
lies in your hands,
Half-Demon Princesses.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.037
I'm counting on you.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.444
[both grunt]

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:32.579

00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:33.547
[both gasp]

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:36.416
- I am...

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.254
so grateful you were able
to survive, both of you.

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:44.725
But it breaks my heart
you had to do it without me,

00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:46.960
that I wasn't there for you.

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:48.695
- No, Mother.
- Mother!

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:50.163
- You're not to blame.

00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:52.866
- I want to...

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.336
take you both into my arms,

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.105
but I know...

00:08:58.138 --> 00:08:59.840
we haven't the time for that.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.608
[both gasp]

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:07.848
I never understood
why Lord Sesshomaru

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:11.151
took you away
so soon after you were born.

00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:13.654
Now I do. I understand.

00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:15.422
[both grunt]

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:16.356
[both gasp]

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:28.235
- You two are the daughters
of Lord Sesshomaru!

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:31.138
And there is something
you must do now,

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:33.440
something that only you can do.

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:35.008
[both grunt]

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.243
- Yes, we know.

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:39.313
Go to the other world
and destroy the Grim Comet.

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:42.649
- But, Towa, how are we
supposed to travel through time?

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:43.951
- The Windmill of Time

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:46.353
is located in front
of Her Ladyship's manor.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:49.122
It's possible she might be
able to tell us something.

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:50.324
- Her Ladyship, who?

00:09:50.357 --> 00:09:52.759
- I'm referring
to Lord Sesshomaru's mother.

00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:54.995
Come! There's no time to waste!

00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:56.363
BOTH: Understood.

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.968
- We must go, Mother.

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:02.769
Goodbye for now.

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:04.171
- RIN: Towa!
- Yes?

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:06.139
- Setsuna!
What is it?

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:08.809
See that...

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:10.644
both of you come back alive.

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:11.712
BOTH: Right!

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:13.747
- And when you do,

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.251
you'll let
your father and I hold you

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:19.553
for as long as you two
will let us.

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:21.355
Will you both promise me that?

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:24.658
BOTH: We promise!

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:27.060
[Jaken grunts] This way! Hurry!

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:29.429
- All right, then.

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:31.164
BOTH: We'll be going.

00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:41.041
- [crying]

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.351
- Lord Sesshomaru.

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:54.488
This was...

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:56.356
all for the best, right?

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:01.662
[birds squawking]

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:02.863
- Hmm?

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:03.864
[all gasp]

00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:05.365
TAKECHIYO AND SHIPPO:
He's back!

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:07.467
[equipment rattles]

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:10.237
- Curse you, Sesshomaru.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.540
Where are you, you coward?!

00:11:13.574 --> 00:11:15.475
- Hah! He's a little busy,

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:17.144
so I'm filling in for him.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.745
You guys stand back.

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:20.514
- I'm fine here.

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:22.249
Moroha, go and hide.

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:23.183
- I'm sorry.

00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:24.484
- I can't.
- [nails clicking]

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:27.254
You really think I survived
this long by running away?

00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:29.656
There's no way I'm leaving.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.558
- Now that's
what I like to hear!

00:11:31.592 --> 00:11:34.328
Just don't come crying to us
if you skin a knee or something.

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:35.162
[grunts]

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.164
KAGOME:
Don't push yourself too hard!

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.967
- MOROHA: I won't!

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.201
[growls]

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:43.737
I don't have time to be
playing around with you!

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.405
- Who's playing around?!

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:47.474
Wind Scar! [grunts]

00:11:49.176 --> 00:11:52.546
- You have the audacity
to interfere?!

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:53.747
- Take flight!

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.649
Sacred Arrow!

00:11:55.682 --> 00:11:56.783
- Try this!

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:59.620
Adamant Barrage!

00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:00.554
- [grunts]

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:06.960
I've had enough
of the Dog-Demon's descendants

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:08.462
getting in my way.

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:14.134
You're all fair game now,
even your women and children.

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:17.337
I will put an end
to your entire line.

00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:20.774
I will bring death down
upon your clan

00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:23.043
and every one of its followers!
Huh?

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.344
[stirring music playing]

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:32.219
- Oh, yeah?!

00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:37.124
- Eh?

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:45.098
I... had to dodge that...

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:47.267
the attack of a little child?!

00:13:00.914 --> 00:13:03.016
[stirring music playing]

00:13:05.052 --> 00:13:07.287
- I am done toying with you!

00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:09.990
- Yeah, I was just
about to say the same thing!

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:13.794
This demon energy of yours
is just what I needed!

00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:15.495
Backlash Wave!

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.501
- Damn you to hell!

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:22.002
- What is with this guy?

00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:24.938
He can even cancel out
a Backlash Wave?

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:27.875
- Yeah, Kirinmaru
is ridiculously strong!

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:31.278
BOTH: Now try this!
Sacred Arrow!

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.580
- Wind Scar!

00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:39.953
- Enough of your insolence.

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:42.489
This ends now!

00:13:42.523 --> 00:13:44.191
- [gasps]
- [grunts]

00:13:51.198 --> 00:13:52.866
Tessaiga's scabbard...

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.601
it really saved our necks.

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:57.404
- [panting]

00:13:57.437 --> 00:14:00.040
- That was
way too close for comfort.

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:03.010
- That was scary.
So much demon power.

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:05.045
- Hey, Moroha!

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:06.613
- Towa! Setsuna!

00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:08.282
- We're heading out!

00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:10.017
We've gotta go
to the other world

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.152
and destroy the Grim Comet
before it's too late!

00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:13.220
- What did you say?

00:14:13.253 --> 00:14:15.389
- Okay. You be careful.

00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:16.323
Eh?

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:20.194
Oh, so it's you again.

00:14:20.227 --> 00:14:22.729
Your name is Akuru, right?

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:25.232
Eh?

00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:27.034
[stammers]

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:29.036
What's the big idea?

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:31.405
- Akuru's saying
he wants you to go with them.

00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:32.406
- What?

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:33.407
- Get going.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.309
- Yeah, but...

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:38.612
- They're your friends,
aren't they?

00:14:38.645 --> 00:14:40.514
- Mm-hmm.

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:42.015
Yeah.

00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:43.083
- This way, girls!

00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:45.586
- Towa, Setsuna, let's go!

00:14:45.619 --> 00:14:46.620
BOTH: Okay!

00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:48.255
- You're not going anywhere!

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:49.189
Eh?

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:55.329
- Long as I'm alive, you're not
laying a finger on my daughter.

- [growls]

00:14:57.364 --> 00:14:59.099

- Hey, guys,
I can carry you all there!

- Takechiyo!

00:15:03.136 --> 00:15:05.172
JAKEN: Hello? Remember me?!

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:07.708
Were you just going
to leave me behind?!

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.510
[birds warbling]

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:11.645
[Rion panting]

00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:18.785
I wonder how Lady Towa
and the others are doing.

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:20.020
- I wonder that myself.

00:15:20.053 --> 00:15:22.422
The very fact
that I'm still alive and well

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:26.260
means that Lord Kirinmaru
hasn't been defeated yet.

00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:28.996
- Yes. Yes, you're right.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:30.831
- [sighs]
- [rod clatters]

- [murmurs]

00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:37.538
- Miss Rion! What's wrong?!

00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:38.705
What's happened to you?

00:15:38.739 --> 00:15:40.607
Talk to me, Miss Rion!

00:15:41.975 --> 00:15:44.244
- It's this body.

00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:46.747
I can't seem to make it
move anymore.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.448
- What do you mean?

00:15:48.482 --> 00:15:50.350
- [yells]

00:15:51.985 --> 00:15:53.587

[gasps] Rion!

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:58.792
- [scoffs] Not a good time
to let yourself get distracted.

00:15:58.825 --> 00:15:59.826
- You're right.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.762
It's not the time
to be distracted!

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:02.863
- [groans]

00:16:02.896 --> 00:16:04.298
[grumbles]

00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:05.365
- Fly true!

00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:10.571
I missed him?

00:16:10.604 --> 00:16:12.272
- Where the hell did he go?

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.741
[droplet echoes]

00:16:14.775 --> 00:16:16.944
<i>- Just as I thought.</i>

[insects chirping]

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:27.020
- You've nearly finished
the thousand-day training.

00:16:27.054 --> 00:16:28.822
You're almost ready to face him.

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:30.157
- Indeed.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.226
In fact, this battle
that is to come

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:34.928
will be the final step
in my training.

00:16:34.962 --> 00:16:37.464
[wind blowing]

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:40.634
[rings jangle]

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.769
- Then let's go, Miroku.

00:16:42.803 --> 00:16:44.438
- Let's do this.

00:16:45.906 --> 00:16:48.942
By the way,
have the kids been doing well?

00:16:48.976 --> 00:16:50.377
[slap echoes]

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.645
[chuckles]

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.347
Well, it seems they are.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.282
[insects chirping]

00:16:56.717 --> 00:16:58.151
DANJO: Demon slayers...

00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:01.154
we've heard
a rather disturbing rumor.

00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:02.856
A demon named Kirinmaru

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.392
is trying to bring about
the Degenerate Age.

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:06.360
Is this true?

00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:09.930
- Yes, and he's too powerful
for us to handle.

00:17:09.963 --> 00:17:11.798
Therefore, I urge you

00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:14.134
to get far away from here,
Your Excellency,

00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:15.536
you and the Princess.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.406
- So you're saying
even you cannot stop him?

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.507
Hmm.

00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:21.542
- I'm not worried.

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:22.342
- Hmm?

00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:24.077
- Don't forget
the demon slayers

00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:26.747
have Hisui
and Setsuna with them.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.415
So if you all work together,

00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.851
I'm sure everything
will be just fine!

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.052
Right?

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:33.654
Am I right, or am I right?

00:17:33.687 --> 00:17:34.955
I'm right, right?

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:36.056
- [stammers]

00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:38.959
Princess, you--
you can't be serious.

00:17:38.992 --> 00:17:41.161
- This is the Kikujumonji,

00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:43.730
a great blade
that can purge evil spirits.

00:17:43.764 --> 00:17:45.966
I was given it by the shogun,

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:48.135
and now I am
bestowing it on you.

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:51.438
Take it, then, and do
your best to defeat the demon.

00:17:51.471 --> 00:17:54.474
- Your Excellency,
we can't defeat him.

00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:55.275
That's what--

00:17:55.309 --> 00:17:57.211
- Sir, you should
accept that sword.

00:17:57.244 --> 00:17:58.145
- Hmm?

00:17:59.046 --> 00:18:00.414
- According to Setsuna,

00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:04.084
Towa has some sort of powerful
connection to that sword.

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:07.487
It might come in handy
against Kirinmaru.

00:18:07.521 --> 00:18:08.956
- You may be right.

00:18:08.989 --> 00:18:11.158
- What do you say,
demon slayers?

00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:14.361
- Thank you.
We gratefully accept your offer.

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:17.931
- Very good.
Then we shall depend on you.

00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:19.666
DEMON SLAYERS: Yes, sir!

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.568
RIKU: Miss Rion, please!

00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:23.136
Wake up!

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.006
I wish I had some idea
what was going on!

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.941
Open your eyes, Miss Rion!

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:30.244
- KIRINMARU: I thought as much.
- [gasps]

00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:34.348
I suspected
that her artificial body

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:37.150
would be reaching its limit
right about now.

00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:41.221
- Lord Kirinmaru.
- [sword scrapes]

00:18:41.255 --> 00:18:42.389
- Rion...

00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:44.858
remember, there is no one
who has cherished you

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:49.029
more than I have,
for I am your father.

00:18:49.062 --> 00:18:50.531
[mysterious music playing]

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.002
- [gasps]

00:18:55.035 --> 00:18:58.071
- Her Kon is sealed
within that vessel

00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:00.407
made out of bones
and grave soil,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.142
but as time passes,

00:19:02.176 --> 00:19:05.479
she runs out of the Haku
needed to move that vessel.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.351
- [gasps]

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:13.420
I am not thanking you for this.

I never expected that you would.

00:19:16.757 --> 00:19:20.060
But I thought
we might chat for a bit.

00:19:20.093 --> 00:19:23.297
- We respectfully decline,
Lord Kirinmaru.

00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:26.700
- I thought
you might want to know

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:30.704
I'm thinking of paying a visit
to the other world soon.

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:33.707

come with me?

I warned you guys
you were pushing me too far.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.333
- Oh, it's been far too long.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:00.334

You two are alive?

hasn't it Granny?

00:20:16.817 --> 00:20:19.319
I'm sorry
I was away for so long.

00:20:19.353 --> 00:20:22.422
Goodness, there's no need
to worry about that now.

00:20:22.456 --> 00:20:24.725
- Well, in any case...

00:20:24.758 --> 00:20:26.527
you need to get everyone out.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.129

the whole village right now.

00:20:29.162 --> 00:20:32.666
- But why? Don't tell me
there's another war starting.

00:20:32.699 --> 00:20:34.101
- Mm-mmm.

00:20:35.002 --> 00:20:36.503
It's not a war.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.973

it's something even worse.

Those crows sound strange,
don't they?

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.114

Look!
They all just disappeared!

00:21:39.666 --> 00:21:41.602
