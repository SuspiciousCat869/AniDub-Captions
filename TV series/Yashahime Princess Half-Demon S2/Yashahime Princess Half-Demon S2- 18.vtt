WEBVTT

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.443
- You know what it is
the two of you must do now.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:13.113
- We will go, then,
and destroy the Grim Comet.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.715
RIN: Promise me...

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:17.384
that you'll come back alive.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.586
This was...

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.155
all for the best, right?

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:26.026
[Japanese music playing]

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.048
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.062
TOWA: <i>"The Collapse</i>
<i>of the Windmill of Time."</i>

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.065
[peaceful music playing]

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.706
- Hmm?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.375
- Good evening, Your Ladyship!

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:22.242
How are you?

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:25.312
What a pleasure it is
to see you again.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.313
Uh...

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.115
- [grunts]

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.951
- Uh, yes, well, anyway,

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:34.121
allow me to present Lord
Sesshomaru's twin daughters,

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.657
Towa and Setsuna.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.525
Oh, and... [clears throat]

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.994
[muffled]
Inuyasha's daughter, Moroha.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:43.664
- Huh?

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.634
- A pleasure, Your Ladyship.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:51.738
Or I suppose I should
call you Grandma, right?

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:52.773
[nervous laugh]

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:54.341
- We don't have time
for this, Towa!

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.610
- Okay. Sorry.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.111
I was just, you know...

00:02:58.145 --> 00:02:59.513
- You've come to try and travel

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.615
through the Windmill of Time,
haven't you?

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.050
- [gasps]

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.484
Yes! That's right!

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.120
- Hmm.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:16.029
I see that Akuru has already
chosen you, apparently.

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:17.464
Go to the Windmill of Time,

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.766
and the Doors of Time
will open for you.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.968
[all gasp]

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.069
- Well, all right, then.

00:03:22.102 --> 00:03:23.437
- Let's go!
- BOTH: Right!

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.806
- That said, however...
- ALL: Eh?

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.275
- there have been
many before you

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:31.111
who have come seeking
to travel through time,

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.279
but one after another,

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.515
the unchosen
have met the same fate.

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:37.217
They're sucked into space-time,
and they perish there.

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:41.755
- Yeah, but we've been chosen,
so we're good, aren't we?

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.423
That's how it works, isn't it?

00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:44.758
[amulet clinks]

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.059
- Though they may have perished,

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:49.062
their resentment still
lingers on in the Underworld.

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:52.232
It's what prevents the Windmill
of Time from turning.

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:54.968
- But if the Windmill
won't turn...

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:58.438
- You see, before you
can travel through time,

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.608
you must first defeat
those who tried to and failed.

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:04.044
Meidomaru, we have visitors.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:06.713
[all gasp]

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:20.594
- It's been quite a while,
Your Ladyship.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:21.929
- We have some newcomers here

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:23.430
who wish to use
the Windmill of Time.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.899
[tense music playing]

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:26.934
- Really?

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.403
This lot has been
chosen by the ages?

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.206
[all grumble]

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:34.441
- [chuckles] How amusing.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.476
Also rather sad.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.711
- [gasps]
- Eh?

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:40.380
- There are worse ways
to pass the time

00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:41.982
than watching
this fellow at work.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.220
He always puts on a good show.

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.488
- Right when things
were looking good,

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.023
this weirdo shows up.

00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:53.260
- I suspected as much.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.163
Her artificial body
has reached its limit.

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.066
- [gasps]

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.968
I am not thanking you for this.

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:04.438
- I thought you'd like to know
that I'm thinking

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.341
of traveling through time
to the other world.

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:10.744
Rion, why don't you
come with me?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.547
- I happen to know

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.750
if you go to that other world,
Father, you'll bring about

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:18.452
the Degenerate Age
in this world,

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:22.923
and that
cannot be allowed to happen.

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:26.460
- If I don't go, however,
500 years from now,

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.329
the Grim Comet
will destroy humankind.

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:30.464
[Rion gasps]

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.735
- That's right.
I am the only one

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:37.538
who can save the world
of the future from extinction.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.240
- Why should I believe you?

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:41.441
- Riku...

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:43.777
it was long ago,
but I'm sure you remember

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.247
when you tossed my right arm
into the Bone Eater's Well?

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:48.615
- [gasps]

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:50.450
- [yells]

00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:53.120
[tense music playing]

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:56.323
RIKU: Just tell me where,
and I'll dispose of it at once.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:06:00.127
KIRINMARU: The Bone Eater's Well
is a pathway between this age

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.564
and the age
of 500 years in the future.

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:05.232
My discarded right arm

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:08.268
continued to gather demon power
at the bottom of the Well

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:12.105
and grew into human form
in the future world.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:17.010
The Grim Comet appears because
it is drawn to demon power.

00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:18.812
The comets from 500 years ago

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.048
and 14 years ago
were mere fragments.

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.518
500 years from now
will come the true Grim Comet,

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.221
its size beyond imagining.

00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:30.724
That right arm of mine
is calling to me,

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.793
pleading with me
to save that world,

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.795
to save the humans.

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:37.030
- It--It can't be!

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:40.434
- But it is,
and it's all your fault, Riku.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.902
- [gasps]

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:44.271
- So now you must choose.

00:06:44.304 --> 00:06:47.374
Will you stay in this world
and do nothing

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:51.411
or come with me and help
save the world of the future?

00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:53.647
- How could I...

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.716
ever make a choice like that?

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.619
- I want you
to come with me, Rion.

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:02.489
I will soon be procuring
a new physical form for you.

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:04.057
- A new physical form?

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:07.494
- The body
of someone dear to you,

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:08.629
your friend Towa.

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:09.863
[both gasp]

00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:12.966
- You see, I set a trap
on the Zanseiken

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.301
to be activated in the event

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:16.937
that anyone was ever
foolish enough to steal it.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.274
As Towa continues
to use the Zanseiken,

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:21.875
her Kon will be whittled away

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:24.244
until her body
becomes an empty husk.

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.780
But it won't be empty for long,

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:30.751
because what used to be her body
will now become yours, Rion.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.086
- [chuckles]

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.227
I've long held a grudge
against the chosen.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.664
The time has come
to settle the score!

00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:48.936
Hah!

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.738
- You mind explaining
what you've got against us?

00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:52.739
[gasps]

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:55.609
- [yells]

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:05.719
- [flute plays]
- Zanseiken!

00:08:05.752 --> 00:08:07.120
- Zanseiken?

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:08.922
- Towa,
you shouldn't be using it.

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:10.357
It's too dangerous!

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.358
- I'll be fine.

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:13.760
- But if you lose
your Kon again...

00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:16.630
- She won't need it
in the Underworld!

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:17.931
- Ever since you died,

00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:20.234
I've searched
for a new body for you,

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:23.403
one that would be worthy
of you, my daughter.

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:25.072
And none's more worthy

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:28.308
than the body of the person
you entrusted the Zanseiken to.

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:29.610
- No, I...

00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:32.779
I wouldn't have given it
to her if I had known.

00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:34.515
- That's too cruel,
even for you.

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:36.950
Sacrifice Lady Towa?

00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:38.118
[earring chimes]

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.120
Not while I'm here!

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:42.022
I won't allow it!

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:43.724
- You can't be serious.

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:46.059
- Even outmatched,
I will fight you!

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:49.796
For Lady Towa, I'd gladly
forfeit this artificial life.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.165
I never cared for it
in the first place!

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:54.768
[yells]

00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:55.769
- [scoffs]

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:56.937
- It's gone.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.372
It's gone, Father,

00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:00.440
the last shred of attachment
I felt for you!

00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:07.614
- Now, you don't
really mean that, Rion.

00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:10.450
- I will kill you myself.

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:13.153
Azusa no Yumihari!

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.157
- You don't know
how deep my love is for you!

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:20.861
I cannot bear to lose you, Rion!

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:24.565
- It's a terrible thing to lose
someone you love, I know.

00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:26.633
But you have it wrong.

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:28.435
You've already lost me, Father.

00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:30.137
[Riku grunts]

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:34.141
- [yells]
- [yells]

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:37.244
- Good.

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:39.446
Those are excellent blows.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:42.182
Why, then, didn't you fight
like this with the Zanseiken,

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.318
instead of allowing yourself
to be killed?

00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:46.320
- [gasps]

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:47.387
- Yaah!

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:48.789
[laughs]

00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:50.791
[both yell]

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:52.292
- [grunts]

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:52.993
- [yelps]

00:09:54.328 --> 00:09:57.464
- We never said
that we wanted to be chosen!

00:09:57.497 --> 00:10:00.734
- And that's
the most annoying part about it!

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.269
Yaah!

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:04.705
- Well, then, if you
won't listen to reason...

00:10:05.873 --> 00:10:07.007
[groans]

00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:10.143
- [laughs]

00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:14.948
- [groans]

00:10:14.982 --> 00:10:17.317
- You all right, Setsuna?!

00:10:17.351 --> 00:10:19.052
- Yaah!

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:23.957
- [grunts] What is this power?

00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:26.793
- It's the power of envy.

00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:29.363
- Have a taste!
- [energy roars]

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:30.497
- [yelps]

00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:37.804
- I will drag you both
to the Underworld!

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:39.840
And there,
you'll become a part of me,

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:42.409
so we'll get
to know each other well.

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:43.810
[laughs]

00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:47.814
- This fellow
never fails to amuse me.

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:49.950
<i>- The resentment</i>
<i>that drives him,</i>

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:52.920
maybe I can sever it
with the Yukari no Tachikiri.

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:54.154
- [chuckles]

00:10:54.188 --> 00:10:55.122
Eh?

00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:00.928
- [bowstring creaks]
- Enough of this!

00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:03.463
I think now is the time
to try out my mom's bow!

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.499
- Moroha, be careful!

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:06.567
Think before you attack!

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:09.236
- Where is his thread of fate?

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:12.940
- I've got to come up with
some kind of countermeasure.

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:15.008
- [laughs]

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:17.110
Well, now I've seen everything.

00:11:17.144 --> 00:11:19.780
A quarter demon
with spirit power.

00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:21.448
- [chuckles]
You have a good trip

00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:23.250
back to the Afterlife.

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:24.852
- Oh.

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.954
Why, thank you.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:28.555
But you go first!

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:30.090
- [gasps]
- Moroha!

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:33.894
- You really think you
can defeat me with that bow?!

00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:36.396
- Oh, but you see,
this isn't just any bow.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.031
My mom made it!

00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:39.399
Sacred Arrow!

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:45.472
- [gasps] What?

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:48.942
[groans]

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:50.711
Such power.

00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:51.945
How can this be?

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:53.447
- Threads of fate.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.449
- [gasps] Amazing.

00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:58.452
When did Moroha's arrows
get that kind of power?

00:11:58.485 --> 00:12:01.054
- [roars]

00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:02.723
- Shit! I'm all out of arrows!

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:04.258
- Do you know what it's like...

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:06.727
to have to linger
in the Underworld

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.063
until this grudge is settled?

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:11.465
Of course you don't!

00:12:11.498 --> 00:12:15.102
Let me give you a taste
of what it feels like.

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:17.371
- [gasps]

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:20.340
- Yaah!

00:12:20.374 --> 00:12:21.975
- [yells]

00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:24.978
- Towa!

00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:29.950
- Towa! Moroha!

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:32.653
I saw his threads
of fate just now,

00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:34.321
but there are so many of them.

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:35.455
- [chuckles]

00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:36.857
Of course there are.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.028
I carry in me the grudges and
grievances of countless demons.

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:42.563
[chuckles]

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:44.765
[tense music playing]

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.401
- [scoffs]

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:50.304
- [gasps]

00:12:50.337 --> 00:12:51.605
- Hah!

00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:01.648
- [winces]

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:07.721
Now that I've drawn this sword,
I will not hold back.

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.156
- That's just the way I want it!

00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:12.659
- [yells]
- [yells]

00:13:13.594 --> 00:13:15.429
- Prepare yourself, Father!

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:17.664
- [yells]

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:20.067
Damn it!

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:22.603
- [yells]

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:23.570
- Huh?

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:34.548
- It ends here, Father.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.599
- It ends here, Father.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.671
[shudders]

00:13:58.906 --> 00:13:59.940
KIRINMARU: Do it.

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:00.974
- [gasps]

00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.576
- Go on, then!

00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:03.977
Kill your father if you can!

00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:05.679
- [gasps]

00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:08.048
- Miss Rion.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.319
[Rion grunting]

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.421
- Lord Kirinmaru, let her go!

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:21.428
[gasps]

00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:24.431
- [gasps]

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:27.100
- [chuckles]

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:30.804
- Riku!

00:14:30.838 --> 00:14:32.673
[gasps] Riku!

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.508
Tell me you're all right!

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.344
Please! Riku!

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.112
[crying]

00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:42.115
- Come, Rion.

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:45.319
- No! Leave me alone!

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:46.553
[crying]

00:14:46.587 --> 00:14:47.921
- You should rest.

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:49.323
- [gasps]

00:14:49.356 --> 00:14:51.024
[murmurs]

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:55.929
[wind blowing]

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:57.731
MOROHA: I can't use
my Sacred Arrow.

00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:00.000
- We've gotta hit him hard...

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.902
to see his threads of fate.

00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:03.504
In which case...

00:15:03.537 --> 00:15:05.439
I'm gonna try this!

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:07.174
[tense music playing]

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:11.678
I'm going to absorb
his demon energy!

00:15:11.712 --> 00:15:12.980
That's the moment to strike!

00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:14.982
- You can't, Towa!

00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:17.484
She's going
to push herself too far again.

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:20.320
MEIDOMARU: You're going
to absorb my demon energy?

00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:23.323
Well, go ahead.
You're welcome to try!

00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:25.125
- [gasps]

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:27.694
Kyuyokon!

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.531
[energy crackles]

00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:32.699
- As I thought.

00:15:32.733 --> 00:15:35.102
It's the sword
of Amatsumikaboshi.

00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:38.605
But why does she have it?

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:39.640
[Meidomaru gasping]

00:15:39.673 --> 00:15:42.009
- Now, Setsuna! Finish it!

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:44.912
- [grunts]

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.046
[gasps]

00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:56.156
[blade pulses]

00:15:57.558 --> 00:16:01.428
Yukari no Tachikiri!

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:07.501
- [gasps]

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:10.971
[shuddering]

00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:17.010
- [panting]

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:22.749
- Well,
are you satisfied, Meidomaru?

00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:23.817
- All this time,

00:16:23.851 --> 00:16:27.921
I resented not being chosen
by the ages,

00:16:27.955 --> 00:16:30.657
but I wasn't worthy
of being chosen.

00:16:31.925 --> 00:16:33.660
I can see that now.

00:16:34.862 --> 00:16:36.763
- Very good.

00:16:36.797 --> 00:16:39.066
- Farewell.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.844
- Towa, are you all right?

00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:53.647
- I'm fine.
Just a little tired, that's all.

00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:55.782
- You sure about that?

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:57.985
- Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.686
- I wonder.
- Eh?

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.989
- Absorbing his demon energy

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:04.625
appears to have whittled away
at your Kon.

00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:07.294
It seems
the Zanseiken is cursed.

00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:08.295
- Cursed?

00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:10.197
- Her Kon? What the heck's that?

00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:14.501
- If Your Ladyship
will allow me,

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:15.969
I'll be glad to explain.

00:17:16.003 --> 00:17:20.607
All humans and demons,
beasts, and half-demons

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:22.543
have a Haku and a Kon.

00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:25.846
The source of power
to move one's body is the Haku,

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.749
and the power
to move one's heart is the Kon.

00:17:28.782 --> 00:17:32.986
Together, they are referred to
as one's spirit or soul.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.288
- I see.

00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:36.390
- But what about this curse?

00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:40.594
- Child, you would be wise
to discard that sword.

00:17:40.627 --> 00:17:41.528
- Huh?

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.298
- If you don't,

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:47.968
the sword's owner will
eventually take over your body.

00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:49.603
- Its owner?

00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:50.604
- But that's Rion!

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:52.139
- [gasps]
- No way!

00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:54.942
- Even if you
have lost all your Kon,

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:57.244
as long as your body
still retains its Haku,

00:17:57.277 --> 00:18:00.047
it can be used
as a vessel by another soul.

00:18:01.315 --> 00:18:02.015
- [gasps]

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.588
[pinwheel clicking]

00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:09.456
- Do you suppose it's possible?

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:11.825
Could Rion
have been deceiving us all?

00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:14.995
- No, I can't believe she would
ever do something like that.

00:18:15.028 --> 00:18:18.165
After all, the whole reason
she gave me this

00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:19.800
was to help us
defeat her father.

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:23.971
Which means, if there's a curse,
she doesn't know about it.

00:18:24.004 --> 00:18:25.806
- Towa...

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:27.608
you can't rule out
the possibility

00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:29.610
that she does know about it.

00:18:29.643 --> 00:18:31.945
- I get it. You trust her.

00:18:31.979 --> 00:18:33.514
But what if you're wrong?

00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:36.416
TOWA: Even if it is cursed...

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.120
I'm still going to try
and master the Zanseiken!

00:18:42.256 --> 00:18:45.025
- Well, do whatever you want.

00:18:48.862 --> 00:18:50.797
[pinwheel clicking]

00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:51.698
- [gasps]

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:56.603
You want me to have this?

- Is the...

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.418
Degenerate Age beginning?

00:19:17.057 --> 00:19:20.994
- Since there's nothing left
for you to do here, go on.

00:19:21.028 --> 00:19:21.995
BOTH: Yes, ma'am.

00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:23.130

00:19:30.204 --> 00:19:31.405
[gasps]

00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:37.311
- Right!
Ready, Setsuna, Moroha?

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:40.080
Let's go
to the Windmill of Time!

00:19:41.949 --> 00:19:43.917
[wind rushing]

[Kirinmaru grumbles]

00:19:44.918 --> 00:19:47.888
I must beat
the half-demon twins,

00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:50.991
or Rion's new body
and all of my dreams

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.326
will turn into nothing!

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:56.029
And I refuse
to give them up now!

00:19:59.266 --> 00:20:01.902
- Now you take care
of yourselves, okay?

00:20:01.935 --> 00:20:03.036
MOROHA: We will.

00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:08.976
[Jaken gasps]

00:20:09.009 --> 00:20:11.678
The Doors of Time have opened!

- The Degenerate Age has begun,

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:26.660
but perhaps they still have
a chance to change things.

00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:28.829
At least make it amusing,

00:20:28.862 --> 00:20:32.266
won't you,
Half-Demon Princesses?

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:36.737
What our ultimate fate will be,
who can say?

00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:39.373

- Here we go...

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:47.114
to the Reiwa era!

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.288

It is my destiny alone...
