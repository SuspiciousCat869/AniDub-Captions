00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:10.427
- Now then, Rion,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.466
let's embark on our journey
to purify the world.

INUYASHA: It's on the move.

KAGOME: I wonder
what it's trying to do.

00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:37.582
- We shall rid the world
of all unworthy demons.

[Takechiyo shudders]

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:54.015
- It's absorbing the demons.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.119
- What incredible power.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:58.156
- Mr. Kirin meant what he said.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.429
He's going to eliminate
every demon in this world.

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:07.642
- Oh, no!
It's headed for Mamiana Island!

00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:10.815
We can't let that thing
get to my family!

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:14.956
- In that case, I'll give it
a taste of Meido Zangetsuha.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.459
- RIKU: No! Wait!
- Huh?

00:03:16.492 --> 00:03:19.666
- Miss Rion is being held
a prisoner inside that thing.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.335
- Well, I can't worry
about her now!

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:22.639
- Dad!
- [both] Huh?

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:26.045
- Riku's right! We promised
that we would save Rion!

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.481
- [grumbles]

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:29.318
Why'd you have to go
and do that?

00:03:31.957 --> 00:03:33.594

- Oh, thank heavens!

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.363
Lady Kagome and Inuyasha,
they're alive!

00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:28.369
- If we don't stop it soon,
things are gonna get real ugly!

00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:30.307
- Takechiyo,
get us closer to it.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.311
- Okay, but what's the plan?

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:34.683
- We're going
inside of that thing!

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:36.820
- And we're
going to save Rion!

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:38.389
- You'll be all right?

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.828
- I will assist them.

[mysterious music playing]

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:53.521
Miss Rion!

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:55.958
I have brought Lady Towa
and the others.

00:04:55.992 --> 00:04:58.296
Please, allow us to enter!

00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:04.041
- Well, what do you know?
She's being reasonable.

00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:05.277
- 'Course she is.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.349
Miss Rion wants us to save her.
I'm certain of it.

00:05:08.383 --> 00:05:10.353
- All right, let's go!

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:11.355
- Right!
- Right!

[all grunting]

00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:15.598

[energy chittering]

00:05:21.475 --> 00:05:23.814

Shippo, quick!

[Takechiyo yelps]

00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:28.624
- We can't leave something
like that on the loose!

00:05:28.657 --> 00:05:30.795
We gotta stop
that damn butterfly!

00:05:30.828 --> 00:05:31.797
- Yeah, but how?

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.268
- We'll need Buddhist power
to suppress it.

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.005
That, along with
your spirit power,

00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:37.174
ought to do the trick!

00:05:37.207 --> 00:05:38.176
- All right.

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:39.411
- Hey, Takechiyo!

00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:42.384
Let the demon slayers know
we're gonna need backup,

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:43.554
and get Miroku!

00:05:43.587 --> 00:05:45.090
- Don't worry! I'm on it!

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:48.597
Hey!

00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:49.633
- [cheering]
- That's...

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:51.803
- It's Master Takechiyo!
- [chatter]

00:05:51.837 --> 00:05:53.741
- Master Takechiyo!

00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:54.976
- [grunts]

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.178
Brother!

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:58.483
- Quickly, go and get
everybody underground!

00:05:58.517 --> 00:06:00.320
- Are you coming?
- No way!

00:06:00.353 --> 00:06:02.324
Somebody's gotta
stay up here and fight 'em!

00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:04.128
- Want me to join you?

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.230
- I could use the help.

00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:06.767
Kikunosuke, it's up to you

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.804
to make sure
to keep our people safe.

00:06:08.837 --> 00:06:10.808
- Count on me!

00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:11.944
- Come on, Hachi!

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:13.814
- Yes, sir!

00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:15.217
- Good luck, Brother!

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.822
You be careful, okay?!

00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:19.759
[footsteps shuffling]

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:24.636
- Riku, what did
you mean earlier

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.007
when you said
Rion wants us to save her?

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.815
The fact that she wasn't
able to kill her father

00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:32.251
might mean that...

00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:33.687
- [sighs]

00:06:33.721 --> 00:06:37.194
KIRIN: You dare to enter this
sacred place without permission?

00:06:37.227 --> 00:06:39.633
How very presumptuous of you.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.970
[ominous music playing]

00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:45.076
- It was Miss Rion
who granted us permission,

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.016
and I'm convinced it's
because she wants to be saved!

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:49.619
- Rion did that?

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:53.126
Well, no matter. I suppose
she was feeling lonely.

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.032
"Uneasy lies the head that
wears the crown," and all that.

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:58.871
- Mr. Kirin! I don't understand!

00:06:58.904 --> 00:06:59.839
What are you doing?!

00:06:59.873 --> 00:07:02.578
- Come clean!
You tricked us, didn't you?!

00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:06.553
- No. This is the world
that Rion always wished for,

00:07:06.586 --> 00:07:09.659
a peaceful world
without strife,

00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:13.600
an ideal world that even I
could scarcely have imagined.

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:16.640
- Rion couldn't have wished
for this kind of world!

00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:18.142
- You're so full of crap!

00:07:19.244 --> 00:07:20.447
- Miss Towa...

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.719
I thought you at least
would be able to understand,

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:25.023
but it seems
I overestimated you.

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:26.158
How disappointing.

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:27.427
- What?!

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:30.735
KIRIN: It goes without saying
that demons are fools,

00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:33.373
but humans are just
as foolish, aren't they?

00:07:33.406 --> 00:07:34.509
No matter how much

00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:36.412
their so-called
civilization flourishes,

00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:39.018
they remain constantly
at war with each other.

00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:42.424
And now, in the Reiwa era,
humans have the power

00:07:42.457 --> 00:07:46.232
to annihilate
themselves completely.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:49.906
- [sighs]
But even if that's true...

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:51.375
- You know it's true.

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:52.745
Humans will always need someone

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:54.348
to master them
and to control them.

00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:57.020
- There's no way
that's what Rion wishes for!

00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:58.423
- Oh, Miss Towa...

00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:00.393
do you know how many wars

00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:03.433
have been waged
by humans in this world?

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:05.203
You've learned
about some of them

00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:06.940
in history class, haven't you?!

00:08:06.973 --> 00:08:09.378
It would appear that I'm
going to have to give you

00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:11.349
some special tutoring!

00:08:11.382 --> 00:08:12.785
- I'll handle this.

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:15.524
Setsuna and Moroha, find Rion.

00:08:15.558 --> 00:08:16.960
- Are you going to be all right?

00:08:16.993 --> 00:08:20.400
- Go ahead. Miss Rion
needs to be found quickly!

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.772
I will stay
and protect Lady Towa.

00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:24.441
- I'll be right behind you!

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:25.511
- You better!

00:08:25.544 --> 00:08:26.713
- All right, then!

00:08:26.747 --> 00:08:29.919
- You won't be going anywhere,
none of you!

00:08:29.953 --> 00:08:32.124
- [yells]

00:08:35.263 --> 00:08:36.298
- Now's your chance!

00:08:36.332 --> 00:08:37.502
- Right!
- Right!

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.409
- [Towa groans]
- Stop!

00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:42.578
Where do you think
you're going?!

00:08:42.612 --> 00:08:44.081
[earring chimes]

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.162
[chuckles]

00:08:51.195 --> 00:08:52.765
[sighs] Fine.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:55.336
Since we seem to have
this time together,

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.942
one thing I've
never understood is why Rion

00:08:57.975 --> 00:09:01.550
bestowed the Zanseiken
on a half-demon like you.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.785
After all, was it not

00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:05.457
a despicable half-demon
that killed her?

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.626
- She said...

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.166
she wanted me to use it
to defeat Kirinmaru.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.970
- [thinking] <i>It's true.</i>

00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:16.513
<i>Miss Rion was killed</i>
<i>by the half-demon Sakasa.</i>

00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:19.151
<i>And yet, in spite of that,</i>

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:22.424
<i>she has never once</i>
<i>spoken ill of him.</i>

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:23.627
That's it!

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.865
Lady Towa, I believe
that Miss Rion actually--

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:26.867
RION: Silence!

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.835
- [gasps]

00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:29.004
- Riku!

00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:30.941
- [screams]

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:35.383
- Now that we're free
from any further interruptions,

00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:37.454
shall we begin
your private tutoring?

00:09:37.487 --> 00:09:39.458
- [sighs]

00:09:39.491 --> 00:09:41.596
[wind blowing]

00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:55.991
- You've no idea how long
I've waited for this moment.

00:09:56.927 --> 00:09:58.296
- How pitiful.

00:09:58.329 --> 00:09:59.799
- What?!

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:02.538
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.274
- I'm speaking of you.

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:05.477
- [growls]

00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:06.580
Go to hell!

00:10:08.182 --> 00:10:09.686
[dramatic music playing]

00:10:14.194 --> 00:10:16.633
[yells]

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.939
Blasting Barrage!

00:10:21.108 --> 00:10:22.377
- Bakusaiga!

00:10:24.414 --> 00:10:25.518
- [grumbles]

00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:30.861

[yelling]

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.121
- Good heavens. What a battle.

00:10:45.456 --> 00:10:47.060
- [sighs]

00:10:47.093 --> 00:10:48.229
[both panting]

00:10:48.262 --> 00:10:49.131
[both gasp]

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.642
- Rion! What the hell
are you doing up there?!

00:10:54.676 --> 00:10:57.447
- Is this really
the world that you wished for?

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.617
[energy surges]

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.153
- You shouldn't have come here!

00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:03.694
What's up with
all these threads?

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:05.163
They're moving toward us!

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.969
- [yells]

00:11:08.002 --> 00:11:08.971
[yelps]

00:11:09.004 --> 00:11:10.541
- [shudders]

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:13.914
[gasping]

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:16.786
'Kay, this is bad.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.626
[demons growling]

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:22.230
- Hurry! Everyone
get to the shrine!

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:23.232
[gasps]

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.236
[demons growl]

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.007
- [yells]

00:11:28.577 --> 00:11:31.015
Disperse, demons!

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:34.254
[demons growl]

00:11:34.288 --> 00:11:35.256
- [growls]

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.960
- Take that!

00:11:36.993 --> 00:11:39.164
- No going off on your own!

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:41.468
We pick a spot
and fight together!

00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:42.638
- Take this! And this!

00:11:42.672 --> 00:11:44.141
- And that! And that!

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.084
BOTH: Bull's-eye!

00:11:49.117 --> 00:11:50.119
- Your turn, Hisui!

00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:51.756
- Go on! Go get 'em!

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.794
- Hiraikotsu!

00:11:57.602 --> 00:11:58.971
Not good.

00:11:59.004 --> 00:12:00.340
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:04.281
- Black Hiraikotsu!

00:12:08.724 --> 00:12:10.728
[demons growling]

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.299
- Nicely done, Mother!

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:15.804
- Looks like Hisui
still has a ways to go.

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:18.075
- I'm sorry about that, Mother.

00:12:18.109 --> 00:12:20.179
- Don't be. You've made me proud

00:12:20.213 --> 00:12:22.183
of how far you've
already come, Hisui.

00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:23.185
[both grumble]

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:24.989
- [chuckles]

00:12:25.023 --> 00:12:28.229
- The swarm of demons has
been thinned out quite a bit.

00:12:28.262 --> 00:12:29.364
TAKECHIYO: Hey!

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:31.536
- Huh?
- Over here, Miroku!

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:33.205
- This way!

00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:35.711
- Takechiyo! Hachiemon!

00:12:35.744 --> 00:12:37.848
[blades clashing]

00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:42.023
- See all of these books?

00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:44.428
I've accumulated
this vast library

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:46.833
on all on human history.

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:49.438
Miss Towa,
this might surprise you,

00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:50.641
but believe it or not,

00:12:50.674 --> 00:12:53.346
I actually wanted
to become a history teacher.

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:54.247
- [gasps]

00:12:57.922 --> 00:13:01.997
and seen all sorts
of different civilizations.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.836
Then I was flung
into the Reiwa era

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:07.708
and found its history books
full of lies and deceit.

00:13:07.742 --> 00:13:10.246
All throughout history,
demons have intervened

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:13.185
to save the lives
of humans countless times,

00:13:13.219 --> 00:13:15.490
and yet I couldn't
find a single mention

00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:19.231
of anything involving demons
in any history textbook.

00:13:19.264 --> 00:13:23.239
We were relegated
to fairy tales and fables.

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:28.482
We demons were regarded
only as monsters to be slain.

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:29.919
I wanted to teach humans

00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:31.856
true history
as it really happened,

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.794
but my efforts were in vain,

00:13:33.827 --> 00:13:36.800
because humans have
no interest in the truth!

00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:41.108
So Rion and I
will create a new history.

00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:43.947
It will begin
when Rion is installed

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.085
as the rightful ruler
of this world.

00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:49.091
- Rion would never wish
for something like that!

00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:51.563
- [gasps]
And what would you know

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.165
about what Rion wishes for?!

00:13:55.738 --> 00:13:57.742
After all, I'm Rion's father!

00:13:57.775 --> 00:13:59.211
I know her better than anyone!

00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:01.482
- But you're not her father!

00:14:01.516 --> 00:14:02.685
You're just his right arm!

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:03.820
- [grumbles]

00:14:06.392 --> 00:14:07.427
Zanseiken!

00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:10.266
[dramatic music playing]

00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:13.406
- [gasps]

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:15.410
My demon powers.

00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:17.815
- I think our session is over.

00:14:17.848 --> 00:14:19.652
- [yelps]

00:14:19.685 --> 00:14:21.321
- [groaning]

00:14:23.827 --> 00:14:25.463
These threads are so strong.

00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:27.267
- [blade pulsing]
- Huh?

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:29.872
Yukari no Tachikiri?!

00:14:31.743 --> 00:14:33.112
We can't keep this up.

00:14:33.145 --> 00:14:34.749
- So what do you suggest, then?

00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:36.753
- These are all threads of fate.

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:38.824
We need to find
the ones connected to Rion

00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:40.326
and sever them!

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:43.099
- Yeah, well, don't look at me!
I thought that was your job!

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:44.635
- [gasps]
- [both grunt]

00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:47.107
- I'll point them out!

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.612
Okay, it's worth a shot,
I guess.

00:14:52.217 --> 00:14:54.287
All right,
let's do this, damn it!

00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:55.624
Ready when you are!

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:01.903
[threads chiming]

00:15:07.648 --> 00:15:09.519
Hey, watch out! Setsuna!

00:15:10.654 --> 00:15:11.623
- [gasps]

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:12.958
[blade pulses]

00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:14.529
There's one right there!

00:15:14.562 --> 00:15:16.331
[yells]

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:22.310
- You got one?

00:15:22.343 --> 00:15:25.016
RION: <i>Father would fight</i>
<i>every day, all day.</i>

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:26.619
- [gasps]
- <i>I would worry about him.</i>

00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:27.555
[Setsuna gasps]

00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:32.197
- What the hell was that?

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.034
- It was Rion's voice.
- [gasps]

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.136
Here they come again!

00:15:37.273 --> 00:15:38.409
[blade pulses]

00:15:38.442 --> 00:15:39.444
The green thread!

00:15:39.478 --> 00:15:41.181
- [yells]

00:15:44.722 --> 00:15:47.260
Okay, then, how about this?!

00:15:48.496 --> 00:15:50.366
I got it!

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:52.137
<i>- My father</i>
<i>never gave a thought</i>

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.374
for what I might be feeling.

00:15:57.715 --> 00:16:00.086
- [gasps] Hah!

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:03.392
<i>- The fact is, he didn't</i>
<i>care about me at all.</i>

00:16:03.425 --> 00:16:07.000
MOROHA: That voice,
it's saying what's in her heart.

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.104
[demons screaming]

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.916
- That is
a truly terrifying sight!

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:16.385
MIROKU: Inuyasha!

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:17.688
SANGO: Kagome!

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.393
SISTERS: Hey!

00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:22.765
- It's so good
to know you're both alive.

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:24.535
- Hmm.
- We can talk later.

00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:27.407
Miroku, demon powers aren't
any good against this thing.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.779
We'll need Buddhist powers
to stop it!

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:33.219
- But can even Buddhist power
stop something that big?!

00:16:33.252 --> 00:16:35.791
- It certainly won't be easy.

00:16:35.824 --> 00:16:38.229
Nonetheless,
I will give it a try!

00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:40.634
- We shall all try together.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:41.803
ALL: All right!

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:43.239
MIROKU: We'll make a barrier

00:16:43.272 --> 00:16:45.076
and lure the creature into it!

00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:46.211
- Okay!
- Got it!

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.453
- Once I've defeated you,

00:16:50.486 --> 00:16:53.292
I will at last be known
as the strongest demon of all!

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:55.597
- Why does that
mean so much to you?

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:01.308
- Because it is
what Rion wishes!

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.118
What's this? Didn't
the Great Dog-Demon warn you

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.790
not to bring women and children
to the battlefield?!

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:13.065
- I'll tell you something
you should already know.

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:14.467
- [gasps]
- Anyone who would sink

00:17:14.502 --> 00:17:17.541
to using such tactics
will never be the strongest.

00:17:17.575 --> 00:17:18.944
- [growls]

00:17:18.977 --> 00:17:20.981
- The reality is Rion and I

00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:22.952
don't see much to admire
in these humans.

00:17:22.985 --> 00:17:26.091
Surely, Miss Towa,
even you can't be blind

00:17:26.124 --> 00:17:29.130
to the ugliness of humanity,
especially in the Reiwa era!

00:17:29.164 --> 00:17:33.439
Their society rejects anyone
who's even a little different!

00:17:33.472 --> 00:17:35.343
They reject them,
just as we demons

00:17:35.376 --> 00:17:37.948
have always been rejected
and chased from our homes

00:17:37.982 --> 00:17:40.019
and made to feel
as if we were inferior!

00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:41.956
- You can't blame
all of humanity

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.893
for the way some people behave!

00:17:43.927 --> 00:17:45.631
There are good humans
and bad humans,

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:48.035
just like there are
good demons and bad demons!

00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:50.841
- Which makes you...

00:17:50.874 --> 00:17:52.811
one of the bad ones!

00:18:03.934 --> 00:18:05.871
ROKUTA: Sir! We're all set up!

00:18:05.904 --> 00:18:06.873
- [grunts]

00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:08.175
All right, then.

00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:10.379
Light the signal fire!

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.258
- Oh, wow, this is
so exciting, isn't it?

00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:18.195
- Yeah, this is just
the chance we wanted

00:18:18.228 --> 00:18:20.166
to try out all those
new weapons we developed.

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:22.738
- Girls, make sure
to stay focused, okay?

00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:24.441
BOTH: Yes, Mother.

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:35.096
- HISUI: Father!
- Hmm?

00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:38.202
- Preparations on the barrier
are complete.

00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:39.872
- Understood, Hisui.

00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:41.509
- Are you ready?
- [grunts]

00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:45.684
- No way! No way! How'd I
get chosen to be the bait?!

00:18:45.717 --> 00:18:48.990
- Stop complaining, and get
that Butterfly's attention!

00:18:49.024 --> 00:18:51.495
- But I didn't
even volunteer for this!

00:18:56.639 --> 00:18:59.144
Agh! It's coming!

00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:05.590
Save me! Save me!
Somebody save me!

00:19:05.624 --> 00:19:06.491
- Ready?!

00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:13.506
All right. Fire away!

00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:31.108
- [coughs]

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:32.978
What the heck's going on now?!

00:19:33.012 --> 00:19:34.648
- Stop yapping,
and hold your breath!

00:19:34.682 --> 00:19:35.684
It won't last long!

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:42.330
[Gyokuto giggles]
I knew my specially made,

00:19:42.363 --> 00:19:44.802
demon-repelling stink bombs
would do the trick!

00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:46.371
- That's nothing! Watch this!

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:48.342
Hah!

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.124
How 'bout that?! [giggles]

00:19:56.158 --> 00:19:57.427
- [sighs]
- BOTH: Oh, no!

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.901
KIN'U: It's going
to escape the barrier!

00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:02.203
- SANGO: Hachi!
- Mm-hmm!

00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:03.673
- Oh, no, you don't!

00:20:03.707 --> 00:20:04.842
Black Hiraikotsu!

00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:11.856
HISUI: All right!

00:20:16.164 --> 00:20:17.968
SANGO:
Now's your chance, Miroku!

00:20:18.001 --> 00:20:21.174
- Failure is not an option,
Lady Kagome.

00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:22.276
Let's do this!

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.479
- You got it.

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:27.487
Take this, butterfly!

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:36.539
- Nice one, Kagome!

00:20:36.572 --> 00:20:38.576
- I'll take care of the rest!

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:42.551
Meet an arhat,
then slay the arhat;

00:20:42.584 --> 00:20:45.189
meet your parents,
then slay your parents.

00:20:45.222 --> 00:20:49.532
Know that the light to your path
lies therein.

00:20:49.565 --> 00:20:51.602
[yells]

00:21:03.993 --> 00:21:05.764
- Wow! They really did it!

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:07.868
- We pulled it off!
- We did it! We did it!

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:10.740
- The mission was a success!
Well done, everyone!

00:21:10.774 --> 00:21:12.711
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:21:13.813 --> 00:21:15.249
INUYASHA: Nicely done!

00:21:15.282 --> 00:21:16.351
- Thanks.

00:21:16.384 --> 00:21:19.257
- All we've done
is delay the inevitable.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.662
- Hmm. Maybe.

00:21:21.696 --> 00:21:25.871
We'll just have to count
on Moroha and the others.

00:21:25.904 --> 00:21:27.641
- Moroha! The blue one!

00:21:27.674 --> 00:21:28.943
- [yells]

00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:32.316
RION: <i>Do you have any idea</i>

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.254
<i>what it's like</i>
<i>to have such a father?!</i>

00:21:34.287 --> 00:21:36.726
- Tell us!
Come down from there, and talk!

00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:40.132
- Rion, think about it.
Is this really what you want?

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:42.136
- Silence, both of you!

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.272
You don't know what I want!

00:21:43.305 --> 00:21:45.276
[both gasp]

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:47.280
- [yells]

00:21:47.313 --> 00:21:48.650
- [grunts]

00:21:51.923 --> 00:21:52.825
- [grunts]

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.296
- [chuckles]

00:21:55.329 --> 00:21:56.632
Well, well.

00:21:56.666 --> 00:21:58.736
You're acting
just like a human.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.540
- What did you say?!

00:22:00.574 --> 00:22:03.947
- There's a limit
to human abilities,

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.418
and I believe you've reached it.

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:08.021
Farewell, Miss Towa!

00:23:34.127 --> 00:23:36.064
- [gasps]

00:23:41.943 --> 00:23:43.245
[dramatic music playing]

00:23:43.278 --> 00:23:46.585
KIRINMARU: <i>A demon's instincts</i>
<i>are all I have left now!</i>

00:23:46.619 --> 00:23:50.593
<i>Let us finish this battle,</i>
<i>Sesshomaru!</i>

00:23:50.627 --> 00:23:51.829
SESSHOMARU: <i>Agreed.</i>

00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:54.000
MOROHA: <i>You want me</i>
<i>to sever another thread?!</i>

00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:56.906
TOWA: <i>Rion, you have to tell us</i>
<i>how you really feel!</i>

00:23:56.939 --> 00:23:59.578
SETSUNA: <i>Stop, Towa!</i>
<i>Don't use the Zanseiken!</i>

00:23:59.612 --> 00:24:01.682
KIRINMARU: <i>Fight, Rion. Fight.</i>

00:24:01.716 --> 00:24:04.420
TOWA: <i>Carve out your future</i>
<i>with your own strength!</i>

00:24:04.454 --> 00:24:07.594
<i>Next time on</i> Yashahime:
<i>"Father and Daughter."</i>

00:24:07.628 --> 00:24:09.632
RION: <i>...as strong as my father!</i>
