[grumbles]

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.415
Moroha, I wouldn't mind

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:06.486
you dragging us out
to the middle of nowhere so much

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.356
if I thought you knew
where you were going.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.427
‐ Hey, I'm doing this for you.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.364
We've gotta find
this Bokusen‐Oh guy

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.536
so he can help us
get the Kyuyokon root.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.209
‐ What is this Kyuyokon root
you keep going on about?

00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:20.615
‐ We're not really sure,
but it's something

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:23.621
extremely important
for making your new demon sword.

00:02:23.654 --> 00:02:26.492
Moroha, you sure
you got it right this time?

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:28.964
‐ Yeah, Mr. Jyubei
screwed up last time,

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:30.702
but this time, we're good.

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:32.237
He assured me that Bokusen‐Oh

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:33.774
lives right there
in that forest.

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:36.412
TOWA: Really? Doesn't look
like anyone lives there.

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:38.316
Just how deep in there
does he live?

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.020
‐ I don't know. Let's find out!

00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:41.022
‐ Fine.

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.159
‐ Come on, Setsuna.
‐ Right.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.165
[gasps]

00:03:01.062 --> 00:03:02.164
‐ I see.

00:03:02.197 --> 00:03:05.872
So they've gone off
in search of Bokusen‐Oh.

00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:07.041
‐ Do you think Setsuna

00:03:07.074 --> 00:03:10.782
will master
the Yukari no Tachikiri in time?

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:11.884
‐ Who can say?

00:03:11.917 --> 00:03:13.186
‐ "Who can say"?!

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.892
Well, I thought
that maybe you could.

00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:17.227
‐ Come, Jaken.

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.833
‐ Eh, yes, yes, My Lord.
I'm coming.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.802
I'm coming.

[violin playing]

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:34.295

00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:37.936
‐ Meido Zangetsuha!

‐ [roars]

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.685
‐ [humming violin tune]

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:53.968
Please keep my children
safe from all harm.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.036
‐ [wind blows]
‐ Huh?

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.305
[woman laughs]

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.311
Were you waiting
for Lord Sesshomaru?

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:00.681
‐ Wh‐Who are you?

00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:02.451
‐ My name is Otsuyu.

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:07.194
I despise half‐demon children
and the humans that spawn them.

00:04:07.227 --> 00:04:08.731
‐ Half‐demons?

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:09.900
‐ Yes, that's right.

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:13.473
Those twin girls you saw fit
to bring into the world.

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:17.816
I hate them, because half‐demons
only bring misfortune.

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:18.851
‐ [gasps]

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.757
‐ If I allow your
half‐demon twins to roam free,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.130
disaster is sure to befall
my brother Kirinmaru,

00:04:25.163 --> 00:04:26.700
ending in his demise.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:30.474
It would be so easy for me
to kill you here and now.

00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:33.480
However, that would play
into the hands of you humans,

00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:36.954
who seek to be loved during
your short and fleeting lives,

00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:38.891
just like Izayoi did.

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:39.926
‐ [gasps]

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.034
‐ Those who are loved
are fated to end in beauty.

00:04:44.068 --> 00:04:45.571
Well, I won't permit it!

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:46.573
‐ [yelps]

00:04:46.607 --> 00:04:47.509
[gasps] Huh?

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:49.846
‐ The silver‐scale curse.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.388
You will live to see your body
covered in hideous silver scales

00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:56.259
as you slowly rot away.

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:57.394
‐ Bakusai‐‐

00:04:57.427 --> 00:04:59.131
‐ You want the woman dead?!

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.570
‐ [gasps]
‐ Lord Sesshomaru!

00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:02.572
Master Jaken!

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:04.241
JAKEN: Rin, are you all right?

00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:06.412
And you‐‐Zero, as I recall‐‐

00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:08.249
what did you just do to Rin?

00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:09.986
‐ I'm afraid you've come

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.057
a little too late,
Lord Sesshomaru.

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:15.263
Oh, I wouldn't.

00:05:15.297 --> 00:05:17.334
If you kill me,
then this woman will die,

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.271
and you wouldn't want that,
would you?

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:20.273
‐ Huh?

00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:21.743
‐ You see, she and I

00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:23.814
now share
the same thread of fate.

00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:26.653
The only way
to lift the silver‐scale curse

00:05:26.687 --> 00:05:27.689
is to kill me,

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:31.429
but if you do that,
you'll be killing her as well.

00:05:31.462 --> 00:05:33.499
‐ [whimpers] L‐Lord Sesshomaru?

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:36.940
ZERO: And what will happen
if she's left like this?

00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:41.315
The ugly silver scales will
start to cover her entire body.

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.419
Oh, dear me, how horrible.

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:45.992
I really wonder
if the great Lord Sesshomaru

00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:48.697
will still be able
to feel love for such a woman.

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:51.904
‐ Zero, just what is it
that you want?

00:05:51.937 --> 00:05:53.707
‐ I want the half‐demon twins.

00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:58.116
Tell me where they are, and I'll
lift the curse from this woman.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.519
‐ You are mad.

00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:01.122
‐ So if we tell you
where they are,

00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:03.192
you will lift the curse
you put on Rin?

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:04.328
Well, I will tell you, then.

00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:06.332
‐ [gasps] Master Jaken, no!

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.637
‐ [muffled] But, Rin, I must...

00:06:08.671 --> 00:06:10.307
‐ [gasps]

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.944
‐ Rin, what are you doing?!

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:13.981
‐ Take my life!

00:06:14.014 --> 00:06:17.655
I'd rather die myself than have
those two die because of me!

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:19.124
‐ Rin...

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:20.861
‐ It's true
I've hardly had the chance

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.734
to even hold them
in my arms yet, but even so‐‐

00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:26.540
even so, my love
for them as our children

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:29.879
is just as strong as yours,
Lord Sesshomaru.

00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:32.852
I'd willingly
sacrifice myself for them!

00:06:34.154 --> 00:06:35.090
[Zero scoffs]

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:38.396
Humans are
such amusing creatures.

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.674
<i>I'll give you some time</i>
<i>to think it over</i>

00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:46.947
<i>and shall return</i>
<i>once Kirinmaru awakens.</i>

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.552
I'll expect your answer then.

00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:50.554
‐ [Rin winces]
‐ [gasps]

00:06:50.588 --> 00:06:52.992
‐ It's so hot. [moans]

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.434
‐ [panting]
‐ What is it?

00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:59.506
Are you in pain, Rin? [gasps]

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.510
[dramatic music playing]

00:07:01.543 --> 00:07:03.914
The curse is moving rapidly
through her body.

00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:07.387
We have to take action,
and quickly too, or else‐‐

00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:09.559
I've got it!
Yes, Lord Sesshomaru,

00:07:09.592 --> 00:07:11.797
there might be
a way to save her.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.970
We'll seal Rin
inside the Tree of Ages.

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:18.644
The only problem
is Inuyasha and Kagome.

00:07:18.677 --> 00:07:20.648
They'll probably
go after Kirinmaru

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:22.518
and try to take down Zero too,

00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:26.092
and then, of course,
Rin will die.

00:07:30.835 --> 00:07:34.274
‐ It's been quite a while,
Kirinmaru.

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:36.680
Do you intend to slay Inuyasha?

00:07:36.713 --> 00:07:40.821
‐ Oh, my. Could Lord Sesshomaru
be offering assistance?

00:07:40.855 --> 00:07:45.296
‐ Very well, Sesshomaru.
Come with me.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.332
‐ [wails]

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:47.735
‐ Inuyasha!
‐ [groans]

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:50.508
‐ Inuyasha, are you okay?
‐ Yeah.

00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:52.745
‐ [screams]

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:53.847
‐ [gasps] No!

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.220
Kagome!

00:07:57.254 --> 00:07:58.891
‐ Why did you help them?

00:07:58.924 --> 00:08:00.661
‐ I did no such thing.

00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:08.610
‐ Burn it all, until
those cursed half‐demon sisters

00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:10.447
are wiped from
this plane of existence.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.186
‐ Setsuna!

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:15.858
‐ [Jaken panting]

00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:17.862
‐ [splashing]
‐ I'm sorry, Rin.

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:21.402
Zero somehow found out
where the girls were hiding,

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:24.174
and she burnt down
the Sealed Forest!

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:25.945
But don't you worry!

00:08:25.978 --> 00:08:27.582
I, Jaken, will make sure

00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:29.586
that Setsuna's taken
to a safe place.

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.122
I've lost track of Towa
at the moment,

00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:34.094
but I'll soon find her again,
and when I do‐‐

00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:34.796
[yelps]

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:36.499
The silver scale is spreading?!

00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:37.502
But why?!

00:08:37.535 --> 00:08:39.071
‐ To stop the curse,

00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:42.545
you must permanently freeze
this woman's flow of time.

00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:44.348
‐ Are you the Tree of Ages?

00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:45.651
Where's Towa?

00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:47.522
Where the heck
did you hide Towa?

00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:49.024
‐ She is safe.

00:08:49.058 --> 00:08:52.632
She was sent across time
to the other world.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.769
The more pressing matter
is to stop

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:57.140
the silver‐scale curse,
is it not?

00:08:57.174 --> 00:09:00.614
Use the Dream Butterfly
to bring dreams to her.

00:09:00.648 --> 00:09:02.050
‐ Use what to do what?

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:07.628
‐ That is
a Dream Butterfly chrysalis.

00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:10.901
Have someone close to the woman
act as its host

00:09:10.935 --> 00:09:13.507
‐ while it grows to maturity.
‐ [grumbles]

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.711
‐ If you use the Dream Butterfly

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:18.550
to keep giving sleep
and dreams to this woman,

00:09:18.584 --> 00:09:21.188
she will also continue
to sleep and dream.

00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:25.531
That will stop her time
and slow the curse down.

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.668
‐ If you say so.

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:30.106
‐ JAKEN: You there.
‐ [gasps]

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:30.775
[gasps]

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:33.847
JAKEN: Little girl, hop on.

00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:35.216
‐ [gasps]

00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:53.019
‐ [panting]

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:55.591
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Lord Sesshomaru.

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:59.031
‐ What was it
you were doing, Jaken?

00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:01.035
‐ Uh, potty break.

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:02.304
You know... [chuckles]

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:04.976
‐ Let us go.

00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:06.880
‐ Wait, wait, wait!
I would if I could!

00:10:06.913 --> 00:10:09.552
Come back,
Lord Sesshomaru, please!

00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:11.656
[birds chirping]

00:10:13.627 --> 00:10:15.798
[brush rustling]

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.837
‐ We finally made it out.

00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:21.676
‐ Now I'm sure you don't know
where you're going.

00:10:24.214 --> 00:10:25.718
‐ [grunts]

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:27.922
‐ Are we any closer
to Bokusen‐Oh?

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:29.124
[Moroha moans]

00:10:29.158 --> 00:10:30.794
‐ What's the matter, Setsuna?
‐ Hmm?

00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:33.667
‐ I seem to have left
my violin somewhere.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.740
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.

00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:41.382
‐ Jeez, how could you go
and forget something like that?

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:42.518
I'm kinda pooped anyway,

00:10:42.552 --> 00:10:43.854
so why don't we
just take a little break?

00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:46.458
‐ Sounds good.
‐ There's a good spot! Come on!

00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:48.630
‐ Okay, okay. Wait up, Moroha!

00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:49.766
‐ Come on out, then!

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:51.135
I've been looking for a chance

00:10:51.168 --> 00:10:54.709
to test the sharpness
of my Yukari no Tachikiri.

00:10:57.113 --> 00:10:58.149
‐ Well, well, well,

00:10:58.182 --> 00:11:00.754
so you're the famous daughter
of Sesshomaru, eh?

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:02.892
‐ Are the stories
we've heard about you true,

00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:04.662
that you're just a half‐demon?

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:06.766
‐ Even so,
being Sesshomaru's daughter

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.402
makes you well worth defeating!

00:11:08.436 --> 00:11:09.371
‐ [grunts]

00:11:09.404 --> 00:11:12.712
‐ In fact,
you're the ideal prey!

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:17.487
‐ [groans]

00:11:17.522 --> 00:11:18.790
What's with this power?

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:20.426
‐ [gasps]
‐ [yells]

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.399
[laughs]

00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:26.071
‐ Hah!

00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:28.409
‐ [yells]

00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:31.382
[gasps]

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:32.284
‐ [grunts]

00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:39.164
‐ [laughter]

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.638
‐ Scourge of Swallows!

00:11:42.672 --> 00:11:44.576
‐ [yells]
‐ BOTH: Brother, no!

00:11:44.609 --> 00:11:47.380
‐ My eyes! [winces]

00:11:47.414 --> 00:11:48.717
‐ Are you all right?

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.919
‐ Damn her!

00:11:49.953 --> 00:11:53.192
‐ This eye's
suddenly a little itchy,

00:11:53.226 --> 00:11:56.600
like a bug flew in it
or something. [laughs]

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:57.935
‐ A Rainbow Pearl?

00:11:57.969 --> 00:11:59.004
‐ [rumble]
‐ [gasps]

00:11:59.037 --> 00:12:01.810
ALL: Now die, you half‐demon!

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:03.446
‐ Die!
‐ [blade slices]

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:11.863
[chime rings]

00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:23.319
[water flowing]

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:26.893
‐ [scoffs]

00:12:26.927 --> 00:12:28.530
‐ Was that
your real target all along?

00:12:28.563 --> 00:12:31.903
‐ You don't seem surprised.
Did you know I was following?

00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:36.245
‐ That earring of yours,
it gives off strange vibrations.

00:12:36.278 --> 00:12:40.654
So what are you really after,
the Rainbow Pearls or us three?

00:12:40.688 --> 00:12:42.758
‐ You're awfully fussy today.

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:44.929
What if I said
I'm only here to help?

00:12:44.963 --> 00:12:47.434
Would that
put your mind at ease?

00:13:00.093 --> 00:13:01.696
‐ [chuckles]

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.101
‐ You want to help us? Really?

00:13:04.134 --> 00:13:05.103
‐ To be honest,

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:07.775
I personally wouldn't care
if you died tomorrow.

00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:10.079
But I know
it would upset Lady Towa.

00:13:10.113 --> 00:13:11.983
‐ So it's Towa you're after.

00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:14.121
I know you're in league
with Kirinmaru,

00:13:14.154 --> 00:13:15.858
so you just stay away from her!

00:13:15.891 --> 00:13:17.695
‐ Me being in league
with Kirinmaru,

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:21.001
well, I can't exactly say
that you're wrong,

00:13:21.035 --> 00:13:23.105
but I would never admit
you're right, either.

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:25.711
‐ [scoffs] You speak in circles.

00:13:25.744 --> 00:13:27.113
‐ [chime rings]
‐ Very well, then.

00:13:27.147 --> 00:13:29.552
Let me put it in words
you'll understand.

00:13:29.585 --> 00:13:33.727
You can't protect Lady Towa.
You're just not good enough yet.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.766
Just look. You're not even
using your new naginata

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.902
to its full potential.

00:13:37.935 --> 00:13:39.739
‐ So what is your point?

00:13:39.772 --> 00:13:41.943
‐ I hereby enlist
my humble services

00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:43.847
as Lady Towa's bodyguard.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.049
I know I'm not, uh,

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:47.120
your favorite person,
to say the least,

00:13:47.153 --> 00:13:50.527
but don't worry.
I won't tell if you won't.

00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:51.796
‐ I do worry.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.099
But I suppose I can trust

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:55.637
that you really do want
to protect Towa.

00:13:55.671 --> 00:13:57.508
‐ That's all I ask for.

00:13:57.541 --> 00:13:59.879
And to show I'm being genuine...

00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:03.419
‐ [gasps]

00:14:04.522 --> 00:14:05.858
Wait. This is...

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.435
KIRINMARU: I see.
So Setsuna's come back to life.

00:14:13.372 --> 00:14:16.579
I thought the Tenseiga
had been destroyed.

00:14:16.613 --> 00:14:18.149
How was she revived?

00:14:18.182 --> 00:14:21.723
Could it have been done by Towa,
that girl Riku is interested in?

00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:26.699
Does the Great Dog‐Demon's blood
run through his granddaughters?

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.572
No wonder they amuse me so.

00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:32.043
‐ There you are!
It's about time!

00:14:32.077 --> 00:14:33.914
What the hell took you so long?

00:14:33.947 --> 00:14:36.185
‐ It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

00:14:36.218 --> 00:14:38.322
‐ Well, anyway,
where is Bokusen‐Oh?

00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:41.095
It's really weird, because we
should have found him by now.

00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:43.567
Moroha, I'm afraid
you've been misinformed again.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.535
[both gasp]

00:14:45.637 --> 00:14:47.073
‐ Oh.

00:14:48.142 --> 00:14:50.948
You sure Bokusen‐Oh
really lives around here?

00:14:50.981 --> 00:14:53.119
‐ Yeah. I see no signs
of human life.

00:14:53.152 --> 00:14:55.824
‐ Hey, Bokusen‐Oh,
are you there?!

00:14:55.858 --> 00:14:57.494
‐ How insulting.

00:14:57.528 --> 00:15:00.601
Who would have thought
I'd ever be called "human"?

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:02.505
‐ Hmm?
‐ [creaking]

00:15:02.538 --> 00:15:05.511
‐ How dare you lump me in
with those tailless monkeys?

00:15:05.544 --> 00:15:09.484
I am a 2,000‐year‐old tree,
and don't you forget it.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.255
‐ Oh, I'm very sorry, sir.

00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:13.827
‐ It's nice to meet you,
Bokusen‐Oh.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.998
I am Moroha, the Demon Killer.

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:18.837
‐ The quarter‐demon
daughter of Inuyasha.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:19.839
‐ That's right!

00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:21.776
And this is Towa and Setsuna,

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.847
the twin daughters
of Sesshomaru!

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.884
‐ Oh, yes, the half‐demon twins.

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:27.888
I've heard
quite a bit about them.

00:15:27.922 --> 00:15:30.293
And that's
the Yukari no Tachikiri?

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:31.261
‐ [gasps]

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:34.034
BOKUSEN‐OH: Forged with
lapis lazuli crystals.

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.904
Must be Totosai's work.

00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:37.407
And now you expect me
to tell you

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.948
about the Kyuyokon root, right?
Not sure I like that.

00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:42.685
‐ But we came all this way
just to see you,

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:45.657
'cause Old Man Totosai
told us you're an amazing tree!

00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:48.429
Is it true that the famous
Tenseiga's fabulous sheath

00:15:48.462 --> 00:15:51.034
‐ was made out of you?
‐ Yes, that's quite true,

00:15:51.068 --> 00:15:52.671
and not only
the Tenseiga's sheath,

00:15:52.705 --> 00:15:56.044
but the Tessaiga's sheath
was part of my body as well.

00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:57.480
[clears throat]

00:15:57.515 --> 00:15:59.117
‐ Wow, that's awesome!

00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:00.888
Seeing as how you're so amazing,

00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:02.490
we have just
one little favor to ask,

00:16:02.525 --> 00:16:03.727
if you'll just hear us out.

00:16:16.151 --> 00:16:19.024
‐ So far,
I've collected four of them.

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:20.226
[water flows]

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:22.330
‐ And here are
the remaining three.

00:16:22.363 --> 00:16:23.667
‐ Ah, Riku.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.504
‐ I traveled
all over the country

00:16:25.537 --> 00:16:26.471
to collect them for you.

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:29.779
‐ Well done. Now I
can restore my full powers.

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:33.052
‐ Once you become a great demon
again, you can usher in

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:34.989
the Degenerate Age
if you wish it.

00:16:35.022 --> 00:16:37.528
You could even
defeat Sesshomaru.

00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:38.763
‐ Spare the pleasantries.

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:42.337
Right now, it's the Half‐Demon
Princesses I wish to kill.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.942
‐ [gasps] Oh, yes, of course.

00:16:44.976 --> 00:16:46.378
Please forgive me, will you?

00:16:46.411 --> 00:16:49.317
It was in very poor taste
to have forgotten that.

00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:53.092
‐ [claps] Pretty, pretty please,
Mr. Bokusen‐Oh?

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:55.964
Come on. The Kyuyokon root,
where is it?

00:16:55.998 --> 00:16:58.970
I know you know,
'cause you're so old and wise.

00:16:59.004 --> 00:17:01.041
‐ Like I'd ever tell
a half‐demon,

00:17:01.074 --> 00:17:02.443
let alone a quarter‐demon.

00:17:02.477 --> 00:17:04.649
‐ Oh, you don't have
to tell us anything.

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:07.186
You can just go ahead
and give us a Kyuyokon root,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.489
because I'm assuming
it's just a part

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:09.992
of your root system
or something.

00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:11.729
‐ Don't be silly.
The root is cut

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:15.804
from a demon spirit tree
which stands on Mount Musubi.

00:17:15.837 --> 00:17:16.906
‐ Mount Musubi?!

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.175
‐ The same Mount Musubi

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:20.246
where the Dream Butterfly
is said to live?

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:23.285
BOKUSEN‐OH: The very same.
Mount Musubi is known to be

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.425
a place where spirits
of all sorts are born.

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:27.327
TOWA: Now I get it.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.865
The Butterfly
was a type of spirit.

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:31.001
MOROHA: And this Kyuyokon,

00:17:31.034 --> 00:17:32.337
the root
of the demon spirit tree,

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.276
can take in demon energy
and store it. Is that right?

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:39.150
BOKUSEN‐OH: Correct. And that
is why Kirinmaru fears it.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.154
‐ Wait.
Kirinmaru is afraid of it?

00:17:41.188 --> 00:17:43.158
‐ Then we have to get it!

00:17:43.192 --> 00:17:45.363
[footsteps clattering]

00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:46.599
[Riku gasps]

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:49.739
‐ Well, my dear brother?

00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:52.010
I've collected
the Rainbow Pearls.

00:17:52.043 --> 00:17:56.351
I know you're able to see me
and hear me, Kirinmaru.

00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:58.155
‐ Um, Madam...

00:17:58.188 --> 00:18:00.126
what are you talking about?

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:02.531
‐ [chuckles]

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:04.200
[ominous music playing]

00:18:04.234 --> 00:18:06.338
‐ I don't understand.

00:18:06.371 --> 00:18:08.877
‐ You really never noticed it?

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.279
Poor thing, I guess no one

00:18:10.313 --> 00:18:13.520
ever did you the kindness
of explaining it to you.

00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:14.487
You know you were once

00:18:14.522 --> 00:18:18.062
a broken‐off piece
of Kirinmaru's horn.

00:18:18.095 --> 00:18:21.201
‐ Yes, and I was
abandoned like trash.

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:22.203
[blades ringing]

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:24.474
ZERO: It happened 600 years ago.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.929
‐ [grunts]

00:18:34.962 --> 00:18:37.033
[gasps]

00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:38.737
‐ Kirinmaru was injured

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.108
during his battle
with the Great Dog‐Demon,

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:43.847
and you are the horn he lost.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.653
You are a part
of Kirinmaru's body.

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:49.290
Therefore,
everything you see and hear

00:18:49.324 --> 00:18:51.461
is seen and heard by him.

00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:52.430
‐ [gasps]

00:18:52.463 --> 00:18:54.769
‐ Isn't that right, Kirinmaru?

00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:58.475
‐ It seems I can't hide anything
from you, Sister.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.150
‐ Riku, do not ever
show your face to me again,

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.922
unless you want me
to kill you, that is.

00:19:04.955 --> 00:19:06.191
‐ But why, Madam?

00:19:06.224 --> 00:19:08.530
‐ Use that head of yours
to figure it out.

00:19:08.563 --> 00:19:09.431
‐ Wait. I beg you‐‐

00:19:09.464 --> 00:19:11.869
‐ Go, and never
come near me again.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.142
‐ I see.

00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:17.881
So fate has decided
to drive us apart.

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:21.589
[chime rings]

00:19:24.027 --> 00:19:26.264
‐ Feared even by Kirinmaru...

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.235
‐ At Mount Musubi...

00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:29.638
‐ Since we're on the subject‐‐

00:19:29.672 --> 00:19:32.544
Oh, but you probably
wouldn't know, anyway.

00:19:32.578 --> 00:19:35.216
‐ There is nothing
I do not know, quarter‐demon.

00:19:35.249 --> 00:19:38.255
‐ [giggles]
Where the heck is Mount Musubi?

00:19:38.288 --> 00:19:40.359
‐ Go about 12 kilometers
in this direction,

00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:42.564
and you will see
the mountain in front of you.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.334
‐ Eh? Okay, got it!

00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:46.271
Thanks! See you later!

00:19:46.304 --> 00:19:47.775
‐ [Bokusen‐Oh scoffs]
‐ Uh, oh.

00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:49.845
Thank you for all your help.

00:19:49.879 --> 00:19:50.914
‐ Wait.

00:19:50.947 --> 00:19:53.419
I didn't just end up
telling them everything, did I?

00:19:53.452 --> 00:19:54.688
No, no, not everything.

00:19:54.722 --> 00:19:58.095
I didn't tell them about
the barrier at Mount Musubi.

00:19:58.128 --> 00:20:00.199
They'll have to deal with that.

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:01.368
[owl hoots]

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:04.307
[owl hoots]

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.409
‐ Hmm?
‐ Hmm?

00:20:05.443 --> 00:20:07.614
‐ There's apparently
some kind of a barrier

00:20:07.648 --> 00:20:09.017
around Mount Musubi.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.252
‐ That's no surprise.

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:11.756
If this place
was easy to get to,

00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:14.528
I'm pretty sure Towa
would have found it ages ago.

00:20:14.562 --> 00:20:16.632
‐ Yeah, that's right.
It's what I've been looking for

00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:18.737
since I got here,
in case you've forgotten.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.843
‐ It's not like I asked you to.
‐ [gasps]

00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:22.845
[grumbles]

00:20:22.878 --> 00:20:25.784
Hey, it's for your sake
I'm doing it, you know!

00:20:25.817 --> 00:20:27.921
[mysterious music playing]

00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:37.941
[music continues]

00:20:41.649 --> 00:20:45.524
‐ Ugh. Memories
of that filthy glutton.

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:49.397
And I remember the Red Pearl
was entrusted to Tokotsu.

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.303
‐ [gasps]
‐ [no audible dialogue]

00:20:53.172 --> 00:20:54.307
[drop echoes]

00:20:59.985 --> 00:21:05.129
Izayoi? Why would I see
her memories in the Red Pearl?

00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:06.431
Wait. That's right.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:09.370
That quarter‐demon concealed it
in the woman's rouge.

00:21:09.404 --> 00:21:10.907
[gasps] Could it be...

00:21:15.917 --> 00:21:19.992
SETSUNA: <i>Anyone standing</i>
<i>against me is my enemy.</i>

00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:21.762
‐ [growls]

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:24.602
I don't believe it.

00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:26.371
The memories
of those half‐demons

00:21:26.404 --> 00:21:28.275
are entwined with my own energy,

00:21:28.308 --> 00:21:31.348
obscuring the Rainbow Pearls
behind a veil.

00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:33.318
That cursed Sesshomaru.

00:21:33.352 --> 00:21:35.256
The Gold and Silver Pearls,

00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:37.160
he sealed them
in his daughters' eyes,

00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:38.796
knowing this would happen!

00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:44.642
[wind blowing]

00:21:44.675 --> 00:21:46.813
‐ I sense
a lot of demon energy here.

00:21:46.846 --> 00:21:49.518
‐ Yeah, it's kinda weird.
I thought this mountain

00:21:49.552 --> 00:21:52.256
was where spirits were born,
not demons.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.427
[wind blowing]

00:21:57.166 --> 00:21:59.304
‐ [breathing softly]

00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:14.400
[Japanese music playing]

00:23:43.513 --> 00:23:44.748
TOWA: <i>Riku once told me</i>

00:23:44.782 --> 00:23:47.621
<i>that those who are loved</i>
<i>fade away in an instant.</i>

00:23:47.654 --> 00:23:49.558
<i>But does that mean</i>
<i>those who are hated</i>

00:23:49.591 --> 00:23:51.796
<i>are left to suffer</i>
<i>for all eternity?</i>

00:23:51.829 --> 00:23:54.367
<i>I wonder if that mountain</i>
<i>we've been searching for</i>

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.436
<i>holds the answer?</i>

00:23:55.469 --> 00:23:56.639
<i>But when we arrive,</i>

00:23:56.672 --> 00:23:59.979
we're greeted
by none other than Kirinmaru.

00:24:00.012 --> 00:24:03.553
Next time on Yashahime,
"The Barrier at Mount Musubi."

00:24:03.586 --> 00:24:07.594
<i>Dream Butterfly,</i>
<i>what exactly are you?</i>
