MOROHA: <i>Soon after Towa</i>
<i>and Setsuna were born,</i>

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.411
<i>Kirinmaru's sister, Zero,</i>

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.714
<i>placed a fatal curse</i>
<i>on their mother, Rin,</i>

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.382
<i>the silver-scale curse,</i>

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.285
<i>that causes the victim</i>
<i>to rot away in agony.</i>

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.854
<i>What's more,</i>
<i>Zero bound Rin to her</i>

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:22.890
<i>by threads of fate,</i>
<i>making it impossible</i>

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.459
<i>for anyone to undo</i>
<i>the curse or defeat her.</i>

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.061
<i>But Towa and Setsuna</i>

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:31.298
<i>were able to sever the fate</i>
<i>that bound Rin to Zero.</i>

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.201
<i>Through their actions,</i>
<i>Zero's heart was redeemed,</i>

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.037
<i>and Riku dispatched</i>
<i>her spirit to heaven.</i>

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.273
<i>Freed from the curse,</i>

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.709
Rin was finally able
to reunite with Sesshomaru.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.780
<i>My parents are</i>
<i>the half-demon Inuyasha</i>

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:50.150
and Kagome, the reincarnation
of a legendary priestess.

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.485
<i>Fourteen years ago,</i>

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:55.122
<i>Sesshomaru sealed them away</i>
<i>inside the Black Pearl.</i>

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.725
I was left behind, entrusted
to Hachi the Raccoon Dog,

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:01.395
who then left me in the care
of the Wolf-Demon Tribe.

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:05.132
<i>After that, I trained</i>
<i>under Master Yawaragi</i>

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.268
and grew up to be a first-rate
<i>demon bounty-hunter.</i>

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.105
<i>Then all of a sudden,</i>
<i>Sesshomaru himself</i>

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.675
<i>gave the Black Pearl to me</i>
<i>just like that,</i>

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:18.278
so now I'm finally gonna be
able to meet my mom and dad!

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:21.181
<i>Or so I thought,</i>
<i>before Kirinmaru came along</i>

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.116
<i>and took the pearl</i>
<i>away from me!</i>

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.152
<i>"Bring me the pinwheel,"</i>
<i>he says.</i>

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.321
<i>What the hell are you</i>
<i>talking about?!</i>

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:29.990
<i>Give me back</i>
<i>the Black Pearl, damn it!</i>

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.060
A Feudal Fairytale, Yashahime.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.261
<i>We'll keep moving forward,</i>

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:37.064
<i>overcoming</i>
<i>the hurdles of destiny!</i>

[Japanese music playing]

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.557
[Japanese music playing]

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.637
TOWA: "Kirinmaru of the Dawn."

[melancholy music playing]

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:31.845
- Riku.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.014
- It's all right, Lady Towa.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.884
This is how Madam
would have wanted it to be.

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:39.186
- Riku's right. Thanks to you,

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.488
Aunt Zero
has found peace at last.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:43.090
[both sigh]

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:46.693
- Towa...
- Yeah?

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.028
- Our mother...

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.697
shall we go see her?

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:51.899
- What?

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:54.868
- Yes, yes! You should
go and see your mother!

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:56.670
I'm sure nothing
would make her happier

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.105
than to see the two of you.

00:03:58.138 --> 00:04:00.440
Yes, you must go at once.

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:01.575
[both grunt]

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.879
- Let's go to her then,
together.

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:07.181
- Right.

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:09.283
- Kirara!

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:10.717
- [snarls]

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:16.490
- Safe travels!

- [gasps]

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:24.665
Riku.

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:34.608
- Riku.
- [grunts]

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.210
- I need your help,

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:38.412
though it's for something
you will not like.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:39.346
- Eh?

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.217
[wind blowing]

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.220
- This Black Pearl is said
to be connected to the place

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.288
where the Dog-Demon
of the West lies buried.

00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:49.423
- [Takechiyo whimpering]
- [Moroha growls]

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.992
- And sealed within it
are his half-demon son

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:55.596
and the priestess
who erased the Shikon Jewel,

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.130
your parents.

00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:59.800
- Get back, Takechiyo. Go on.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.001
- [yelps]

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.304
- I don't have time for this!

00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:06.707
Quit yapping and
hand over the pearl now!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.609
[yells]

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:12.145
[gasps]

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:15.315
- You don't listen very well,
do you, quarter demon?

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.484
- [grunting]

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:20.220
- If you want the pearl back
so badly...

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:23.323
then bring me Akuru.

00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:25.526
- Yeah, I know!
You keep saying that!

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.094
Who the hell is this Akuru?!

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.529
- [pinwheel clicking]
- [gasps]

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:30.297
- Akuru is a spirit

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.500
who has been around
since the Age of the Gods.

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:37.237
Akuru, the one who opens
doorways through time,

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.805
it is said that only those

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.375
who have been chosen
by the ages can see him.

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:44.044
According to legend,
he takes the form

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:46.313
of a little child
holding a pinwheel.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.214
- [gasps]

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:50.450
- I suspect you know
who I'm talking about.

00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:53.820
In fact, I'm willing to bet
you've even seen him.

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:54.888
- <i>That's right.</i>

00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:57.324
<i>Rion did say something</i>
<i>about Akuru.</i>

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.960
RION: <i>My father has visited</i>
<i>every corner of this world,</i>

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:02.062
<i>but for one place,</i>
<i>and that would be</i>

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:04.965
<i>the realm that lies</i>
<i>beyond space and time.</i>

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:06.400
<i>To achieve this,</i>

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:09.736
he hopes to find and capture
<i>a spirit named Akuru</i>

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.605
to move the Windmill of Time.

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:14.274
<i>But it is said that,</i>
<i>should that ever happen,</i>

00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:17.044
<i>the world of the living</i>
<i>will come to an end.</i>

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:20.113
<i>Flowers, trees,</i>
<i>insects, animals,</i>

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:22.349
<i>all the living things</i>
<i>I love in this world,</i>

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.352
<i>all of it will disappear</i>
<i>in an instant.</i>

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.553
- [growls]

00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:29.590
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:32.059
There's no way
I'm gonna help you find Akuru!

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:37.564
With this rouge...

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:42.169
I become Beniyasha.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:45.572
Now tremble
before the bloodthirsty dawn!

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:47.975
I challenge you to a duel!

00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:50.377
- Oh, come now.
Have you already forgotten

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.080
how thoroughly
I trounced you before?

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:00.487
- [grunts]

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:03.056
Interesting.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.126
Since our previous encounters,
it seems your spirit power

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.762
has increased along
with your demon power...

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:09.997
quarter demon.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.032
[tense music playing]

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:14.568
- Quit calling me that!

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.570
The name is Beniyasha!

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.071
- [scoffs]

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:25.212
<i>- I wonder</i>
<i>what was up with Riku.</i>

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:27.981
<i>It almost feels as if</i>
<i>I'll never see him again.</i>

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:29.049
[energy whooshes]

00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:31.018
- Towa, look at that.
- What?

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:33.987
[explosions rumble]

00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.490
- Is the Tree of Ages on fire?

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:44.431
- Lord Sesshomaru.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.866
- Can you stand up?

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:47.968
- Mm, yes, I think so.

00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:49.436
[water ripples]

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:53.106
- I'm sure that Towa and Setsuna
will be here very soon, Milady.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.142
- They will be? Really?

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:56.677
- [rumbling]
- [gasps]

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:00.948
- Moroha's here.

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.783
[footsteps splash]

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:03.784
Rin.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.452
- Yes?

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.055
- Whatever happens,
don't leave this place.

00:08:08.088 --> 00:08:11.058
- B-But, Lord Sesshomaru,
where are you going?

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:14.261
- Guard her with your life,
Jaken.

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:15.462
- Wha?!

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.364
- Wait, Lord Sesshomaru!

00:08:17.397 --> 00:08:19.566
Lord Sesshomaru!

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:34.581
[wind blowing]

00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:36.517
[water flowing]

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.152
- I've decided.

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.988
I must kill my father.

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.856
- Are you serious?!

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.124
- Perfectly.

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:47.895
But if I'm successful,
that means...

00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:49.263
- Yes, I know.

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:54.268
I was created from a piece
of Kirinmaru's broken horn,

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.369
so...

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.471
if he were to die...

00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:01.074
- Then you would
have to die as well.

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:03.977
- [chuckles]

00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:06.747
- Don't let that hold you back.
- [gasps]

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.982
- I knew this day
had to come sometime.

00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:11.585
- Won't you miss Lady Towa?

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:13.687
- Though it didn't last long,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.558
the short time I did have
to spend with Lady Towa

00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:19.026
was truly fulfilling.

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:22.196
She gave me a reason to live.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.100
- What is that?

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:31.371
- A seed from the sweetest fruit
Lady Towa ever gave me,

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:33.006
a forbidden fruit.

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:36.043
<i>Oh, my!</i>

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.078
<i>So this is an apple.</i>

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.080
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for the hospitality.</i>

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:43.750
<i>I must say...</i>

00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:46.220
[spits]

00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:49.022
<i>this fruit truly is tasty.</i>

00:09:50.324 --> 00:09:52.926
The flavor
of something forbidden,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.295
that's when I first
tasted such a thing.

00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:58.332
Lady Towa believed
my every word.

00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:02.736
And that smile on her face,
so innocent and trusting.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:06.440
I felt something
I'd never felt before.

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:10.344
I learned what it means
to truly fall in love.

00:10:10.377 --> 00:10:12.346
- [gasps]

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:16.083
- This feeling,
just this is more than enough.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.952
I no longer have any regrets.

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:20.320
My life is yours.

00:10:20.354 --> 00:10:23.423
Use it as you will, Miss Rion.

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:24.358
- Riku.

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:28.862
- So where are we off to now?

00:10:28.896 --> 00:10:31.865
- We must go back
to Mount Musubi again.

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:33.567
- Mount Musubi?

00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:38.739
[blades clashing]

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:43.844
- She should have gone
when she had the chance.

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:45.245
- [yells]

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.552
- [grunts] You have spirit.

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:52.953
I'll give you that.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.588
- [blades clashing]
- SETSUNA: Look!

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:56.790
- Moroha and Kirinmaru!

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.792
- [grunts]

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.261
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!

00:11:02.563 --> 00:11:05.632
- This is exactly
the kind of futile persistence

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:07.601
I like in an opponent.

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:08.969
- [growls]

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:11.038
- Hmm?

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.909
- I'll teach you
to look away from me in a fight!

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:17.477
[yells]

00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:18.846
- [grunts]
- [groans]

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:19.980
[yelps]

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:24.384
- Ohh! This isn't
going well at all!

00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:32.793
[stammers]

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:34.494
Damn it.

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:35.762
BOTH: Moroha!

00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:40.501
Moroha! You okay?

00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:41.869
- Yeah, fine,

00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:44.872
but you're not catching me
at my finest moment.

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:46.874
- Don't worry.
We're here to help.

00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:47.975
- No!

00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:49.176
S-Stay out of it!

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.678
This fight is only
between me and him.

00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:52.679
- [gasps] Don't--

00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:53.881
- Nonsense!

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:56.250
We're your friends, remember?

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:58.085
- [gasps]
- [gasps] Yeah, that's right!

00:11:58.118 --> 00:11:59.286
We're your friends!

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:01.588
And even more than that,
we're your cousins!

00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:04.758
Cousins support each other
and gather together at holidays

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:07.327
and spend time together
and all that!

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.662
- [gasps]

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:09.596
[sighs]

00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:13.600
KIRINMARU: It's been a while,
hasn't it...

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:16.570
Sesshomaru.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.641
- That's...
- That's...

00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:21.508
MOROHA: Sesshomaru!

00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:24.678
- I gather that my sister
has passed on.

00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:27.714
But your wife is still safe?

00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:28.649
- [scoffs]

00:12:30.117 --> 00:12:32.586
Draw your sword, Kirinmaru.

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:35.622
- Don't you think there
should be an order to things?

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:37.090
I'm in the middle of fighting

00:12:37.124 --> 00:12:39.693
that quarter demon
at the moment.

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:40.861
- [chuckles]

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:43.297
So the great
Kirinmaru of the Dawn

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.531
would rather spend his time

00:12:44.565 --> 00:12:47.701
fighting an opponent
he's already defeated twice.

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:51.238
And resort to underhanded
tactics against her too.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.306
- You dare?

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:55.075
- If you really want to be
considered the strongest,

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.877
you will have to defeat
the strongest,

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.813
and he's standing
right here before you.

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:01.048
- [chuckles]

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:09.489
So you've finally made up your
mind to take me on, have you?

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:16.063
Remember, if I win, you must
fulfill the promise you made.

00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:17.998
You must bring me Akuru.

00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:20.467
You understand that.

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:27.374
[all gasp]

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:29.977
- The fight's begun.

00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:32.813
- [grunts]

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:35.282
- [growls]

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.891
[Rin gasps]

00:13:43.924 --> 00:13:45.526
- What's all that
going on out there?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.669
- [chuckles]

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:57.304
[gasps]

00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:06.246
Don't you dare interfere,
little girls!

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.247
- Let's go!

00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:08.048
BOTH: Right!

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:11.285
- Here! Try this Sacred Arrow!

00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:16.056
- [winces] What?!

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:17.791
- I fooled you, didn't I?!

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:19.459
Heavenly Arrow Barrage!

00:14:19.493 --> 00:14:22.763
- She's suppressing
my power with hers.

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:25.098
- [flute plays]
- Zanseiken!

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.937
Twin Azure Dragon Wave!

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.874
[dragons roar]

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:37.411
- What? Is this
the power of the Kyuyokon?

00:14:38.912 --> 00:14:41.582
I can feel it
devouring my power.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.720
[screams]

00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:49.690
[grunting]

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:52.359
- Vermillion Bird...

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.694
Ambush!

00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:58.031
[bird shrieks]

00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:00.767
[shrieks]

00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:06.507
- Enough! I don't have time
to be dealing with children!

00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:09.743
[groaning]

00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:17.351
[scream echoes]

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:20.254
- [winces]

00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:21.555
- [gasps]

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:22.990
- [grunts]

00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:25.993
- [sizzling]
- [panting]

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:33.667
Damn you.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.671
How dare you interfere
in a duel between warriors,

00:15:37.704 --> 00:15:40.140
you insufferable brats?!

00:15:40.174 --> 00:15:42.242
You will pay for your impudence!

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:43.443
- [grunts]

00:15:43.477 --> 00:15:44.645
- Here it comes.

00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:47.314
- [dramatic music playing]
- The Dog-Demon of the West

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:51.818
always said the battlefield was
no place for women and children.

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:53.854
Were his teachings
not passed down

00:15:53.887 --> 00:15:56.023
among the members
of his own clan?!

00:15:56.056 --> 00:15:58.525
I used this giant demon fireball

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:02.262
against the Dog-Demon himself
500 years ago.

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:05.532
Let's see if you can survive it!

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:15.409
[growls]

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:17.344
[yells]

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:22.349
[all gasp]

00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:23.450
ALL: Eh?!

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:30.524
- BOTH: Father!
- MOROHA: Wha...

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:31.458
- What?!

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:44.238
- [chuckles]

00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:47.107
Yes, that was
a most impressive attack.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.244
But I survived it, Kirinmaru.

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:54.047
- He blocked it
without even raising his sword!

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.051
[both gasp]

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:03.123
- Lord Sesshomaru.

00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:05.259
[foreboding music playing]

00:17:08.795 --> 00:17:10.364
[all gasp]

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:14.735
[all gasp]

00:17:15.836 --> 00:17:16.737
[all yelp]

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.441
[both gasp]

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:23.677
[all yell]

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:29.249
- [yells] It just
gets worse and worse!

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:31.752
[leaves rustling]

00:17:31.785 --> 00:17:32.920
[both gasp]

00:17:32.953 --> 00:17:34.354
- No! It can't be!

00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:37.324
Lord Sesshomaru!

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:40.060
- [panting]

00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:42.262
It got Moroha and the others!

00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:44.064
It just sucked them right in!

00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:46.166
[all screaming]

00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:54.808
INUYASHA: Huh?
What the hell is that?

00:17:54.842 --> 00:17:56.176
KAGOME: Let's go and see.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.144
- Yeah.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.182
[mysterious music playing]

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:09.523
- What this?
Has he concealed his presence?

00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:11.558
[chuckles] <i>No matter.</i>

00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:17.030
<i>Having been hit</i>
<i>by my demon fireball,</i>

00:18:17.064 --> 00:18:20.167
<i>Sesshomaru will be</i>
<i>starting to lose his Haku.</i>

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:22.369
<i>Even so...</i>

00:18:22.402 --> 00:18:25.339
<i>we still haven't</i>
<i>settled things just yet.</i>

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:28.809
Come on out, Sesshomaru!

00:18:28.842 --> 00:18:30.043
Where are you hiding?!

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:33.213
Show yourself, Sesshomaru!

00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:36.316
- [shudders]

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.852
I don't know if anyone
can hear me in there,

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:41.555
but if so,
hurry up and come out!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:43.991
- Sesshomaru!

00:18:44.024 --> 00:18:45.259
- [yelps]

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:48.128
If Kirinmaru gets his hands
on this Black Pearl,

00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:50.130
things will be even worse
than they are now,

00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:51.365
if that's even possible!

00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:53.934
- Sesshomaru...

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.636
if you won't come out,

00:18:55.669 --> 00:19:00.340
well, then I guess
I can declare this a victory.

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:06.613
[wind blowing]

00:19:06.647 --> 00:19:08.949
SETSUNA: What is this place?

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:10.951
MOROHA: Apparently
this is where our grandpa,

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.053
the Great Dog-Demon, was buried.

00:19:14.087 --> 00:19:17.324
- We need to find a way
to get back, and fast.

00:19:17.357 --> 00:19:18.492
- I'm sorry.

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:22.162
It was all my fault that
Sesshomaru ended up like that.

00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:24.665
- Moroha!
- Mm?

00:19:24.698 --> 00:19:26.333
TOWA: Someone's coming.

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:27.301
MOROHA: Huh?

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:28.669
[Kagome panting]

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.805
[twins gasp]

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:32.739
- Is that...

00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:34.741
No way.

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:43.317
- Moroha?

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.785
Is that you?

00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:46.320
Can it be?

00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:49.556
- [gasps]

00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:56.063
It's for real, then?

00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:58.565
You really are my mom?

00:20:01.935 --> 00:20:03.036
- [growls]

00:20:04.271 --> 00:20:05.973

[groans]

00:20:09.009 --> 00:20:10.544
- You're Moroha, are you?

00:20:10.577 --> 00:20:11.578
- Uh, huh?

00:20:11.612 --> 00:20:13.847
Uh, yeah, I am.

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:14.882
[winces]

00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:16.817
[stammers]

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.385
- Stop making faces.

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:19.419
Let me look at you.

00:20:19.453 --> 00:20:22.689
- Huh? O-Okay, Mom.

00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:23.991
- It's not a trick?

00:20:24.024 --> 00:20:26.193
You really are Moroha, then?

00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:29.363
- Yeah, I really am.

00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:33.567
[sentimental music playing]

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.601
- Moroha.

00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:36.870
[sniffles]

00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:38.872
You came to see us, didn't you,

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:40.073
to find us?

00:20:40.107 --> 00:20:41.942
- Well, sort of,

00:20:41.975 --> 00:20:44.444
but actually...

00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:45.579
- [cries]
- [gasps]

00:20:55.722 --> 00:20:58.759
- Moroha, I've missed you.

00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:00.594
I've missed you so much.

00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:03.997
- Y-Yeah.

00:21:04.898 --> 00:21:06.600
Hmm? [sniffs]

00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:10.237
Her scent, it's so familiar.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.240
<i>I remember it</i>
<i>from a long time ago.</i>

00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:22.015
- Moroha, forgive me for having
left you all alone for so long.

00:21:23.784 --> 00:21:24.685
I'm sorry.

00:21:25.886 --> 00:21:27.988
[crying] I'm sorry.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.225
Forgive me.

00:21:36.897 --> 00:21:39.933
- Moroha, I'm so happy for you.

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:41.768
[crying]

00:21:41.802 --> 00:21:44.071
- Hey, Kagome!

00:21:44.104 --> 00:21:46.640
I couldn't find anything
over that way.
