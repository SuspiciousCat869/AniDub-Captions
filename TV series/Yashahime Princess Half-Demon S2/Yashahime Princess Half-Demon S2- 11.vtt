00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.774
MOROHA: Look!

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.710
That eyeball thing
on top of the tower

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:10.978
is sleeping on the job!

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.113
Now's my chance to get
my bow and arrows back

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.381
from Shogen Mamiana!

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.316
[both yelling]

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:23.524
‐ Where am I?

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:25.592
‐ [Zero laughs]
‐ [gasps]

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:26.593
Zero!

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:27.995
‐ [laughs]

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.930
Without your demon power,

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.699
you're easy prey
for my illusion spell.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.067
NANAHOSHI:
The sorrow in her eyes

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.370
is subtle, but intense.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:40.541
‐ A grieving heart
and tears of distress.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:41.808
What a feast.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.978
Enjoy your meal,
Lord Nanahoshi.

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:47.114
[both laughing]

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.186
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.641
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.755
TOWA: <i>"Battle on the New Moon,</i>
<i>Part 2."</i>

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.294
‐ [sighing]

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:41.695
JAKEN: Oh, no.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.598
The silver scales
have spread fast.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:45.599
‐ [grunts]

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.601
[moans]

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.269
Lord Sesshomaru...

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.908
I wish to see my girls...

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.543
with my own eyes...

00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.479
one last time.

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:02.449
[footsteps splashing]

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.585
Lord Sesshomaru.

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:07.154
Towa is crying.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.793
[footsteps splashing]

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:14.328
[footsteps shuffling]

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:17.598
‐ Tonight is the New Moon.

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:22.402
Which means that Towa and
Setsuna's demon powers are gone.

00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:26.173
[dog barking]

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.577
[breathing softly]

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:36.383
‐ [jabbering]

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.185
[footsteps rumbling]

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.287
[tense music playing]

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.791
‐ Sesshomaru's daughter...

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:50.097
they say that revenge is a dish
that's best served cold. Heh.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.534
‐ [laughs]

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:54.868
Behold!

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:57.070
‐ [gasps]

00:03:57.104 --> 00:04:01.308
‐ This is a piece of the finest
aromatic wood in the world,

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.277
the Mini Galaxy.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.678
‐ [gasps]

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.246
‐ What are you doing?!

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.182
[gasping]

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:16.223
‐ It's called an eternity bug.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:19.159
It will suck out and collect
all your pain and suffering

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:21.762
and infuse it
in the Mini Galaxy,

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:22.863
which will then release

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.299
a splendid fragrance
for me to enjoy.

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:26.466
[laughs]

[insects chirping]

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:38.979
‐ Huh?
‐ Eh?

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.647
‐ [babbling]

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:41.982
‐ Sir Shogen?

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.817
‐ [drunken] How goes it?

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:45.285
‐ All's well, sir!

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.621
‐ Good, because you know
that during the new moon,

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:50.390
the Full Moon Raccoon Dog's eye
is closed, right?

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:53.327
‐ Sir! We'll be sure
to keep our eyes open, sir!

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.462
‐ Excellent, 'cause at daybreak,
we're holding

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:58.498
Lord Kiku‐whoever's
coming‐of‐age ceremony,

00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:02.002
and I want no intruders
interfering, understood?!

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.470
‐ BOTH: Yes, sir!
‐ [babbling]

00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:06.073
‐ He sure seems
to be in a good mood.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:08.008
‐ Well, yeah,
why wouldn't he be?

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.744
After tomorrow,
he'll be in complete control.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:11.778
‐ Hey!
‐ Huh?

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:12.880
‐ SHOGEN: Stop your struggling!

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:13.947
‐ Damn it, Shogen!

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.883
Let me go, you evil fiend!

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.351
‐ Sir Shogen?

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:18.819
‐ Open the gates!

00:05:18.852 --> 00:05:20.153
I've caught that intruder

00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:22.789
who's working
with the traitor Takechiyo!

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:25.092
‐ [groans]
‐ Uh, well, um...

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.160
‐ Wait, did you let
somebody who looks like me

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:28.529
just pass by here?!

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:31.732
I ask because her wily companion
Hachiemon got away from me

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.100
and was running this way!

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:36.069
‐ Are you saying
that was Hachiemon just now?

00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:37.971
‐ I think that's
what he's saying, yeah.

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:39.306
‐ Idiots!

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.241
You allowed him
into the castle?!

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:43.744
‐ Hah! You call yourself
raccoon dog demons,

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:45.245
and you let
one of your own kind

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.780
pull a fast one
like that on you?!

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:48.182
‐ [both yelp]
‐ [whistle blowing]

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.550
‐ Sound the alarm!
‐ [bell ringing]

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:50.951
We have an intruder!

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:53.353
‐ An intruder
has snuck into the castle!

00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:55.088
Not only that, he's an imposter

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.491
who's disguised himself
as the head elder!

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.992
‐ [hums a tune] Huh?

00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:00.527
‐ There he is! Get him!
‐ [yelling]

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:01.595
Get the imposter!

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:02.696
‐ Have you gone mad?!

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:03.897
What are you doing?!

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:06.466
Get your hands off me,
you fools!

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.734
‐ Quiet, Hachiemon!

00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:11.171
‐ What?! Who?!
What are you talking about?!

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:13.941
TAKECHIYO: Hah!
They all fell for it.

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:16.009
HACHI: Yes,
we've accomplished our job.

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:17.978
Now it's up to Moroha.

00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:21.181
[rustling]

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:26.119
‐ All right.

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:29.823
Boy, does it ever feel good
to get you guys back.

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:30.991
‐ KIKUNOSUKE: Who's there?
‐ Huh?

00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:32.826
‐ Wait a minute.
You're that intruder

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.995
who escaped from the dungeon,
aren't you?

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.797
‐ Oh, it's you, Kikunosuke.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.532
You scared me there
for a second.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.033
‐ How fares my brother?

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:41.602
I hope he's doing well.

00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:45.672
He has suffered much
and faced many hardships

00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:47.674
due to my lack of courage.

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:50.277
I'm sure he despises me,
doesn't he?

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.447
‐ Takechiyo's in a tough
situation, that's for sure,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.582
but I know
he doesn't blame you for it.

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:59.186
‐ Really? Oh, I wish
I could see him right now

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.689
to say I'm sorry
from the bottom of my heart.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.125
<i>‐ Well, what do you know?</i>

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:08.095
<i>The little brother's more</i>
<i>mature than the big brother.</i>

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:10.397
‐ Will you take me
to my brother?

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.198
‐ You bet I‐‐

00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:13.500
‐ You mustn't, Lord Kikunosuke.

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:14.468
Would you help those

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:16.870
who seek the destruction
of your own clan?

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:18.972
[Kikunosuke gasps]
Full Moon Raccoon Dog?

00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:22.676
‐ Summon the guards and
have that girl taken prisoner.

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.077
‐ Give me a break!

00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.480
You're the one trying to grab
control of the Mamidaira Clan

00:07:26.513 --> 00:07:29.082
from the two brothers
who should be in charge of it!

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.120
‐ [laughing]
That won't work on me.

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:34.821
‐ Yeah, but why doesn't it?!

00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:35.956
[energy surges]

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:38.458
‐ Did you really think
you could seal me away

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:41.028
with that puny level
of spirit power?

00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:44.097
‐ [grunts] I can't move.

00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:46.700
‐ [squawks]

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:47.601
[grunts]

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.038
‐ [gasps]

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:53.440
Hey, way to go, Takamaru!
Thanks!

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.142
‐ [squawks]

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:57.644
‐ Lord Kikunosuke, help me up!

00:07:57.678 --> 00:07:59.413
Quickly! Help me up!

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:00.314
‐ I think it's better

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:02.249
if you stayed
just where you are for now.

00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:03.750
‐ [squawks]
‐ Takamaru.

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:05.619
So you got me
a response from them, huh?

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:06.553
‐ [squawks]

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:11.191
‐ What the hell?

00:08:11.225 --> 00:08:13.060
I can barely read
this handwriting.

00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:16.430
"My dear,
most honorable Lady Moroha,

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:19.867
worthy daughter of the noble
Inuyasha and Lady Kagome,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.369
whose feats have made them
legend far and near,

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:24.438
I have heard with pleasure
the many accounts

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:26.306
of your continued
growth and success.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.276
As to your question
concerning the best way

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:31.845
to repel Shogen Mamiana's
secret technique,

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.247
the so‐called World Reversal‐‐"

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.749
Agh! Just get on
with it already!

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.117
‐ [door slides]
‐ You!

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.654
So you managed to sneak this far
into the castle, did you?

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:45.459
Get away from her and come here
at once, Lord Kikunosuke.

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:46.860
‐ [gasps]

00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:49.162
‐ Hey, are we sure
he's the real Shogen?

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:52.065
Who's to say that's
not Hachiemon in disguise?

00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:53.634
‐ [guards murmur]
‐ Of course I'm me!

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.002
Stop talking nonsense!

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.437
Don't even think of falling
for that stupid trick!

00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:59.306
‐ But, sir, we can't tell
what's a trick

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:01.408
and what's not a trick anymore!

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:02.342
‐ That's what I get

00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:04.745
for surrounding myself
with complete idiots!

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:07.147
But no matter.

00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:09.816
I'm quite capable
of dealing with you myself!

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.720
‐ Sorry, but I'm right in
the middle of reading a letter,

00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:15.222
so I'm afraid
this'll have to wait.

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:16.557
But keep up the good work.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.159
You almost got me believing
you're not Hachiemon.

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:21.161
‐ You know perfectly well
I'm not‐‐

00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:23.730
Hey! Stop! Come back here!

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:28.101
Get after that big red kite
or whatever it is!

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:30.637
Lord Kikunosuke's
just been abducted!

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:32.172
Don't let them get away!

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:33.841
‐ [bell ringing]
‐ Yes, sir, at once!

00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:35.108
After them, men!

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:36.376
‐ They mustn't get away!

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.579
The next leader of our clan
has been kidnapped!

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:39.880
‐ Shh.
‐ [ringing continues]

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:40.914

[owl hooting]

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.728
All right, then,

[Yukinyudo laughs]

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.245
Can it be Sesshomaru's daughter
has such weak demon energy?

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:13.313
Eh?

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.818
‐ "If a demon shows up..."

00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:21.054
SETSUNA: If a demon shows up
that is taller than two meters,

<i>pull rope number one</i>
<i>hanging from the ceiling.</i>

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:26.226
‐ So what do you think?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.496
KOHAKU: Yup,
he's definitely tall enough.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.831
‐ Who the hell are you?

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:32.599
‐ We're demon slayers.

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:34.301
‐ Demon slayers?

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:36.637
Were you guys hired
by the innkeeper here?

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.572
‐ Well, something like that.

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:39.873
‐ There.

00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:41.408
‐ Huh?

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:43.310
What the...

‐ Hisui, what's it say

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.764
about demons
that are 30 centimeters tall?

00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:05.966
‐ <i>According</i>

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.335
<i>so long as they are</i>
<i>less than ten in number...</i>

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:10.704
‐ It says you should
be able to take 'em out

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:12.739
with your sickle and chain.

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:13.774
‐ Well, I didn't need

00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:16.243
any special instructions
to know that.

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:17.177

HISUI: Uh‐oh.

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.988
Okay then, now what?

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.990
SETSUNA: <i>The demons</i>

Found it.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.134
Well, what do you know?

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:43.470

[screams]

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:14.902
What did I ever do to you?!

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:16.703
‐ Jeez, I'm amazed that Setsuna

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:18.705

‐ You can cry if you want, Towa.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.718
In fact,
the more tears you shed,

00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:34.988
the sooner your sorrow and pain
will be alleviated.

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:36.456
‐ [gasps]

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.091
I will never cry.

‐ How very impressive.

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:43.630
‐ Go on, Towa.
Let your tears flow.

00:12:43.664 --> 00:12:45.799
Scream as loud as you can.

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:46.834
Let it out.

Release all the rage and hate

You're never
gonna get me to cry!

KIKUNOSUKE:
So what's the plan now?

00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:17.231
‐ I'm betting
the real Full Moon Raccoon Dog

00:13:17.264 --> 00:13:18.932
is up there in that tower.

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:21.835
The voice that came
from behind that screen,

00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:24.505
that was just Shogen Mamiana
playing a part.

00:13:24.538 --> 00:13:27.508
‐ So why did he say
your spirit powers won't work?

00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:31.111
‐ 'Cause they won't work
against a simple painted screen.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.613
But the fact is, he must feel

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:34.681
at least a little threatened
by my spirit powers,

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:37.718
or else he wouldn't have tried
to pull off a bluff like that.

00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:39.520
‐ Oh, I see.

00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:41.355
‐ Here is the proof!

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:44.057
He's been embezzling your taxes!

00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:46.193
TAKECHIYO:
Shogen Mamiana is a crook!

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:48.262
He's been deceiving you!

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:50.831
‐ Together, we can bring
his corrupt reign to an end

00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:52.366
and throw the tyrant out!

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.800
Are you with me?!

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.903
ALL: Yeah!

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.871
KIKUNOSUKE:
I envy my older brother,

00:13:57.905 --> 00:14:00.107
that he could find
someone as wonderful as you

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.942
willing to be his ally.

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:04.444
I don't inspire
that kind of loyalty.

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:07.047
You can see the terrible state
our clan's in,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.149
and it's all due to my weakness.

00:14:09.183 --> 00:14:12.019
‐ Hey, it's not easy
being a young lord

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:14.655
or a kid brother
for that matter.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.557

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:28.402
Oh!

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:33.540
‐ So that's the thing
my mom sealed away, huh?

00:14:33.574 --> 00:14:34.641
‐ Yes, but I was taught

00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:38.445
that the Full Moon Raccoon Dog
is our guardian spirit.

00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:39.613
‐ He's not much of one.

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:42.416
What kind of guardian spirit
lets himself be used

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:45.752
by a a thieving sack of shit
like Shogen Mamiana?!

00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:47.754
‐ Uh, Moroha?

00:14:47.788 --> 00:14:50.357
[bowstring creaking]

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.627
‐ My mom showed you
a lot more mercy than I will!

00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:57.097
This is no Arrow of Sealing.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.300
This arrow will purify you
once and for all!

You okay, Little Bro?

00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:35.102
‐ Big Brother!

00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:36.703

‐ I got you!

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.712
‐ You better be the real Hachi

00:15:45.746 --> 00:15:47.881
and not Shogen in disguise.

00:15:47.915 --> 00:15:50.884
‐ Very funny, Miss Moroha.

you've ruined everything
with your meddling.

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:13.373
‐ Well...

00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:15.075
I don't want you
going away angry,

00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:16.977
so why don't we
finish this here and now?

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.046
‐ With great pleasure.

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:21.782
It was your father, Inuyasha,
who gave me this scar,

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.884
but I'll take
my vengeance out on you!

00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:24.918

‐ Takechiyo...
‐ Eh?

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.022
‐ I need you to stand
right where you are.

00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:31.558
Hold these letters up
high enough that I can read 'em.

00:16:31.592 --> 00:16:33.794
‐ Huh?! W‐Wait! Why me?!

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:36.296
‐ Because this fight
is about your clan!

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.665
Be brave and stand your ground.

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:41.835
Show your people that you
deserve to be their young lord.

00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:43.804
‐ [groans]

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.672
All right, I'll do it.

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:46.874
‐ Besides...

00:16:46.907 --> 00:16:48.742
I can't think of anyone else

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:50.677
I'd rather have
watching my back.

‐ [gasps] Moroha!

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.982
You can count on me!

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:01.421

‐ That's just what I wanted!

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:16.904
Try this on for size!

00:17:16.937 --> 00:17:19.306
Crimson...

[dragon roars]

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:28.582
I countered with my Backlash
Wave at its slowest speed.

00:17:28.615 --> 00:17:30.350
<i>Hope this works.</i>

00:17:31.585 --> 00:17:33.086
‐ What a fool you are.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.422
You still haven't learned,
have you?

00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:37.324
World Reversal!

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.328
[dragon roars]

00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:44.097
‐ Okay, let's see.

00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:46.834
I put my wrists together,
and...

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:49.036
‐ What are you doing Moroha?!
Hurry up!

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:50.771
‐ Why isn't anything happening?

00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:52.272
‐ [wails]

00:17:52.306 --> 00:17:53.974
This is bad!

[dragon roars]

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:56.910
‐ Run, Brother! Run!

00:17:56.944 --> 00:17:58.378
You too, Miss Moroha!

00:17:58.412 --> 00:18:00.981
‐ Come on, Moroha!
You can do this!

00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:03.951
‐ Oh, I see!
We have to say it together!

00:18:03.984 --> 00:18:05.686
BOTH: World Reversal Reversal!

00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:12.226
‐ Impossible!

00:18:15.863 --> 00:18:18.232
The same technique
that monk used back then!

00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:19.733
Where did the brat learn that?!

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.301

‐ [sighs]

00:18:31.545 --> 00:18:32.446
We did it.

00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:35.716
‐ Brother...

00:18:35.749 --> 00:18:36.950
you're all right?

00:18:36.984 --> 00:18:39.386
‐ Yeah, but that
was a close one.

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:40.220
‐ Wait.

00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:43.624
Doesn't that painting
look different?

00:18:43.657 --> 00:18:46.660
‐ It appears the Full Moon
Raccoon Dog has been purified

00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:50.364
and released from the spell
Shogen Mamiana cast on him.

00:18:50.397 --> 00:18:53.834
Now he is the guardian spirit
of our clan once again.

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:56.103
It's all thanks to you,
Lady Moroha.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.605
Your mother would be very proud.

00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:00.107
‐ Thank you, Lady Moroha.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.410
The Mamidaira Clan
owes you a debt of gratitude.

00:19:03.443 --> 00:19:07.114
‐ Uh, sure.
Guess I was pretty awesome.

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:09.816
‐ Yes, you were,
and thank you for that.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.019
[laughter]

00:19:12.052 --> 00:19:13.654
‐ Good luck, Takechiyo.

00:19:13.687 --> 00:19:16.924
I know you'll be
an awesome leader for your clan.

00:19:16.957 --> 00:19:17.958
‐ What do you mean?

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.326
‐ Who said I'm doing that?
‐ Huh?

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:21.228
‐ Huh? Hang on.
Then what the heck

00:19:21.261 --> 00:19:23.330
did we just go through
all this trouble for?

00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:25.365
‐ I know, I know,
but it's way more fun

00:19:25.399 --> 00:19:27.167
working for the corpse dealer,
I decided.

00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:29.303
‐ Yeah, okay, but even
if that were true...

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.306
‐ Kikunosuke,
you can lead the clan!

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.241
‐ B‐But you're
the rightful heir!

00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:35.475
‐ [laughs]

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:36.443
I've realized this castle

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:38.879
is too small
for someone of my caliber,

00:19:38.912 --> 00:19:41.682
so I'm gonna keep on
collecting my bounties

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:43.917
as I reach for a higher dream!

00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:46.153
‐ Well said!
Just what I'd expect

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.922
from someone who chose me
to be his bodyguard.

00:19:48.956 --> 00:19:49.923
‐ [grumbles]

00:19:49.957 --> 00:19:50.924
Yeah, you know what?

00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.926
Let's take care of that
right now.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.828
Now we're square.

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:57.731
That's your reward
of one ryou in gold dust.

00:19:57.764 --> 00:19:59.032
It's what you needed

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:01.768
to pay off your whole debt
to Mr. Jyubei, isn't it?

00:20:01.802 --> 00:20:03.337
‐ Keep it.
‐ [gasps]

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.172
Uh, Moroha?

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.607
‐ Hey, listen,
I have no intention

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.009
of quitting the bounty‐hunting
business, either.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.778
And a little debt just makes
life exciting, so come on.

00:20:11.812 --> 00:20:14.715
Let's go back to giving
that corpse dealer a hard time!

00:20:14.748 --> 00:20:16.049
What do you say, huh?

00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:19.620
‐ Huh? But I could never
take back this money I owed you.

00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:20.621
That wouldn't be right.

00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:23.023
‐ Well, then, give it away.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.558
‐ [gasps] Yeah!

00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:26.226
You take it, Kikunosuke.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.928
You can use it as a refund

00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:30.931
for everybody
who had their taxes stolen.

00:20:30.964 --> 00:20:32.933
‐ It isn't much, though.

00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:35.903
‐ Thanks, Brother, Lady Moroha.

00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:38.338
‐ Well, let's go, Takechiyo!

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.708
‐ Okay! Aye, aye, cap'n!

00:20:41.742 --> 00:20:43.677
BOTH: Thank you for everything!

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:47.514
‐ Ah, that's all right.

00:20:47.548 --> 00:20:49.616
Take care! Bye now!

00:20:56.757 --> 00:20:58.692
‐ [birds chirping]
‐ [sighs]

00:21:04.064 --> 00:21:06.166
[stairs creaking]

00:21:09.536 --> 00:21:10.604
[sighs]

00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:13.340
‐ Oh, good morning.
‐ Hmm?

00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:16.009
‐ That right there's
the demon you warned us about,

00:21:16.043 --> 00:21:18.078
or what's left of him.

00:21:20.147 --> 00:21:22.983
‐ I'm sorry, sir,
for causing so much trouble.

00:21:23.016 --> 00:21:25.252
‐ Don't worry.
The locals were grateful.

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.321
All right, everyone, let's go.

00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:30.324
Setsuna will protect us
on the road for a while.

00:21:31.658 --> 00:21:33.527
You'll do that, right?

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.761
‐ Yes, sir.

00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:36.830
Of course I will.

00:21:36.864 --> 00:21:39.299
[water flowing]

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:43.270
‐ [screams]

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.275
[music playing]

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:49.643
[gasps]

00:21:49.676 --> 00:21:51.645
You'll pay for this.

00:21:51.678 --> 00:21:53.480
‐ Delicious. Delicious!

00:21:53.514 --> 00:21:57.518
Such exquisite sorrow!
Such delectable suffering!

00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:00.921
‐ Bring out your hatred.
Let it flow, Towa.

00:22:00.954 --> 00:22:02.923
‐ I'll never forgive you.

00:22:02.956 --> 00:22:06.326
You'll pay for this,
both of you!

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.495
I'll kill you!

00:22:10.564 --> 00:22:12.666
[singing in Japanese]

00:23:40.521 --> 00:23:42.089
[music playing]

00:23:42.122 --> 00:23:43.690
TOWA: <i>The Mini Galaxy,</i>

00:23:43.724 --> 00:23:45.058
<i>the eternity bug,</i>

00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:47.060
the grief‐filled Silver Pearl,

00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:48.896
<i>Zero's true motive,</i>

00:23:48.929 --> 00:23:50.931
<i>the scent of lavender...</i>

00:23:50.964 --> 00:23:54.101
<i>and finally,</i>
<i>a place where I belong.</i>

00:23:54.134 --> 00:23:58.472
I was told that the name Towa
means "eternity," but why‐‐

00:23:58.505 --> 00:24:01.074
<i>why did my mother</i>
<i>give me that name?</i>

00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:05.712
<i>Next time on</i> Yashahime:
<i>"A Place (Not) for Towa."</i>

00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:08.248
<i>I'll never cry. Never!</i>
