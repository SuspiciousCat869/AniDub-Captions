00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:21,888
That's ridiculous! Why would
we need to go back there?

151
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:24,888
You're living in the dark ages.
What do you think they make
phones for?

152
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:28,588
Uh! I hate telephones,
Ireally don't trust them!

153
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,488
And why is that?!

154
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:34,688
Uhh!
Nyaa! Nyaa!
Nyaaaahhhh!!!

155
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:38,721
Meow! Meww!

156
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:39,788
Neko?

157
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:41,221
What was that about?

158
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,521
[ringing]

159
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:48,119
<i>[Kukuri]</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

160
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,759
Hi. It's me, Yashiro.
We're here to buy the
fireworks, but, uh...

161
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:55,592
<i>Yashiro? Do I know you?</i>

162
00:11:55,625 --> 00:12:01,225
Hm? What are you talking about?
It's me, Yashiro Isana.
You know, Shiro!

163
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:05,825
<i>Shiro? I'm sorry, I don't</i>
<i>know any 'Shiro'. I think</i>
<i>you have the wrong number.</i>

164
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:06,892
[click]

165
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,992
Here. Give me the phone.

166
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:15,892
What did she
just say to you?

167
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:19,725
Apparently, she
didn't recognize me.

168
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,559
Told me she doesn't
know any Yashiro Isana.

169
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,992
Was she just joking
around with you?

170
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,992
She sure didn't sound
like she was joking.

171
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:32,859
Neko was acting strangely.

172
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:35,892
I wonder if she might have
done something to Kukuri.

173
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:38,725
I'll investigate. Let's
head back to the school.

174
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,392
Hey, Kuroh.

175
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:47,425
Do you mind if I borrow your
phone for one more call?

176
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:49,392
Who is it you need to reach?

177
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,759
<i>I'm gonna call my</i>
<i>parents' house.</i>

178
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:53,359
<i>Why?</i>

179
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,592
<i>To be sure. To find out if</i>
<i>I'm definitely Yashiro Isana.</i>

180
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,425
I want them to say it.

181
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,344
Hello? This is Yashiro--

182
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:16,478
<i>The number you have dialed is</i>
<i>not in service at this time.</i>
<i>Please check the number and</i>
<i>dial again.</i>

183
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,397
[Kusanagi]
Is everything okay?

184
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:31,982
Why do you ask?

185
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,749
[sigh]
He's stressed out.
Wonder why?

186
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,815
[Totsuka]
The dinner I have planned for
tonight is Tom Yam Goong.

187
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:55,815
<i>You're here?</i>

188
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:59,915
Well of course! This is
where I always come to
take my afternoon nap.

189
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,615
And by the way,
Thanks for what
you did.

190
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:03,882
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

191
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:06,249
It was nothing but
a stupid scuffle.

192
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:09,249
Y'know Mr. Kusanagi was
kind of upset about it.

193
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,882
He said you shouldn't
have gone after them
by yourself.

194
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:13,015
Augh.

195
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:15,582
I don't know why I became
a King in the first place.

196
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:18,282
It seems to be pretty
obvious to me.

197
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,882
You happen to be different
from other people.

198
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:25,882
Different enough to attract
every Tom, Dick, and Harry.
Why does that qualify me?

199
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,549
You act like
you don't care.

200
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:29,249
but you're a
natural-born leader.

201
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:30,949
They all look up to
you, you know?

202
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,182
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>One day...</i>

203
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:52,082
Hey don't sweat it!
It'll all work out
in the end!

204
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,949
Says the guy who
never seems to have
a care in the world.

205
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:59,049
Because I believe there's
nothin' to be afraid of.

206
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:05,749
A king is what you're
meant to be. And that
means your powers are not
meant for destruction.

207
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,215
They exist to protect.

208
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:10,882
Hunh.

209
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:12,282
I guarantee that.

210
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:15,949
So what the hell is
Tom Yang Goong?

211
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,249
Never had it before?

212
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:20,082
It's a wonderful
hot-and-sour soup!

213
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:26,015
It's bright-red and appears
to be really spicy, but when
you taste it, it has
unexpectedly complex flavors!

214
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,215
It's red?

215
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:29,149
It sure is red!

216
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:31,882
Whaddya think?
You want to come
help me make it?

217
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,215
You really know
how to cook?

218
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:37,515
Oh yeah. I'm really
into cooking right now.

219
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:45,549
When I tried calling my parents'
home, I got a recorded message,

220
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:47,282
saying the number
wasn't in service.

221
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,049
I was sure I'd dialed the
number right, but I had to
consider the possibilities.

222
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:56,282
Number one, in spite
of my certainty, I had
mis-dialed the number.

223
00:15:56,682 --> 00:16:00,915
Number two, something happened
at home that worried my folks
and made them change the number.

224
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:05,049
Number three, I've been lying
about this whole thing.

225
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:09,682
It seems to me you've
forgotten about the
possibility of a
fourth explanation;

226
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,582
That there's something
wrong with your memory.

227
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:12,582
Huh?

228
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:15,315
I don't get it.
I'm Yashiro Isana.

229
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:19,215
I'm an ordinary guy
from an ordinary,
middle-class family.

230
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:21,382
<i>I'm not that</i>
<i>adventurous.</i>

231
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:24,182
<i>I happen to be living</i>
<i>away from home to</i>
<i>attend high-school.</i>

232
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,182
[Yashiro]
I wonder where Neko went?

233
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:32,749
[laughing]

234
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:35,549
Wow! You really suck
at this, Tatara!

235
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:40,082
You did it all wrong!
The first thing you have
to do is go 'bam', and
after that, you flip it!

236
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:44,582
Uhh, that probably makes
sense to you, but I have
no idea what you said.

237
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:45,915
Give me that board.

238
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:48,682
Whoooa!

239
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:51,015
What are you idiots doing?!
Stop that right now!

240
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:53,115
<i>Go ride that</i>
<i>skateboard outside!</i>

241
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:54,982
Eegh.

242
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,815
[Yata]
Here, let me show you how
to do it. You just stomp
on this end real hard.

243
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:58,882
I gotta tell ya.

244
00:16:58,915 --> 00:16:59,849
Hm?

245

<i>[Mikoto]</i>
<i>That guy's a strange dude.</i>

246

You sure got that
right. Jeez.

247
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,649
The kid can't fight, but he
seems perfectly comfortable
hanging around with a bunch of
guys who do nothing but fight.

248
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,682
You know what he
reminds me of?
A wild animal trainer.

249
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:16,815
Wait a minute,
I heard something.
Did you just laugh?

250
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:19,915
[falling down]

251
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:20,782
[chuckles from kids]
You suck even worse
than I thought!

252
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:23,649
So what?! You're not
good at everything!

253
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:25,049
You're crappy at
playing Sevens!

254
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:25,982
What?!

255
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,382
You've got a lot of nerve,
putting me down like that!

256
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:32,049
Especially coming from a
guy who's into old-dude
hobbies like bonsai!

257
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:35,149
The truth is, I enjoy trying
lots of different hobbies.

258
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:36,815
Oh! That reminds me.

259
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:40,582
At a swap meet the
other day, I bought an
old-style movie camera.

260
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:43,815
What do you need that for?
Just take videos
with your phone!

261
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:45,882
I thought about that,
but it's not the same.

262
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:48,282
I've been all over town,
shooting a lot of clips.

263
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:50,049
I'll show them
to you sometime.

264

Hm?

265
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:53,015
What about your song?

266
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,849
You know, The one
you've been practicing?

267
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:58,815
Finally, a true
fan of my work!
Did you hear that?

268
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:04,282
Here's a young lady whose
heart has been captivated
by one of my varied
interests! I'm validated!

269
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,049
Tone it down a little,
would ya!

So, this is
where you live?

273
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:46,715
Well, it was
supposed to be here.

274
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:49,282
Straight down the road
after we left the station.

275
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:52,282
It was a small house
with a nice-sized yard.

276
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:57,282
I have to say...

277
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:01,682
From all the evidence,
it appears you're not
who you think you are.

278
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:06,749
I'm beginning to
think you're right.
I may not be
Yashiro Isana at all.

279
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:13,715
The truth is the boy you know
as Yashiro Isana may never
have existed to begin with.

280
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:15,115
Perhaps.

281
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:19,082
I've had a feeling
something wasn't right
for a while, now.

When I tried to remember
details of my background,
nothing came through clearly.

00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,749
So then, who are you?

284
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:29,282
Well, that's the
problem, isn't it?

285
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:33,115
At this point, I can't say
with absolute certainty
that I'm not a murderer.

286
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:37,782
As of now, I'm not sure
what I can believe anymore.

287
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,515
So what do you think?
You gonna kill me now?

297
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:28,782
<i>Hey, don't... sweat it.</i>

298
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:33,015
It'll all work out in the end.

299
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:37,882
Sorry.

300
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,649
<i>Tatara?</i>

301
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:46,682
Don't leave us...

302
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,515
What happened?
You can't be gone!

303
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,749
The doctor'll fix you!
Hang on!

304
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:03,049
Sorry to bother you, Mikoto.

305
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:07,082
I have some bad news.

306
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,847
<i>So what do we do now, Tatara?</i>

307
00:21:13,245 --> 00:21:16,778
<i>You were always so</i>
<i>irresponsible, then</i>
<i>you go and die on us.</i>
<i>Damn fool.</i>

308
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,196
<i>[Ichigen Miwa] [recording]</i>
<i>The final curtain</i>
<i>Falls at the very moment</i>
<i>A person gives up.</i>

309
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:44,063
Such wise and wonderful words.

310
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:48,096
Kuroh. Were you listening
to what I just said?

311
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:51,130
You mean about how you
can't believe your own
story anymore?

312
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,396
Interesting you
should say that.

313
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,663
I haven't believed what
you've been telling me,
from the beginning.

314
00:21:57,696 --> 00:22:01,896
I was wondering how you'd
react to the truth, when the
veil was finally lifted.

315
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:04,063
I only believe
in one thing.

316
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,263
<i>My late master's words.</i>

317
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:10,030
<i>Master Ichigen said to be</i>
<i>certain before taking action.</i>

318
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:12,963
<i>I'm still in the process of</i>
<i>discovering that truth.</i>

319
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:17,130
<i>I have no intention of</i>
<i>rushing to judgment before</i>
<i>all the facts are before me.</i>

320
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:20,930
Do you feel the
same way, Shiro?

321
00:22:23,396 --> 00:22:25,363
Don't give up yet. Right?

322
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:27,896
That makes sense.

323
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,463
There's a lot of truth
in what he said.

324
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,963
I'm glad to hear
you feel that way.

325
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:36,596
In that case, I think you ought
to repeat his words out loud.

326
00:22:38,163 --> 00:22:40,396
<i>Trust me on this.</i>

327
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,963
[uncomfortable giggle]
<i>Repeating Master Ichigen's</i>
<i>blessed words will ultimately</i>
<i>cleanse your soul.</i>

328
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,296
Creepy.

329
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:24,441
Lovely, calorie, hungry!!
Meeoooow!

330
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:26,174
<i>It's me, Neko!</i>

331
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:30,407
<i>I'm hungry as usual, but now</i>
<i>we're all in big trouble!</i>

332
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:33,807
Lots of Blue people stormed in,
and then things went 'Flash'!

333
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:37,107
<i>So I ended up meowing, and</i>
<i>the boob lady went 'Kaboom'!</i>

334
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:41,474
<i>After that, the boss with</i>
<i>the glasses got all crazy</i>
<i>and tried to wipe out Kuroh!</i>

335
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:44,707
<i>Well, the last part I'm okay</i>
<i>with since he deserved it.</i>

336
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:47,807
But that's when Shiro came out,
and then he went all blam!

337
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:51,641
<i>then it got all glittery,</i>
<i>and from the sky came this:</i>

338
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:54,374
<i>Rrrrrring! rrrringggg!</i>

339
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:58,374
<i>And then it went, nyrrrr!</i>
<i>And then, wuuu-uu-uu!</i>

340
00:24:58,407 --> 00:25:00,841
<i>and then, pew pew pew pew pew!</i>
<i>Whuuuuu!</i>

341
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,274
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Hold it! You're not</i>
<i>making any sense!</i>

342
00:25:03,307 --> 00:25:06,707
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>Hehee! That's okay.</i>
<i>It doesn't need to</i>
<i>make sense!</i>

343
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:10,174
<i>Because Shiro will</i>
<i>always be my Shiro!</i>

344
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:13,841
<i>Next time on 'K':</i>
<i>Episode 7,</i>
<i>'Key'!</i>

345
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:17,807
<i>[gasp] Shiro, you</i>
<i>are my Shiro, right?</i>
