1
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:41,966
C'mon, Is that the
best you've got?

2
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:44,166
<i>I hope you're not</i>
<i>going soft on me.</i>

3
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:46,499
It's because I don't
have my glasses on.

4
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:49,999
<i>Heh. You don't seem</i>
<i>to have your heart</i>
<i>in it, either.</i>

5
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:51,899
I'm quite committed,
I assure you.

6
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:54,799
For you are the Red King
and deserve a worthy opponent.

7
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:56,932
Ehh.

8
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:02,466
Why do you always have to speak
to me in that overly formal
tone, like you're delivering
some commencement address?

9
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:04,866
Please, will y'just
cut the shit already.

10
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,866
I have an official
authority to maintain.

11
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:12,866
It is my duty as head of
SCEPTER Four and also as
one of the Seven Kings,

12
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:16,499
to detach myself from you,
and defeat you.

13
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:19,832
Personally, all I really
want to do is help you.

14
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:21,199
Hmm.

15
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,832
You're so full of it!

16
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,932
Uaagh!

17
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,866
Agh. Mikoto.

18
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,466
Looks like your
boss found himself
some trouble.

19
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:57,866
It's too late.
He's over-extended.

20
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:59,832
You bastard!

21
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,499
Rgh!

22
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,732
Gimme that!

23
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:10,866
This sucks!

24
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:11,899
[gasp]

25
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:16,266
OMIT

26
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,932
Mikoto. Take it easy or
you'll scare those kids.

27
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:20,932
[chuckle]

28
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:21,932
Hm.

29
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,899
Hey! Who you callin' scared?!

30
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:40,966
Instead of just sitting
around there wasting time,
Why don't you kids come
and join up with us?

31
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,799
We'll give you plenty of
opportunities to blow off
steam. What do you say?

32
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:48,499
Hm.

33
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:53,199
Don't you care anymore?
Have you forgotten everything?

34
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,032
You looked up to him
as your King, once!

35
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,999
I know you must still have
some respect for him!

36
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:01,199
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Haven't you both</i>
<i>had enough already?</i>

37
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,799
From what I've observed,
you're the only ones
still out here fighting.

38
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:12,569
<i>[Rikio]</i>
<i>C'mon, Yata, let's get</i>
<i>out of here. Everyone</i>
<i>else has been evacuated.</i>

39
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:17,536
<i>[Yata]</i>
<i>That's not true! Mikoto hasn't</i>
<i>left. And he'll never leave!</i>
<i>He'll never give up!</i>

40
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:19,236
Hrmm.

41
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,236
Put me down! Hey!
Y'listening to me??
Put me down and
leave me alone.

42
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,203
<i>Believe me, it wasn't</i>
<i>my idea to do this.</i>

43
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:33,169
<i>But my King is</i>
<i>compassionate.</i>

44
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:35,869
<i>Despite the fact that you</i>
<i>turned away from him,</i>

45
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,569
<i>he isn't letting your</i>
<i>petty betrayal bother him.</i>

46
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:39,569
<i>[Yata]</i>
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>
<i>Just let me go!</i>

47
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:41,869
I didn't betray him, I left.

48
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:43,969
Good work, Kuroh.

49
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:48,136
Well, as you can hear,
they aren't happy about it.

50
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,003
We took care of things
on our end as well.

51
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,503
The credit
belongs to Neko.

52
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:56,269
Now then,
let's go finish this,
once and for all.

53
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,269
Let's save Kukuri.

54
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:03,169
No second thoughts?
You're sure your
plan is solid, that
it's going to work?

55
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:08,536
Well, I'm hoping you'll
somehow be able to pull it
off without any hitches.

56
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:12,269
You've regained your
memory of being a King.

57
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:16,169
But it appears you're
just as irresponsible
as when you thought you
were a mere student.

58
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:20,669
<i>You need to act with the</i>
<i>self-assured poise and</i>
<i>maturity that befits a King.</i>

59
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,536
Prepare to be disappointed.
I don't think I'll ever be
your ideal King.

60
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,536
[exasperated sigh]

61
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,136
Huh?!

62
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:32,269
Kuroh! What are you doing?
Why are you bowing to me?
C'mon, get up!

63
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:35,103
I must ask you to be quiet.

64
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:38,203
Let me do this.

65
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:42,669
May I be permitted
to serve a new King,
Master Ichigen?

66
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:46,269
[pleased]
Mmm.

67
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:56,769
I, Kuroh Yatogami, do solemnly
swear to devote my life to
serve Adolph K. Weismann,
the First and Silver King.

68
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:59,136
I shall be his
loyal clansman.

69
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:03,636
Hey, lighten up.
This isn't necessary.

70
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,736
You and I are friends,
and I know I can count
on you to have my back.

71
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,236
C'mon, let's go.

72
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:32,703
[sinister]
He he he. Looks like
the first to weaken
is the Blue King.

73
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:33,903
That's surprising.

74
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:35,769
[bubbly]
I could devour him now
in his weakened state.

75
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:40,169
[sinister]
But then I might get myself
killed by the Red King and that
wouldn't be very much fun.

76
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:45,069
[calm]
It'd be smarter to wait until
the Red King wears him
self down,
and then I'll engulf him.

77
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:47,703
[sinister]
I can take my time with
the Blue King after that.

78
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:53,703
Once I get the power of two
Kings, consuming the others
will be a piece of cake!

79
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:59,636
And then, after I have
the strength of seven Kings,
I will be all-powerful! Yes!!

80
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:06,636
Who needs seven Kings anyway?!
That's what I say!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

81
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,236
One and only one is
more than enough!

82
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:13,136
[faints]

83
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:17,069
I'll be King...
by myself!
I'll rule the world!

84
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:20,236
[Kukuri's natural voice]
Help me please! Someone!

85
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:23,169
[Yashiro]
Hey you, in Kukuri's body,
stop making those nasty faces.

86
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:24,203
Rrr!

87
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:31,203
Shiro!

88
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:34,503
Heh!

89
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,269
Nobody's left.
We've evacuated everyone
from the island.

90
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,669
[Kuroh]
Anyone you could easily
possess is gone.

91
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:49,636
The few of us that are here,
are too resilient for you.

92
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:08,703
Hagh!

93
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:13,169
Kuroh! Don't hurt Kukuri!

94
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:14,769
Uh?

95
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:15,803
Kuroh!

96
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,703
<i>My late Master</i>
<i>Ichigen's sword.</i>
<i>'Kotowari'.</i>

97
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:21,703
This is only the second
time I've drawn it.

98
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:24,069
Do you understand the
significance of that?

99
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:27,269
<i>It has been confirmed that</i>
<i>you are an evil King.</i>

100
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:32,103
<i>So in accordance with</i>
<i>Master Ichigen's last words,</i>
<i>I intend to slay you.</i>

101
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:38,703
I know he would never
allow an evil being like
you to succeed him as the
Seventh and last King.

102
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,036
I will make sure of that!

103
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,236
C'mon, Kuroh, it's me.
I thought I was your
good friend.

104
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:46,936
You don't want to kill me.
It wouldn't be right.

105
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,836
You'd feel terrible!

106
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,236
Na ha ha ha ha!
Slay me, you say?!

107
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:53,136
Go ahead, I dare you!

108
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,836
No, don't listen to
him, he's kidding.
Please don't!

109
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:58,536
I'm begging you!
Please spare my life!

110
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,536
[gasp]
Wait, don't do it!
Please! No!

111
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,036
Shiro, help me!

112
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,003
Uh...

113
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,803
Kuroh, stop this now!

114
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:10,869
Eh he he he he.

115
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:16,836
Ah ha ha ha ha! You let
your guard down, Weismann.

116
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:20,169
I was going to save you
for later, but now is
as good a time as any!

117
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:21,769
Oh, damn it!

118
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,803
You coward! You're not
getting away this time!

119
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,903
Gotcha, big mouth.

120
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:39,069
You wouldn't know this,
but the real Kukuri
doesn't remember my name.

121
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:41,869
We set the trap and
you took the bait.

122
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:44,103
What?!

123
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,936
Hey! Let go!

124
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,869
Just stop it! You can't do
this to me, understand!

125
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:04,869
Help me, help me,
please help, somebody!

126
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,603
Oh, Shiro, won't
you please help me?

127
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:10,536
You'll regret this, believe me!
I'm going to murder you!

128
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:12,503
I pity you.

129
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:19,903
<i>You've consumed so many</i>
<i>different personalities, your</i>
<i>sense of self is beginning to</i>
<i>disintegrate, bit by bit.</i>

130
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,903
And sadly, you no longer
know for sure which one of
them is your true self.

131
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:30,069
I know who I am!
I'm the Seventh King!

132
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,569
Ich bin der erste koenig.

133
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,203
Das aelteste Koenig,

134
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:36,569
...mein Jung.

135
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,969
Eegh!
YAAGH!

136
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,469
[relieved sigh]

137
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:59,936
Well, we had a fifty-fifty
chance of success!
But it worked out alright!

138
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:02,069
Not what I'd call a
perfectly solid plan.

139
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,469
You could have
mentioned that.

140
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,836
You always take big
risks with everything,
no matter what it is.

141
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:10,069
All right, I get
it, you're upset.
You can lecture me later.

142
00:10:10,103 --> 00:10:13,103
But right now, you need to
take Kukuri to a safe place.

143
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:14,203
What about you?

144
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,269
Are you totally insane?!

145
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:25,869
If you interrupt a battle
between two Kings, even you
won't emerge unscathed!

146
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:29,236
No big deal.
Don't forget,
I'm the Immortal King.

147
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:30,869
Now, you'd better get going.

148
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,603
I'm not leaving.

149
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:34,003
King's orders.

150
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:35,203
Huh?!

151
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:41,603
Anybody who is not a King
will only get in the way
from here on out.

152
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:43,636
[sigh]

153
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:45,003
Egh.

154
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:49,603
I'm sorry, Kuroh.

155
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:52,569
Look after Kukuri.
And keep Neko safe as well.

156
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:54,269
Rrrgh!

157
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:57,236
[struggling]

158
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,503
Will you just hold still?

159
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:05,603
I'm not sure how long
I can retain you, but I
guess we'll soon find out.

160
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:09,503
I won't underestimate your
powers, Colorless King.

161
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:14,603
You know, Lieutenant Kokujoji,

162
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:19,236
I honestly believed that
my research project had
the potential to make
everyone happy.

163
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:24,703
However, now I'm beginning
to see that the energy
force I discovered has
only brought loneliness.

164
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:29,736
Each King sees himself above the
Clansmen who are devoted to him,

165
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:33,169
and each has set himself
on a course divergent
from one another.

166
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:37,803
As I did on that day, long ago,
when I parted from you.

167
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,536
I wonder if there is any chance
for these men to move forward
and resolve their differences.

168
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:48,936
Can they co-exist?

169
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:57,703
Heh.

170
00:11:58,636 --> 00:11:59,969
Hmph!

171
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,655
Nobody knows anything.

172
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,655
Chiho!...

173
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:13,655
Huh?

174
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:14,689
Kukuri's still missing!

175
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:16,589
We've looked everywhere
that we're allowed to go!

176
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:18,524
Who was the last person
you saw her with?

177
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:19,557
Let me think...

178
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:24,924
Oh, I'm pretty sure it
was that boy from earlier.
The one who led us out.
Remember him?

179
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:26,890
Yeah! You're right!

180
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:28,857
But I never got his name.

181
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:33,957
If she's with him I
have this feeling she's
gonna be all right.

182
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:35,924
Yeah, me too.

183
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:42,990
Even though we didn't find
out who he is, he must be
a really good person.
He saved all of us, didn't he?

184
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,124
[Yata]
I still don't understand
why the hell you did that!

185
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,624
<i>[Rikio]</i>
<i>I told you why!</i>

186
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:53,890
<i>[Izumo]</i>
<i>Oh, great. The skateboarding</i>
<i>genius is back.</i>

187
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:55,824
I was just trying to help!

188
00:12:55,857 --> 00:13:00,890
"Help", fuck you! This is
just bullshit! I want to
know why everybody had to
be pulled out of there!

189
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:03,357
You know you've just
abandoned our King!

190
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,457
Dagh! Agh!

191
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,124
What was that
for hah?!

192
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:10,590
[Izumo]
Calm down! We're under
our King's orders.

193
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,490
<i>This is how he wants it.</i>
<i>So be patient, like the</i>
<i>others.</i>

194
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:16,357
<i>You should be ashamed</i>
<i>of yourself. Man up!</i>

195
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,024
Wasn't sure if you'd
rejoined your old gang.

196
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,857
It might have looked
that way for a moment.

197
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:38,957
<i>[Seri]</i>
<i>Four Kings haven't come</i>
<i>together at any time since</i>
<i>the Kagutsu Crater incident.</i>

198
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:44,057
[Fushimi]
Do you think a massive disaster
like that can happen again now?

199
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,624
The Captain will do whatever
it takes to prevent that.

200
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:49,557
I doubt he'd
sacrifice himself!

201
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,624
Let me remind you that the
man you're referring to is
a compassionate individual.

202
00:13:57,657 --> 00:14:01,190
He gave you an important
position with us,
despite your past
ties with HOMRA.

203
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,157
Don't ever forget that.

204
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:08,024
I'm suspicious of
compassionate people,
especially if they're Kings.

205
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,357
They always make you
feel beholden to them,

206
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,090
so they can call upon
you whenever they need
something done that they
feel is beneath them.

207
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:20,024
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>Heh. We're just underlings</i>
<i>to them. They'll never see</i>
<i>us as their equals.</i>

208
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,057
I hate to admit it but,

209
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,190
You may have a point. Kings
seem to keep to themselves
and only each other.

210
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,157
The guy you're
looking for is here.

211
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:45,557
I'm the one.

212
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,124
Stop! What are you doing?
They'll kill us!

213
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:50,024
Stop right now! Stop it! Stop!

214
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:51,990
Let me out!

215
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,524
Nnggh... Egh!

216
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:55,990
Hurry up!

217
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,257
Come on, do it!
Only a King can
murder a King.

218
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,990
Yeah. I'm aware of that.

219
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:06,290
Thanks for
bringing him here!

220
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:09,224
Stop, don't do it, Suoh!

221
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:12,257
Haaaaaaa!

222
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:55,957
Where am I?
What is...

223
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:58,590
Kuroh, what are
we doing here?

224
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,590
Kukuri, so you
do remember me.

225
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,024
Thank goodness.
Is everyone all right?

226
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,024
I was worried about that
cat-girl and, um...

227
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:08,057
...who else?

228
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:11,924
Huh? I can't think of who
I'm trying to remember.

229
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:17,024
It's weird.
I'm...

230
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,524
...lost.

231
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:25,957
Just rest. There's no
pressure to remember
anything for now.

232
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:27,957
[Mikoto]
Sorry for all this.
but I guess that's that.

233
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:41,157
Don't pretend to be
sorry when you didn't do
anything to prevent it.

234
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:46,024
You knew it would come
to this and did nothing
to help yourself.

235
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:49,990
This is the end.
But it didn't have to be.

236
00:17:57,057 --> 00:18:00,057
[Mikoto]
There's nothing more
to say, Munakata.

237
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:08,390

238
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,157

Give it to me!

I'm taking it to Shiro!
He's gonna want it back!

251
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:39,524
Neko, you can't.
It's impossible.
He's no longer with us.

252
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,957
Yes, he is! I'm taking this
to Shiro right now, because
he's gonna need his umbrella!

253

Listen to me! I'm sorry!
