00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,233
<i>[Weismann]</i>
<i>Hehehe ha ha ha!</i>

2
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,933
Bye-bye, now.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,133
Yaaahhh!

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,566
[gasp]

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>Who...</i>

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,900
was that?!

7
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:35,966
[Neko]
Shiro?

8
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,633
[Kuroh]
What is it, Yashiro?
Are you able to
remember anything now?

9
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,100
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>We finally made it back!</i>

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,966
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>Made it back</i>
<i>to where?</i>

11
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:26,864
I don't get it.
If I'm not from here,
what am I doing here?

12
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:31,664
We don't know the truth
about you yet, so for now
why don't we say, you're
just revisiting again.

13
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,230
But I'm not sure
returning here was such a
good idea, since the Blue
Clan has marked you.

14
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,930
It's fine!

15
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:42,164
We're happy here!
This place is our home!

16
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,964
Mm?

17
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:46,364
Yeah.

18
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:53,664
You're right Neko.

19
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,430
Maybe none of this is really
mine. And even if those
memories are totally false,

20
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:05,864
<i>The days when I was here,</i>
<i>hanging out with everyone,</i>
<i>felt amazingly real.</i>

21
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:07,697
And that's why,

22
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:09,771
<i>It's okay to say,</i>
<i>I've come back home.</i>

23
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:10,638
Hee!

24
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:14,305
It's clear to me now
that I had to return
to this place,

25
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:18,792
so I could engrave it
in my heart forever.

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,224
That much I know.

27
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:24,995
However, it's the many things
I don't know that worry me.

28
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:28,372
But, you see,

29
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,691
I have to figure
out what went wrong.

30
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:37,347
That's the only way I can
make everything right again.
From this moment on, I'm
starting over.

31
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:18,790
[Seri]
To sum it up, every squad
failed in their pursuit, due in
part to the inclement weather,

32
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,690
<i>And so far, no suspect has</i>
<i>been identified on the traffic</i>
<i>surveillance network.</i>

33
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:25,823
I see.

34
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:32,657
Not only did he manage to get
away from me, but he was also
able to outwit Fushimi, who
was heading up the pursuit.

35
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,757
His ability to remain under the
radar until now was no fluke.

36
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:42,390
At present, we are retracing
his possible escape route,

37
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:46,290
and eliminating our perimeter
around Ashinaka High School.

38
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,790
Apprehending him is
becoming a tall order.

39
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,590
This kid is extremely
difficult to pin down.

40
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:59,257
<i>And on top of that, the two</i>
<i>traveling with him have</i>
<i>proven to be quite a handful.</i>

41
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,790
<i>[knock]</i>

42
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,757
<i>Fushimi reporting,</i>
<i>Captain.</i>

43
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,457
Please, come in,
Fushimi.

44
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,690
What do you
have for us?

45
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:23,123
I regret to inform you
that a member of our
pursuit team was attacked,

46
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,723
and subsequently
transported back
to headquarters.

47
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,323
What unit was he in,
and exactly what time
was he attacked?

48
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:32,523
Chikushi was in the Third
Division, East District.

49
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:34,757
It occurred about
fifteen minutes ago.

50
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,490
The status of
his condition?

51
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,190
<i>He mostly suffered</i>
<i>minor contusions.</i>
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>his PDA was stolen.</i>

52
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,190
That could pose
a problem.

53
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,590
I'm pulling up
his assigned areas
right now.

54
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,457
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>Was the officer able to</i>
<i>identify his assailant?</i>

55
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:54,390
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>It was our old nemesis,</i>
<i>the Black Dog.</i>

56
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:57,390
<i>Officer Chikushi says he</i>
<i>didn't see the other two.</i>

57
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:02,257
I don't get it.
What connection does
Kuroh Yatogami have
to the suspect?

58
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:05,357
It makes no sense.

59
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,490
I don't think it
was an actual attack.
It was contact.

60
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:11,057
Eh?

61
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,023
[Reisi]
Fushimi.
Check the report.

62
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:18,323
Was anything left at the
scene of the incident
that might be a possible
message from these guys?

63
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,023
There was one item.

64
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,190
Now it makes sense.

65
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,823
Mm?

66
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,657
Fushimi, why don't you
come over and take a seat?

67
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,657
Ah-h...

68
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,157
Mmh.

69
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:44,223
I'm fine, right here.

70
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,557
Very well.

71
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,590
Alert the squads standing
by at headquarters that
they need to get ready
for emergency deployment.

72
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,157
[sigh]

73
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:53,723
Right!

74
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,457
[cell phone rings]

75
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,723
Uh!

76
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,523
Captain Munakata speaking.
Who is this?

77
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:41,390
Yashiro Isana.

78
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,323
<i>or so they tell me.</i>

79
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:45,090
I had a hunch you
might be calling.

80
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:49,523
I'm wondering why you
orchestrated such an
aggressive maneuver
to make contact.

81
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,057
<i>I apologize for that.</i>
<i>But I couldn't think of any</i>
<i>other way to talk to you</i>
<i>without getting caught.</i>

82
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:56,657
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>Mm.</i>

83
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,723
<i>We'll let that go</i>
<i>for the moment.</i>

84
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:00,290
<i>Now let's hear what</i>
<i>you have to say.</i>

85
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:03,457
I'm going to make this
short because I'm not fond
of talking on the phone.

86
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:05,823
There's an airship
flying over this city.

87
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:10,223
<i>The man commanding that</i>
<i>craft is somehow involved</i>
<i>in your murder case.</i>

88
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:15,190
That's all I know, other than
the fact that I'm the only
suspect you're pursuing so far.

89
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,323
Do you understand
the implications of
such an allegation?

90
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:21,757
You might want
to reconsider.

91
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,623
<i>Excuse me?</i>

92
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:27,057
Exactly what do you know about
the man in the airship whom
you're trying to incriminate?

93
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:29,823
<i>Only what I've learned from</i>
<i>a recent crash course.</i>

94
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,290
Then you should realize he's
not to be taken lightly;

95
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:37,490
that he's much too important
to be dragged into this
investigation just because
you're claiming to be innocent.

96
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:39,423
Awashima here.
I think now would be an
excellent time for you

97
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:42,423
Fushimi will be heading
to the Tokyo Expressway.
to demonstrate your goodwill
By turning yourself in.

98
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:43,790
Give him backup.
How about it?

99
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,090
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>Pleading my innocence</i>
<i>from a jail cell would</i>
<i>be a waste of time.</i>

100
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:49,790
<i>I've seen enough cop shows</i>
<i>to know how that works.</i>

101
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:55,257
<i>However, I might be willing</i>
<i>to t</i>
urn myself in, if we
<i>can cut the right deal.</i>

102
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:59,690
Well now. That is a shrewd
suggestion, and I must say
I'm quite impressed.

103
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:01,123
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>Why, thank you.</i>

104
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,590
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>As for our deal...</i>

105
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:08,390
<i>if you promise to bring</i>
<i>that man in the airship</i>
<i>to the ground so I can</i>
<i>ask him some questions,</i>

106
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:13,423
<i>I in turn promise to</i>
<i>surrender myself to you.</i>
<i>How does that sound?</i>

107
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:21,390
I'd like to be able to say
yes, since your willingness
seems genuine.

108
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:25,323
<i>But I'm afraid in this</i>
<i>case, you really don't</i>
<i>have any negotiating power</i>

109
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,523
<i>when it comes to involving</i>
<i>the man in the airship.</i>

110
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,857
<i>Besides, should you end</i>
<i>up turning yourself in,</i>

111
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,490
<i>I can't help but suspect</i>
<i>that your two friends will</i>
<i>come to bail you out,</i>

112
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:36,723
<i>probably in a</i>
<i>non-traditional way.</i>

113
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:41,823
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>Ha ha! Yeah, you're</i>
<i>right about that.</i>
<i>Guess I got carried away.</i>

114
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,790
Indeed. But on second thought,
I accept your terms.

115
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,157
Huh!?

116
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:51,438
I'm declaring that I,
Reisi Munakata,
the Fourth and Blue King,

117
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:54,405
will detain the man
from the airship as
requested by you.

118
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:57,517
This person is also known
as Adolph K. Weismann.

119
00:09:57,551 --> 00:10:01,417
You may not know this,
but he is the First
and Silver King.

120
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:02,484
Uh!

121
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:05,451
If you're still up for it,
come visit us.

122
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,017
We'll sit down
together and talk.

123
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:09,884
However, there's a prerequisite
that first must be met.

124
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:14,584
Understand, I shall require
that all three of you
jointly turn yourselves in.

125
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:23,584
Mister Fushimi.
What if he's
still with his
two companions?

126
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:25,617
Do you think we'll
be able to handle
the three of them?

127
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,817
Lieutenant Awashima
says the tall one can
match her strength.

128
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:32,917
...and that other one
is a Strain than can
manipulate perception.

129
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:34,084
Tch.

130
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:36,407
That's why all of you are here.

131
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:42,307
That might be true, but the word
is that Yashiro Isana possesses
no special power himself.

132
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:46,641
<i>If we find him, his two</i>
<i>associates will most</i>
<i>definitely come to help.</i>

133
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:49,341
<i>I want the three of you</i>
<i>to only go after him.</i>

134
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,674
You idiots are in my way!

135
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:56,174
I have a delivery to make!
Let me through right now!
I'm in a hurry!

136
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:05,541
He's close by.

137
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:07,707
Okay, move out!

138
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:14,207
[fear grunts]
Uh? Eh?!

139
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:21,874
Huh?

140
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:32,207
I don't know anything!
I'm just driving a load of
merchandise to a warehouse
like I always do.

141
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:39,607
Egh. What a lousy trick!

142
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,841
Phew! That was
a close call.

143
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:57,607
Who's the shrewd one now?
Sending guys out to nab us
while I was still on the
phone talking to him.

144
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,441
We could have been
arrested before I hung up.

145
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:02,774
Good thing you sensed
him coming, Kuroh.

146
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:05,607
That didn't take much effort.

147
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:10,274
That guy is unusually
spiteful for someone
with the Blue Clansmen.

148
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:12,574
I could sense him
coming a mile away.

149
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,641
Wow! That's pretty
darn impressive.

150
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:19,774
Now then. Once we get some
distance from this guy, let's
move on to our next location.

151
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,407
Neko, I'm counting on you
to guide us from this
point onward, alright?

152
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,907
Okay, got it!
But tell me, Shiro,

153
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:32,474
<i>What was that thing you</i>
<i>set in the back of the</i>
<i>truck? It looked awesome!</i>
<i>Is it going to explode?</i>

154
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,141
No, no, it's nothing like that.

155
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,807
<i>It was just a couple of</i>
<i>plastic covers with some</i>
<i>computer hardware taped</i>
<i>to the back of them.</i>

156
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:45,874
<i>I did it to make them think I</i>
<i>was still in the back of that</i>
<i>truck, without being there.</i>
<i>It'll buy us some time.</i>

157
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,474
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Well, now I'm impressed.</i>
<i>Nice piece of work.</i>

158
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:56,056
Hurry up! Get a move on!

159
00:12:57,456 --> 00:12:59,023
<i>Look sharp!</i>
<i>We're here to</i>
<i>take control!</i>

160
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,323
<i>The off-duty squads</i>
<i>are at parking lot four!</i>

161
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,456
[PA Announcer]
Calling for immediate dispatch!
Repeat, immediate dispatch!

162
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,723
<i>Divisions One through Five</i>
<i>will stand by for orders to</i>
<i>commandeer the Himmelreich,</i>

163
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:16,656
<i>and take custody of the</i>
<i>First and Silver King,</i>
<i>Adolph K. Weismann.</i>

164
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:29,723
<i>[Andy]</i>
<i>Full alert and deployment</i>
<i>of half the troops.</i>

165
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:33,656
This is a large scale
operation. I think
it's the biggest one
we've ever had.

166
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,656
I haven't seen this many
choppers since the Kagutsu
Crater incident, when they
deployed the whole fleet.

167
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:40,923
Hey don't
bring that up
right now.

168
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:42,984
Try to stay focused.

169
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:50,251
The third request was
sent at seventeen
hundred hours,

170
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:55,117
However, we still have not
received any response or
acknowledgement from the
First and Silver King.

171
00:13:56,051 --> 00:14:00,851
We have completed the
requisite procedure.
Now we'll take the first
steps to detain him.

172
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,017
I understand, Captain.

173
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,217
However,

174
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:11,851
according to Protocol 120,
we do not possess the authority
to conduct an investigation
on the Himmelreich,

175
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,217
<i>because it is currently in</i>
<i>the First King's domain.</i>

176
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:20,217
<i>I think we should obtain</i>
<i>permission from the Second</i>
<i>and Gold King before we</i>
<i>proceed in this endeavor.</i>

177
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:23,984
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>His Excellency would never</i>
<i>allow us to even come</i>
<i>close to</i>
the First King,

178
00:14:24,017 --> 00:14:25,817
<i>regardless of</i>
<i>our reasons.</i>

179
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:31,617
And because of that we'll do
everything we possibly can until
he finds out and stops us.

180
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:35,684
I will personally explain
the situation afterwards,
so you don't have to worry.

181
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:36,751
Mh!

182
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:39,117
Ahem!

183
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:44,984
Very well. But then can you
please tell me why you're
rushing after this King on
behalf of Yashiro Isana?

184
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:52,717
I suppose I can.

185
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:58,817
Understand, this is not an
impulsive action that I have
felt compelled to take because
of Yashiro Isana's demands.

186
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:03,851
<i>It is true that I decided</i>
<i>to proceed because he was</i>
<i>so insistent that I do so.</i>

187
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:08,751
<i>However, I had been</i>
<i>keeping an eye on the</i>
<i>Silver King's suspicious</i>
<i>behavior for some time.</i>

188
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:13,184
When you say 'suspicious
behavior', are you
linking him to the recent
batch of incidents?

189
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:18,617
Isn't the Silver King just a
myth? Some guy who floats
around the sky in an airship?

190
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,784
And even if he does exist,
how then can he possibly be
related to our case?

191
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:27,717
He's living in the sky
and everything that's
happened has happened
down here on earth.

192
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:33,551
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>Let me explain the chronology</i>
<i>that I've been following.</i>

193
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:34,484
Tch.

194
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:38,084
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>For the past</i>
<i>several decades,</i>

195
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:42,584
<i>the Himmelreich has cruised</i>
<i>through the sky in very</i>
<i>specific and curiously</i>
<i>repetitive flight patterns.</i>

196
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:48,217
Except for deviations
attributable to occasional
inclement weather,

197
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:54,584
<i>These are the fifteen flight</i>
<i>patterns that it has followed.</i>
<i>If we correlate these patterns</i>
<i>with the weather conditions,</i>

198
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:57,517
<i>it always appears to fly</i>
<i>along the optimal course.</i>

199
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:01,851
Currently, its route is
zig-zagging and weaving
around like this.

200
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:04,717
I just recently
noticed the variance.

201
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:08,517
So I have no way of telling
precisely when the change
might have taken place.

202
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,217
Also, due to the importance
of who I was dealing with,

203
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:16,817
I communicated with the Air
Traffic Control Division at
Ukita Airport to initiate a
follow-up investigation.

204
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:20,217
They had tracked it and
discovered that the airship
changed from its usual routes

205
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,617
immediately after a
certain incident occurred.

206
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:25,117
Routes it had maintained
consistently for decades.

207
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:30,917
I asked what would have
caused this abrupt change.
None of the air-traffic
controllers had an answer.

208
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:33,484
So naturally I
became suspicious.

209
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:39,184
And just last night,
the airship hovered
above the stadium.

210
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:39,984
Eh?

211
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,451
[upset trembling]

212
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:47,517
You're suggesting the first king
is linked to the murder?

213
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:04,017
Attention Scepter Four.
All personnel stand by!

214
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:10,151
<i>Be advised. We will now</i>
<i>commence our operation to</i>
<i>apprehend the First and Silver</i>
<i>King, Adolph K. Weismann,</i>

215
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:13,551
<i>as a person of interest in</i>
<i>the murder of Tatara Totsuka.</i>

216
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:17,484
<i>We will advise the</i>
<i>Himmelreich to land at</i>
<i>the appointed airport.</i>

217
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:21,551
<i>In the event that he</i>
<i>does not comply, we will</i>
<i>commandeer his vessel.</i>

218
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:22,751
<i>Understood?</i>

219
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:23,584
<i>[unison]</i>
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

220
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:27,917
Mm?!

221
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,251
<i>[gasp]</i>

222
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:35,951
<i>There's a whole army!</i>

223
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:37,884
The guy with the glasses
is getting them ready!

224
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:40,984
My guess is that negotiations
with the Silver King failed,

225
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:43,684
and they've decided to
use force instead.

226
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:47,484
[Kuroh]
We won't get much accomplished
by sitting around talking.

227
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:48,684
Let's move on now.

228
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:52,385
We have to be careful
not to let them spot us.
Can you take care of that?

229
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:54,152
No problem!

230
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,785
After the Captain's warning,
we wait three minutes,
then move in.

231
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:46,352
<i>If the airship fails to</i>
<i>respond to our signals</i>
<i>or does not descend,</i>

232
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:51,485
<i>all choppers will fire</i>
<i>their boarding lines to</i>
<i>hook onto the craft, and</i>
<i>seize control immediately!</i>

233
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:18,152
Hmm hmm, ha ha ha ha!

234
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:19,852
How delightful.

235
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:25,326
<i>Looks like we have</i>
<i>unexpected guests.</i>

236
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:29,493
We must prepare.

<i>Nah-haha ha ha!</i>
<i>AAHHA HA HA HAAAH!</i>

246
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:15,693
Hey, Kuroh.

247
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:16,559
What is it?

248
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:19,693
I'm really curious about
this First and Silver King.

249
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,580
Can you tell me
anything more that I
should know about him?

250
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:25,180
I've never actually
met the man myself.

251
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:27,746
I really don't know
much about him.

252
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:30,346
Just what I learned
from Master Ichigen.

253
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,846
It's important to me.
I'd like to hear it.

254
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,180
<i>Very well. Among the</i>
<i>seven kings, he and the</i>
<i>Gold King are special.</i>

255
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:43,246
<i>What distinguishes him,</i>
<i>however, is his very</i>
<i>mysterious nature.</i>

256
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:47,913
And, naturally, he is the
reason the Gold King is
called the Second King.

257
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,113
I'm bored!

258
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:53,813
He's only called the
First King because he
was the first one here?

259
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:59,013
Yes. But being the First
King gave him superior
power to lord over the
others who came later.

260
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:03,113
And when he chose the sky
as his domain, the Gold
King claimed the ground.

261
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:04,280
[helicopter approach]
Now they rule as equals.

262
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:05,613
Gyahh!

Let's...go!

273
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:30,402
Even if we're able to
board the airship,

00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:33,768
<i>we won't be able to</i>

And that jerk with the
glasses won't be there.
He'll be too busy giving orders.

277

Come on, we've got to
crank up the speed,

<i>three minute warning yet!</i>

282
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:57,168
[giggle] Yeah! Yay!

283
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:05,635
[chuckle]

284
00:22:38,535 --> 00:22:39,302
[gasp]

285
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:47,302
What's that?

286
00:24:21,446 --> 00:24:24,412
<i>[Seri]</i>
<i>It all began with the</i>
<i>discovery of one slate.</i>

287
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:29,312
In Germany in 1945, the man who
would become the First King

288
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:33,279
<i>faded into the backgrounds</i>
<i>of history amidst the</i>
<i>escalating war.</i>

289
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:37,279
<i>Now, the Immortal King has</i>
<i>died in a massive explosion.</i>

290
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:41,846
<i>The unthinkable death of</i>
<i>Adolf K Weismann prompts</i>
<i>Reisi Munakata</i>

291
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:45,646
<i>to visit the Gold King,</i>
<i>Daikaku Kokujoji, for</i>
<i>some answers.</i>

292
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:50,646
<i>During the chaos,</i>
<i>the detained Mikoto Suoh</i>
<i>finally makes his move.</i>

293
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:57,679
<i>[Seri]</i>
<i>Hold it, Mikoto Suoh!</i>
<i>You do not have permission</i>
<i>to leave the perimeter!</i>

294
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:01,246
<i>I said hold it!</i>
<i>Didn't you hear me?</i>

295
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,479
<i>[shriek]</i>

296
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,479
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>Ma'am, did you just squeal</i>
<i>like a little girl?</i>

297
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:09,412
<i>[Seri]</i>
<i>O-Of course not!</i>
<i>That wasn't me, I swear!</i>

298
00:25:09,446 --> 00:25:11,346
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>Sure, if you say so.</i>

299
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:15,279
<i>Ahem. Next time on</i>
<i>"K," episode nine,</i>
