1
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,333
[Misaki]
The Blues are here!

2
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,766
SCEPTER 4 has entered
the building, gentlemen.

3
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:50,834
Munakata, ready!

4
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,601
I'll handle this.

5
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:33,967
In compliance with Protocol
One-Two-Oh, I'm taking you into
custody. Do you have any
objections?

6
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:37,701
Hm. Oddly enough,
I can't think of any.

7
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:41,067
<i>Take good care</i>
<i>of me, though.</i>

8
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,601
Mmmh?

9
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:10,201
Whaddya know? Look who
decided to drop by.

10
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,334
Suoh. I'm gonna get
right to the point.

11
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:20,034
All of our monitors have issued
the same warning. Your Weismann
level is pushing its limit.

12
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:24,901
<i>If the Sword of Damocles</i>
<i>should fall, we'll</i>
<i>experience a repeat of</i>
<i>the Kagutsu Crater.</i>

13
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:27,634
I came down here to
warn you in person.

14
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:31,267
If you draw more power
from the Dresden Slate,
I'll be forced to kill you.

15
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:34,067
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

16
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,134
It's pretty simple.
I'm telling you to
renounce your throne.

17
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:44,667
Sometimes you say the
funniest things, Munakata.
And all with a straight face.
Think I'll pass.

18
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:47,401
So that's your answer?
You leave me no choice.

19
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,867
I'll have to figure out a way
to keep you locked up in here
for the rest of your life.

20
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:56,267
Really, is that all you've got?
Actually, there is a way to keep
me locked in here forever.

21
00:02:56,934 --> 00:03:03,667
You could do it, Munakata.
The Blue King could keep
an eye on me personally,
24 hours a day.

22
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,901
It's a pretty attractive job,
with lots of perks.

23
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:13,001
I mean, think about it,
If I were to become
violent, you'd be allowed
to restrain me by force.

24
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:18,801
As attractive as that sounds,
the thought of breathing the
same air as you makes me ill.

25
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,701
And besides,

26
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,767
I have many other important
responsibilities that require
both my time and attention.

27
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:29,267
I can't devote the kind
of resources to punishing
you as I'd like.

28
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,834
Sorry you feel that way.
It's disappointing.

29
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:39,234
[falls back asleep]

30
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,834
Hmpf. And for me
as well, Suoh.

31
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:23,862
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>Restraining him with</i>
<i>fire-retardant phenolic</i>
<i>resin...</i>

32
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,395
That sounds like a good idea.

33
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,862
But to tell you the truth,
I honestly don't know how
effective it would be
against that man.

34
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:37,862
As the Red King, Mikoto Suoh
is a dangerous individual.
We have to find a way to
control him.

35
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:42,662
We know what he's capable of.
And if I may be so blunt, short
of killing him outright,

36
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:46,162
we need to protect ourselves,
in the event he becomes
aggressive.

37
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:49,328
I suggest incapacitating
him in a humane way.

38
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:54,495
Under proper medical
supervision, how about
administering doses of muscle
relaxants or tranquilizers?

39
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:56,362
Hmm.

40
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:00,828
That's quite a radical idea,
and a very good one, by the way.
Very intriguing.

41
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,428
I have to commend you,
Ms. Awashima.

42
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:06,762
Your blatant disregard
for Suoh's human rights
makes me shudder.

43
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:09,662
<i>I'll definitely</i>
<i>consider your proposal.</i>

44
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:15,628
Have you been able to
learn anything useful
about the weapon used to
murder Tatara Totsuka?

45
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:20,362
Apparently it was one of
many modified guns that the
mafia was trafficking in.

46
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:24,528
<i>The man in charge of their</i>
<i>smuggling operation has gone</i>
<i>missing, along with the truck.</i>

47
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:27,228
Hmm.

48
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:30,595
Now why would the
vehicle go missing?
Was there anything
else on that truck?

49
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:35,362
There were some
volatile chemicals,
a couple of crates
of explosives,

50
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,228
and enough weapons
and ammunition to
open up a gun shop.

51
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:44,562
Those bastards. If our
suspect was able to get
his hands so easily on
that much fire power...

52
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:49,610
Metro P.D. is taking this
very seriously, and is
about to form an
investigation strike force.

53
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:54,310
I'm putting in a request for
a release of information,
and forwarding it to the
officer in charge.

54
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,176
Shall I issue the order under
the level 'Prussian Blue'?

55
00:06:57,976 --> 00:06:58,676
Hmm.

56
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:04,010
No. Increase
security levels.
Use 'Royal Blue'.

57
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,976
I want to know about every
incident that has occurred in
this city in the past two weeks.

58
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:15,110
<i>And then I want information</i>
<i>on every event that takes</i>
<i>place after, regardless of</i>
<i>its relevance to the case.</i>

59
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:17,676
I want all eyes
and ears on this!

60
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:22,676
Yes. And if their eyes and ears
do not quickly produce results,
we should eliminate them.

61
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,276
I will exploit all our
personnel to their
utmost potential.

62
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:31,276
You are an exceptional
woman, Ms. Awashima.
No doubt about it.

63
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,476
How's it coming along?

64
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:42,676
I took the video that
HOMRA spammed across
the net the other day,
And I sweetened it up a bit.

65
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,643
We created an algorithm to
follow how it's tracking online,

66
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:49,643
<i>and I've been trolling</i>
<i>chat rooms, posting</i>
<i>comments questioning the</i>
<i>video's authenticity.</i>

67
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:54,343
Its impact will be limited
if people believe it's just
another internet prank.

68
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,476
And you?

69
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,543
[sigh] I'm checking for
people with criminal records
in this area, but so far,

70
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,976
<i>...I'm not getting any hits.</i>

71
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:07,210
I just hope the Greens
don't catch on to this.

73

That's perfect.
I'm leaving now.

Excuse me, can you
pass the soy sauce?

75
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:20,343
Mm-hm.

<i>Know your meal is important.</i>
<i>Now chew and savor.</i>

Those are wise words.
You should pace yourselves.

At this point, I'm not
that concerned, as long as
the video still exists
we'll be able to find him.

81
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:51,543
Mmm. Okay,
understood.

82
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:55,110
That's right. I get it.
Thanks for your help.

83
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,576
Well, things have gotten
a lot more complicated.

84
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,576
Now that the Black Dog has
joined the other side,
this is going to be a
bitch of a fight.

85
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:08,510
Not to mention, we're running
out of time.

This bar was
specially imported from a pub in
England! It cost me a fortune!

patrons are all soaked into
this fine piece of history!

So...

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,743
Would you care to tell me how
this fight started, boys?

104
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:07,610
I will! It began because
this asshole was talking
shit about Mr. Mikoto!

Uh--

some kind of traitor,
that he crossed over to

Wait! That's not
what I said at all!

111
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,702
I just wondered why the King let
himself be captured like that!
Don't you even try
to lie about that!

Yeah...
Yeah...

117
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,305
Why Mikoto allowed
himself to be captured?

118
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,205
You mean...?
Well, sure.

119
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:44,271
First you have to
apologize to my bar,
with sincerity.

120
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:46,271
Then I'll tell you.
Otherwise, forget it.

Really? Okay.

I'm sorry, bar.
I'm sorry, bar.

to confine a guy who's a natural

00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:44,238
I thought you understood their
fellow Clansman was murdered.

143
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,771
Now, they're out
for revenge.

144
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:50,771
Their clansman?
Is it an illegal
club of some kind?

145
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:53,338
You know, like a motorcycle
gang or the Mafia?

146
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:56,605
[Kuroh]
A Clan is a group of people who
serve under the same King.

147
00:11:56,638 --> 00:12:01,905
Mikoto Suoh is the king of the
Third Clan. His Clansmen are the
ones chasing you.

148
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:06,871
<i>Mikoto is known as the Red</i>
<i>King, and of all the Kings,</i>
<i>he possesses the most</i>
<i>violent temper.</i>

149
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:10,471
He's the leader of that
group of people with
those strange powers?

150
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:12,871
And you're telling me
there are other groups
just like his?

151
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:18,271
So now this group is after me
because there's been a terrible
mistake and they think I killed
one of their members.

152
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:22,571
They haven't made a mistake.
The fact is, you are
themurderer.

153
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,571
After we're done eating,
I shall kill you.

154
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:26,671
<i>What?!</i>

155
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:29,305
More, please!

156
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:30,671
Hm? [sigh]

157
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:33,438
Hey! If you're serving,
me, too!

158
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:34,938
Uhh...

159
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:43,405
Enjoy yourself Yashiro.
This is the last bowl of
white rice you will ever eat.

160
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:44,771
Stop saying
stuff like that!

161
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:00,462
<i>I found one.</i>

162
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:02,703
Yeah, over here, too.

163
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:06,803
<i>[Chitose]</i>
<i>That gun dealer must</i>
<i>have hidden his stuff</i>
<i>before he disappeared.</i>

164
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:09,170
<i>[Masaomi]</i>
<i>I don't understand.</i>

165
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:13,270
How did Mr. Kusanagi ever
find out about this place?

166
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:16,170
You shouldn't be asking
so many questions.

167
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:20,103
From what I hear, this
dealer isn't the only
guy who's mysteriously
disappeared lately.

168
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:24,903
It looks like Mr. Kusanagi
made the connection between
a few other guys and
Totsuka's murder.

169
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,770
<i>[Saruhiko]</i>
<i>You really should keep</i>
<i>talking, scumbag.</i>

170
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:31,803
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

171
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,403
What the hell are
you doing here?

172
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:35,870
<i>[Shoei]</i>
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

173
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,203
[Saburota]
He's Fushimi!

174
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:39,070
<i>Didn't he betray us?!</i>

175
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:44,970
Guess our guy didn't
show up. Man... Augh...

176
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,637
<i>[group]</i>
<i>Hauuggh!</i>

177
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,837
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>I found the missing</i>
<i>gun-dealer's warehouse.</i>

178
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,703
Notify Lt. Awashima, and get
someone over here to clean up.

179
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,270
Hm?
Huh?

180
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:03,070
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

181
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,037
YOU'RE TOO KIND.

182
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,970
MOVING ONWARD.

183
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:17,037
After your explanation, I
understand why those creeps
are so intent on killing me.

184
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,070
What I can't figure out,
even now, is why you
want to kill me.

185
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,303
<i>It's not like</i>
<i>you're one of them.</i>
<i>You don't belong to</i>
<i>their Clan.</i>

186
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:29,770
It's because I am a
vassal of the Seventh King.
The previous King,
the Colorless King.

187
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,370
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>Colorless?</i>

188
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,237
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>It means 'one who is not</i>
<i>beholden to a color'.</i>

189
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,303
<i>My late master ordered me</i>
<i>to evaluate the man who</i>
<i>would be the next King.</i>

190
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:41,803
If my investigation found
him to be evil, I wa
s to kill
him without hesitation.

191
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,370
That's my primary mission.

192
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:47,737
My Master, Ichigen Miwa,
possessed the ability to
predict the future.

193
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:49,403
That's pretty amazing.

194
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:51,770
But I'm confused.

195
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:55,237
You talk about this
King and the next King,
but what is it that
makes them Kings?

196
00:14:55,437 --> 00:15:00,403
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>They are beings endowed with</i>
<i>great powers that embody the</i>
<i>natural laws of this world.</i>

197
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:06,803
The power of the King is what
runs this country. But ordinary
human beings are unaware of it.

198
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:12,370
And here, after all this time,
I thought the Prime Minister
was the most powerful man
in the country.

199
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:16,270
Yes, yes. I will take care of
the matter immediately. Yes sir.

200
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:20,037
Yes. As you wish, sir.
I'll talk to you later.

201
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:22,970
[sigh]

202
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:24,237
Mr. Prime Minister.

203
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:27,870
Here's the official document.
Level, Royal Blue.

204
00:15:28,703 --> 00:15:31,337
I just received a
call regarding this.

205
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:34,037
I'm not surprised.

206
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:39,070
The Captain and
His Excellency value
protocol above all else.

207
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:42,670
As ordered SCEPTER Four
will now institute the
Yuishiki system, sir.

208
00:15:43,303 --> 00:15:46,070
For the next two weeks, the
people will be disenfranchised,

209
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:48,003
<i>but I'm sure you</i>
<i>can understand why.</i>

210
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,237
<i>I couldn't veto it if I</i>
<i>wanted to. But I'm sure</i>
<i>you're well aware of that.</i>

211
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,337
Following regulations, sir.

212
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,037
<i>[sigh] Yeah, right.</i>

213
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:03,837
Even though we have no choice,
it's not easy going along with
the King's capricious decisions.

214
00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:08,203
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Today, this country's</i>
<i>government and economy</i>

215
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:10,903
<i>cannot function without</i>
<i>the power of one man.</i>

216
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,670
Trust me on this. It was
because of him, and him only,
that Japan was able to transform
from a once-defeated nation,

217
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:23,303
preyed on by its neighbors,
into the modern world's
greatest economic and
technological power.

218
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:25,270
Seriously? Who is he?

219
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:27,137
He is known as the
'Gold King'.

220
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,403
He influences all
aspects of society.

221
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,137
For example,

222
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,637
Both of these products here,
were made by companies
controlled by the Gold King.

223
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:42,370
So the leader of that gang
who was trying to kill me.
You called him the Red
King, didn't you?

224
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:44,870
So there's a Red King
and a Gold King?

225
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,637
There are seven
Kings in total.

226
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:48,437
There's seven of them?

227
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,637
Each clan is different,
depending on the King
who rules them.

228
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,437
If I had to describe the Red
Clan in one word, that word
would be...

229
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,937
...violent.

230
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,837
[punched]
Haughh!

231
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,870
Hmpf!

232
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,237
What the hell? I rushed over
here as fast as I could,

233
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,803
because I was led to believe
there was trouble with the
guy who killed Totsuka.

234
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:10,003
<i>These were the guys you meant?</i>

235
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:11,837
Listen, you
little punk-ass!

236
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,203
Don't get
involved in this!

237
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:15,303
Don't leave, Yata!

238
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:19,856
Help me out here, will ya?
These guys won't go away
and leave me alone!

239
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,223
<i>They keep asking me for</i>
<i>information about you!</i>

240
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,489
Get lost.

241
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,756
You heard me!
Get out of here!

242
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,856
Or you're gonna be
in a world of hurt.

243
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,556
The hell with you, buddy!

244
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:33,156
Oh! Ohhh!

245
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:36,589
Is that right? You
guys are sniffin'
around, trying to
find out about us?

246
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,523
You could have asked
me directly. I'm a
member of HOMRA.

247
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:42,789
This represents our pride.

248
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:47,523
Mr. Mikoto taught us to
stand tall. You think I'm
afraid of that pistol?

00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,604
<i>Heh!</i>

Ah!

251
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:58,426
I fill you in and that's how
you react? How rude of you.
You should pay better attention.

252
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,001
Know what I mean?

253
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:02,334

<i>Augghhhh!!</i>

Save some for us!
What do you want
us to do to them?

256
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:10,734
do anything you want,
without killing the creeps.

<i>You might not have known this,</i>
<i>but I have to tell you.</i>

They're a Clan with bonds
that run thicker than blood.

259
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:21,234
Going out to hunt down and
kill one of their members
was a stupid thing to do.

You follow me,

Do you see those three
thugs lying there?

266
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:38,268
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
They walked into my shop,
tried to extort money,

267
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,419
Is that so?
and then went and
trashed the place!

268
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,652
That's right.
We're over at the mall.
Are you listening?!

<i>You two need to come to my</i>

[Kuroh & Yashiro]
Thank you for this meal.

Ohh, thank you
for this meow!

Okay, time
to kill you.

277
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:29,080
Rawwrrrr!
Wait a minute!
Just hold on there!
This isn't right!

278
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:30,847
Think about this
rationally!

279
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,380
You say the whole reason you
want to kill me is because
you're convinced I'm the
'Colorless King'! Am I right?

280
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:37,813
<i>Based on what?!</i>

281
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:39,380
Based on the video.

That could have
easily been faked!

283
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,180
I mean, don't you think
it's a little strange?

284
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:47,813
Why would I purposely commit
a crime and then identify
myself on the video?

285
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:50,513
Because you're evil, and you
want everyone to know it.

286
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,347
You believe that? If that's
really the case, then I must
be a pretty stupid villain.

287
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,913
Come on! By now, wouldn't I
have run away to someplace
where I'd be safe?

288
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:01,213
Hm.

289
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,013
I keep telling you,
I don't know what
this is all about!

290
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:06,047
I'm just an ordinary
high-school student!

291
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,413
If that's true,

292
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:10,047
<i>then who is she?!</i>

293
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:11,947
Isn't she one of your Clansmen?

294
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,980
Well, no, I mean, she's uh,
Wait, who are you, exactly?

295
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:20,947
<i>Or What are you?</i>

296
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:23,980
Well, I am a Cat. I'm Neko!

297
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,280
Could she be
a Strain?

298
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:29,147
It can't be just
coincidence that she's here.
That's implausible.

299
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,247
Huh?

300
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
What's a Strain?

301
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:36,413
They are beings who
possess special
powers naturally,

302
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:38,347
instead of receiving
them from a King.

303
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:40,513
<i>Is that what you are?</i>

304
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:44,813
I don't understand it
myself. All I know
is, I'm Shiro's cat!

305
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:48,380
I'm Shiro's cat,
and I belong to Shiro!

306
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,213
I'm Shiro's cat, and he
belongs to me!
Heh heh heh,
well now...

307
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:52,313
Yes, you are my cat,
calm down there...

308
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:53,213
Hm.

309
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,013
<i>Listen to me,</i>
<i>Kuroh Yagotami.</i>

310
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:58,480
The bottom line is,
I'm being falsely
accused here!

311
00:20:58,513 --> 00:21:01,480
I have no choice,
I'll have to prove
my innocence to you!

312
00:21:02,113 --> 00:21:05,780
<i>And then I'll have to find a</i>
<i>way to clear things up with</i>
<i>those scary red thugs!</i>

313
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:07,880
<i>I swear...</i>

314
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:09,313
I haven't killed anyone!

315
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:14,347
Didn't your late master tell
you to kill me only after you
had made a precise evaluation?

316
00:21:15,113 --> 00:21:17,480
In that case, you have to
determine with your own eyes,

317
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:20,380
Whether I am good, or evil!

318
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:25,213
Go ahead and
push a button.

319
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,213
Uh?

320
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:27,113
Just do it.

321
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:29,313
Well, all right.

322
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:35,758
<i>[recording]</i>
<i>Do not judge the cold.</i>
<i>Without first knowing the</i>
<i>warmth of the shining sun.</i>

323
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:38,625
What does
that mean?

324
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:40,692
It means, don't jump
to conclusions.

325
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,158
More importantly, it would
appear that you just earned
a new lease on life,
Yashiro Isana.

326
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,192
Just 'Shiro' is fine!
And thank you!

327
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:53,825
Oh, do you mind,
if I address you
as 'Kuroh'?

328
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:55,125
Yashiro Isana!

329
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:56,325
Uh?

330
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:01,225
Address me as you wish, but from
this moment on, I will determine
what kind of person you are!

331
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:05,025
And if I find that you
are evil, I will slay
you without hesitation.

332
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:07,092
Now, do we understand
each other?

333
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,325
Thank you, Kuroh. I got it.

334
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:11,758
Thanks for giving me time
to prove my innocence.

335
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:15,258
You can thank
Master Ichigen Miwa
for admonishing me.

336
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,658
You carry him around
with you on that?

337
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:19,758
Amazing, isn't it?!

338
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:24,092
The words of my late
master, Ichigen Miwa,
are contained on this device!

339
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:28,192
He was also an avant-garde poet,
and his words were so filled
with meaning and beauty,

340
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,492
that listening to them
only once was not enough!

341
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:34,625
<i>It was not enough to simply</i>
<i>engrave them onto my soul!</i>
<i>I recorded them at every</i>
<i>opportunity.</i>

342
00:22:34,658 --> 00:22:37,292
I play them whenever I
need guidance in my life!

343
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:44,092
<i>Walk casually down the</i>
<i>path you have chosen.</i>
<i>The path to your dreams.</i>

344
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,458
Perfect, don't you think?

345
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,158
Creepy!

346
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,526
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>Hey there!</i>
<i>It's me, Neko!</i>

347
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,226
<i>I'm always happy</i>
<i>and always bare!</i>

348
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,693
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Stop selling</i>
<i>yourself already!</i>

349
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,093
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>Oh, it's the</i>
<i>creepy guy.</i>

350
00:24:28,126 --> 00:24:30,126
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>How dare you</i>
<i>call me creepy!</i>

351
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,326
<i>I'm here to fulfill my late</i>

<i>I'm speaking!</i>

353
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:37,026
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>Who cares!?</i>
<i>Nobody's looking!</i>

354
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,226
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>That's not the point.</i>
<i>Can't you be more</i>
<i>lady-like!</i>

355
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:40,759
<i>Hey, I told you to</i>
<i>stop undressing!</i>

356
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:43,593
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>Ha ha! Too late!</i>
<i>I'm completely</i>
<i>buck-naked!</i>

357
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:46,226
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Ugh! Have you no shame,</i>
<i>young lady?!</i>

358
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:48,093
<i>Put this on now!!</i>

359
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:49,759
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

360
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:53,526
<i>Not this uniform again!</i>
<i>Why does everyone want</i>
<i>me to put on clothes?!</i>

361
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,659
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Because you're</i>
<i>embarrassing yourself!</i>

362
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:59,526
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>Hrgh! Wait, I look</i>
<i>funny because I'm</i>
<i>the only one naked.</i>

363
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:03,259
Hey, if I use my powers to make
Kuroh and Shiro naked too,

364
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,759
then they won't notice that we
aren't dressed for the episode!

365
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:06,593
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Cut it out!</i>

366
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:08,293

<i>What? No?</i>

367

<i>"Knock-on Effect".</i>
