[Kuroh]
[humming]

00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:45,863
Fold the omelet
quickly while the egg
is still half cooked.

4
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:48,275

7
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:58,629
Yashiro Isana, I've
prepared lunch boxes
for you as requested.

8
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,215
Do not put lids on the boxes
until the contents have cooled.

9
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:08,213
The omelets are sweet and
covered with fluffy rice, but
let me know if you would prefer
Dashi egg rolls instead.

10
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:09,922
[awe]
Aaah!

11
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:11,229
Mmm!

12
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:13,808
(OM giggles as she dodges the
laser light)

13
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:14,948
What are you doing?
Keep your paws off!

14
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:19,271
<i>DIE!</i>

15
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,923
Hey don't throw that away!

16
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:24,263
It's my school bag!

17
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:34,115
<i>DIE!</i>

18
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:36,192
You think I'm a
piece of trash too?

19
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:37,466
SHOW SOME RESPECT!

20
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:41,319
You hillbilly samurai!

21
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,690
Raah! Stop bullying Shiro!

22
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:44,159
[choking]

23
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,011
KNOW YOUR PLACE!

24
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:48,688
This is no time
for games!
What are you planning
to do today?!

25
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:52,172
What're you
talking about?
Obviously I have
to go to school!

26
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:54,283
<i>I have to turn in</i>
<i>my assignment for</i>
<i>my classical</i>
<i>literature class!</i>

27
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:56,529
<i>Shiro isn't trash!</i>
<i>HAVE MERCY!</i>

28
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:59,812
I might have known.
You've forgotten
what you promised
to do last night!

29
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:01,124
<i>I HAVE FAILED.</i>

30
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:02,297
<i>I have won!</i>

31
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:05,880
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Do you have any intention of</i>
<i>ever proving your innocence?!</i>

32
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:44,809
<i>Alright, class, let's continue</i>
<i>where we left off yesterday.</i>

33
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:49,701
<i>Overcome with curiosity, the</i>
<i>Goddess Amaterasu, opened</i>
<i>the Cave of Heaven slightly.</i>

34
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,330
And saw her radiance reflected
in a mirror that had been set
up outside the entrance by the
Goddess Amanouzume.

35
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,351
<i>then the God Amenotajikara</i>
<i>closed the cave so she</i>
<i>could not go back in.</i>

36
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:03,105
I'm glad you can
spend time with
your friend, Shiro.

37
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:04,646
Yeah, it's great.

38
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:10,242
Mm?! And who might
you be, young man?

39
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:14,933
I am a vassal of the former
Seventh King, Ichigen Miwa,

40
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,312
Kuroh Yatogami.

41
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:18,284
What he's trying to say,

42
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:22,104
is that he's sort of a
recent transfer student.

43
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,019
You may continue
with your literary
selection now.

44
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:26,025
Heh...

45
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,197
If you say so.

46
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:30,481
[sigh]

47
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,206
...And the other
celestials watched as
Amatersu once again...

48
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:38,121
You are very kind.
Thank you again for
all your help.

49
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:41,438
Since you're going to
be in our class I guess
it would help if you
knew all our names.

50
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:43,884
My name is
Kukuri Yukizome.

51
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,364
Kukuri Yukizome.

52
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:48,140
You can just
call me Kukuri.

53
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:49,410
And your name is Kuroh.

54
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:53,834
Funny - in Japanese, Kuro means
'black' and Shiro means 'white',
like pieces on a game board!

55
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:56,012
<i>Oh, and just ask if you</i>
<i>need any more help.</i>

56
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,017
<i>Thank you.</i>

57
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:08,578
Stop!

58
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:09,449
Huh?

59
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,011
You're brazen,
but at least you look
decent this time.

60
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,122
Eh, heh heh heh...

61
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:19,266
Um, heh heh heh...

62
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:21,043
<i>If I may interrrupt,</i>

63
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:22,651
Just who might you be, Miss?

64
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,840
Well, she's sort of a
transfer student too.

65
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:38,132
You brought a complete
homemade lunch!
What happened?

66
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,773
Did you get married
or something?

67
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,656
Yes, my loving wife,
Kuroh, made everything.

68
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,331
I suggest you watch your mouth.

69
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:46,844
One more insult like that and
I'll cut out your tongue!

70
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,424
That was good!
I want some more!

71
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:51,200
I've got extra if you want it.

72
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:54,752
Bleh!

73
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,963
You brought a bunch
of vegetables!

74
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,907
Hey, where did
you get that?

75
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,755
It doesn't look like our
school-issued PDA.

76
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:03,934
It belongs to
my loving wife.

77
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:05,944
Say farewell to
your tongue.

78
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,016
Huh?!

79
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:09,295
So, any new leads?

80
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,965
No, not really.
This image is
just too blurry.

81
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,239
What are you
looking at?

82
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:16,084
Mmm?

83
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,249
Heh hah!

84
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:27,567
Hey, Shiro! Wanna take a
look at my latest download,
It's a pretty nasty piece.

85
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,327
You're really hooked
on that stuff,
aren't you?

86
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,946
Listen, I've gotta tell
you I'm not as interested
in pornography as you
think I am.

87
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,286
Like hell you're not!

88
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,866
And this clip isn't porn.
Check it out look!

89
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:43,322
Oh, wait, before you do!
You didn't tell Kukuri
about that porno I showed
you the other day, did you?

90
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:45,031
No, of course not.

91
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:47,210
Good. Okay, here we go.

92
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:49,690
Get ready, pal,
check this out.

93
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,671
He looks exactly
like you, Shiro.

94
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,749
You're right about that.

95
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,787
Looks like the jig is up.
It's time to call the Coppers,
You're toast!

96
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,970
Not funny. But I am
curious about my
look alike, Sota.

97
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,518
Could you forward
this to my e-mail?

98
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,153
<i>It's a disturbing</i>
<i>video I got from Sota.</i>

99
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:14,538
Oh, he sent
you that?

100
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:17,486
Then, others must have it.

101
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:30,286
Privacy's just a
thing of the past.

102
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,263
Stop slacking
off and help us.

103
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:35,011
I'm not slacking,
I'm expressing an
opinion.

104
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:40,373
<i>According to this video,</i>
<i>the crime occurred on</i>
<i>December Seventh at 23:45,</i>

105
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:44,293
<i>on the Hirasaka building</i>
<i>rooftop in the West Precinct.</i>

106
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:50,023
Tatara is really dead.

107
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,301
Lieutenant Awashima!

108
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,219
[Awashima]
Do we know where
the suspect is now?

109
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,465
We do. Give me a
moment to bring it up.

110
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:08,422
Ashinaka High School.
So he's on the school island.

111
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:13,951
The video that streamed
across the city was
time-stamped and dated.

112
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:17,301
<i>It was the night of</i>
<i>December seventh at 23:45.</i>

113
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:21,389
Given the distance
between the crime
scene and my school,

114
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:24,305
there is no way I could
have made it there and
back in an hour.

115
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,297
Which means?

116
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,419
<i>Which means I could</i>
<i>prove my innocence!</i>

117
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:34,680
<i>If I can demonstrate I was</i>
<i>on campus on the Seventh</i>
<i>of December, around</i>
<i>23:45 in the evening,</i>

118
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:37,797
I would have an alibi.
All I need are witnesses.

119
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,807
Let's be very clear
about your alibi.

120
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:43,124
You can't simply claim
you were sleeping
alone in your room.

121
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:49,021
Furthermore, I wouldn't accept
anything this one says about
your whereabouts, as an alibi.

122
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:52,875
Aaahh!

123
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,148
I'm the best
one to ask!

124
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:57,231
We've been together
since the moment we met,
we're inseparable!

125
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,845
<i>I know that my Shiro</i>
<i>is a good guy.</i>

126
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:02,358
Just be quiet.
I told you I
don't trust him.

127
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:08,322
If he can't prove his
innocence, and I find out you
played a part in this crime,
you will pay with your life.

128
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:09,596
I hope I'm making
myself clear.

129
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,305
Hey, everything
will be all right.

130
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:15,326
We were permitted to work at
the school that night on
preparations for the festival.

131
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,934
I'm beginning to remember.

132
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:19,480
<i>All kinds of things were</i>
<i>going on that evening.</i>

133
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:20,955
Things?!

134
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:22,229
Yeah.

135
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:26,283
I'm pretty sure someone will be
able to vouch for the fact that
I was at school that night,

136
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,657
doing a lot of work
for the event.

137
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,611
C'mon! So how much
longer are you guys
going to be back here?!

138
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:39,485
<i>Wow! You look good! And quite</i>
<i>authentic, just like Ebisu,</i>
<i>the god of good fortune!</i>
<i>Although you're not as fat!</i>

139
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,457
Mm!

140
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:43,774
<i>I don't know who you're</i>
<i>supposed to be, but you</i>
<i>look beautiful!</i>

141
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:46,622
I guess that's because
I really am beautiful!

142
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:48,834
Kukuri, do you
have a second?

143
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:52,085
I need to ask you about the
night of December Seventh.

144
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,436
Almost...

145
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:11,184
Here it is.

146
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:12,056
Huh?!
Huh?!

147
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,057
<i>He goes to the school</i>
<i>on the Island?</i>

148
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,507
It'll certainly be tough to
get him out of that place
without making a scene.

149
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:19,618
We have to play smart.

The hell we do!

152
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,003
Hm? Mm? Yata?!

153
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,219
<i>Ugh, that idiot!</i>

154
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:45,146
[shouting]
Ms. Kukuri Yukizome!

155
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:52,686
<i>It was love at first sight!</i>
<i>I knew it had to be you from</i>
<i>the first minute I saw you.</i>
<i>Please be my girl!</i>

156
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,357
No!

157
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:55,993
Huh?!

158
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:57,133
I'm sorry!

159
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:03,064
Heh heh!

160
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:08,459
[exaggerating]
My heart is broken!
I'm ruined for life!

161
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,122
That was one of the
things that happened.

162
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:18,109
Why did you
bring that up?
I just wanted
to forget it!

163
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:24,643
[recording]
The feeling of love.
A shower of fireworks.
It bursts, then fizzles.

164
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:25,683
Mm.

165
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:26,587
Creepy.

166
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:29,468
But that fireworks
show was awesome.

167
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:33,054
It happened just before
midnight, if I remember
correctly, right?

168
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:36,271
Around 11:45 pm,
to be more exact.

169
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:38,315
That sounds right.

170
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:40,359
But why is that
important?

171
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:43,743
<i>It just is. I was there</i>
<i>watching it, remember?</i>

172
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,620
[Kukuri]
Hmm, I don't know.

173
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:50,076
<i>Maybe you were, but I'm</i>
<i>not absolutely positive,</i>
<i>now that I think about it.</i>

174
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:51,785
You've got
to remember.

175
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,667
Well, I don't!
That was the last
thing on my mind!

176
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:59,794
It looks like that guy
is going to set off all
the festival fireworks!

177
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:02,173
Someone needs to drag
him down here quick!

178
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:04,652
Here comes the
Student Council!

179
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,511
Last chance
to come down!

180
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,120
Remove the door.

181
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,030
[Shiro]
During that whole
December night incident,

182
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,710
I was there and
witnessed everything.

183
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:18,592
<i>Do you remember seeing me?</i>

184
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,798
Don't recall.

185
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,920
I was too busy dragging that
idiot down off the roof to
notice anybody else.

186
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:27,572
Yes, I remember the
whole situation was
pretty messy.

187
00:12:27,974 --> 00:12:32,598
In my opinion, if you
hadn't acted so swiftly,
who knows what might have
happened that evening?

188
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:35,581
Hey, why don't we check the
news articles from that day?

189
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:40,607
<i>[Shiro]</i>
<i>Two photos and I'm not</i>
<i>in either of them.</i>

190
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:47,443
Well, if you're looking for a
photo of yourself during the
commotion, why not talk to
someone at the school newspaper?

191
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,626
They were snapping plenty
of pictures that evening.

192
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:54,077
Yeah, that's right!
I know they were taking
tons of pictures of you,

193
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,959
while you dealt with one
issue after another as
our class president.

194
00:12:56,992 --> 00:13:00,829
You are so good at what
you do, And there's
nothing that you can't do.

195
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:02,202
By the way,
you're busted.

196
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:05,654
I realize we're all
getting ready for the
school festival, but,

197
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:09,709
you can't continue to walk
around this campus dressed as
outlandishly as you are now.

198
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,863
<i>I don't care if those</i>
<i>are fake prop swords,</i>
<i>they're prohibited</i>
<i>just the same.</i>

199
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:16,343
Ugh! These swords
are not just props!

200
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:18,387
Ha ha ha ha!

201
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:21,839
Stop laughing!

202
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,011
Thanks for your time.

203
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:30,585
Easy, boy, easy.
Calm down!

204
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,606
Dude, this is cool.

205
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,923
Watch it,
you idiot!

206
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:39,196
Ah! Aghh!

207
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:44,960
A-aahhh! It's
out of control!

208
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:46,601
Somebody get a
fire extinguisher!

209
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:48,177
<i>Eek! Stop that horse!</i>

210
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:51,862
Ah sweet! a hot story!

211
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,739
Go around that way,
See what you can get!

212
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,917
Use the zoom an' get
some good close-ups!

213
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,822
Right!

214
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,583
<i>So far, I'm not seeing myself.</i>

215
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:11,664
<i>I'm pretty sure I was hanging</i>
<i>around this area at the time.</i>

216
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:12,815
<i>Are you sure?</i>

217
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:17,138
We took a ton of photos on that
night, so if you were there, you
should be able to find yourself
in at least one of them.

218
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:19,048
Hm...

219
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:21,225
Where am I??

220
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,208
Just as I suspected,
you have no alibi!!

221
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:28,095
Why do you need an
alibi? Was there some
sort of an incident?
Do I smell a scoop here?

222
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,340
No, no. It's not
scoop-worthy at all.

223
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:32,518
You're too kind.

224
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:34,730
This is becoming
a real problem.

225
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:38,147
I was sure I would
find myself in one of
those photographs.

226
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,496
Hey, guys,
Where've ya been?!

227
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,210
Rgh! I'm super busy and I
still have a lot to do,

228
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:51,618
I could really use your help.

229
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,370
[giggle] Thanks a bunch.

230
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:56,878
Where do you wish me to take it?

231
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:02,479
Well, if it wouldn't be
too much trouble, could
you drop it off at the
teachers' main office?

232
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,824
I have to run this
over to the student
council room.

233
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:06,500
I'll do it.

234
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,381
Oh, the teachers' office!

235
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,392
I've got a new idea.

236
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,284
Oh, thank you.
If you would be so
kind, please leave
it right there.

237
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:17,960
I have a little
request.

238
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:22,818
<i>You want to see a log of</i>
<i>all the students who left</i>
<i>the island through the main</i>
<i>gate on a particular day?</i>

239
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:23,957
Yes.

240
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:25,867
Okay, but what do
you need it for?

241
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:29,721
Just to know I was here,
in case anybody should ask.

242
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,737
Guess I shouldn't mention
I might be killed if we
don't see it.

243
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:34,743
Mm? Oh, very well.

244
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,426
What day do you
want to check?

245
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,067
December Seventh.

246
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,379
<i>Let's print it up.</i>
<i>December Seventh.</i>

247
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:46,645
Ido, Ikuno, and Inoue...
But no Isana!

248
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:49,761
You see?! There's
no Yashiro Isana!

249
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:52,711
Let's eat, Shiro!
I'm hungry!

250
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:56,732
This should clear me
of suspicion once and
for all, right?!

251
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,652
I want to eat!

252
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:03,165
Nothing to worry
about now.

253
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:07,353
Why don't we all go
get some snacks and
just enjoy the rest
of this afternoon?

254
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:10,369
Yahoo! Yahoo!
Yahoo!

255
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:14,859
Speaking of snacks, Kukuri said
she's got some delicious rice
crackers that she would share.

256
00:16:15,194 --> 00:16:22,499
And her friend, Sumika, said
she'd buy me some tasty Daifuku
mochi! The hot ones ! Daifuku!
Daifuku! Oh, now I'm thirsty!

257
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,309
Shiro, can you
buy me a drink?

258
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:26,352
She has a lot
of energy.

259
00:16:28,297 --> 00:16:29,704
<i>[Shiro]</i>
<i>Like I told you, every</i>
<i>time a student comes to</i>
<i>or leaves this island,</i>

260
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:31,748
<i>they are scanned</i>
<i>at the automatic gate.</i>

261
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:36,707
I'm not on this list,
which means I was on this
Island the whole day and
night of December Seventh.

262
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:39,991
<i>And therefore, I couldn't</i>
<i>have been at the scene of</i>
<i>the crime. Get it?!</i>

263
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,906
I want juice,
okay?

264
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:47,698
Oh! I didn't bring
enough change.

265
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:49,608
[can drops]

266
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,752
Did you forget
your PDA again?

267
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:55,069
<i>You know it's a school</i>
<i>rule that you have to</i>
<i>keep it on you.</i>

268
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:57,013
<i>Besides, it's inconvenient</i>
<i>not to have it.</i>

269
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:02,843
Kukuri. Are you saying
that Shiro doesn't usually
carry a PDA with him?

270
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:06,160
No matter how many
times I remind him,
he always forgets.

271
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:07,736
Shh...

272
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,081
Without a PDA it would be
a problem to get scanned
at the gate, am I right?

273
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:13,566
Not a problem for this guy.
Somehow he sneaks past it.

274
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:20,736
Kukuri. Something is about
to happen that I don't want
you to have to witness.

275
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,776
Please leave us now.

276
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,149
Wa- Wait a minute!

277
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,403
I'll search everywhere!
I'll find other proof!

278
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:30,324
I've heard enough!
It's become quite clear to
me that you are deceitful!

279
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:31,464
Mrowwr!

280
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:34,010
Step aside, Neko.

281
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,931
Unless of course,
as I suspect,
you've been working
with him all along.

282
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:40,745
So is it your desire to be
slain with your master?

283
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,063
I am Neko, Shiro's
domesticated house cat
and loyal pet!

284
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,911
I'm not letting you kill him,
He's my guardian!

285
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:51,803
He's a warm, caring human!
And I enjoy having delicious
meals and cat treats with him!

286
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:53,981
Easy. Calm down.

287
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,634
You're kinda making
things more complicated.

288
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,261
Shiro...?
Shiro...?

289
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,879
I'm... sorry, Kuroh.

290
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:36,838
Give me one more chance,
I know I can prove I was here!

291
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:39,469
Come to think of it,
a lot more than fireworks
happened that night.

292
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:40,911
There was a
sprinkler that burst,

293
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:44,965
a toilet that overflowed,
and the ceiling in the
gym storeroom caved in.

294
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,579
I saw it all! Someone
had to have seen me, too.

295
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:48,986
Mmmm...

296
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,532
Wait a minute, I recall
running into the gym.

297
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,844
I was so upset that night
that it slipped my mind.

298
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,420
Hmm?

299
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,664
<i>It's finally all</i>
<i>coming back to me.</i>

300
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:01,451
<i>After Sota embarrassed me</i>
<i>in front of everyone,</i>
<i>I ran into the gym.</i>

301
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:03,696
<i>That's when Shiro and I</i>
<i>found this hole together.</i>

302
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:07,013
That's right,
I'd forgotten that!

303
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:11,470
You wouldn't by any
chance remember what time
we were both staring up
at the hole, would you?

304
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:12,743
Sure do,

305
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,457
Half past midnight.

306
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,679
Phew! I believe
that's within an
hour of the crime.

307
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:28,224
It would have been impossible
to sneak back in here from the
crime scene by then. So...

308
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,575
You know what that means;
I've got an alibi!

309
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:33,686
Shiro, what on
earth is going on?

310
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:38,109
Well, my dear friend Kukuri,
I owe you my life.
That's what's going on.

311
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:40,890
Hm?!

312
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:48,866
Focus, people! Focus!
We don't have much time
left before the festival!

313
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:50,575
Right!

314
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:53,289
[Kukuri]
It's amazing! Ever since
Kuroh took charge,
we're getting so much done,

315
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:55,165
We may even finish
ahead of schedule.

316
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,957
Hmpf! Nobody was focused,
It's taken a transfer student
to get anybody to work.

317
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,000
But Shiro's
disappeared again.

318
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,145
I was just thinking
about that.

319
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:07,027
<i>Are those two newbies</i>
<i>really transfers?</i>

320
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:10,243
<i>It seems like they just</i>
<i>suddenly appeared in</i>
<i>class one day.</i>

321
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,326
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>[humming Beethoven's 9th]</i>

322
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,275
[siighh] I'm completely beat.

323
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:20,765
I can only take so many death
threats before my brain turns
into a pile of mush.

324
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,848
Uh! Must have left my uniform
in one of the classrooms.

325
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,160
Well, no big deal.

326
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:28,840
[humming]

327
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:31,924
<i>Uh!</i>

328
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:45,595
[humming Beethoven's 9th]

329
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:49,683
Hey, how're you doing?
It's a nice night out, isn't it?

330
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,753
<i>I came up to film</i>
<i>the city lights,</i>
<i>since it's so clear.</i>

331
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:54,730
[sinister chuckles]
<i>It's beautiful!</i>

332
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:57,210
<i>I'm Tatara Totsuka.</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>

333
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:15,874
I, my friend, am the Seventh
King, the colorless king!

334
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,325
I've been out here,
waiting for someone.

335
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:21,704
Nice night, you say?

336
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:25,625
Yes, it is. A very nice night!

337
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,409
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>Shiro!</i>

338
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:40,669
Neko, what's wrong?
What are you doing home?
Is it snack time?

339
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:43,183
Kukuri gave me super
spicy rice crackers!

340
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:45,696
And then she asked
me to come here and
bring you back.

341
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:51,460
<i>And if I do that, she</i>
<i>promised me ultra super</i>
<i>spicy rice crackers.</i>
<i>My mouth is tingling already!</i>

342
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:53,872
Okay I'll go,
if that's what
you want.

343
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:56,218
Mm, what's wrong?

344
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,066
Shiro, do you have
a tummy ache?

345
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:02,886
It's nothing.

346
00:22:08,248 --> 00:22:09,655
How can this be?

347
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:23,963
YOU'RE TOO KIND.

348
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:33,010
So this is where that
piece of shit hangs out.

349
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,757
Just you wait, pal.

350
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,773
I'll tear you apart
with my bare hands.

351
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:46,078
[buzz]

352
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:46,882
Huh?

353
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:47,820
Huh?

354
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:23,023
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>I took the early shift and now</i>
<i>you have me working overtime?</i>

355
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:24,900
<i>[Munakata]</i>
<i>Is there a problem,</i>
<i>Fushimi?</i>

356
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:26,451
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
No, nothing, sir.

357
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:27,982
<i>[Munakata]</i>
Please, have some tea.

358
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:30,864
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>Thanks. Ugh!</i>
<i>My foot's asleep.</i>

359
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:34,416
<i>[Munakata]</i>
<i>Is something wrong, Fushimi?</i>
<i>Can't drink the tea</i>
<i>I fixed for you?</i>

360
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,127
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>Um, no, sir.</i>
<i>it's not like that.</i>

361
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,693
<i>[Munakata]</i>
<i>Hmm. Very well.</i>
<i>I suppose I shall enjoy</i>
<i>this tea for myself.</i>

362
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:45,893
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>Damn it, nothing ever seems to</i>
<i>bother him. It's irritating.</i>

363
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:49,127
<i>Besides, what's so great</i>
<i>about green tea anyway?</i>

364
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,993
<i>I bet he's never had any</i>
<i>junk food in his life.</i>

365
00:24:52,027 --> 00:24:55,827
<i>Now that I think of it,</i>
<i>the guys in HOMRA lived</i>
<i>on junk food.</i>

366
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:58,393
<i>And Mr. Kusanagi would give</i>
<i>them a hard time about...</i>

367
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:01,093
<i>Heh, what am I thinking?</i>

368
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:03,293
<i>I have no regrets in</i>
<i>leaving that clan.</i>

369
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:05,260
<i>That was simply not</i>
<i>the place for me.</i>

370
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:09,360
<i>Next time on "K".</i>
<i>Episode 5,</i>
<i>"Knife".</i>

371

<i>[Munakata]</i>
<i>Say Fushimi.</i>
<i>Is your foot asleep?</i>

00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,927
<i>[Fushimi]</i>
<i>What?! Uh, no.</i>
<i>No, sir.</i>

373
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,177
<i>[Munakata]</i>
<i>Mmm.</i>

374
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,367

<i>Captain? No, wait.</i>
<i>Please, don't get any</i>
