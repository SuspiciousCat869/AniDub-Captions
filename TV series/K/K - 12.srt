1
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:26,560
From now on, I'll be on my own.

2
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,155
<i>Good-bye for now, Lieutenant.</i>

3
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:38,723
Perhaps someday
we'll meet again.

4
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,055
The Silver King?

5
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:47,155
That's you?

6
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:53,889
Yes, it's me.
But at the same time,
I'm still Yashiro Isana.

7
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,889
The truth of the matter is,
Nothing's really changed.

8
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:08,155
<i>[Seri]</i>
<i>Wait a minute! That was the</i>
<i>Sword of Damocles, but...</i>

9
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:11,122
Misaki!

10
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:15,189
Keep your eyes on me, loser!
I'm the one you're fighting!

11
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:16,822
So stay focused!

12
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:18,589
Yeah... I hear you.

13
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:19,989
Fucking monkey!

14
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,822
Everyone stay on target!

15
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:28,289
We take control!
As quickly as possible!

16
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,122
Alright, let's take 'em out!

17
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:32,822
-Yeaah!
-All right!
-Yaaaahh!

18
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:35,289
[charge yells]
Yaaahh!

19
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:38,955
[charge yells]
Huaaah!!

20
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:42,922
You don't have to stay.

21
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:45,189
You can go help your
forces, if you want.

22
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:49,155
Oh really? And ruin this
wonderful moment with you?

23
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:52,089
You have a point,
now that I think about it.

24
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:54,989
After all this will
be our last fight.

25
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,055
Munakata...

26
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:04,522
...Ready!

27
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,327
So. You came here to tell me
you're the new Colorless King?

28
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:45,194
Right.

29
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,627
I see. I appreciate you
coming all this way to
introduce yourself.

30
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,494
But I must say, regardless
of who or what you are,

31
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:55,794
<i>I'm no longer</i>
<i>interested in...</i>

32
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:57,427
What goes on
in the world?

33
00:03:58,127 --> 00:03:59,760
Right. So...

34
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:03,760
Unfortunately for you,
I still do have an interest.

35
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,294
In your...
eternal...
immortality!

36
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,027
<i>Hee hee, ha ha ha!</i>

37
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,094
Bye-bye, now.

38
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,227
[Kuroh]
I see. And that's when
you swapped bodies?

39
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,060
Yes. Although it was more
like him snatching my body,
than us swapping.

40
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:38,127
But in spite of all his power,
He couldn't take over my
heart and soul.

41
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:41,394
That's the strength of
being the Silver King.

42
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:46,527
You may very well be right.
The Silver King is eternal.

43
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,560
His power can't be
harmed or destroyed.

44
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:51,394
Ah! That must be it!

45
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,150
The Colorless King's ability?
The power to affect other Kings!

46
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,817
Mmm.

47
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,884
When my power of
inviolability clashed with
his power to affect other
Kings, the result was mixed.

48
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:05,050
Sure, he took over my body,

49
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,884
<i>But he failed to</i>
<i>capture my power.</i>

50
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,350
<i>which resulted in something</i>
<i>he may not have anticipated.</i>

51
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:16,417
<i>With nowhere else to go,</i>
<i>my soul escaped into the</i>
<i>body he had just discarded.</i>

52
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,084
My amnesia was the result
of that transition.

53
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,950
I see! That explains why you
didn't get hurt when you fell
so very far from the sky!

54
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:28,017
No scar!

55
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:33,184
That means he murdered Tatara
Totsuka specifically, so he
could put the blame on you!

56
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,084
It was all part of
his master plan.

57
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:40,884
...the Colorless King.

58
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:45,950
<i>I can tell you,</i>
<i>he's jumped from body to</i>
<i>body many times before.</i>

59
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:50,850
He's already discarded
my original body, and
moved on to another one.

60
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:51,784
[Neko]
[gasp]

61
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,517
[Kuroh]
We have to find
Kukuri then!

62
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,250
[Shiro]
I've got to save her!

63
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:58,950
Can I count on you to help me?

64
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:00,084
Mm-hm!

65
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:01,084
Mmm.

66
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:04,184

Don't lose your formation!

69
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,850
At this rate, it's a
battle of attrition.

70

It's the Captain!
He's alive!

Wait! Lieutenant,
where are you going?

77
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,017
I'm coming to help you, Captain!

78
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:09,250
[Yashiro]
As I recall, you're one
of the people in charge
of SCEPTER 4, right?

79
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,250
Have you got a minute?
I'd like to talk.

80
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,417
Hold it right there!

81
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,984
Grr!

82
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:24,284
Bear with me, if you would.

83
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:29,050
It's been a while.
And this could take
me a bit to get
used to again.

84
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,884
Raa!

85
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,884
Trying to trick me with
another illusion?!

86
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,150
Uh?

87
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:43,950
Ah!

88
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:49,950
Whuaaa?!

89
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,117
Don't worry.
You're really
in no danger.

90
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,117
All I did was tune in
to the spectrum of
your biological wave,

91
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,350
which is synced to the Blue
Clan, and synched it to my
own, which is Silver.

92
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,784
In other words,
as my temporary
clansman,

93
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:06,350
I've given you the
ability to access the
Silver Sanctum's power
to manipulate gravity.

94
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:08,217
Uht! Put me down!

95
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,917
He he he he!
Take it easy.
Time to go!

The one from
the stadium!

102

Yaaaaaa!

What the hell?!
Black Dog...?!

105
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,350
I'm speaking to both clans!

106
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:26,284
<i>On orders of the First</i>
<i>King, the Silver King,</i>
<i>you are hereby commanded to</i>
<i>cease fighting immediately!</i>

107
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,517
Get outta here!
Why should we
listen to you?!

108
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,184
My King is the Red
King, Mikoto Suoh,
and no-one else!

109
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:35,984
I don't give a shit
about Silver!

110
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:38,384
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo!
- All right!

111
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,017
That's right!

112
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,217
Blue King Reisi Munakata
is the only leader that
members of SCEPTER 4
will accept orders from!

113
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:46,730
We obey no other King!

114
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:52,563
Let me ask this!

115
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:58,884
If you're all so determined to
carry out this fight to the
finish, do you really know the
true intentions of both Kings?

116
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:03,084
<i>Why did the Red King, Mikoto</i>
<i>Suoh, take over this island?</i>

117
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:08,017
And why isn't the Blue King,
Reisi Munakata, taking
command of the fight himself?

118
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,717
Why are those two off trying to
settle their fight right now?

119
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,750
And doing it without bothering
to involve their loyal troops?

120
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,984
<i>Even though your Kings may</i>
<i>have ordered you to fight,</i>

121
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,817
I urge you to lay down
your weapons right now.

122
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,717
Lay them down and wait...
for your King's next orders!

123
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:33,584
Hm?

124
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,984
Shut your mouth, you stray dog!
You don't give orders here!

125
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:40,984
Hyaaah!

126
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:44,650
I hate to admit it,
but the Monkey's right!

127
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:47,684
There's no reason to trust
anything you have to say!

128
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:52,617
Bastard!

129
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,150
So be it. I never really
expected to settle this
battle with words alone.

130
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:01,384
Who wants to be first?

131
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:04,717
Mr. Kusanagi!
The Black Dog
is out front!

The Black Dog, eh?
The kid in the video
must also be here.

get what's happening.

155
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,417
[Yashiro]
Um. I think I do.

156
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,917
Yeah sorry.

157
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,784
I'm pretty sure it's for me.

158
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:29,050
Would one of you
mind answering that?

159
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,784
[beep]
[all phones stop ringing]

160
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:39,050
Hello?

161
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,117
<i>Am I speaking to Mikoto</i>
<i>Suoh's first in charge,</i>
<i>Izumo Kusanagi?</i>

162
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:47,884
Uh, why, yes.

163
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,184
<i>There should be a man standing</i>
<i>somewhere near you with a</i>
<i>silly look on his face.</i>

164
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:54,650
<i>Put him on the</i>
<i>line, would you?</i>

165
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,984
Just a minute.

166
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,450
May I ask who's calling?

167
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:04,784
<i>Daikaku Kokujoji...</i>

168
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,450
<i>...The Gold King.</i>

169
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:52,334
We're not finished, are we?

170
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:56,334
More like we're just
getting started.

171
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:01,067
No more time-outs, pal.
We're going straight
through to the end.

172
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:05,334
Fine by me. It's not
like I would ever have
a choice in the matter.

173
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,434
Heh heh heh!

174
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,767
[evil voice]
That's right.
Fight to the end.

175
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:19,034
[voice reverts]
That's very strange.
It seems a little too quiet.

176
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:20,967
<i>[evil voice]</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

177
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:23,801
Okay, I'm
counting on you.

178
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:24,967
You'll have to hurry.

179
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,334
I can't believe it.
The day has gotten
really weird.

180
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,067
No kidding!
You can say
that again.

181
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:37,634
Sorry for all the trouble.
I'm afraid it couldn't be
helped.

182
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:38,901
<i>[Kokujoji]</i>
<i>Hmph.</i>

183
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:41,689
If you really feel that way,
how 'bout fulfilling some of
your responsibilities as a King?

184
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:45,022
Come on, that's mean.
You could give me a
little credit.

185
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:47,055
After all, isn't
that why I'm here?

186
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:51,189
You're there because
half of what's happening
is of your own doing.

187
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:55,222
You've gotten old and gray,
but you're still the same
old Lieutenant.

188
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:58,022
You just can't stop
lecturing me, can you?

189
00:14:58,222 --> 00:14:59,189
[amused]
Hmm.

190
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:01,922
So, my friend...

191
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,355
<i>How do you intend</i>
<i>to settle this?</i>

192
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,846
I see. Well, that's
typical of you.

193
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:21,669
<i>Just when I thought you had</i>
<i>finally returned, after being</i>
<i>gone for half a century.</i>

194
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:25,936
I wish we could have seen
each other, one last time.

195
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:29,736
If that's how you really feel,
then stop this.

196
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,936
Not that you're
going to listen to me.

197
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:34,003
You know me too
well, Lieutenant.

198
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:35,669
But thanks for the offer.

199
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,769
Unfortunately,
just like the last time,

200
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:41,436
...this is 'so long'.

201
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:43,703
<i>Alles gute mein freund.</i>

202
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:47,403
<i>Viel erfolg, Weismann.</i>

203
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:53,803
[small sigh]

204
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:57,303
<i>So...</i>

205
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:00,036
Silver King,
your highness.

206
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:02,936
Just call me Yashiro Isana.

207
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:06,769
<i>Very well, then. Yashiro.</i>

208
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:11,036
As you proposed to us,
there's an escape plan
to evacuate the students
from the school.

209
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:15,969
At present, both clans
are under control,
and they're escorting
the students out.

210
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:18,003
Everything's
going smoothly.

211
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:21,336
However, we do
have one concern.

212
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,303
<i>If the Colorless King</i>
<i>possesses a student,</i>
<i>he could escape our net.</i>

213
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,936
Don't worry, he's
only targeting Kings.

214
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:31,069
That's the primary
reason he lured the
Red and Blue Kings here.

215
00:16:31,503 --> 00:16:35,336
But that's not the only danger.
That's why we have to get all
the students evacuated.

216
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:39,003
If the swords were to fall,
there'd be mass destruction.

217
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:45,803
He's here!

218
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:47,436
[gasp]

219
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:50,436
[evil colorles king]
Me hee, ha ha ha ha!

220
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,803
<i>None of you are getting</i>
<i>out of here alive!</i>

221
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:55,069
<i>Oh, you can run,</i>
<i>but you can't hide!</i>

222
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:57,803
<i>You're all mine,</i>
<i>and I have big</i>
<i>plans for your demise!</i>

223
00:16:57,836 --> 00:16:59,803
This voice is killing me!
Where's it coming from?!

224
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:04,503
<i>You'll form a circle around</i>
<i>my fingertips, and I'll make</i>
<i>you dance until you drop!</i>

225
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:06,503
I can't stand it, Shiro!
He's in my head!

226
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:08,436
<i>Your experiences,</i>
<i>your strengths,</i>

227
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:10,869
Guess he's finally
making his move.
<i>your weaknesses,</i>
<i>all of it belongs to me, now!</i>

228
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:14,044
He couldn't have caught
us at a worse time!
We're not ready for this!

229
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:15,844
<i>Ah ha ha ha ha!</i>

230
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:19,310
[trembling with pain]
Nnhhahh...

231
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:20,777
Neko!

232
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,344
I am going to
need your power.

233
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,410
<i>More than you've</i>
<i>ever used before.</i>

234
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,844
What? What do you
want me to do, Shiro?

235
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:35,677
Something extremely important.
Y'see, to this day, I've never
had my own clansman.

236
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,977
I've always had to work alone.

237
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:39,744
I'm asking...

238
00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:42,710
Will you be the very
first one to help me out?

239
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:47,677
Of course I will! [sob]

240
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,810
Silly, I would do anything for
you! After all this time,
don't you know that by now?!

241
00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:04,244
I'm not going to let
you hurt these people!

242
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:12,410
Are we going to be killed?
I can't stand this anymore!

243
00:18:12,444 --> 00:18:16,377
Think about it! While
they're fighting each other,
we have a great opportunity!

244
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,377
Now's our chance
to escape!

245
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,710
How are we gonna do that?!

246
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,744
They're everywhere!
We'll never be able
to get away!

247
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:24,877
<i>Face it, we're</i>
<i>gonna die here!</i>

248
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,410
- Oh man!
- [crying]
- Oh no!

249
00:18:27,444 --> 00:18:30,477
Hey, stop it!
We can't give up here!

250
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:37,510
[crying]

251
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:41,444
[gasp]

252
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:45,377
Aren't you...?

253
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,877
Hey! Wait a minute!
You're the guy in
that video aren't you?!

254
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:51,810
<i>It's your fault that this</i>
<i>whole thing is happening--</i>

255
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:53,010
Hold on a second!

256
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,744
It is him!

257
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:58,277
Have we met?

258
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,710
<i>...somewhere before?</i>

259
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:02,944
Yeah, you're--

260
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:04,777
Uhh...

261
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,544
I can't remember.

262
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:08,944
Isa-- I almost had it.

263
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,944
It's very important that you all
get off this island, right now.

264
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:17,710
And trust me when I say,
I won't let anybody hurt you.

265
00:19:18,444 --> 00:19:20,910
That's good, but,
who exactly are you?

266
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,344
Just a friend.

267
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,744
I don't know you.
So why should I
trust you?

268
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,444
I'm confused.

269
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:29,910
Why are you here?!

270
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:33,477
Hm? I'm here to
protect you.

271
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:37,010
I know all of you.

272
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,744
But how can that be?

273
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:43,544
It's quite simple.
You're my precious friends,
every one of you.

274
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,310
I'm going to show you
all the way out now.

275
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:52,777
<i>Please trust me,</i>
<i>and follow my lead.</i>

276
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:06,844
Damn it!
Weismann!

277
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:07,910
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>I found you.</i>

278
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,944
Don't involve
innocent bystanders.

279
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,744
Let's you and I
put an end to this.

280
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:21,444
[weak breaths, faints]

281
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:22,344
Neko!

282
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,344
Shiro...

283
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:27,744
Did I... do okay?

284
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:31,744
Yes. Thank you
for all your help.

285
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,877
So he is the
Silver King.

286
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,310
Truly.

287
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,910
Were you able to get
everyone out safely, Anna?

288
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:50,944
Mmm.

289
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,510
Thank you so much,
both of you.

290
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,377
Watch over her,
if you would.

291
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:17,010
Of course we will.

292
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:26,910
And Munakata
and Suoh?
Please!

293
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:35,344
I wish I could reassure you.
I can't promise anything.
But I'll do the best I can.

294
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,410
To all of you,

295
00:21:47,477 --> 00:21:48,810
Viel glÃ¼ck!

296
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,244
[panting]

297
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,944
End me?
Heh heh heh heh!

298
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:09,544
An exercise in futility!
[giggles]

299
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:16,244
Once I've overcome and
neutralized the power of the
Red and Blue Kings, everything
will be mine for the taking!

300
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,910
[giggles]

301
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:19,910
But can you seriously
pull it off?

302
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,277
What a question!
Of course he can!

303
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,810
After all, he is the King!

304
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,544
I'm the strongest
King of all!

[giggles]

306
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,544
Heh!

307
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:38,044
He he he he!

308
00:22:38,077 --> 00:22:40,810
Hehe.. he... eh.

309
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:46,944
<i>Help me!</i>

310
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:25,167
<i>I am the First King, also know as The Silver King.And I am eternal.</i>

311
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:31,430
<i>Time has stood still for me since thatfateful day back in 1945.
Or so I had hoped.</i>

312
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,094
<i>But nothing can stay the same forever.</i>

313
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:40,834
<i>We must change at some point.
No, we gradually change as we interactwith the people around us.</i>

314
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:47,405
<i>Neko, thanks to your unconditional love, I was able to find my own place to call home.</i>

315
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:53,931
<i>Kuro, without your tacit belief in me,
I couldn't have faced the truth about myself.</i>

316
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:59,637
<i>I am Adolf K. Weismann.</i>
<i>But now I am also</i>
<i>Yashiro Isana.</i>

317
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:01,737
<i>And my friends</i>
<i>call me 'Shiro'.</i>

318
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:03,398
<i>I am here to protect them.</i>

319
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:07,418
<i>They're dear to me, and I won't let anyone hurt them. Ever.</i>

320
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:12,165
<i>Lieutenant, my dear sister... I won't runaway anymore.</i>

321
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:16,465
<i>Next time on "K",</i>
<i>The final episode:</i>
<i>"King".</i>

322
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,519
<i>Everything will be just fine,because Shiro is our King!</i>
