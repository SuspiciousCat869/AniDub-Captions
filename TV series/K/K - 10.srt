It is inexcusable. Not only did
I allow the Red King to escape,

<i>but I'm also responsible for</i>
<i>what has happened afterward.</i>

79

It's highly unusual to
see you so humble, but I
must say, Lieutenant,
I'm liking this new look.

00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,968
Thank you, Captain.

81
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:19,568
However, I think it
is extremely arrogant
for you to assume

82
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:23,335
that you are the one and
only one responsible for
stopping the Red King.

83
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:25,335
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:29,735
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>Let's put that behind us.</i>
<i>Right now we're facing a more</i>
<i>troublesome situation.</i>

85
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,255
How so?

86
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:38,788
Mikoto Suoh and his red
clansmen have taken over
the island high school.

87
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,822
This takeover can
mean only one thing.

88
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:44,422
That he's after Tatara's
Totsuka's killer.

89
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,588
I'm convinced that's
his main agenda.

90
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:51,322
But, we might have a total
disaster on our hands if the
person he is after,

91
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,222
is also a king.

92
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:55,522
The Colorless King, I assume.

93
00:07:57,722 --> 00:08:01,588
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>Yes. The Seventh King, the</i>
<i>Colorless King, is unlike</i>
<i>any of the other kings.</i>

94
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:05,788
<i>Each successive generation</i>
<i>exhibits a unique power</i>
<i>different from the prior ones.</i>

95
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:09,455
And no-one knows what that
power is, until it shows itself.

96
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:13,222
So it could possibly
disrupt the relationships
between kings.

97
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:16,655
And would have an effect
much like a joker in a
deck of cards.

98
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:21,655
You know, I've always
despised the joker.

99
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,955
Even the picture of
the jester on the card
reeks of trickery.

100
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:27,955
There's no sense
of honesty or
fairness about it.

101
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:31,922
Especially when it's
not in the hand that
I happen to be playing.

102
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:33,922
Good grief.

103
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:39,655
It would have been so
much simpler if he had
remained a recluse like
his predecessor, Miwa.

104
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:42,455
[Seri]
So the fact is that,
at any moment,

105
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:47,655
the short-fused Red King could
come into contact with the
unpredictable Colorless King.

106
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:51,888
If that happens, it could
create an extremely
volatile situation.

107
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:56,622
And what's more troubling,
we don't really know if the
Colorless King can even be
captured.

108
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:59,522
Our only alternative is to
restrain the Red King again.

109
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:04,555
At this point, an all-out
war with the Red Clansmen
seems inevitable.

110
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:07,322
Mm.

111
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:12,655
All units are ready
for battle, sir!
You may give the order

rather selfish request?

00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:21,822

not too cold?

When I'm next to you
I don't feel the cold.

148
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,382
Yata, I'm just telling
you for your own good.

149
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:01,615
But I guess you wouldn't
be you if you didn't go
around acting like an
idiot at times like this.

150
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:02,415
Hey, man!

151
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,582
I've noticed that you go
beyond ballistic whenever
Fushimi is in the mix.

152
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:10,782
Since you two were
partners back in the day,
I really shouldn't blame you.

153
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,948
With all due respect,
you're about to make me
go ballistic right now!

154
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:17,348
<i>Fushimi betrayed me</i>
<i>and that's never</i>
<i>gonna change!</i>

155
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:18,582
Oh!

156
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:22,615
<i>[Kusanagi]</i>
<i>By the way, since you'll</i>

<i>the rest of the night,</i>

157
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:26,248
<i>there's something I have to</i>

158
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:33,948
That's awesome, Boss!

159
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:36,415
Ha ha ha ha ha!

160
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:40,382
[sigh]

161
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,482
<i>[Yata]</i>
<i>You bastard!</i>
<i>You did what?!</i>

162
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:46,882
You heard me, Yata.
I said I went and
joined SCEPTER Four.

163
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:49,382
You've betrayed us!
Why, Fushimi, why?!

164
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:53,548
<i>It doesn't make sense!</i>
<i>Why join up with the</i>
<i>Blues of all people?!</i>

165
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:56,315
Egh!

166
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,382
<i>Did you forget</i>
<i>this mark?</i>

167
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:00,682
The symbol of
our true pride!

168
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:03,215
We've sworn our loyalty
to HOMRA with this!

169
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:07,315
Loyalty.

170
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:23,382
See, Misaki, I just wiped
out my true pride in HOMRA.

171
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,248
It's all gone.

172
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,582
I'm sorry if you
think I betrayed you.

173
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:29,748
But I need to go in a
different direction.

174
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:34,815
I want to use my special
power to engage in something
other than playing games
with gang bangers.

175
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,582
I'm sick to death of
being a punk from HOMRA.

176
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:41,848
Nice! This is your
gratitude to the
man who took you in
off the streets?

177
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:44,715
How dare you
disrespect him!

178
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:47,482
I know, but I must move on.

179
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:50,982
[chuckles] I don't wanna
waste my life playing the fool.

180
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,582
I want to be somebody who's
a lot more important.

181
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,782
You think you're
better than us?
Fuck you!

182
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,548
One day I'm going
to kill you!

183
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:01,982
Fuse.

184
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:02,748
Yes sir!

185
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:06,448
Did we get the go-ahead
for the raid yet?

186
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:10,782
No, sir. We're to
stay put unless
something out of the
ordinary happens.

187
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:13,382
<i>Orders from the Lieutenant</i>
<i>remain unchanged.</i>

188
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:14,882
Heh.

189
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:25,548
[Kusanagi]
I wonder how your boys feel
about you relaxing as they run
around all over the island.

190
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,715
<i>The king naps</i>
<i>while they work.</i>

191
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:30,548
That's what you're supposed
to do when you're king.

192
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:34,515
I think you may have a
misconceived impression
of your ruling duties.

193
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:40,715
I'm not saying you have to
necessarily work with us,
but do you intend to just
lie around waiting?

194
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,482
Yeah.

195
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,882
You think he'll
make a move?

196
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:47,215
Yeah.

197
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:47,882
Hm.

198
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:53,615
Well we, your loyal subjects,
will do our best to catch
him, in the event that
doesn't happen.

199
00:14:57,682 --> 00:15:00,215
<i>[Kusanagi]</i>
<i>The first time I saw</i>
<i>Totsuka looking at you,</i>

200
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:02,948
<i>I thought the guy might not</i>
<i>be dealing with a full deck.</i>

201
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:09,182
You gave him a death stare, but
he approached you anyway, like
you were a pair of old buddies.

202
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:16,682
What made him go around
boasting that you would
someday be a king and he
would be your vassal?

203
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:21,215
And then you actually did
become a king, like he said.

204
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:23,548
I had thought you weren't
right for the job.

205
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,482
All I saw was that you were
like a bomb with a short fuse.

206
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:29,482
<i>But Totsuka saw</i>
<i>something different.</i>

207
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,882
<i>He thought you could</i>
<i>bring people together</i>
<i>and protect them.</i>

208
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:35,948
Hmm. I think your
assessment of me was more
correct than his was.

209
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:40,448
<i>[Kusanagi]</i>
<i>To my surprise, you gave</i>
<i>up your quick temper and</i>
<i>became a strong king</i>

210
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,582
<i>who looked after his</i>
<i>people and served side</i>
<i>by side with them,</i>

211
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,782
<i>never making them feel</i>
<i>that you were superior</i>
<i>because of your position.</i>

212
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:52,748
<i>And we used to have so much</i>
<i>fun hanging out with you,</i>
<i>and laughing about all our</i>
<i>adventures together.</i>

213
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:55,548
<i>You were truly one with</i>
<i>the people you ruled.</i>

214
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,056
[sigh] Stop traveling
down memory lane.

215
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,420
Yeah, you're right. There's no
point in clinging to the good
old days. What's past is past.

216
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,920
Anna, you better
come with me now.

217
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,420
Mikoto needs to take
care of some business.

218
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,987
Mmm.

219
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:23,453
Somebody's here
to see you.

220
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,920
<i>[Kusanagi]</i>
<i>When all is</i>
<i>said and done,</i>

221
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:45,553
we couldn't have asked
for a better king.

222
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:52,920
Mm?

223
00:16:59,087 --> 00:16:59,853
Hm.

224
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,620
Isn't sharing the same
air with me supposed
to be toxic for you?

225
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:10,453
Not any more toxic than
the air I'm about to
blow in your direction.

226
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:24,387
Heh.

227
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:33,987
<i>[Munakata]</i>
<i>Let me be very direct.</i>

228
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:35,787
Mm?

229
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,987
Just peacefully relinquish
control of this school.

230
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,120
I'll try to overlook the way
you've been involving innocent
pupils in your search, but I
can't guarantee it.

231
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:50,520
However, if you agree to comply
now, we can settle this before
things get out of hand.

232
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:53,053
Gee, that's a really
super suggestion.

233
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,053
<i>[Mikoto]</i>
<i>But you can't actually</i>
<i>think I'll do it.</i>

234
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:59,587
[Munakata]
It's not a suggestion.
It's an ultimatum.

235
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,520
You've gone too far,
Suoh.

236
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:06,087
You need to let me find
Totsuka's murderer.

237
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,120
I promise this guy who claims
to be the Colorless King will
be caught and convicted.

238
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,387
Mm...

239
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,487
If you give me your consent
to go after him, I'll give
you my word that you can
chose how he'll be executed.

240
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:19,387
That's an offer that's
almost too good to pass up.

241
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:21,987
But I have to
say no thanks.

242
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,820
I'm sure I needn't remind
you of the very precarious
shape your sword of Damocles
is in at the present time.

243
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:32,020
And because the sword is
a symbolic representation
of a king,

244
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:35,120
it always reveals the
truest impression of
the king's condition.

245
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:39,453
Sad to say, your
sword will come
crashing down soon.

246
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:40,953
Don't believe it.

247
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:44,160
I know that right
now, your Weismann
level is precariously
close to the edge.

248
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,793
If you take on the added
burden of killing a
king, it will certainly
exceed your limit.

249
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:52,726
You will cause a
repeat of the Kagutsu
Crater tragedy.

250
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,726
And you will have to
give up your right
to be a king.

251
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,226
Why not step down now,
and avoid all this?

252
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,660
I have never taken any action
as king but this is one thing
I want to accomplish.

253
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,993
Think about the innocent
students who could be
harmed by your actions.

254
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:12,693
And you know what will
happen to your own men.

255
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:19,760
Am I making
myself clear?

256
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,593
I have to settle my
business on my own terms.

257
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:28,693
And you do, too.
Am I making
myself clear?

258
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:30,960
If that's all,
I think we're
done here.

259
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:38,626
You are stubborn.

260
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:40,560
It's impossible to
ever reason with you.

261
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:46,560
C'mon, you didn't come here
yourself because you thought you
could change my mind did you?

262
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,193
That's not like you.

263
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:54,160
No, it isn't. I just came
here to see a an old friend.

264
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:55,826
Hm.

265
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:02,314
Better go back.

266
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:10,914
You're positive?
Last chance to
walk away.

267
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:13,881
Nope, my mind's made up.

268
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:15,881
Ugh.

269
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,314
<i>Fool.</i>

270
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:20,947
[Yashiro]
Finally, we're back!

271
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:22,581
[gasp]

272
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:23,547
Uh!

273
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,281
Whoah! It looks like we must
have been burglarized!

274
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,985
On what planet would
burglars blast a hole
in the floor just to
get in and out?!

275
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:30,685
<i>[Neko]</i>
<i>No-o-o-o-o!!!</i>

276
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:35,185
Look what happened
to my bowl!
It was my favorite!!

277
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:39,752
We were lucky to escape
when the airship burst
into a massive fireball,

278
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:43,585
And it looks like we're lucky
to have been away when this
apartment was trashed.

279
00:20:47,753 --> 00:20:52,253
We had to come back when we
heard the entire school island
was under HOMRA's control,

280
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:55,176
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>But I never thought the Red</i>
<i>King would be here as well.</i>

281
00:20:55,743 --> 00:21:00,443
And the outside perimeter of
the school is guarded by the
Blues. The island has been
taken over by the clans.

282
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:04,910
[sigh] Guess hunting for
my true identity will be
put on hold for a while.

283
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:07,343
Unfortunately,
it had to come
to this.

284
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:12,176
In a worst-case scenario,
this island could become a
battleground for a clan war.

285
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:15,010
Maybe we shouldn't have
come back after all.

286
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:17,376
I've told you already!

287
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,943
This is our home,
we have to stay here!

288
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:23,010
It's the best place to be!
Let's get busy and clean it up!

289
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,643
[Yashiro]
Neko's right.

290
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:29,543
We need to do a major
cleanup job to make
it livable again.

291
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,176
Once we're finished with
that, we have to figure
out what to do next.

292
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:37,510
Why don't we ask
Master Ichigen?

293
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:39,376
What?

294
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:43,076
You said he was
supposed to have the
ability to see into the
future, am I right?

295
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:48,510
Maybe he would have some
insight, and could lend us
some advice on what to do;
it would sure be helpful.

296
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,243
I doubt it.

297
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:07,076
We know what to do next.
Think about it for a minute.

298
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,243
Oh!

299
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,443
We need to go rescue
Kukuri and all the other
students at the school.

300
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,076
We don't need Master Ichigen
to tell us what's obvious.

301
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,443
Mm-hm!

302
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,343
Yeah. You're right,
as usual.

303
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,110
Now, first things first.
We need to start by
discovering where Kukuri
and the others are hiding.

304
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:28,643
Neko! Let's go!

305
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:31,076
Huh?! But what about..!

306
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,010
It's alright. We'll
come straight back here
as soon as we're done.

307
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,643
Bye bye.

308
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:26,954
[Kusanagi]
Oh boy. Looks like there's no
turning back now. Right, Mikoto?

309
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:28,369
<i>[Mikoto]</i>
<i>Yeah...</i>

310
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:30,969
<i>[Kusanagi]</i>
<i>Just between you and me,</i>

311
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,435
<i>there was a time when I</i>
<i>thought everything would</i>
<i>work out for HOMRA.</i>

312
00:24:36,135 --> 00:24:42,302
<i>You, me, Yata, Rikio,</i>
<i>Anna, Totsuka.</i>

313
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:45,835
<i>We'd all be fighting and</i>
<i>arguing every single day,</i>

314
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:50,702
<i>but still have a good</i>
<i>time and always end up</i>
<i>at the usual place.</i>

315
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:52,769
<i>[Mikoto]</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

316
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,443
<i>[Kusanagi]</i>
<i>But oh well. We've come</i>
<i>this far, so we might</i>
<i>as well finish this.</i>

317
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:01,177
<i>Heh. Let's do it.</i>

318
00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:05,476
<i>[Mikoto]</i>
<i>Hey... Izumo.</i>

319
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,643
<i>[Kusanagi]</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

320
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:07,876
<i>[Mikoto]</i>
<i>Sorry for all the trouble.</i>

321
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:09,243
<i>[Kusanagi]</i>
<i>No problem.</i>

322
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,664
<i>[Mikoto]</i>
<i>Next time on K,</i>
<i>Episode Eleven,</i>
<i>'Killer'.</i>

323
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:19,595
<i>[Kusanagi]</i>
<i>We're going out with a bang.</i>
<i>There'll be no blood,</i>
<i>no bone and no ash.</i>
