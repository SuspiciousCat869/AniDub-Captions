<i>Just a reminder for all of you</i>
<i>who are busy preparing for the</i>
<i>upcoming school festival.</i>

2
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,623
<i>Please don't get</i>
<i>carried away with any</i>
<i>unofficial activities,</i>

3
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:30,423
<i>and always remember to</i>
<i>uphold the traditions</i>
<i>and honor of our school.</i>

4
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:34,589
<i>Your families will be joining</i>
<i>us on festival day and will</i>
<i>be able to see the results</i>

5
00:00:34,623 --> 00:00:38,323
<i>of all the hard work you</i>
<i>put into this event during</i>
<i>these past few weeks.</i>

6
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:42,123
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Are these all of the costumes?</i>
<i>It's important that you check</i>
<i>the ones you're going to wear.</i>

7
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:45,489
Once you do, be sure to let
me know if you're having any
trouble with the sizes.

8
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:47,556
How are the decorations
coming along?

9
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:49,556
We're not quite done yet.

10
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:51,923
Okay. I'll get
you some help.

11
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:54,589
Let's see who might
be free right now.

12
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,289
Rice crackers!
Rice crackers!
Rice crackers!

13
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,456
Hm? What do you
need, Kuroh?

14
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:02,889
I noticed your left sleeve
is torn at the elbow.

15
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,523
Oh. You're right.

16
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:08,256
Guess I must have
caught it on something.

17
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:11,123
When can I have
my rice crackers!
-I'll fix it. I have
a needle and thread.

18
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:12,856
It'll just take
a minute.

19
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:16,089
[Neko] [whimper]
Rice crackers...

20
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,224
When can I have them?

21
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:21,824
<i>Be patient.</i>

22
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,457
Hmm...

23
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:42,853
Half past midnight.

24
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,687
Phew! I believe
that's within an
hour of the crime!

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,920
It would have been
impossible to sneak back
in here from the crime
scene by then. So...

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,287
[Kuroh]
Yashiro, what are you doing?

27
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:12,620
Quit wasting time.
There's a lot of
work to do.

28
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:14,720
[Neko]
Shiro got in trouble!

29
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:18,920
<i>Ouch! Kuroh! Please keep your</i>
<i>eyes on what you're doing!</i>

30
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,620
Hm.

31
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:24,620
Sorry about that!
What was it I was
supposed to be
doing right now?

32
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:25,887
Well...

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,020
Let's all have some
rice crackers!

34
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,253
You're supposed to
be helping with
these preparations!

35
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:31,753
Can we please finish
up this patch job?

36
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:33,487
Oh! You know what?

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,187
Shiro, if you don't have
an assignment, can I ask
you to do me a favor?

38
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:39,620
[nervous]
Ahh?

39
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:15,169
<i>[Seri]</i>
<i>Yes...</i>

40
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,069
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>

41
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:19,369
...At Ashinaka High School.

42
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:28,136
It happened a few minutes ago.
The Yuishiki System has
identified someone there who's
a 91 percent match.

43
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,103
That's right.
No question.

44
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:34,969
I want to go there, to
confirm this information
with my own eyes.

45
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,969
Yes, I understand.
I'll let you know.

46
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,636
We have authorization.

47
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,669
We will now head to the
school on the island,
to confirm the
suspect's presence.

48
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:45,903
Yes Ma'am!
Yes Ma'am!

49
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,036
Have a safe
trip, you guys.

50
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,403
Fushimi. You're
coming as well.

51
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:52,003
Are you serious?

52
00:04:57,436 --> 00:04:59,469
What will you do if you
find this murderer?

53
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:01,436
Take him into custody,
of course.

54
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,469
And if he should resist?

55
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,469
That's a stupid question.

56
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:11,036
[panicked sounds]
Gyaahh!
Yahh!

57
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:21,536
So we use this to get in?
Psh. What a pain in the ass.

58
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:23,936
You ready?

59
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:25,169
Hyea.

60
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,169
We're going for
a walk! [giggle]

61
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:42,903
Please explain to
me why you keep
using this exit?

62
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:46,236
[Yashiro]
I told you before,
I mis-placed my PDA.

63
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:50,269
[Yashiro]
Oh, wait, maybe I should just
install my passcode into yours.

64
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:52,936
[Kuroh]
That's not going to happen.
Just get a new one.

65
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:56,169
[Neko]
Shiro! Hurry, hurry!
[giggles]

66
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,969
[Kuroh]
One of our assignments
is to go into town and
order more fireworks,

67
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:03,436
because you blew up the
other ones when you were
trying to escape.

68
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,303
I really didn't have
much choice, You were
trying to kill me.

69
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,436
Let's just get
this over with.
I'm very busy.

70
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,569
Wow, you're really
getting into this.

71
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:13,169
Hm?

SHOW SOME RESPECT!

79
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,350
Okay. We're
all going in.

80
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:08,284
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:25,384
[Seri]
We apologize for this rather
sudden and unexpected request,
but we need your cooperation.

82
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,250
I want to reiterate,
we're just doing our jobs.

83
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:30,084
<i>We don't want to</i>
<i>cause your school</i>
<i>any trouble.</i>

84
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,850
We understand what
you're looking for...

85
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:41,384
But in this day and
age, releasing personal
student information is,
a breach of secur--

86
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:45,250
<i>I need you to understand,</i>
<i>sir, that this is a</i>
<i>high-priority request.</i>

87
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:48,717
<i>If need be, we are prepared</i>

88
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,317
Uh we can't have that!

89
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:56,184
<i>We agree. That's why,</i>
<i>under the circumstances,</i>
<i>we'd like to handle things</i>

90
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:59,784
<i>We'd prefer that you</i>
<i>cooperate willingly</i>
<i>with our request.</i>

91
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:03,184
<i>That's why we met with</i>
<i>you privately, rather</i>
<i>than get a warrant.</i>

92
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:07,717
[Principal]
I understand. But asking us
to identify a student from
the entire student body,

93
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,550
when you don't even
have a name, is
nearly impossible.

94
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:15,850
[Vice-Principal]
With such short notice, there's
very little hope of success, if
we have to do this search today.

95
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:21,317
<i>[Seri]</i>
<i>Let me make myself clear.</i>
<i>This investigation has</i>
<i>already been authorized.</i>

96
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,850
<i>If your school lacks the means</i>
<i>or the personnel to conduct</i>
<i>such an investigation,</i>

97
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,884
<i>we will step in</i>
<i>and do it for you.</i>

98
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,650
<i>What?! That's</i>
<i>going too far!</i>

99
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:30,584
You have no right to
come in and here and--

100
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:32,550
I think you
misunderstand
what I'm saying.

101
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:35,250
We're not trying
to 'persuade' you
to cooperate.

102
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:37,850
<i>That doesn't reflect the</i>
<i>gravity of the situation.</i>

103
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,384
We're here to order you to
comply with our demands.

104
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:41,917
[Principal]
But that's...

105
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,850
[Seri]
As I said earlier, it is
not our wish to turn this
into a public issue.

106
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:50,450
However, I have no
reservations about using the
law to take the appropriate
action in this situation.

Huh??

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,116
What's the deal?
I just said we want
to ask some questions,
that's--

152
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,150
Yowww!

153
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,750
Stop! fatass!

154
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:18,850
Don't go scaring girls like
that! or I'll kill you!

155
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,683

Haven't I told you
over and over, to
never threaten girls?!

161
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,704
Yeah, but I didn't
threaten them!

162
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:38,304
I mean, I had to
do something.

163
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:41,038
All this time,
you've only been
talking to guys!

164
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:43,038
We have to talk to
the girls, too.

165
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:45,738
No way, if you
want to find a guy,
you ask guys!

166
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:47,071

What a shock to see you.
How did you find this place?

171
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:01,871
Right... It must
have been Anna.

172
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:05,438
And you can't be out here
on Mr. Kusanagi's orders;

173
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:10,371
he isn't stupid enough to
send the two of you out
alone. Right, Misaki?

174
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:12,771
I'm not surprised.
You never change.

175
00:13:12,804 --> 00:13:13,638
Shut your mouth!

176
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:20,104
Don't you call me by that name,
damn it! And don't talk about
my people like you know them!

177
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:23,404
I know you. And you're
nothing but a traitor!

178

[chuckle] Can you blame me?

179
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:30,304
The fact of the matter is,
in the end, I wasn't like
you and the others.

180
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:32,738
My leaving HOMRA
was inevitable.

181
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:37,338
Yeah! You are damn right
about that part of it!
You sure weren't like
the rest of us!

182
00:13:38,404 --> 00:13:42,104
You need to cool down, Yata.
The last thing we want to do
is make a scene.

183

Let me put it to
you this way.

185
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:50,038
It's none of your
fuckin' business!

186
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:54,071
I happen to know that
security's pretty tight here.
Where's your pass?

187
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:56,871
Come on, show it
to me, MISAKI!

188
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,671
I just said,
it's none of
your business!

189
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:03,704
And stop calling me
by my first name.
When you do it, it
creeps me out.

190
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:06,038
That's right.
What a dummy I am.

191
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:09,804
I had completely forgotten.
You hate being called by
that name, don't you?

Heh he he he he!

196
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:24,204
Don't get in trouble!
Remember what Mr. Kusanagi said!

197
00:14:24,804 --> 00:14:27,138
We don't want Mikoto's
capture to be in vain!

198
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:31,138
Fighting that monkey
isn't going to
accomplish anything.

199
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:39,338
You're doing this
for Mikoto?
Really?

200
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:46,138
I'm afraid your hero
has lost his edge.
After all, he willingly
went to jail.

201
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:49,371
I wonder if that means
he's finally grown up?

202
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,271
He could teach
you a few things...

203
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:55,104
Mi... sa... kiiii.

Now ready for battle.

00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:23,771
Heh! Not as sharp as
you used to be, monkey!

<i>No...</i>

In fact...

213
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:32,804
...I'm much stronger.

214
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:36,038

Heh! What's the
matter, monkey?

<i>Didn't you hear what</i>
<i>I just told you?</i>

220
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:21,291
Since I walked away from HOMRA
and the presence of Mikoto Suoh,
I've acquired even more power!

221
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:23,524
As you can see for yourself,
here's the proof!

222
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:28,457
Two colors!
Dual powers!
Damn!

223
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:29,291
Huh?

224
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:35,257
Keep your nose out of this
fight, punk! This is no
place for a loser like you!

225
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,057

He's actually right.

228
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:47,057
You need to stay out of this.

Heh heh.

because you've gained some

out here in broad daylight?

Egh...

Of the Red King's faction?

HOMRA's front-line. You also go
by the name...Yatagarasu.

But the only one who calls
me that is the owner of a

00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:36,391
Huh?

251
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:38,357
Be that as it may,

252
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:42,191
I must tell you that I cannot
condone your activities here
in the middle of a school day.

253
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:46,891
Unfortunately, there's too
much to lose if I decide
to make an issue of your
presence on this campus.

254
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:51,124
How about if the two of you
postpone your confrontation
to another time?

255

Tch! He's the one
who started the
whole thing!

256
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:57,157
I see. Perhaps
I didn't make
myself clear.

257
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:01,357
You will postpone this
confrontation. Immediately.

258
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,291
Or pay the price.

259

Was that better?

00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:07,391

about how bad the food is.

00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:23,024
Then he eats every crumb,
curls up, and goes to sleep.

266
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,091
I have to say,
he's quite a
piece of work.

00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,991
I've never seen him before.

300
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,703
<i>[Yata]</i>
<i>Fuck! I keep</i>
<i>hitting dead-ends!</i>

301
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:28,303
<i>Worse than that,</i>
<i>I had to run into</i>
<i>that monkey!</i>

302
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,870
<i>I can't afford to</i>
<i>waste any more time!</i>

303
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,470
<i>I've gotta find the</i>
<i>bastard who killed Tatara!</i>

304
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,836
<i>I'm not gonna let him</i>
<i>get away with this.</i>

305
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:39,903
<i>I had such crazy fun with</i>
<i>Mr. Mikoto and the guys.</i>

306
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,436
<i>And with one pull</i>
<i>of the trigger,</i>
<i>that son of a bitch</i>
<i>destroyed it all!</i>

307
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:47,570
<i>He's going to pay for</i>
<i>this with his life!</i>

308
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:52,970
<i>[Rikio]</i>
<i>Excuse me! Another order</i>
<i>of fried rice over here!</i>

309
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,436
<i>[Yata]</i>
<i>Damn it, do you</i>
<i>ever stop eating?!!</i>

310
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,670
<i>[Rikio]</i>
<i>You know, you should eat</i>
<i>something too, Yata.</i>

311
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,736
<i>You don't want to collapse</i>
<i>from starvation when we</i>
<i>find the killer, right?</i>

312
00:25:01,336 --> 00:25:02,270
<i>[Yata]</i>
<i>Rikio...</i>

313
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:03,836
<i>[Rikio]</i>
<i>Yata.</i>

314
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,503
<i>But I'll tell you what,</i>
<i>why don't I finish your</i>
<i>plate for now?</i>

315
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:09,403
<i>[Munching] Oh yeah, can</i>
<i>I also get another plate</i>
<i>of pot stickers too!!</i>

316
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:11,503
<i>[Yata]</i>
<i>Hey! Ugh.</i>

317
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:14,236
<i>Next time on 'K'.</i>
<i>Episode 6,</i>
<i>'Karma'!</i>

318
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,670
<i>You fat-ass bastard!!</i>
