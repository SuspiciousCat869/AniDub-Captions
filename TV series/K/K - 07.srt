Go ahead,
draw your sword.

Listen to me.

46
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,381
This sword was never
intended to kill the
likes of you!

47

Then you can prepare
to be slain by the
likes of me!

48

Hmm.

00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:22,814
Perhaps it's time for you
to do some work, sir.

52
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,381
Let's see you dodge this!

Mrowwrr!

54
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:46,114
What is that?

55
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:54,814
The Sword of Damocles!

It's announcing
someone's arrival!

57

Well done, Ms. Awashima.

60
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,981
Thanks to your efforts,
I now have a clear grasp
of the situation.

61

Sir!

62
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,847
Now that I'm here, I guess
I'd better get to work.

63
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:31,214
Mr. Fushimi is growing
quite impatient with me.

65
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:42,814
Hm.

67
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:57,314
Yah!

68
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:01,714
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>Just as I suspected,</i>
<i>a third party.</i>

69
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:05,047
An unknown Strain was
behind all of this
from the beginning.

70
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:11,881
<i>If you don't already know,</i>
<i>A Strain can project their</i>
<i>powers outward, to form a</i>
<i>perimeter around themselves.</i>

71
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:14,247
<i>Within that area they can</i>
<i>interfere with and manipulate</i>

72
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:16,981
<i>the senses and perceptions of</i>
<i>those humans around them.</i>

73
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:20,081
As you can imagine,
it's a dangerous power.

74

meow...

75
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,881
Hey Kuroh,
shouldn't we
surrender?

76
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:38,147
Heh.

77
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:42,047
Here's what's
gonna happen.
I'll hold off
their leader.

78
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:44,481
You two will have to
find a way to escape.

79
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:44,947

Seal off the

<i>I'll send in the men</i>
<i>from the outside.</i>

88
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:19,447
I see. So you chose to
sacrifice yourself.

89
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,327
<i>[Reisi]</i>
<i>I recognize your sword.</i>

90
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,227
Uh!?

91
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,427
It's called Kotowari, and used
to belong to Ichigen Miwa, known
as the Colorless King.

92
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:32,427
If you think you can kill me
with that, go ahead and try.

93
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,593
Heh.

94
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:43,660
What's the matter,
didn't you hear me?

95
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,060
I'm giving you permission.
Draw that sword.

96
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:53,227
<i>That's more like it.</i>

97
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,960
<i>No?</i>

98
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:59,127
Such a disobedient child.

99
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,293
Gyahh!

100
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,460
If you insist on
being so stubborn,
you leave me no
choice.

101
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,327
<i>This is a silly exercise,</i>
<i>my friend. What do you say</i>
<i>we end this game now?</i>

102
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,060
I refuse.

103
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,260
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Yaaaaaaah!</i>

104
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:52,260
Now then. Let's get to the
subject at hand, shall we?

105
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,927
Aah!

106
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,627
This way!

107
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,193
Shiro! We have to hurry!

108
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:17,708
I applaud your
self-sacrifice.

109
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,374
Let me ask you
something.

110
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:23,308
That young man
you've been helping.

111
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:28,974
Is he the master you serve now?
The successor to the late
Colorless King?

112
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:31,841
The Seventh, and
weakest king?

113
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,041
Rrgh.

114
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:36,808
He is not a powerful
presence by himself alone.

115
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:39,674
But in the current situation,
he is the wild card

116
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,074
who could end up tipping the
balance of power between the
remaining kings.

117
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:47,941
In other words, he is the one
person in this whole mix that I
need to handle carfully.

118
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:52,574
That young man is the new
Colorless King who will
replace Ichigen Miwa.

119
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,674
I'm right about
that, aren't I?

120
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,974
You would do well
to answer me.

121
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:04,008
Master Ichigen sent me to
evaluate that young man.

122
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,574
Very interesting.
So what is your verdict?

123
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:12,908
I won't let anyone
touch him until I make
that final decision.

124
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:17,941
I understand. But I'm afraid
that might have been the
boy's plan, from the start.

125
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,341
He doesn't have to take
the side of good or evil.

126
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:26,674
And as long as he maintains
that ambiguous position,

127
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:31,508
he can keep the 'Black Dog',
Kuroh Yatogami,
as his bodyguard.

128
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,774
He could not ask for
a more powerful pawn.

129
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:41,341
Using the powers of that young
female Strain, deceiving both
you and the other people around
him would be a simple matter.

130
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:48,441
We could be the fools.
All of us might be nothing
more than puppets in that
young man's scheme.

131
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,441
Wouldn't you agree, Kuroh?

132
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:52,574
You have a point.

133
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:55,108
He constantly laughs,
like some kind of fool.

134
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:57,808
And everything that comes
out of his mouth is a lie.

135
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,741
<i>But, that's just the</i>
<i>kind of guy he is.</i>

136
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:05,774
I guess you have to ask
yourself, Is that the
kind of guy worth
risking your life over?

137
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:07,941
Hm.

138
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,541
Hm...

139
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:11,541
Heh.

140
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,774
So! What brings
you back to us?
Did you forget
something?

141
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:28,908
Get out of here,
you fool!

142
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:30,708
Augh!

143
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:34,908
Well now. I thought about it,
and just didn't feel I could
go and leave my friend behind.

144
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:39,474
Selfless. So you came back here
to share your fate together.

145
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:42,608
That is a noble
gesture on your part.

146
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:45,041
But ultimately meaningless.

147
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:49,741
Actually, as I think
you'll see, it's not
all that meaningless.

148
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:50,808
Oh?

149
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:54,474
I just want to say to Kuroh...
Sorry!

150
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,074
<i>I've been lying to</i>
<i>you all this time.</i>

151
00:12:57,108 --> 00:13:00,808
It's time to tell the truth.
This is who I really am.

152
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:10,474
[gasp]

153
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:12,508
Whoa!

00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:16,974
I fell for it,
hook, line, and sinker.

160
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,074
All right, Fushimi.
Time to call in the
local authorities.

161
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:26,341
<i>Roger.</i>

162
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,941
[Kuroh]
[groan]

163
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:39,808
Kuroh! Are you okay?

164
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:43,041
My injuries are not serious.

165
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,808
I'll be fine in a
couple of minutes.

166
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:58,441
So, Neko.
Listen to me.

167
00:14:58,474 --> 00:14:59,041
Uh?

168
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,508
I have to tell
you something.
You were great.

169
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:07,741
If those blue soldiers had
caught us, They would have
locked us away for a long time.

170
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,774
<i>But the way you took over and</i>
<i>transported us to that</i>
<i>downtown street, was amazing.</i>

171
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:16,508
There's no question about it.
You're the one who saved us.

172
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:18,574
[Neko]
I... don't know
what you mean.

173
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:21,508
I guess you don't realize
what kind of power you have.

174
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:25,674
The Blue Leader said
you have the ability
to interfere with
people's perceptions.

175
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,041
I'm not really
sure I understand
what that means.

176
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:30,908
Her powers aren't
limited to the visual
and auditory.

177
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:36,608
Apparently, in
manipulating perception,
she can even play with a
person's memory.

178
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:40,074
I've never heard of
such a thing.

179
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:42,441
[Kuroh]
She is what is called a Strain.

180
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:45,408
<i>She can create false</i>
<i>memories in people,</i>

181
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:50,541
<i>even make people who've</i>
<i>never met before,</i>
<i>believe they're actually</i>
<i>dear, old friends.</i>

182
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:53,441
You're brazen.

183
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:54,674
Not funny.

184
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,641
C'mon!

185
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:56,541
Here.

186
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:57,074
Thanks!

187
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:57,974
Yeah, okay!

188
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:58,908
I'm not eating all of mine!

189
00:15:58,941 --> 00:15:59,808
Thanks!

190
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,941
Try this!

191
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:01,641
Whoops!

192
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:13,541
Ohh, I see. It's all
finally coming together.
That explains everything.

193
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,574
<i>Okay, then.</i>

194
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:17,941
<i>Neko.</i>

195
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:22,074
I need you to get
rid of my amnesia.

196
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:24,808
No more phony
memories.

197
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:28,474
That way, we'll finally
know the truth.

198
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:31,441
We'll discover whether or
not I'm that evil king.

199
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:34,008
You should be
aware, though.

200
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,408
If I find out you
are that evil king,

201
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:39,441
<i>I'll have no choice but</i>
<i>to kill you on the spot.</i>

202
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:42,374
Of course.
I understand.

203
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:48,074
Your life is at stake
in this decision.
Calm down and think
it over carefully.

204
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,041
I am calm.

205
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,474
I mean it.

206
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:56,908
Whatever you say.

207
00:16:56,941 --> 00:17:01,741
I just want you to know,
I'm open to discussing this,
once we've successfully
escaped from here.

208
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,041
You know...
I'm tired of that.

209
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:12,674
Putting things off, that's
all we've been doing.

210
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:16,108
<i>"We'll do it tomorrow".</i>
<i>"We'll think about it later".</i>

211
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:17,774
That's not getting us anywhere.

212
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:21,616
<i>If we can't deal with this</i>
<i>right here and now, then</i>
<i>we're just running in place.</i>

213
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,116
<i>I don't know who I</i>
<i>was in the past.</i>

214
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,316
<i>But the person I am this</i>
<i>very second needs to find</i>
<i>out what's going on and</i>
<i>finally take responsibility.</i>

215
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,583
I don't think I'm evil, but I
need to know for sure.

216
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,250
More importantly, however,

217
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:35,183
No matter what I might
have done in the past,

218
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:39,183
I feel I should be judged
by the nature and quality
of my present behavior.

219
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,283
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Such commendable ideas.</i>
<i>Are they really yours?</i>

220
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:45,550
Heh heh heh!
Oh...

221
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:55,283
Let's see where
this takes us.

222
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:01,250
All right.
I'm ready.

223
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:03,616
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>Go ahead, Neko.</i>

224

[Kuroh]
Undo your spell completely.
And remember, no tricks.

Eek!

Oh uh. Hello, there!

00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,529
Are you okay? I've never seen
you before. Who are you?
Where are you from?

You said Yashiro Isana?

Well, of course
you're Yashiro Isana!

But why in the world are
you hiding out in here?

252

Wait, I know! You were trying
to avoid helping with the
school festival preparations!

Sure, why not?
