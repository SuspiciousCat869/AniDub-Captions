00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:39,340
<i>[Yata]</i>
<i>Hey, it's me!</i><i> This place is</i>
<i>humongous!</i>

2
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,440
<i>I'm gonna focus on</i>
<i>guarding the front.</i>
<i>That's all I can handle.</i>

3
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,740
But to do that I'm
gonna need a few more
guys over here, okay?

4
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:47,373
Copy that. Right away.

5
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:50,240
Hey! You two,
go back up Yata.

6
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,640
Yes, Boss!

7
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,773
<i>[Munakata]</i>
<i>Let me be very direct.</i>

8
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,807
Just peacefully relinquish
control of this school.

9
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,773
I'll try to overlook the way
you've been involving innocent
pupils in your search but I
can't guarantee it.

10
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:17,301
I'm sure I needn't remind
you of the very precarious
shape your sword of Damocles
is in at the present time.

11
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:21,434
And because the sword is
a symbolic representation
of a king,

12
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:24,968
it always reveals the
truest impression of
the king's condition.

13
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:29,068
Sad to say, your
sword will come
crashing down soon.

14
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:30,434
Don't believe it.

15
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:34,898
I know that right now,
your Weismann level is
precariously close to
the edge.

16
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:39,537
If you take on the added
burden of killing a king,
it will certainly exceed
your limit.

17
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:43,137
You will cause a
repeat of the Kagutsu
Crater tragedy.

18
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:46,237
And you will have to give
up your right to be a king.

19
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:50,037
Why not step down now,
and avoid all this?

20
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:55,037
Mm?

21
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:01,637
Huh?

22
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,071

Oh...

00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:45,704
Lieutenant.
Are we going in?

26
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:52,004
How about we use a boat or
a chopper to gain entry?

27
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,537
Either way, they'll
burn us alive.

28
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:58,104
How long do we stay
here biding our time?

29

30
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,961

Red King again.

Yeah!

Miss Awashima.

45

I'm leaving you in charge
of this offensive.

46

We will advance
with our swords
in our hands!

47

We will triumph,
because our cause

00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:45,561
Hm?

163
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:54,861
Hah.

164
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:11,694
I understand the
situation now.

165
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:14,161
Then we can cut
to the chase.

166
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:16,594
I just need you to
keep quiet and watch.

167
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:18,294
Kuroh!

168
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:21,594
Tch.

169
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,794
Munakata,
don't interfere!

170
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:34,161
[Yashiro]
We should be safe here for now!

171
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,694
Their inevitable battle
has just begun.

172
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:49,894
I don't get it! He wasn't
affected by my illusions!

173
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:51,561
I've got nothing
else to use!

174
00:15:51,794 --> 00:15:53,128
I'm totally burned out!

175
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,561
Let's go.
C'mon, Shiro.

176
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:59,061
while those guys are
fighting with each other!
Now's our chance.

177
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:01,261
Let's run far away,
while we still can.

178
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:02,761
Neko...

179
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:07,228
C'mon! Now that we've rescued
Kukuri, we can take her with us.

180
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:08,261
<i>But...</i>

181
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:12,928
Sorry, I wish we had more
time to explain it to you.

182
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:16,194
Don't worry, though.
We'll find you some place
that's safer than this.

183
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:18,594
I'm fine here.

184
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:21,094
But wait!
You've been injured!

185
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:22,661
Huh?!

186
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,261
I'm alright.
It doesn't even hurt.

187
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:26,861
Let me see it.

188
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:32,761

189
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:34,294
