00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:05,428
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Well, that's you, isn't it?</i>

2
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:07,562
<i>Answer me.</i>

3
00:02:12,662 --> 00:02:13,395
<i>Yashiro Isana!</i>

4
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:14,495
Mrowwwr!
Mm!

5
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:18,528
I was a vassal of
Ichigen Miwa.

6
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:22,028
He is the former
Seventh King.

7
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:23,162
I must now take...

8
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:24,228
<i>Hold on a minute!</i>

9
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:25,595
...your life!

10
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:40,028
Hold on a minute!
Are you seriously
going to kill me?

11
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:41,628
Are you going to resist?

12
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,495
I didn't do it!
I'm innocent!

13
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:48,562
Did this Miwa person also
give you orders to kill a
man who's innocent?

14
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:50,962
Innocent?!

15
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:54,462
Hnn.. Yaah!

16
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:07,528
Heh heh...

17
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:15,195
Okay, so, I might
not look innocent
at the moment.

18
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:20,128
But as they say,
eyes can be deceived.
Don't be so quick to judge.

19
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,528
It's what's inside
that really matters.

20
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:25,995
What's "inside"
doesn't matter to me.
Nor do appearances.

21
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:30,028
I believe that a man should be
judged only by his actions.

22
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:31,262
H-heh heh...

23
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:36,495
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>though, That's not me!</i>
<i>You've got the wrong guy!</i>

24
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:40,928
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>No matter how much you</i>
<i>protest, that is you!</i>
<i>Stop trying to deny it!</i>

25
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:45,028
Okay, let's assume for a moment
that I did kill someone.

26
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:49,095
Why are you trying to punish me?
What gives you that right?

27
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,128
If you think I'm
guilty of murder, hand
me over to the police.

28
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,995
let the prosecutor
and judge determine
what happens to me.

29
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:57,395
Go ahead.
Take me in, then.

30
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:00,262
Isn't that how
things work in this
law-abiding country?

31
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:05,328
I don't serve this
country's court system,
only Master Ichigen Miwa.

32
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:07,228
[sigh]

33
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:11,262
I give up. I guess you've
pretty much made up your mind.

34
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:14,862
Do what you want with me.
Go ahead, get it over with.

35
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:17,995
You've finally
accepted your fate--

36
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:21,995
But before you run me
through with your sword,
will you grant me one
final request?

37
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,628
Speak.

38
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:26,162
Heh, Would you mind
putting me down first?

39
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:28,095
I'm getting a bit of
a kink in my neck.

40
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:29,428
Hmf.

41
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:31,428
Yeah, yeah,
don't worry,
I won't run.

42
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:34,062
What would be the point?
I wouldn't get very far anyway.

43
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:35,395
Hrrrrg.

44
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:38,128
You'd catch me before
I had a chance, right?

45
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:45,995
Heh, thanks,
I appreciate
your trust.

46
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:03,928
I need to write a farewell
letter to my little sister.

47
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:07,195
Your sister?

48
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:10,395
Yes, we've always
been very close.

49
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:14,128
I know I'll never be able
to prove my innocence,

50
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:19,162
But I just don't want my
little sister to believe
that I was executed for
committing murder.

51
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:23,362
She's always had a
very serious illness,

52
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:29,862
And has lived her entire
life going in and out from
one hospital to another.

53
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,095
She's in the hospital
right now.

54
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:33,762
Huh?

55
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:37,362
She's never had any friends,
I'm the only person she
knows and can talk to.

56
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:42,495
Without me, there's no-one
in her life. She's alone.

57
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:44,628
I need to prepare
her for that.

58
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:52,195
I see. What is your
little sister's name?

59
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:54,028
Huh?! Her name?

60
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:56,528
Ah, it's, ah...

61
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:58,195
<i>Marilyn.</i>

62
00:05:58,228 --> 00:05:58,995
What?

63
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:00,295
Uhh! Mari!

64
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:02,395
Her name's Mari!
That's my sister.

65
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,862
Mari Isana.
That's a nice name.

66
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:10,128
Thanks so much. So now...

67
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:12,562
Here. I need a favor.

68
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:16,395
I would greatly appreciate
it if you would give
this note to her.

69
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:21,862
Come on, please say yes.
There's no one else I can
turn to for this favor.

70
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:25,528
It isn't much to ask.
I'm not going to be
around to do it myself.

71
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:28,928
When I'm gone,
she'll have no
family left.

72
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:32,195
Ah!?

73
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:33,195
What is this?!

74
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:50,195
<i>[frustrated breaths]</i>

77

Well, I managed to
get out of that alive.

00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,895
Mew!

79
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:13,495
But I'm guessing if there's
a next time, he'll be ready
to kill me on the spot.

80
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:14,962
Meooww!

81
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:46,462
<i>Did you put up the</i>
<i>bounty notices?</i>

82
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:49,562
I'm sending them out...
right now!

83
00:07:54,628 --> 00:08:00,428
[crowd interest]
Whoa. Did you see that?
Ooh! Wow! That's a lot of money!

84
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:04,195
HOMRA's offering ten million
to find that guy!

85
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:12,295
<i>Hello, you've reached HOMRA.</i>
<i>Do you have information</i>
<i>about the suspect?</i>

86
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:18,362
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>
<i>Ten million yen.</i>
<i>No, we're not joking.</i>

87
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:20,895
<i>Come on, now,</i>
<i>give us a little credit.</i>

88
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:25,562
Hey, Anna. Having any luck?

All right,

I've got a lot on my plate.
Give me a little more time.

Hey, pal, can I get a

<i>You're not being</i>
<i>paid to eat!</i>

say about HOMRA?!

Focus on the boy.

101
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,528
Also, keep your distance
from the Black Dog.

102
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:45,562
Trust me, you guys
are no match for him,

He's one of my

Do you know where
he is right now?

Well, I'm not really sure.
He went to run some
errands for me.

But that was a while ago.
He should be done by now.

If you have time, I can take you
over to his dorm to find him.

isn't too far from here at all.

So I promise I will not forget
how cooperative you have been.

<i>Scrape the whites against</i>

304
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:37,283
<i>tearing, tearing the yolk.</i>

305
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,016
<i>Mince finely.</i>

306
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:43,416
<i>Eat while it's hot!</i>

307
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:46,883
<i>[all in unison]</i>
<i>Thank you for the food!</i>

308
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:22,588
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>First, you must</i>
<i>pick the fresh egg.</i>

309
00:24:22,621 --> 00:24:25,888
<i>That means when you crack an</i>
<i>egg, the egg yolk doesn't lie</i>
<i>too flat on the pan.</i>

310
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:28,421
<i>Then, add soy sauce</i>
<i>and dashi to it.</i>

311
00:24:28,454 --> 00:24:32,821
<i>For kids, you can also</i>
<i>add a pinch of sugar.</i>
<i>Mix them all gently.</i>

312
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:36,754
Next add oil to the frying pan,
then pour in the egg mixture.

313
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:42,354
Once the mixture starts to cook,
push it to one side of the pan,
and quickly roll it into the
proper shape.

<i>What're you doing</i>
<i>in my kitchen?</i>

315
00:24:44,254 --> 00:24:46,621
[Kuroh]
[gasp] You've been watching me?!

316
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:49,488
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>It's tough to ignore a</i>
<i>grown man reciting cooking</i>
<i>instructions out loud.</i>

317
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:54,654
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Your kitchen is utterly</i>
<i>useless! There's not</i>
<i>even one usable knife!</i>

318
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:59,588
[Yashiro]
I'm not much of a cook. But you
seem well prepared. By the way,
is that your own kitchen knife?

319
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:01,721
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>You're not talking</i>
<i>about this, are you?</i>

320
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:06,654
<i>[Kuroh]</i>
<i>Are you seriously calling</i>
<i>my celebrated sword</i>
<i>Kotowari, a kitchen knife?!</i>

321
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:08,821
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>No, I didn't mean it</i>
<i>like that, really!</i>

322
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:12,921
[Kuroh]
Rest assured. Kotowari is always
ready to slay the evil king.

<i>Episode three,</i>
<i>"Kitchen".</i>

324
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:17,954
<i>Here's how you properly</i>
<i>slay the evil king!</i>

325
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:19,988
<i>[Yashiro]</i>
<i>D'yahhh!</i>
