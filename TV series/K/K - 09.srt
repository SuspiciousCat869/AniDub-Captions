<i>[German]</i>
<i>Die apparatur ist bereit.</i>

<i>Das Kamera aäuft schon.</i>

00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:45,771
<i>Die Schiefertafel</i>

00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:54,571
<i>Und wo ist die Maus?</i>

7
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:57,183
<i>Doctor Weismann will</i>
<i>be arriving with it</i>
<i>at any moment.</i>

8
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,350
[Adolph Weismann]
Here I am.

9
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:03,129
It's all up to you,
my furry little
rodent friend.

10
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:08,084
I'm counting on a
perfect performance.
So make me look good.

11
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:12,851
[researcher]
They're calling it the
Extra Alpha Group.

12
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:17,418
<i>The mouse is a prototype,</i>
<i>and it's under the</i>
<i>influence of the Slate.</i>

13
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:20,472
The blue mouse
is in place.

14
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:34,040
The Slate is reacting.

15
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:36,807
Sword Aura is confirmed.

16
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,107
Huh??

17
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,173
[Daikaku]
Amazing! Could it have the
same effect on human beings?

18
00:02:00,473 --> 00:02:02,440
It's just the tip
of the iceberg.

19
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:08,073
The intensity level of the link
with the Slate, is proportional
to the complexity of the brain.

20
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:14,807
More precisely, the deviation
from the law of causality,
creates the Fieldback Group.

21
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:21,107
which engulfs beta bodies in
the vicinity as its intensity
increases in a manner of
geometric progression.

22
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:23,440
As a result...

23
00:02:23,473 --> 00:02:26,807
An army of super-humans
is born, huh?

24
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,040
No...

25
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:30,007
That is not my goal.

26
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:37,573
This will bring
everybody happiness.

Huh?!

00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,007
Oh! Hi,

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,640
Hmm.

33
00:02:57,673 --> 00:03:01,973
Hello, Lieutenant.
Is my baby brother
bothering you again
with his nonsense?

34
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:05,673
No, I was just showing
him my experiment.
Right, Lieutenant?

35
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,873
And his results are
quite astounding.

36
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:10,707
I must say I am
truly amazed.

37
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,173
I told you, sis.

38
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,573
However,

39
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:19,540
I'm worried that the
Lieutenant thinks I've been
working on some kind of
advanced instrument of war,

40
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,107
and that wouldn't be good!
What a horrible thought!

41
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,473
That's enough!

42
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,540
Mh! Augh!

43
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:25,973
You need to learn to
hold your tongue.

44
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,473
Don't forget, we're
receiving a very nice
stipend for your research.

45
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:32,573
C'mon, please let go!
That really hurts!

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,140
Eh...

47
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,940
[nervous giggle]
Ha ha!
Lieutenant Kokujoji.

48
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:43,107
Disregard that, please.
Could we make this
off-the-record?

49
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:46,140
Oh! That's no problem.

50
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:49,907
I'm unable to understand
the technical jargon
most of the time.

51
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,007
Uh?

But everything
is not lost.

63
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:50,173
Yes, it is.
at least for me.

64
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:01,173
I must ask you
once again.

65
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:05,607
This is good bye,
Lieutenant.

66

Are you running away?

Why would you give
all of this up?

<i>Police helicopter, which</i>

<i>A police statement released</i>
<i>after the incident</i>
<i>identifies both crafts.</i>

72
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:08,504
Oh! You mean that
airship that crashed?

73
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:12,504
Well, I believe they said the
whole thing was caused by a
cult leader or something.

74
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:19,039
I have heard that the man
up there is so incredibly
powerful that people refer
to him as a living god.

75
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,672
Well if that's true, Amen.

Oh, wow! Take me on a
heavenly shopping spree!

77
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,105
That would mend
my broken heart!

Chopper Seven crew's been

Unfortunately, the last
thing that any of them can
remember is getting ready
to board their helicopter.

94
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,539
What?

95
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,105
Then the only question is,
who was actually flying
this chopper?

<i>Damn!</i>

Ah! Shit!

00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:56,939
Hey, give me a pry bar?
A pry bar, a crowbar,
anything useful.

As your Student Council
Representative, I am very proud.

103
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,872
Are you running short on
any equipment, do you have
your paper work ready,

104
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,805
and would any of you
be available for a
new task right now?

How about getting that
guy to help you again?

He must be around
here somewhere.

[giggle]
Right, right!

109
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,872
Who're you talking about?

110
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:29,672
Well, you know who I mean!

111
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:30,872
Uh...

112
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,601
We're almost finished, Sota.
We can spare you.
Why don't you go help her?

113
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,568
Huh?!

114
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,200
Uh-h... Oh.

Ah, hmm.

117
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,933
Well, that was awkward,
but at least it got me
off the hook!

118
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,533
Sumika, I could use
your help as well!

119
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,566
Augh!

120
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,655
[Kukuri]
The storeroom's completely
crammed with stuff,

121
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,756
so we borrowed a
vacant room in
the dormitory.

122
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:58,756
[Sumika]
Why there?

123
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:00,123
[Kukuri]
If we keep the finished
costumes in there,

124
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:03,956
all we have to do is
go to a nearby room
to change into them.

125
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:05,989
That makes sense.

126
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:08,723
What's the matter, Kukuri?

127
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,556
[Sumika]
Hey, what are you doing?

128
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:15,689
Ah!

129
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:17,623
I'm sorry.
I spaced out.

130
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:23,595
The first thing we need to do
is clear the room before we
can put our things inside.

131
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:27,295
The resident advisor told me
that everything here could go
into the trash. So let's start
throwing everything out.

132
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:29,162
[both]
Yes, ma'am!

133
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:32,329

00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:33,462
Nice to see you!

135
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,595
I can use your help, too.

136
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:41,595
From what I can tell It
isn't quite unoccupied,
even though no one's
here right now.

137
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:44,562
Maybe someone was living
here and just moved out.

138
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:48,990
He he! Or maybe someone
with nothing better to do
just comes in here to nap.

139
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:50,790
Hey, I bet that
guy uses it.

140
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:51,857
Yeah!

141
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,990
Kukuri's friend?

142
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:54,590
Yup, that one.

143
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,155
Who is he?

144
00:11:57,155 --> 00:11:58,155
Uh...
Uh...

145
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:08,098
Huh!

146
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:09,465
Huh...

147
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:34,807
Mm.

148
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:40,880
Fourth King,
Reisi Munakata is here.
I will show him in sir.

149
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,180
So tell me, are you
here to fight or talk?

150
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:34,780
A King coming to the Slate is
an extremely rare occurrence.

151
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,780
Hm.

152
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,280
I come without my sword.
I'm here to have a
conversation.

153
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:44,947
That is all I plan to do.

154
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,747
It is good to
see you again,
Your Excellency.

155
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,047
Let's dispense with
the pleasantries.

156
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:03,680
Very well, but you must allow
me to express my gratitude to
you for interceding in the
recent Royal Blue situation.

157
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,047
<i>We were able to use all the</i>
<i>information obtained through</i>
<i>extralegal means, for the good</i>
of the public. I'm sure you--

158
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,714
I'm running out of patience.
Get to the point.

159
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:15,114
Very well. Then let
me jump right in.

160
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:21,714
[Reisi]
I believe that the body your men
retrieved earlier from the wreck
of the Himmelreich airship,

161
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:25,947
<i>is the Silver King,</i>
<i>also known as</i>
<i>Adolph K. Weismann.</i>

162
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,380
That's correct.

163
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:32,980
The origin of all the
Kings began with Weismann,
as he was the First King.

164
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:37,014
<i>And his physical components</i>
<i>are such that they can</i>
<i>never change, correct?</i>

165
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,047
Just what are you implying?

166
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,247
The 'Immortal King', who
retained the youth and vigor of
his prime for more than half a
century, has now suddenly died.

167
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:50,280
I have questions about the
circumstances of his passing.

168
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:53,947
<i>I'd like your permission</i>
<i>to examine his body.</i>

169
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:56,114
Hmm.

170
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:19,276
Well that was pleasant.
It's good that some
things never change.

171
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,142
The old man is as
stubborn as ever.

172
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:28,173
But he's indispensible.
He still functions as the
backbone of this country.

173
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:35,573
However, as mighty and
powerful as he is, the one
thing he isn't, is immortal.

174
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,873
<i>I wish that were also true</i>
<i>about the Silver King.</i>

175
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,106
We'll continue to
treat this as a crisis.
Remain alert and ready.

176
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,006
<i>Yes sir!</i>
<i>Yes sir!</i>

177
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:04,540
[ringing]

178
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,306
Mm?

179
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,240
[ringing]

180
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,173
<i>Hello there! Helloo!!!</i>
<i>Got a minute?</i>

181
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:26,640
<i>Oh, you're wondering who</i>
<i>I am, aren't you?</i>

182
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:30,167
<i>Well, I'm the guy you've</i>
<i>been looking for.</i>

183
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Hrrh.

184
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:34,915
I'm calling about your pal.
His name was Totsuka, wasn't it?

185
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:38,181
<i>I was the one</i>
<i>who killed him.</i>

186
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:41,348
<i>I feel bad for him now!</i>
<i>Ooh hoo hoo hoo!</i>

187
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:45,415
<i>He's probably lonesome all by</i>
<i>himself in the other world.</i>

188
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:47,848
<i>Don't you think he</i>
<i>could use some company?</i>

189
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:52,481
<i>I could kill everyone,</i>
<i>starting with Kusanagi,</i>
<i>and then Yata.</i>

190
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,248
<i>You like that idea? Huh?</i>

191
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,181
<i>Shall I do it?</i>
<i>C'mon, just say</i>
<i>the word!</i>

192
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:59,415
<i>Hey, man, are you</i>
<i>alive in there?</i>

193
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:02,748
<i>Maybe next time,</i>
<i>I'll get that young</i>
<i>girl to entertain me.</i>

194
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:06,415
<i>You know who I mean,</i>
<i>that pretty one you</i>
<i>always have with you?</i>

195
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:11,148
<i>Her name's Anna, right?</i>
<i>I'm sure she's gonna be</i>
<i>lots of fun!</i>

196
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:13,115
<i>I like 'em young</i>
<i>and innocent!</i>

197
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:16,315
Oh! That was a real eye opener!

198
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:20,848
<i>Ah ha ha ha ha ha!</i>

199
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:24,481
<i>Must have hit a nerve!</i>
<i>Gotcha now!</i>

200
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:28,048
<i>So long, loser,</i>
<i>you're all mine!</i>

201
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:37,043
Not so fast.
Two can play
this game.

202
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:39,409
<i>Huh?</i>

203
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,186
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>Aaaahhh!!!</i>

204
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:47,853
Hmf.

205
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:06,540
[gasps]

206
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,140
Was that explosion
from the room we
were just in?!

207
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,707
[panic]

208
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,674
Whoa!

209
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,340
I found you.

210
00:18:36,774 --> 00:18:37,774
Mikoto...

211
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:38,674
Huh?

212
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,307
[alarm buzzing]
I'm still getting nothing
over here.

213
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:08,274
Mister Fushimi!

214
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:13,407
Don't make a move. Stand down.
We're not to do anything.
Those are the orders.

215
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,307
But, sir!

216
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:22,540
[chuckle]

217
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:33,051
Third King,
Mikoto Suoh.

218
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:36,518
It is my duty to remind you,
that you are in the custody
of Scepter Four.

219
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,985
You have not been granted
permission to leave!
Stop right now!

220
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:44,485
I said stop!

221
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:52,885
Call in the second team!

222
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,785
It's no
use...

223
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,425
Hey! Good
to see you!

224
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:05,825
Sir!

225
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:06,792
Sir!
Sir!

226
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:08,805
We're glad
you're out!

227
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:17,272
<i>[Izumo]</i>
<i>So, Boss...</i>

228
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:18,905
Mm?

229
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:20,938
Did you find who you've
been looking for?

230
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:30,872
A school-boy on the Island.

231
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:31,905
All right!

232
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,038
Awesome!

233
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:34,538
Aww yeah!

234
00:21:35,184 --> 00:21:37,851
Just where I said he was!
I was right!

235
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:39,018
Uh, hee hee!

236
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:40,618
[Kamamoto]
I thought I
said that?

237
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:42,118
[Yata]
You never did!

238
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,684
[Kamamoto]
Well, I was thinking it!

239
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:50,651
C'mon, let's go.

240
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:54,318
[Yata]
We're ready!
Let's do this!

241
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:55,651
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

242
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,026
<i>Mikoto, yours is the only red...</i>

243
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:44,986
<i>But I know that you've already
made your decision...</i>

244
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:50,186
<i>So I won't try to stop you from going.</i>

245
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,287
<i>What's wrong, Anna? Getting a little nervous?</i>

246
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:57,555
<i>No</i>

247
00:23:58,095 --> 00:24:02,959
<i>You're a strong girl. Now, let's take of things
so we can go home</i>

248
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,119
<i>Okay.</i>

249
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:11,301
<i>Don't worry. Everything's going to work out.
We both know how strong Mikodo is, right?</i>

250
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,619
<i>Ismo?</i>

251
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:14,530
<i>Yes?</i>

252
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:16,032
<i>Thank you.</i>

253
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:22,407
<i>Next time on 'K'. Episode 10</i>
<i>'Kaleidoscope'</i>

254
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,607
<i>I'm the one who should be saying that.
Thank you, Anna.</i>
