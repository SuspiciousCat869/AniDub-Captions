but I don't think
we should interrupt just yet.

Yeah, I guess I am.

How long must you carry on
in front of the woman you love

372
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,708
before you're truly satisfied?

373
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,291
- Th-Then you want me

374
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,416
to just fall in line

I accept that I lost, okay,

377
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,541
but I won't ever believe
that I was wrong! You got that?!

378
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,166
Because I wasn't,
and that's all there is to it!

379

So don't expect me to make
some half-assed attempt
to--

380

- If you don't want it
to stop at half-assed,

then you simply need to prove
that you're not standing
still.

You have to find out
with your own two eyes.

- Now don't say that in a way

Mother loved us both

The only reason
she left the Sanctuary

was to better her family.

So what's the matter, then?

Don't you
feel content with that?

What a load of crap!

If she loved us,
then why did she--

467
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,041
- It probably
made things easier for you

to believe
that she didn't love us.

If you thought
your feelings were one-sided,

470
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,625
you could justify
the pain it caused you.

You don't even understand!

When Mom leaves this place,
she's gonna--

474
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,958
- You're speaking
as if I don't already know.

475
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,416
- Huh?

476

to meet with misfortune
after leaving here,

don't you think Grandmother

00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,458
would inform us
about something like that?

481

- Then why?
Explain to me what happened.

482
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,666

483
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,666
why you weren't told about this
at such a young age.

But you're much older now,

to hear things frankly.

you wanted to forget,

00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,375
but you remembered that Mother
loved you, didn't you?

489
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,166
You have that scar
on your forehead

490
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,375
because you wanted
to forget her kiss.

491
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,625
You needed to make it disappear,
so you gave it to yourself.

492
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,666
- [crying]

493
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,458
- This is the end,

494
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,875
the end of your past.

495
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,541
- Wait.

496
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,083
No, wait a minute!

497
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,541
What happens now?

498
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,375
What am I supposed to do?

499
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,875
- If you rely on your sister
for guidance

500
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,000
even when she's still so young,
you'll never find your answer.

501
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,291
- Listen, I know
it might seem pathetic,

502
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,916
but you're the only one
I can count on.

503
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:02,875
So, please...

504
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,041
- Now tell me.

505
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,875
What do you want to do, Garf?

506
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,791
- [gasps]

507
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:08,750
[sighs]

508
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,041
- I want to know.

509
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,000
What do you want to do?

510
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,958
- Exactly what it is
that I'm expected to.

511
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,083
- Go on.
Who has these expectations?

512
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,916
- Everyone, all the people,

513
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,958
the ones in my life who need me.

514
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,958
I want to be there
for each of them.

515
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:33,833
- I see. And what is it that's
bringing this feeling about?

516
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,791
[no audible dialogue]

517
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,875
- It's because they...

518
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,666
they made me remember...

519
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,125
something precious...

520
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,166
that Mom
really loved me after all.

521
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,541
- [laughs]

522
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,000
EMILIA: Is Ryuzu Shima

523
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,166
the older sister
or the younger one?

524
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,666
How does this work?

525
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,000
- Uh, it's actually
kinda confusing,

526
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,458
so let's save it for later.

527
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,708
[all gasp]

528
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,666
- [gasps] Young Gar!

529
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,458
You okay?

530
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,916
So about what happened,

531
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,083
you see, we did not--

532
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,458
- Don't make that face,
old hags,

533
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,541
'cause it don't suit you.

534
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,791
[both gasp]

535
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,833
- I made you worry,

536
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,041
and I'm sorry.

537
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,250
[both cry]

538
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,208
RAM: Garf, how did it go?

539
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,208
- Huh?

540
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,875
Well, honestly,

541
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,208
can't say I got much
you can really see,

542
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,833
but still,

543
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,666
I did get some answers
to a whole lot of things.

544
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,916
- [sighs]

545
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,750
- Right. Okay then,

546
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,666
let's do the rest
of the trial while--

547
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,166
- You can count me out on that,
'cause it ain't my job.

548
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,541
- He's absolutely right.
It's my job and mine alone.

549
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:00,833
Don't just hand it off.

550
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,708
- Uh...

551
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,083
yeah, I also wanna say...

552
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,958
I think the reason I was
able to take on the trial

553
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:11,000
was because of all of you guys,

554
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,541
so thanks.

555
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,625
- Wait. Did you
actually just thank us?

556
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,000
- I'm not gonna say it again!
Listen up!

557
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,750
I realize I lost, okay?!
Are you happy now?!

558
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,250
But if you guys
liberate this place

559
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,708
and the old hags suffer,

560
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,750
I won't go easy on you!
Understand?!

561
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,541
- Of course. You got it. Y-Yeah.

562
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:31,041
- Which means I'm gonna be here
watchin' your every move

563
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,541
to make sure
you're not just a bunch of talk!

564
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:37,208
So make sure you do it
and get it right, boss!

565
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,041
- [sighs]

566
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,083
- His face was pretty red,
wasn't it?

567
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,708
- Did he call me "boss"?

568
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:45,708
'Cause between the two of us,
you definitely outrank me.

569
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:49,000
- I bet you must feel as if
you've gained a new brother now.

570
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,583
You're older than he is,
so try to be lenient.

571
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,791
- Well, if that's the case...

572
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,208
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you tryin' to tell me

573
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,458
that Garfiel is
actually younger than I am?!

574
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:02,125
- Huh? Garf's only turning
14 years old this year.

575
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,583
- Huh?!

576
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:07,541
So he's just an eighth grader?!

577
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:15,500
Are you going?

578
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,250
- Yeah. If I stand around
too much longer,

579
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,125
I might lose my confidence.

580
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:24,500
Subaru...

581
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:29,250
about what happened earlier
when we were in the graveyard...

582
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,916
[sighs]

583
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,250
- Uh, what do you mean?

584
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,625
- You know, when we, uh...

585
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,750
- [sputters]

586
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,166
- Um, it really
meant a lot to me,

587
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,083
so when the trial
and everything else

588
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,583
is taken care of,
why don't we talk it over, okay?

589
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,125
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

590
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,791
[inhales]

00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,875
[exhales]

592
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,583
Already talking about what
you'll do when it's finished.

593
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:58,291
You must be feeling
pretty confident, Mili.

594
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,083
- I don't know.

595
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:04,125
Maybe I'm only trying
to convince myself.

596
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,208
- I know it'll work out.

597
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,375
In fact,
I feel so sure of that,

598
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:10,291
I'll even bet
a date with you on it!

599
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:11,750
[chuckles]

600
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,125
- Yes, of course.

601
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,291
It's time for me
to be going now.

602
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,125
- Go get 'em. You can do it!

603
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,958
Watch out for cars and boys!

604
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:23,916
- [gasps]

605
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,791
Whatever that means.

606

[giggles]

GARFIEL: A giltylaw
that came one step short?

608
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:39,833
Can't be much of a man if you
keep lookin' all worried,
boss.

609
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,166
- The way you talk
makes a lot more sense to me

610
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,208
now that I know
you're in the eighth grade.

611
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,291
I rattled off
a bunch of famous quotes

612
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:48,208
- when I was your age, too.
- Hey, listen.

613
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,291
As long as I'm
turnin' over a new leaf,

614
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,750
there's somethin' I ought
to apologize to you for.

615
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:55,166
- Well, that's
very admirable of you.

616
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,625
Go on, then. You can talk
to your boss about
anything.

617
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:01,666
Oh, man. I'm embarrassed
even sayin' that.

618
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,166
- I saw you earlier.

619
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,333
- Huh?

620
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,041
- You know, when you, well...

621
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:08,958
got a little...

622
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,041
desperate?

623
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,208
["Memento" playing]

624
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,208
[chuckles]

625
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,125
- [gasps] Uh, oh, crap.

626
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,000
I completely forgot!

627
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:21,125
But I mean, I wasn't expecting
you to come in! Aww, man!

628
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:21,875
- Look...
- [wailing]

629
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,666
- that made me
realize somethin'.

630
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,041
You may be a complete
dumb ass--

631
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,083
and you gotta admit
you are one--

632
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,791
but if I had
to lose to somebody,

633
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:29,375
I sure am glad it was you!

634
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:30,250
- Just shut up!
- [laughs]

635
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,541
Forget you ever saw that, okay?!

636
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,500
You're not a kid,
so pretend you didn't--

637
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:37,250
- Wait. You<i> are</i> a kid! Agh!
- [laughs]

638
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:44,291
- You're such a dummy, Subaru.

SUBARU:<i> Give it your best.</i>

He really is...

645
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,208
just the biggest dummy.

646
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,083
Dummy. Dummy.

00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,333
You nincompoop.

00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:11,000
How could you break your promise

00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,333
to stay with me?

650
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,916
I'm never going to forgive you.

651
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,458
Well, not until you apologize,
that is.

652
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,750
ECHIDNA: Welcome back.

653
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:30,291
I've certainly had
a lot of visitors lately.

654
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,416
I must say,
it's awfully bold of you

655
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,833
to stroll in here after
that disgraceful display before.

656
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,916
Audacity like that
surprises even me.

657
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,791
You've proven to be
a pathetic and loose woman.

658
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,125
Kissing up to the first man

659
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,833
who offers to comfort you
when you're sobbing in despair,

660
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:51,416
a shameless fool who's soiling
the world that is mine alone,

661
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,916
a selfish hedonist
who hides her true self

662
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,250
and embraces the you
that he's forgiven.

663
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:00,125
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself,

664
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,583
witch's daughter?

665
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:10,041
- My name is Emilia,
nothing more or less!

666
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,250
And I was born in Eilor Forest!

667
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,875
I'm the Frozen Witch!

668
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:22,833
I won't give in to the
malevolence of a fellow witch.

669
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:25,958
After all, I'm quite
an insufferable woman.
