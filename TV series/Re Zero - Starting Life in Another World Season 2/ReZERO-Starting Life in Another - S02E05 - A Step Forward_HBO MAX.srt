SUBARU: First of all,

00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,500
there's something
I'd like to say to you.

3
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,958
- Hmm?

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,708
- Honestly, you look
pretty good in that uniform.

Why, thank you!

10
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,333
Hearing you give me
such a compliment

11
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,625
lets me know that recreating it
from your memories

12
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:52,833
was quite worthwhile.

13
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:56,000
- Now, what is this place,
anyway?

14
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,666
- Well, you qualified
to enter the graveyard.

15
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,625
Upon doing so, the trial began,
and that's all there is to it.

16
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,875
Remember what I said?

17
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,416
"First, you need to face
your own past"?

18

- I think it's slowly
starting to come back.

19
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,041
So what exactly
did you do to me?

20
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,791
I had completely forgotten
about you already.

21
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,791
- It was much quicker
to meddle with your memories

22
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,458
than it would've been to trust

23
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,750
that you could ever keep
an important secret.

24

your weird little trial or what?

every moment of it,

I'd have to say you did.

27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,375
I thought the result
that you achieved

28
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,000
was more than suitable.

29
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,416

- [mocking sob] "I'm so sorry!"

- When you said that,

33
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,750
even I began tearing up a bit.
I have to be honest.

34
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,250
- Shut up!
And keep that to yourself!

00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,708
It's embarrassing, all right?!

36
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,500
Anyway, you're saying
this world is actually...

37
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:47,416
- Indeed. Everything around you
is a completely fabricated world

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,666
that I recreated with utmost
faithfulness to your memories,

40

Your parents, too, see?

41
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,333
- You took those images
from my mind?

42
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,750
But some of that
was stuff even I didn't know.

43
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,666
- Are you absolutely positive
that what you're saying is
true?

44
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,750
Did you never once
entertain the thought

that something might be amiss,

46
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,750
that your father was
possibly different in some way

47
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,583
from what you pictured?

48
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,208
- Hmm?
- Did you really think

49
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,000
you could hide
the secrets deep in your heart,

50
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,000
the ones you thought
no one knew about,

51
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,416
like the desire to ease
the burden you carry,

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,625
the selfish wish
that they'd both still love you,

53
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,208
even if they knew the truth?

54
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,583
Can you say for certain
that those conversations

55
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,500
with your imaginary parents
weren't really for you?

'Cause anything more
would be far too idealistic,

Not to mention convenient.

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,375

- What?

60
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,166
- I gave all of my answers
during those conversations.

61
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,916
Both my mom and dad
accepted them, too.

62

You heard
what they said to me, right?

63
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,625
They wanted me
to take care of myself

64
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:53,916
and to give it my all.

Their voices, their smiles,
and everything else,

they completely shattered
what I had imagined.

67
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,958
My parents are larger than life
and couldn't even begin

68
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,875
to fit into
a puny imagination like mine,

69
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,583
so don't sell them short!

70
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,625
I told them
everything I wanted to say,

71
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,625
and I'm not gonna let
anything you say sidetrack me.

00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:19,500

is over in the truest sense now.

I look forward to seeing how
you handle the next question.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,333
- [sputters] Wait a minute!

75
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,875
What does that mean?
There's more than one trial?!

76
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,500
There are
three graveyard trials in total,

77
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,375
and you must pass each of them
to set the Sanctuary free.

78
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,500
I'm so glad I finally
got to tell you this.

79
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,708
Surprising bit of news,
isn't it?

80
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,916

If you go outside,
you'll find yourself

where you started.

I'll let you hit me?

I'll admit I'd want to,
and you do have the right,

I thought I'd never get to say,

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,541
and I realize there's no way
I'd have gotten that chance

100
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,333
to know I can scare a witch.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,083
Oh, yeah. From that
big buildup and explanation,

102
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,333
it sounded like you really want
me to go through the next trial,

103
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,625
but I can't grant
that wish for you.

104
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,458
- What are you saying, then?

105
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,583
- Well, I'm saying
that I'm not the one

and free the Sanctuary.

No! Don't look at me like that!

Just stop it! Stop it!
It wasn't me!

- Well, I didn't do it for you.

Still, the Sanctuary

is even farther
from being set free now.

149

150
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,166
- Huh? What's up, Otto?

151
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,125
- There might be a way to get
everyone outside the barrier

without taking the trial
and freeing the Sanctuary.

That's impossible.

I know that anyone
with mixed blood

who touches the barrier
loses consciousness.

that's impossible to avoid,

161
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,708
why don't those of us who
aren't affected by the barrier

162
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:04,041
carry the other ones through it
while they're unconscious?

163
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,583
- Yeah, that's not bad.

164
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,625
If the unaffected
could get everyone together--

165
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:11,666
- An amusing idea, but one you
would be better off not trying.

166
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,541
As for my thoughts
on the matter,

167
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,458
I would rather not become
an empty shell of a soul.

168
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,083
- [gasps]

169
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,541
Hold on a second.
You're the girl--

170
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,583
- [sizzles]
- [yelps]

171
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,000
- Here. Tea's ready.

172
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,041
- "Tea's ready," my ass!

173
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,250
You almost burned my cheek off!

174
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,791
I didn't know
what was goin' on!

175
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,791
- So dramatic.

176
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,208
What a pathetic man you are.

177
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,666
Avoid unnecessary comments.

178
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
- [gasps]

179
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,750
- Ram, how 'bout
some for me, too?

180
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,375
- It's coarse tea.

181
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,125
- Hey, what's up?

182
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,500
You normally talk
all humble-like.

183
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,583
- I just brewed
some leaves I found.

184
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,291
Show your gratitude
to me for that

185
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,791
by drinking every last drop.

186
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:50,750
- I heard that you
had brought in

187
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,875
more people from the outside,
Young Gar.

188
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,333
My, what a noisy boy he is.

189
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:59,708
- Uh, and who
might you be, Miss?

190
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,000
- I am Ryuzu Bilma.

191
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:05,166
It is my duty, you might say,
to represent this community,

192
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,958
though I am old and frail.

193
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,125
- Old and frail, huh?

194
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,625
So you're a loli hag.

195
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,500
I figured
I'd meet one at some point,

196
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,291
but you really fit
the stereotype.

197
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,916
- We just meet,
and you call me an old woman?

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,083
Well, no matter.

199
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,291
And you are Barusu,

200
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,291
which makes you Young Su.

201
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,625
- What did you call me?

202
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,291
- So, Miss Ryuzu,
what part of my idea

203
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,125
makes you believe
it couldn't work?

204
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,125
What did you mean
by "empty shell"?

205
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,583
- Have you not heard?

206
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,750
When someone of mixed blood
touches the barrier,

207
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,916
it removes their consciousness,
repelling their soul.

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,208
- I'm still
not sure I understand.

209
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,791
- Repels their...
- I think I get it.

210
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:46,958
When a mixed-blood attempts

211
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,791
to force their way
through the barrier,

212
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,000
their soul separates
from their body,

213
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,916
so even if the body
makes it through,

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,833
it'll be an empty shell,
leaving the soul behind.

215
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:56,833
Does that sum it up?

216
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,666
- Aha. You do catch on quickly.

217
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,791
That is the gist of it, yes.

218
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,625
When a body without a soul
exits the barrier,

219
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,166
it ceases to function.

220
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,041
For all intents and purposes,
it's dead.

221
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,208
- [gasping]

222

[Garfiel screams]

223
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,125
Gross!

224
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,166
This tea sucks! [gags]

225
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,250
- I guess this new batch
gets a thumbs down.

226
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,708
- [coughs, spits]
- What I don't get is,

227
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:21,916
if the qualification
for undergoing the trial

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,958
is having mixed blood,
why haven't you or Garfiel

229
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,833
done it and ended all of this?

230
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,166
Do you just not want to,
or what?

231
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,750
- If you are speaking
only of an attempt,

232
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,666
it stands to reason we could,

233
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,666
but we cannot free
the Sanctuary.

234
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,250
That is the contract
that has been handed down

235
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,708
among those of us who have
resided here for generations.

236
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,250
- [sighs]

237

00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,916
Subaru?

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,958
Hey, good morning, Mili.

241
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,500
Did you sleep okay?

242
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,375
- I did. Thanks.

243
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,708
Did you stay right here
with me all night?

244
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,416
- It's not like I could have
dozed off in my room, anyway.

245
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,000
Kinda hard to get any rest
with Otto talking in his sleep.

246
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,875
- I'm sorry about yesterday.

247
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,750
I feel like I lost my composure
in the graveyard.

248
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,166
- What?

249
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,333
Come on. Don't worry about it.

250
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:13,916
More importantly--

251
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,875
Eh?

252
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,875
- [gasps]

253
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,625
Wait! I didn't--

254
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,916
Uh, I don't understand
why I just did that.

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,125
It doesn't make sense.

256
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,083
- Are you finally
getting assertive enough

257
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,916
to reach out for me
subconsciously?!

258
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,916
- No! I'm sorry!
It's not like that at all!

259
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,208
I was just confused
and not thinking.

260
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,750
- You denied that so fast!

261
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,208
And you weren't thinking?
Really?!

262
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,166
- I mean...

263
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,083
- As long as you can smile,
it's all right.

264
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,416
There's no problem.

265
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,041
You can give the trial
another shot tonight, okay?

266
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,541
- [gasps]

267
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,416
Again? Tonight?

[cloth fluttering]

269
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,083
- Listen, Barusu.

270
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,041
- Huh?

271
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,875
- Despite what you
likely assume,

272
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,125
not all of the residents

273
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,708
are in favor
of setting the Sanctuary free.

274
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,208
- Are you serious?
Why wouldn't they be?

275
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,125
- Only a segment of
the population here wants that,

276
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,291
and people like Garf,
led by Miss Ryuzu,

277
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,541
are the most outspoken.

278
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,291
There's a conservative faction

279
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,916
that doesn't want this place
to gain its autonomy.

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,833
- There are people who
don't want it to be set free?

281
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,625
- The conservatives
think having minimal interaction

282
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,791
with outsiders
is the ideal scenario.

283
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,250
In their opinion,
the Sanctuary's independence

284
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,000
would destroy that option
and cause nothing but trouble.

285
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,291
- I get not trusting Garfiel
in all of this,

286
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,416
but they don't even trust Ryuzu?

287
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
- No, or Frederica, either.

288

290
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,125
- She was the one
who gave Miss Emilia

291
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,000
that glowing stone, remember?

292
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,166
- So you think Frederica
started this whole thing?

293
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,208
- Circumstantial evidence
would suggest

294
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,875
that she almost certainly
had some plan in mind.

295
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,333
As it is,
Miss Emilia escaped disaster

296
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,291
by little more
than a hair's breadth,

thanks to your noble--

298
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,750
relatively noble sacrifice.

299
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,166
- Give me a break, huh?

300
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,375
I mean, look, all right,
I didn't die or anything,

301
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,791
so I get it, but still...

302
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,541
- Just be careful, Barusu.
Remember,

303
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,083
for the ones who oppose
setting the Sanctuary free,

304
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,250
the best way to assure
they get what they want

305
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,583
is to find some way
to harm Miss Emilia.

306
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,916
You never know
who might be your true enemy.

307
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,250
Be vigilant, and stay alert.

You're no fun.

a thing for Ram or something?

Well, she's hot, ain't she?

to a strong girl
who knows how to handle herself.

I hope this works out
better than the last time.

00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,583
We don't want
a short nap for a morolok

321
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,166
to be a whole day's sleep
for the rest of us.

322
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,458
SUBARU: So tell me, is
there
something you want to do

323
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,916
after getting out
of the barrier?

324
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,250
- Okay, that came
out of nowhere.

325
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,250
You mean what do I wanna do
once I'm out, huh?

326
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,166
A guy who's able
to come and go as he pleases

327
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,416
wouldn't have any idea
how the old hag and I feel.

328
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,750
- In that case,
what about Frederica?

329
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,875
- Huh?
- What are her thoughts

330
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,083
about people being freed
from the Sanctuary?

331
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,000
- Didn't she
tell you a damn thing

332
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,291
about what's goin' on here?

333
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,250
- She only said
she couldn't explain it to me

334
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,666
- in any real detail.
- [growls]

335
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,625
- All she told me about you was
your name, because of some oath.

336
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,916
- Some oath, my ass. Please.

337
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,500
Hah! Talk about a handy excuse.

338
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,291
Sounds just like
her damn master.

339
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,333
So you and Frederica
aren't exactly

340
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,916
what you'd call close,
I take it?

341
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,458
- If you're askin'
if we get along,

342
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,416
the answer is nope, not at all.

343
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,875
Yeah, so anyway, when you were
in the graveyard yesterday--

344
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,125
- [Emilia sobbing]
- [gasps]

345
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,000
- [sobbing]

346
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,041
SUBARU: Emilia!

347
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,958
I'm sorry!

348
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,458
I--Again, I--

349
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,458
- [sighs]

350
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,166
Roswaal: I see.
That's quite unfortunate.

351
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,041
Even so, just learning
that you cannot lose

352
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:14,125
your right to undergo the trial
is useful to know.

353
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,291
- Okay, then. What is it

354
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,625
you called me in here
without Emilia to talk about?

355
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,250
- Call it a bit of a conspiracy.

356
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,875
Although I am bighearted,
I'm not so foolish

357
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,083
that I'd invite one
to a discussion

358
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,583
when they cannot be trusted.

359
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,958
- Hold on. Are you saying
that Emilia can't be trusted?

360
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,458
What in the hell
are you talking--

361
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,416
- Calm yourself, Subaru.
Let me explain.

362
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,333
And whatever the case,
please continue

363
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,625
to support Miss Emilia
as you always have.

364
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,833
- I will whether you
ask me to or not,

365
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,208
but I wanna know
what you're gonna do.

366
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,166
- The same thing, naturally.

367
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,583
I plan to give my utmost

368
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,750
to help Miss Emilia
win the royal selection,

369
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,541
meaning I'll continue
my involvement

370
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,041
as a partner in crime.

371
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:52,666
- Shouldn't you
say we're partners

372
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,750
and leave it at that?

373
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,833
You just keep contradicting
yourself over and over.

374
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,625
- Oh? And what
makes you say that?

375
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,583
- Quit playing dumb!

376
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,125
Everyone knew the Witch's Cult
would start causing trouble

377
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,750
when Emilia's participation
was announced to the public!

378
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,208
And what the hell
were you doing through it all?!

379
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,208
You hid information
about the Witch's Cult

380
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,541
from Emilia, didn't you?!

381
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,166
She didn't have a clue
about those monsters!

382
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,541
If she'd known, everything
would have been different!

383
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,291
And if it was, then...

384
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,333
that never would have...

385
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,625
You should've been there
from the very beginning.

386
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,166
If you'd just taken the time,

387
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,333
a horrible thing
wouldn't have happened.

388
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,625
If you had been trying
to protect everybody...

389
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,958
- But it wasn't necessary,

390
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,041
as you managed to fulfill
that role in my absence.

391
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,666
As a knight, your performance
was commendable.

392
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,208
- You...

393
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,083
- You need to calm down, Barusu.

394
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,375
- Don't tell me that you're
okay with all this?!

395
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,000
You were left behind
at the mansion

396
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,583
like some kind
of sacrificial pawn!

397
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,791
- Whether or not that's true,

398
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,000
I condone everything
Master Roswaal did.

399
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,791
It doesn't matter
how I was treated.

400
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,666
Even if I was cast aside,
that wouldn't change how I feel.

401
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,250
- [gasps]

402
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,041
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

403
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,666
Then you're fine
with Rem being sacrificed

404
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,250
for a stupid reason like--

405
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,791
[gasps]

406
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,583
- You say that
as if I'm supposed to know

407
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,000
who you're talking about,

408
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:09,583
but the name
of an absolute stranger

409
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,791
means nothing to me.

410
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,583
- [gasps]

411
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,458
- So you want to know
why I concealed information

412
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,833
that I should have
disclosed to Miss Emilia

413
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,458
and why I wasn't
present and ready

414
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,458
to defend the mansion
when the Witch's Cult

415
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,458
was preparing
their insidious attack?

416
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,541
There's but one answer
to these questions.

417
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,375
To completely guarantee

418
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:34,416
that I wouldn't have to confront
the Witch's Cult myself,

419
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I personally made sure...

420
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,791
all these events would happen.

421
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,250
- [gasps]

422
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,708
- If I'd solved
the problem myself,

423
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,041
it would present a dilemma.

424
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,458
There would be no way
for you or Miss Emilia

425
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,791
to claim any credit
for their defeat.

426
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,833
See? It had
a rather tremendous effect, no?

427
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,458
Just take the attitudes
of the villagers of Arlam.

428
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,833
Their feelings
toward Miss Emilia

429
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,875
are drastically different than
they were before the onslaught.

430
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,791
She's no longer seen
as a relative of the witch.

431
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,291
Instead, she's viewed favorably

432
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,666
as one who contributed
to saving their lives.

433
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,041
- Bullshit!

434
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:08,833
Do you even have
the slightest clue

435
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,125
about what you're saying?!

436
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,458
That's only
how it looks in hindsight!

437
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,958
Do you know how many people died
'cause you weren't there

438
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,666
and didn't
tell anyone anything?!

439
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,500
- I do offer my condolences

440
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,708
for all those on our side
who were lost.

441
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,500
Or would you rather
hear me apologize

442
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,541
- instead of making that offer?
- No, no, no, no!

443
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,791
That's not it!
That's not what I want!

444
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,666
If I was still a total waste

445
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,583
that couldn't
accomplish anything,

446
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,833
what would you have done?!
Answer me!

447
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,333
If none of the villagers or
Emilia could have been saved--

448
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,375
- I had faith in you.
- [gasps]

449
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,750
- And it paid off.

450
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,458
I felt sure you'd
do anything for Miss Emilia,

451
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,333
give your best effort in
forming
an alliance with Miss Crusch,

452
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,833
put your very life on the line

453
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,500
to stop
the Witch's Cult's attack,

454
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,458
and complete all of these tasks
with excellence.

455
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,833
- What the hell
do you know about me?

456
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,541
When I last saw you,
I was nothing,

457
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,166
an absolute pile of trash!

458
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,625
I only got a little less useless

459
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,791
because of all the things
that happened after that!

460
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,208
And, besides, no one else

461
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,166
has any idea
what happened then, anyway!

462
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,208
- What made you believe in me...
- And, on that note,

463
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,541
it would seem
that tonight's conversation

464
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,125
has reached its end.

465
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,375
If you tell Miss Emilia

466
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,708
what we've discussed here...

467
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,666
- As if I could
ever tell her this.

468
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,708
- You're angry,
but I can see, deep down,

469
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,208
you understand
that this machinated outcome

470
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,541
is as it should be.

471
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,708
And considering
the royal selection,

472
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,125
for the sake of all involved,

473
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,791
I advise you
not to create any friction.

474
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,250
- [sputters]
- Good.

475
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,250
I knew you would make a fitting

EMILIA: I'm sorry.
I failed again.

- Don't beat yourself up, okay?

479
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,541
It looks like you can try
as often as you like,

480
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,791
so for now, it just depends
on you and how you're feeling.

481
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,333
- In other words,
it's up to me, huh?

482
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,458
- I can tell
this hasn't been easy for you,

483
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,666
but there's no point
in freeing the Sanctuary

if you're not the one to do it.

485
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,416
That's my opinion, anyway.

486
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,625
So what do you say?

487
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,666
Do you wanna try it again?

- Whoa! That came
out of nowhere!

491
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,708
When you ask
with such gentle eyes and words,

492
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,333
how could I possibly say no?

493
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,416
I'm not very smart, but even
I'm aware of what's at stake,

494
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,500
and I'm certain
that this is my duty.

495
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,708
Just keep believing in me.
Don't spoil me.

496
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,541
[chuckles] I mean,
I know I'm probably

497
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,458
not very convincing
right now, but--

498
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,125
- That's not true.

499

[chuckles] Thanks for that.

Still, I-I realize
I'll be causing trouble

for the people of Arlam,

504
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,208
and that's the one thing
that I regret.

505
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,791
- Oh, yeah.
About those villagers,

506
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,375
would it be okay
if you left all that up to me?

- [gasps]

508

Yes, of course.

509
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,625
I wouldn't start
doubting you now after all this.

510
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,375

513
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,500

- Subaru: Took two whole days

514
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,000
to pull it off, but yeah.

515
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,708
He understands
that since Emilia's

516
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,041
already inside the barrier,

517
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,791
setting the people
of Arlam Village free

518
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,625
isn't gonna cause any problems.

519
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,916
- That really surprises me,

520
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,833
because he comes across as
the type who would never listen

521
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,416
to what anybody else
had to say about anything.

522
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,625
For a trader, you're a pretty
lousy judge of character, huh?

523
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,791
[gasps]

524
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,333
- That's a rather old-fashioned
good-luck charm.

525
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,041
- Petra gave it to me
before we all headed out,

526
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,375
which was right after Frederica
hired her as a new maid.

527
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,666
- Frederica would never attempt

528
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,750
any sort of hazing
to a new recruit.

529
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,375
She would never be
that spiteful or fiendish,

530
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,291
so there's no need
to worry about the girl.

531
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,333
- Well, do you have faith
in Frederica or not?

532
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,375
I can't get a good read on you
about her.

533
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,291
I don't know
what she's planning.

534
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,541
But still,
Frederica is Frederica,

535
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,750
and I've never had
any doubt about that.

536
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,666
Also, I have a message
from Master Roswaal.

537
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,708
- [gasps]
- If you're worried

538
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,958
about having to face Frederica,

539
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,000
he suggests you merely turn
to Miss Beatrice for help.

540
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,250
If she wavers, do this.
Look her in the eye

541
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,333
and say, "Roswaal said
to ask the question."

542
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,041
- That's it?
- I'm not sure of the details.

543
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,458
Just know, when Miss Beatrice
hears you say those exact
words,

544
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,791
everything will change.

545
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,583
That's what
Master Roswaal said to me.

Hey, what's up, Mili?

- Oh, sorry.

Have I interrupted
your conversation?

551
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,125
- Not at all,
so don't worry about it.

552
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,000
It isn't like we were talking
about important stuff, anyway

553
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,583
Besides, you take priority!

554

- It makes me really happy
to hear that,

555
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,583
but I think
you should let the villagers

556
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,083
be the priority for right now.

557
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,333
- Sure.

00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,791

as the barrier.

I really appreciate it.

563

you went through a trial

out there, too, didn't you?

567

- [gasps]

568
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,000
- Look, there's
no sense in hiding it.

569
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,708
It's easy to tell.

570
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,458
- What's the point in asking me
about this, exactly?

571
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:14,416
- The reason's pretty simple.
If you already did it,

572
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,041
then that means
you can go through the trial

573
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,125
- in Emilia's place.
- I can't do that!

574
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,708
It would screw up the precedent,
and besides--

575
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,708
- So tell me something,
Subaru.
Is it really even necessary

576
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,625
- to overcome your past?
- Huh?

577
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,625
- I watched Emilia
go through the trials

578
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,958
and saw how it broke her spirit.
It didn't look pretty.

579
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,750
And every time, she comes back
totally freaked out.

580
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:33,916
I just can't stand to see that.

581
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,375
- Look, I saw it, too, okay,
but I still have faith

582
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,541
that Emilia has
what it takes to do this,

583
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,666
so I think she should--

584
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,958
- Expect what you want
from her, then.

585
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,041
Thing is, I'm not sure
if she really wants

586
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,833
to overcome her past,
trial or not.

587
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,625
When she's shakin' and cryin',
how do you think she feels?

588
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,666
- I hadn't thought of that.
So maybe...

589
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,250
Aw, man. Does she actually...
