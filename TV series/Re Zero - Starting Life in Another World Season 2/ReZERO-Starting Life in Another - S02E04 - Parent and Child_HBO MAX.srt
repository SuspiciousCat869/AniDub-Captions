[birds chirping]

2
00:00:03,416 --> 00:00:04,750
- Uh...

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,666
- Come on now! Don't ignore me!

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,666
- [Subaru yelps]
- [grunting]

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,625
- [groaning]
- [laughs]

6
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,250
Hey, what's the matter?

7
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,708
You train daily and still lose
to a middle-aged man?

8
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,416
Huh? No, no, no, no!

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,125
- [grunts] You're getting old...
- [groaning]

10
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,375
- if you didn't see
that counter coming, Pops!

11
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,083
I'm about to win by decis--

12
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,166
- Hey! Wait!
- [laughs]

13
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,250
- No fair flipping me back over!
- Are you ready to give up?

14
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,375
- Cut it out! Stop it! Stop!
- Then you better say uncle!

15
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,458
- Excuse me. Come on, you guys.

16
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,750
- Uh...
- I'm getting hungry,

17
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,250
so I'd like
to have some breakfast.

18
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,291
Could you two wrap this up now?

19
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,791
- Oh, whoops.

20
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,291
Sorry about that.
Got a little carried away

21
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,875
with my one-on-one time
with Subaru.

22
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:44,791
You could have started
without us, though.

23
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,125
- But why should I do that

24
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,083
when the whole family
could sit down together?

25
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,625
- You know,
you're absolutely right, honey.

26
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,291
Really sorry.
That's my wife for you!

27
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,625
- Come on.
It's time for breakfast.

28
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,416
I started feeling adventurous,

29
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,916
so I made
something special just for you.

30
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,291
- Well, would you look at that?

31
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,625
Bet you weren't expecting
a mountain of peas.

32
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,583
- Hey, Mom, I appreciate it,

33
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,708
but why are there
so many of these things?

34
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,125
- It's not good
to be picky about your food,

35
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,541
so I thought this might be

36
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,291
a good chance
to get you over that.

37
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,291
- It's not like this is
a special day or anything.

38
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,583
- What do you mean by chance?
- Very naive of you, son,

39
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,666
and that's because today--
no, every moment of every day

40
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,708
is a precious,
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

41
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,166
to make a positive change.

42
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:27,791
SUBARU: Doesn't matter now,
so...

43
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:28,791
it's time to eat.

44
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,708
- Don't be shy, and dig in.

45
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,583
SUBARU: You know,
I've always wondered

46
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,250
about this mix
of Japanese and Western dishes.

47
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,666
- I like wakame seaweed
in my miso soup

48
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,416
and strawberry jam on my toast.
Yummy.

49
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,666
- Huh?

50
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,458
[sighs]

51
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,416
What are we gonna do with this?

52
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,708
We can't just keep on
passing it around.

53
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,833
MOM: Well, I hate peas, so one
of you will have to eat it.

54
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,208
- [gasps] And you were trying
to get me to be less picky?!

55
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,333
- Don't get the wrong idea,
though.

56
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,166
I hate all foods
that are tiny and round.

57
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,583
Peas just happen
to fit that category.

58
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,333
- Oh, I didn't have
the wrong idea!

59
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,541
If anything,
now I have even more doubts!

60
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,791
The husband should take
responsibility for his wife.

61
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,291
- [chuckles] Listen.

62
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,458
Families that get along
as well as ours does

63
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,958
are rare these days.

64
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,000
What I'm saying
is you and your mother

65
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,791
hate exactly
the same things I do.

66
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,375
- Then this gigantic
mound of peas

67
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,375
was never gonna make
anyone happy, now, was it?

68
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,333
- I'll turn it into something
we all love, pilaf!

69
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,708
[dramatic music plays]

70
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,375
- I can't even stand
the sight of it.

71
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,291
[both groan]

72
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,541
- Subaru?

73
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,208
Right.

74
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,208
- [claps]
- [groans]

75
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,875
- Thank you
for that bountiful feast!

76
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,875
- Not a problem! Now, let's
get the dishes to the sink,

77
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,208
and after that, we'll
race
to school to help
digestion!

78
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,041
- Stop trying to turn this
into a scenario

79
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,291
that ends with me
going off to school, okay?

80
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:44,750
I'm heading back to bed.

81
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,666
[groans] Ow.

82
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,625
PARENTS: Subaru?

83
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,666
- It's nothing.

84
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,250
[footsteps recede]

85
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,416

[panting]

87
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,125
What the hell?

88
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,916
Why do I feel so weird
all of a sudden?

89
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,750
[ticking]

90
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,833
[panting]

91
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,750
Once it gets past 8:00,
it's over.

92
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,708
[gasping]

93
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,833

[ticking fades]

95

[sighs]

96
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,291
[normal ticking]

97
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,291
I won't make it to school
on time now,

98
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,833
so there's no other choice.

99
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:35,666
It's a done deal.

100
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,625
[groans]

101
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,291
What the hell is this?

102
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,583
That's always
calmed it down before.

103
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,416
[groans]

104
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,791
- [whoops] Hee hee!

105
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,625
Hey, mind if I join you, Subaru?

106
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,375
- What's the point of asking

107
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,041
if you walk in
before I can answer?

108
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,291
- Oh, lighten up.
There's no need for that

109
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,916
between two guys
as tight as you and--

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,458
Oh, wait! You're right!

111
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,250
I'm sorry.
I forgot you're a teenager.

112
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,625
- I'll leave and come back.
- Ah, too late now.

113
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,541
It doesn't matter.
What do you want?

114
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,250
Oh, nothing.

115
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,958
So tell me,
is there a girl you like?

116
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,458
- Are you serious?!

117
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,750
- [scoffs] You're no fun at all.

118
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,916
- Come on.
What do you really want?

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,791
Hmm. Well, let's see.

120
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,458
The weather
is pretty nice, so...

121
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's go have an awesome
father-son talk outside, okay?

122
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,000
[birds chirping]

123
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,458
Man, what's with everybody?

124
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,291
They happen to see me
on my day off,

125
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,458
and they all assume
I lost my job.

126
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,833
Hey, what's with
the gloomy face?

127
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't be like that.
It's a beautiful morning.

128
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,333
- It's your own fault
for dragging me out here.

129
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,666
- Why so suspicious?

130
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,708
Look, I'm not going
to tell you anything scary.

131
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,000
It's more
of a father-son subject.

132
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,583
- Ah, tell me more.
I can't wait.

133
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,750
- Ken, my boy!

134
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,291
Haven't seen you in a while.

135
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,291
Oh, hold on.
Don't tell me that's...

136
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,916
- Uh-huh. This is my son.

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,625
Or as I like to affectionately
call him, "my pride and joy."

138
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,541
- Ah! It seems I was right.

139
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,458
He looks so much like you did
back when you were--

140
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,583
Actually, no.
Take after your mom?

141
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,541
- Uh, well--[chuckles]
That's what people say.

142
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,916
Around the eyes, especially.

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,666
- Of course. Time does fly.

144
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,375
It's hard to believe
you're old enough

145
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,708
to have a son who's that age.

146
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,500
Come to think of it,
today's Monday, right?

147
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,750
Shouldn't you be
in school now, young man?

148
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,333
[groans]

149
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,500
Sorry. Gotta go.

150
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,166
- Eh, hey! What's wrong?

151
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,541
My apologies.

152
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,416
We'll both stop by again
when we have time to chat.

153
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,750
- Sounds good.

154
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,125
Looks like I said
something I shouldn't have.

155
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,333
Please tell him I'm sorry,
would you?

156
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,666
KEN: Oh, no.
That won't be necessary.

157
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,416
It's up to him to deal
with this on his own now.

158
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,458
[can thumps]

159
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,750
Here.

160
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,583

- You really thought
I didn't see that coming?

163
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,958
I know how you are.

164
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,125
Ugh. My hands are all sticky.

165
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,083
- [sighs]
- Well...

166
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,791
are you feeling any better now?

167
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,833
- It's kinda hard to say.
[groans]

168
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,791
- You look like you really
aren't feeling too great, son.

169
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,625
Are you ready to head back home?
Just hop on. I can carry you.

170
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,000
- No. Don't worry about it.

171
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,083
There's no need to do that.

172
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,750
It would only be the same
back there, anyway.

173
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,791
- So, uh, listen, Subaru,

174
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,541
not to change
the subject on you,

175
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,583

that you like?

Uh...

KEN: What's up?

181
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,416
- Did somebody just say my name?

182
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,708
- Don't think so.

183
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,666
If not, then what was it
that I just heard?

184
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,291
- So? Come on now.
Is there a girl you like?

185
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,000
- Why are you
going on about that?

186
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,125
Stop beating
around the bush, okay?

187
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,666
Come out and ask me.

188
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,000
"Why didn't you
head off to school today?"

189
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,208
It's easy.

190

for trying to be considerate

191
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,375
for once in my life.

192
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,541
Well, I suppose
you could see through me anyway,

193
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,833
since that is the thing
I wanted to talk about.

- [gasps]

195

I know it's disrespectful
to you and Mom.

196
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,666
- Ah, there's no need
to feel that way.

197
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,041
I've got a vague sense
that you have your own reasons.

198
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,791
And even if you don't,
I'm prepared to brush it off

199
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,083
as something
I can't do anything about.

200
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,958
Now, I can't really speak
for the rest of the world,

201
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:06,125
but personally I don't believe
school is the be-all-end-all.

202
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,125
It's not a big deal.

203
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,583
- But why?

204
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,875
- Hmm?

205
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,041
Why did you suddenly decide

206
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,458
to tell me
all of this stuff right now?

207
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,875
What's the occasion?

208
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,583
Today's not
a special day or anything.

209
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,916
Unless it's secretly
Mountain of Peas Day.

210
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,375
- Well, your bowl was certainly
full of those things, wasn't it?

211
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,666
I'm not really sure why.

212
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,708
I guess the look on your face
this morning

213
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,708
just seemed a little better.

214
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,750
- [gasps] My face looked better?

215

- [chuckles]
The expression on it, I mean.

216
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,958
Of course you still
do look like a bad guy,

217
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,833
thanks to those angry eyes
you inherited from your
mom.

219

Nothing about me has changed.

That's how I want it, okay?

You look like
you're really hurting!

along the way,

00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,000
I stopped being the best

I always used to excel at.

What used to be my best
grew smaller and smaller.

it was all pointless,

that it made no sense.

I'd always have to do

I made everybody think
I would do anything...

288
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,208
so the stuff I did

289
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,166
ended up being
progressively dumber.

290

this much fun without me,

00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,041
that we'd break up the boring

I'd set my sights higher.

after taking
a good look around...

300

I found there was
no one left but me.

301

It was right then and there
when I finally realized,

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,625
despite all my efforts
to be the center of attention,

303

there was nothing special
about me at all.

I just tried to be invisible,

doing my best not to stand out,

308

all through middle school.

But things changed after that.

310
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,750
Honestly, I really blew my
high school debut in a big way.

311
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,166
It was bound to happen, though.

312
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,958
I'd never had any real
relationships up to that point.

313
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,333
High school wasn't
gonna be any better.

314
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,958
And then one day,
it kind of hit me.

315
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,291
I just didn't want
to go to school at all.

Everything snowballed
from there.

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,291
I skipped school once a week,

318
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,291
then once every three days,
then every other day.

319
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,750
It didn't even
take me three months

320
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,416
before I had stopped
going there altogether.

321
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,416
But somehow,
no matter how pathetic I was,

322
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,958
you and Mom
just treated me the same way,

323
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,416
like it didn't make
any difference.

324
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,291
I think that's what
scared me most of all.

325
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,416
I wanted you to say,
"I don't love you,"

326
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,541
or, "I can't stand you,"

327
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,750
or maybe even,
"You are not my son."

328
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,208
I really hoped
you'd tell me that

329
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,458
and then throw me out.

330
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:46,041
I wanted you
to just make me give it all up.

331
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,583
But now...

332
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,708
REM:<i> It's easy to give up,</i>

333
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:56,000
<i>but doing so doesn't suit you.</i>

334
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,166
<i>I love you, Subaru,</i>
<i>so very much.</i>

335
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,250
<i>Let's start here...</i>

336
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,291
<i>from square one.</i>

337
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,125
<i>No...</i>

338
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,666
<i>from zero!</i>

339
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,458
<i>My hero,</i>
<i>he's the greatest in the world.</i>

340
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,208
- Subaru...

341
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,625
- Eh?

342
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,000
Huh?

343
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,833
- Father Head-butt!

344
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,500
- [groans]
- You see that, son?

345
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,000
That was my most loving
Father Head-butt,

346
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,958
- packed with all my rage!
- Hey, that was an ax kick,

347
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,208
not a head-butt! Ow!

348
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,916
You're right!
My leg goes up pretty high.

349
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,666
This is
just an observation here,

350
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,333
but you're kind of stupid,
aren't you?

351
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,500
- Uh, huh?

352
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,500
- A lot about what you said
bothers me,

353
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,750
but you know what's the worst?

354
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,416
You wanted me to hate
you,
so you tried to achieve
that

355
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,875
by playing hooky? How dumb!

356
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,041
If you want to get me
to throw you out,

357
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,458
then pick a more active
method!
Who would ditch their own kid

358
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,625
just because he retreated
into his shell, huh?!

359
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,125
You're so twisted,

360
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,958
you're on the fast track
to being an idiot!

361
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,541
And just so you know,
I'd be glad

362
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,125
to set you straight
by force if you want,

363
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,208
but it looks like you've
already been knocked down

364
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,916
and you've been able
to stand back up,

365
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,083
so there's no need
to do so, is there?

366
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,125
[laughs]

367
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,041
- You heard what I said.

368
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,375
I did find a girl that I like.

369
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,708
Actually there's another girl
who said she loves me,

370
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,458
despite all of the flaws
that I have.

371
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,666
And neither one of them
has any idea

372
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,750
that I'm the son
of Kenichi Natsuki.

373
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,333
In their eyes,
I'm just Subaru Natsuki,

374
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,583
nothing more, nothing less.

375
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,375
No, in all of their eyes,

376
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,833
just Subaru Natsuki.

377
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,666
I guess I finally
figured that out.

378
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,083
- What do you know?
It took you long enough.

379
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,541
You're really just now coming
around to saying all this
stuff?

380
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,958
I should whack you.

381
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,583
- You just whacked
my skull with your heel

382
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,250
- not even a few minutes ago!
- [chuckles] Sorry about that.

383
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,333
Still, I suppose this was
all my fault for not realizing

384
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,833
that you thought so highly
of your awesome dad.

385
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,666
Sorry. Looks like
I just ended up being

386
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,416
too big a part of your life.

387
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,583
- Yeah, I really don't want
to admit that's true,

388
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,333
- even though it is.
- Good talk.

389
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,041
That took a little weight
off my shoulders. [sighs]

390
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,250
Now we need to chat
about the future,

391
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,791
'cause we are
just getting started.

392
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,541
- Oh, sure. Um, sorry
for putting you through--

393
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,125
- If you really are
feeling sorry about everything,

394
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,416
all you gotta do from here

395
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,291
is take your time
making it up to us.

396
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,416
- [gasps]
- Okay?

397
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,708
Just try to take good care
of your mom and me

398
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:30,125
when we get old, all right, son?

399
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,416
- [gasps]

400
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,250
[crying]

401
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,458
I'm--I'm so sorry.

402
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,625
- Eh? Subaru?

403
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,458
- I'm sorry. I-I...

404
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,625
- [shudders]

405
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,708
- I can't.

406
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,333
I'm sorry.

407
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,458
I won't be able
to make anything up to you.

408
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,583
I'll probably
never see you again.

409
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:04,666
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

410
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,333
I'm so sorry.

411
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,125
I'm sorry.

412
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,458
I'm so sorry!

413
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,875
- You know, no matter
how much time passes,

414
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,750
you're still
such a handful, son. Sheesh.

415
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,208
- [sobbing]

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,375
- All right, I still feel
like walking a little bit more,

417
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,500
so I think I'm gonna
take the long way home

418
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,791
to stretch my legs.

419
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,791
- Okay. I'll keep
heading this way, then.

420
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,083
[sighs]

421
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,666
- Hey, Subaru...

422
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,333
I'm sure you got a lot of things
going on right now, too,

423
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,416
so there's really only one thing
I want to say.

424
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,541
Just give it your all, son,

425
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,375
and do the best you can.
Got it?

426
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,333
- Yeah.

427
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,333
You can count on me, Dad.

428
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,791
Listen up!

429
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,750
My name is Subaru Natsuki,

430
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,375
son of Kenichi Natsuki!

431
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:06,375
I can do anything,
and I will do anything,

432
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,666
'cause your son's
just that awesome!

433
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,833
- Come on! I already know that.

434
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,708
I mean, you are half me,
after all,

435
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,916
- so it's in your blood.
- [chuckles]

436
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,291
[music playing]

437
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,583
Well, the student
Subaru Natsuki is complete.

438
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,541
What's it been already,
about three months or so?

439
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,375
- Hey! Are you feeling nervous?

440
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,916
Want to try out this new
mayonnaise on something?

441
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,541
- Nah, I'm not
in the mood right now.

442
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,916
- Suit yourself, then.

443
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,666
Guess I really
shouldn't be surprised.

444
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,416
After all, you don't actually
like mayonnaise that much.

445
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,750
- Huh?
- I mean, your dad and I

446
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,250
both like it quite a bit,

447
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,625
so I suppose you were
only sharing it with us.

448
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,875
- Uh, hang on.
What gives you that idea?

449
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,875
- Then, which would you choose,
the world or mayonnaise?

450
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,291
- Well, the world, obviously!

451
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,500
- Just as I thought.

452
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,208
- What's with
the self-satisfied smile?!

453
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,583
Look, anyone
who picks mayonnaise

454
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,250
doesn't do it
because they like mayonnaise!

455
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,875
They just hate the world,
all right?!

456
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,166
- [laughs]

457
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,666
Well, I suppose that's true.

458
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,666
- Anyway,
I should be heading out.

459
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,375
- You're leaving for school now?

460
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,125
Don't get me wrong. I'm glad,

461
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,458
but won't that give
a bad impression?

462
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,791
Why do today what you can
put off until tomorrow?

463
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,958
- Your son finally found
the motivation to do something!

464
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,416
Don't ruin it!
I'm too hard on everyone else

465
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,083
and easy on myself as it is!

466
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,041
Well, I must admit,
if you really were that way,

467
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,958
it would've meant
a whole lot less trouble for me,

468
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,958
and that, I can assure you

469
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,958
- Uh...

470
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,500
Hey, what's this about?!
Why are you following me?

471
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,416
Going from being a shut-in
to walking to school with my mom

472
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,000
is worse than a game penalty.

473
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,083
I'm not going
all the way to school.

474
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:02,458
Just to the convenience store,
all right?

475
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,000
It's been such a long time

476
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,625
since you and I walked together,
hasn't it?

477
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,375
- It has?

478
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,625
- What did you and your dad
talk about?

479
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,416
- Nothing special, really.

480
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,375
Just reliving the past
and stuff.

481
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,000
- Hmm. So reliving the past

482
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,708
somehow made you want
to go back to school, I guess?

483
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,833
- Well, I suppose
you could say that.

484
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,375
It gave me a chance
to look back on a few things

485
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,666
and sort them out.

486
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,916
Is that so, Subaru?
Then you've given up

487
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,541
on trying to be just like
your father in everything?

488
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,958
- Uh...

489
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,375
- You were always
an incredibly hard worker.

490
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,250
You could do so much
without even trying.

491
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,000
Since your dad was
into lots of different things,

492
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,208
you had
quite a few opportunities.

493
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,916
[laughs] Exhausting, isn't it?

494
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,666
- Mom, how much do you...

495
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,375
- [sighs]

496
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,041
You should know, Subaru,

497
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,666
parents keep a close eye
on their children,

498
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,375
more than they realize.
We're protective.

499
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:01,500
That goes for me, too.
I'm always watching you.

500
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,583
One time, when you were little,
I had to give you a suppository,

501
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,041
so I've even seen
your little heinie up close.

502
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,541
Whoa, T.M.I.!

503
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,375
It's nice going down
memory lane with you,

504
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,708
but don't tell me
everything, Mom.

505
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,041
- The back-and-forth
about mayonnaise,

506
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,541
as well as your reasons
for not going to school,

507
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,333
If there was anything at
all
I could have done for
you,

508
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,791
I gladly would have,
but no matter what I tried,

509
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,500
I felt like nothing was
going to make a difference.

510
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,083
However...

511
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,666
someone other
than your father and me

512
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,500
seems to have made a positive
impact on you, didn't they?

513
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:36,666
Whoever they are, I think
they did a wonderful thing.

514
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,500
We should be grateful to them.

515
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:40,875
- [chuckles]

516
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,166
Well, yeah, I agree.

517
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,416
That's why I'm able
to walk this path.

518
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,750
They really are
wonderful people.

519
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,083
I honestly don't deserve them.

520
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,625
- I see. But you won't give them
to anyone else, right?

521
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,083
- Aw, you better believe it.

522
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,916
'Cause whether
I'm good enough for them or not

523
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,583
isn't the issue at all.
If I had to give them away,

524
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,583
I'd make them mine,
even if I don't deserve them!

525
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,875
I'd just vow to make myself
worthy of them later on.

526
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,125
- Mm-hmm.

527
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,041
Oh, yeah.

528
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,583
You're definitely his kid.

529
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,791
- [gasps]

530
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:19,791
But am I--am I doing
everything that I can?

531
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,916
Am I living up
to all the expectations

532
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,458
of being his kid?

533
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,375
- [chuckles]

534
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,625
Don't worry about a thing.

535
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,625
'Cause after all,
half of everything

536
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,958
at the core of who you are
came from me,

537
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:35,333
so if you manage to become
even half as cool as your dad,

538
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,833
then you've filled your quota.

539
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,666
Just do whatever you need
to measure up to that
level.

540
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,625
And as for the other half,
that part can simply be Subaru.

541

- [gasps]

542
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,416
- Which means do your best
in your own way.

543
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,291
Be the best you that you can.

544
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,166
At least, that's what I think.

545
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,583
- The best in my own way, huh?

546
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:01,500
- Exactly. Though it's fine
if you want to be a bit

547
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:05,291
like your mom and dad
as you grow into yourself.

548
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,833
Well, I'm heading this way.

549
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:09,958
Will you be okay on your own?

550
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,708
- I'll be fine.

551
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,500
- I'm sure you will.

552
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,875
Give it your all, then.

555
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,583
Mom!

556
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,166
There's something I need to do!

557
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,083
I probably won't see you
for a long time!

558
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:36,250
It's kinda far away, too,

559
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,708
which means it'll be hard
to keep in touch!

560
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,916
Even so,
no matter where I might be,

561
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,041
I promise you
I'll be thinking of you guys,

562
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,875
and I'll never forget you.

563
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,333
- Subaru, I...

564
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,750
- I swear to you,
no matter what,

565
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,875
I'll always want to be your kid.

566
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:58,000
I'll try to never do anything
that makes me hate myself!

567
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,875
- My sweet boy.
- [gasps]

568

Listen. I understand.

570
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,625
I know
what you're trying to say.

How could you?

573
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:18,083
- Come now.
How could I know that?

574
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,625
Easy. Because I'm your mother,
of course.

I'm--I'm sorry, Mom.

I was never able
to do anything for you guys,

and now...

579

- Hey, we didn't have you

580
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:43,208
because we wanted you
to do something for us.

Pathetic.

- No, there's nothing wrong
with crying.

You can cry all you want.

how I meant for you to take it.
