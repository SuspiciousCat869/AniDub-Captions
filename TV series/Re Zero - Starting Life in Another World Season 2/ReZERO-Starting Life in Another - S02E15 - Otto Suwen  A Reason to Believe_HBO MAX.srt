- [gasps]

324
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,291
- It seems you've gotten
stronger, haven't you,
Garf?

325

- [shriek echoes]

333
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:33,833
- I'm counting on you, Otto,

334
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,083
so please
don't do anything crazy.

335
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,541
Now...

336
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:43,083
it's time for me to do my part.

337
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,541

[footsteps echoing]

339
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,541
Ah, good. I finally found you.

340
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,791
- [gasps]

341
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,750
Subaru?

342
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,708
[breeze echoing]

343
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,125
- You really thought
this through, didn't you, Mili?

344
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,041
You knew
that no one would find you

345
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,166
if you holed up in this place.

346
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,125
- Why--why are you here, Subaru?

347
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,125
You don't...

348
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,375
- "...get forced back
as hard as Roswaal."

349
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,208
- Is that it?
- [gasps]

350
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,041
- I mean, I'm here,
as you can see,

351
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,333
but I'm fighting
pretty hard to hang on.

352
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,583
- Is that so?

353
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,250
- When I left for this place,

354
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,041
half of me
believed you'd be here,

355
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,666
and the other half
just wished for it.

356
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,708
- Half and half.

357
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,583
- I'm so relieved
that I found you.

358
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,708
- Just relieved?
- Huh?

359
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,041
- Does this mean
you're not angry?

360
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,375
- Hold on.
What are you talking about?

361
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,666
Were you actually afraid
I'd be mad at you?

362
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,333
Well, I'm not.

363
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,625
Though I did panic,

364
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,291
and frankly,
I wasn't even sure I was alive.

365
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,250
- I see.

366
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,250
You're not angry.

367
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,125
- Emilia?

368
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:57,833
- After what's happened,

369
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,458
you don't feel that way at all.

370
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:05,250
You won't even get angry at me.

371
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:09,041
Why? Why won't you, Subaru?

372
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,750
What I did was really selfish,
wasn't it?

373
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,000
It caused you trouble,
didn't it?

374
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:18,208
I left on my own
and then didn't tell you.

375
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,333
Are you not angry

376
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,083
'cause you knew better
than to expect anything?

377
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,166
You're this kind to me
even when I mess up,

378
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,625
because it doesn't faze you.

379
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,791
You're not even disappointed,
are you,

380
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,166
because you know
I'll never do anything right.

381
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,041
- Is that it?
- Emilia, wait a second.

382
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,291
That couldn't be farther
from the truth, I swear!

383
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,625
- Then why?

384
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,458
I don't get it.

385
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,250
Why didn't you
keep your promise to me?!

386
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,625
- [gasps]

387
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,375
- You and Puck,

388
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,625
you broke your word
and went away.

389
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,583
[crying] You headed out,
and then you left me
behind.

390
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,625
You're a liar.

391
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,458
Puck is a liar.

392
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,208
Both of you.

393
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,708
You lied.

394
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,083
- Emilia.

395
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,583
- You shouldn't break a promise.

396
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,583
Why would you do that?!

397
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,375
It's just wrong!

398
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:11,125
[sobbing]

399
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
- Listen to me.

400
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,500
I love you so much, Emilia.

401
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,333
- Huh?

402
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,208
[gasps]

403
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,333
- Night after night,

404
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,416
you rush into
the same damn trial, don't you?

405
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,166
And all it amounts to
are some scenes from your past.

406
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,458
There's no need for you

407
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,708
to keep moping about stuff
that's over and done with.

408
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,458
When I tried to do it for you,

409
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,166
you told me no
and said only you could do it,

410
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,875
so when you blow it, that
just means you were all talk!

411
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,708
- [gasps] Subaru.

412
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,666
- And then when your guardian
and pet takes off,

413
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,541
you abandon your duties

414
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,083
and run off to sulk
and cry your eyes out?

415
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,416
Sorry, but I just
can't put up with it anymore!

416
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,458
- [gasping]

417
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,208
You're right to say that.

418
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,166
And if I'm being honest,

419
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,375
it makes sense
why you'd think of me that way.

420
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,541
- Still...

421
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,708
I truly love you, Emilia,

422
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,833
completely.

423
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,166
- [gasps]

424
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,458
- And I won't ever
stop loving you.

425
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,416
I care about you so much,

426
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,625
I don't know
what to do with myself.

427
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,333
- Wh-Where did this come from?

428
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,375
- I love that beautiful
silver hair of yours

429
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,708
and those sparkling purple
jewels you have for eyes.

430
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,208
I love your voice and how
just hearing it mesmerizes me.

431
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,041
Your slender arms and legs
and your porcelain skin,

432
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,291
even your height
is something so perfect to me,

433
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,750
I can hardly stand it.

434
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,916
Just being with you
makes my heart race.

435
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,375
It's scary, honestly.

436
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,083
I love how you're
a little absent-minded, too,

437
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:53,583
the way that you try
to give everything your all,

438
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,875
and I respect how you always
do your best to help people.

439
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,708
It's hard to leave you alone

440
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,916
when I see you
putting others before yourself.

441
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,708
I want to see all the beautiful
expressions you make

442
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,583
from right here beside you.

443
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,583
- Th-This is no time for--

444
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,458
Stop playing around!

445
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,291
Why are you
suddenly telling me this?!

446
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,916
It has nothing to do
with what we were talking about!

447
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,250
You were saying I'm
completely useless, remember,

448
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,958
and that you
couldn't put up with me!

449
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,500
- You're right about that.

450
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,625
- So what would make you

451
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,500
ever forgive me
for being so hopeless?

452
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,541
- I've already answered that
over and over again!

453
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,458
Listen to me very closely!

454
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,833
It's because I love you!

455
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,291
- [gasps]

456
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,916
- That's not gonna change!

457
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,416
In my eyes, every single thing
about you shines like the sun!

458
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,916
Yeah, of course there are
parts
of you that aren't perfect.

459
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,791
You're not an angel
or a goddess.

460
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,125
You're an ordinary girl.

461
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,916
You'll feel so bad
you want to cry sometimes,

462
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,041
and you'll want to run away
from things that hurt!

463
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,291
I get that!

464
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,791
But even with those weaknesses

465
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,250
and the parts of yourself
you might even consider ugly,

466
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,000
I love every fiber
of your being, Emilia.

467
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,375
- [gasps]

468
00:20:59,458 --> 00:20:59,708
That's just...

469
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,208
too selfish!

470
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,375
You named all the things
that make me worthless,

471
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,000
and you still say you love me?

472
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,833
How am I supposed
to believe you?!

473
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:10,708
- No, you're wrong!

474
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,125
You've got everything
completely wrong!

475
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,958
So I'm going to make this
crystal clear.

476
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,541
It's not because I
believe in you that I love you.

477
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,666
Don't you understand?!

478
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,375
I believe in you
because I love you!

479
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,708
- Just feeling that way

480
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,500
isn't a reason
to believe in someone!

481
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,458
- [gasps]

482
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,500
Then if that isn't enough
to have faith in you,

483
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,125
why don't you tell me who
in the hell would voluntarily

484
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,041
go through all this
never-ending pain and suffering

485
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,041
to come and help a gigantic
pain in the ass like you are?!

486
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,708
I love you so much,
it makes me crazy!

487
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,333
It's never-ending!
I love you so much I could die!

488
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,041
That's why I put up with
everything that comes with it!

489
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,958
Even now,
I feel like I might puke,

490
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,666
but I'm still
standing in front of you!

491
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,958
- [gasps] Wait a second.

492
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,875
I never asked you to do that!

493
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,041
As far as I'm concerned,

494
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,500
you're only being selfish
and narrow-minded!

495
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,208
You're not thinking
about me at all!

496
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,041
You have no idea how I feel
every time that I see you,

497
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:00,916
see you out risking your life

498
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,583
and getting hurt
just because of me!

499
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,958
- Well, how would I
even know that?

500
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,416
I don't think about it!

501
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,375
What I do think about is
how to look good in front of you

502
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,708
and be a hero in your eyes!

503
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,500
I am absolutely
suffering for you here!

504
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,750
'Least try to look as cute
as I hoped you would!

505
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,083
- Don't talk
like I'm just some doll!

506
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,250
Why did you break your promise?!

507
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,000
If you'd just done
what I asked you to,

508
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,583
then that would
have been enough!

509
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,500
Why wouldn't you even do that?!

510
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,583
The truth is
you really hate me, don't you?

511
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,916
- 'Course not!
- You're a liar!

512
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,791
- Listen! I love you!

513
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:30,500
- Then...

514
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,333
why?

515
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,166
Why did you break your promise?

516
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,208
- [sighs]

517
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,833
I can't say.

518
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,708
If you'd stayed with me
until morning

519
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:44,583
like you said you would...

520
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,833
I think--I think
I could have believed you.

521
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,041
I could have believed you and
entrusted you with everything.

522
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,833
But you just abandoned me.

523
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,041
[sobbing]

524
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,541
Since Puck left...

525
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,500
I've been
slowly regaining my memories,

526
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,416
things in my mind
I don't recognize,

527
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,291
conversations I don't recall.

528
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:16,541
More and more of them
keep coming back.

529
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,125
I thought
I remembered everything

530
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,708
- this whole time, but...
- [song playing in
Japanese]

531
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,666
- I went and
forgot them entirely,

532
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,541
like they never existed at all.

533
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,875
When the memories
finally return,

534
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:32,625
then what will I become?

535
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,083
Is this me, really me?

536
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,083
I forgot
so many important things.

537
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,833
I even failed
to remember my mother.

538
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,833
And yet I'm not wrong?

539
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,125
How is that possible?

540
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,708
- [gasps]

541
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,458
NAHOKO:<i> What matters</i>
<i>isn't how you start</i>

542
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,000
<i>or what happens in the middle.</i>

543
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,250
<i>It's all in how it ends.</i>

544
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,458
SUBARU:<i> Yeah.</i>

545
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,208
<i>You're absolutely right, Mom.</i>

546
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,166
No matter
what memories you get back,

547
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,833
it won't change anything,

548
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,666
'cause I'll love you
just the same,

549
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,166
and I always will.

550
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,041
- [crying]

551
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,291
I can't believe that.

552
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:18,625
If the me--If the me
you say you love...

553
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,708
if she goes away,
are you still going to feel--

554
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:24,041
- I am.

555
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,166
And regardless
of what might happen,

556
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,250
I know you're
not gonna go away.

557
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,041
I'll love you
'til my last breath.

558
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,166
- Just stop it. You're a liar!

559
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,375
All of this time, you've done
nothing to make me believe you.

560
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:38,208
- Okay, then I'll
make you believe me now.

561
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,208
- [gasps]

562
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,666
What are you...

563
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,875
- If you don't want this...

564
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:45,625
then dodge.

565
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,208
[song continues]

566
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:16,500
I love you.

567
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,583
No matter what you say or do,

568
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,458
even if we argue like this,

569
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:25,125
nothing will ever happen
to make me stop caring for you.

570
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll feel this way
until the end of time.

571
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,083
I will love you more every day.

572
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:33,166
And you have my word that I
will always believe in you.

573
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,958
By now, you should know why.

574
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,375
- 'Cause you love me?

575
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:46,291
- With all those unfamiliar
memories flooding your mind,

576
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:49,041
it's only natural that
you'd
feel anxious and
scared.

577
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,833
But every single one of them
is a part of you...

578
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,958
so I know that you're
gonna be just fine.

579
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:57,166
- But how?

580
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,791
How can you be so certain?

581
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,083
- What matters
isn't how you start,

582
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,375
but how it ends.

583
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,166
The woman I respect

584
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,208
more than anyone in the world
told me so.

585
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:11,791
You'll be okay, Emilia.

586
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,791
I'll be right here by your side.

587
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,291
Feel free to remember it all.

588
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,125
And if you're still afraid,
don't be.

589
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,125
We'll find it.

590
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:23,125
- What do you mean? Find what?

591
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,250
- In the same way
my feelings for you

592
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,333
make me able
to keep on moving forward,

593
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,000
you'll find
that most precious feeling

594
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,000
that makes you able

595
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,875
to blow away all your anxiety.

596
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,416
Then you can keep moving
forward.

597
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,708
And even though it might
come across as a little selfish,

598
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,833
I'm hopin' that feeling's
gonna be for me.

599
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:41,500
[chuckles]

600
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,958
- My most precious feeling, huh?

601
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,791
I wonder,

602
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:53,666
maybe it's among all these
memories I've been getting back

603
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,041
and it'll come to me.

604
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,416
- Yeah. I'm sure it will.

605
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,208
Your reason
to keep moving's in there.

606
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:01,666
- [gasps]

607
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,708
[music ends]

608
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,708
Yeah.

609
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,750
[leaves rustling]

610
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:27,250
- Hey. Sorry about the wait.

611
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:30,041
- Whatever. Ain't like
I was waitin' for you.
