00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,166
<i>Behold an unthinkable present.</i>

164
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,041
<i>Behold an unthinkable present.</i>

00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,583

[wind blowing]

170
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,000
[groans]

171
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,208
- What's wrong?

172
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,125
Are you having trouble
standing up, Subaru?

173
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,291
- Huh?

174
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,458
No way.

175
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,916
- I'm real, I assure you.

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,541
Whenever you need me,

177
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,125
I'll be right by your side.

178
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,625
- [gasps] Rem, is...

179
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,541
- Yes, your Rem
is here for you now.

180
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,166
- [groans]

181
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,833
It's you.

182
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,416
- Yes, I'm Rem, Subaru.

183
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,583
And I'll continue to be
the all-purpose,

184
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,750
ever-useful maid
of your very own.

185
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,166
- I'm dreaming.

186
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,791
- No, you're wide awake.

187
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,750
Are you feeling okay?

188
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,750
- I don't know.

189
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,791
Maybe I'm just a little tired.
That's all.

190
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,916
But I haven't even
done anything yet.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,541
- [gasps]

192
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,083
- If I were
a whole lot stronger,

193
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,375
a whole lot smarter,

194
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,166
if I were somebody
who's more capable,

195
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,083
then they--they wouldn't
have felt all that pain.

196
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,666
I can't believe
how much I put them through.

197
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,041
- Subaru.

198
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,708
- If the worlds I've been in

199
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,666
just kept on going after I died,

200
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,083
how often did I leave everybody
to suffer the same fate?

201
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,458
- Don't say that.

202
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:02,750
- How many times
did I let you die?

203
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,958
How many times
do I have to kill you?

204
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,875
- Oh, Subaru.

205
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,625
- [gasps]

206
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,875
- It's all right.

207
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,000
- It is?

208
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,375
- Because I love you.

209
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,000
I truly love you
with all my heart.

210
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,041
Know that, and just
remember
everything will be okay.

211
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,916
But that still doesn't
answer anything, though.

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,791
- You're wrong. It does.

213
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,875
Having my arms
wrapped around you

214
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,000
and holding you
the way I am right now,

215
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,041
that's the only answer.

216
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,083
- [gasps]

217
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,791
- You've been
through so much, Subaru,

218
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,458
and suffered great pain
all alone, but that's over.

219
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,000
You don't need
to feel sad anymore.

220
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,083
- I...

221
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,333
- I will take the place

222
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,166
of everything you're feeling.

223
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,041
Just put your faith in me.

224
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:55,041
It's finally time for you
to have some well-deserved rest.

225
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,875
All you need to do is sleep.

226
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,291
- I missed you.

227
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,791
-<i> It's easy to give up...</i>

228
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,916
<i>but doing so</i>
<i>doesn't suit you.</i>

229
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,500
- Huh?

230
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,083
Who are you, anyway?

231
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,083
- Huh?

232
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,000
- I'm asking you
who you really are,

233
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,250
and I want an explanation.

234
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,875
- But what do you mean?
You know me.

235
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,500
- Those times I felt
like I and couldn't go on,

236
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,791
clutching my knees
and wallowing in misery,

237
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:32,791
she would sit right by my side
and try to comfort me.

238
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,416
She'd listen patiently
to my troubles,

239
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,375
let me vent my insecurities,

240
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,625
then wring it all out of me
'til my tears ran dry.

241
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,166
And when I was through,

242
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,791
she would always say,
"Now stand up."

243
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,166
- [gasps]
- She would never tell me

244
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,750
to just take it easy and rest.

245
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,666
She wouldn't say
that I should give up

246
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,041
and entrust everything
to her, either.

247
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,875
The two of us
truly care about each other.

248
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,708
She's good to me,
said that she loves me,

249
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,041
but there's also nobody
she's tougher with.

250
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,291
Rem is the one girl
who would never go easy on me!

251
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,250
- You're wrong!

252
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,125
Please, listen, Subaru!

253
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,500
I don't want to see you
suffering, that's--

254
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,208
- I'll show her my weakness
and just how fragile I can be,

255
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,125
but there is no way
I'd ever let her see me give up!

256
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,875
<i>- Because you're</i>
<i>my hero, Subaru!</i>

257
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,083
- Get out of here, you fraud.

258
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,083
And stop coddling me!

259
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:24,083
Enough! How dare you
try and pose as Rem?!

260
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,125
- [gasps]

261
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,041
This isn't what I expected.

262
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,750
I was told to just...

263
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,750
- Huh?

264
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,958
[chiming]

265
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,083
Tell me who the hell you are.

266
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,291
- I-I'm Carmilla,

267
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,208
th-the Witch of Lust.

268
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,500
N-Nice to meet you.

269
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,666
- Is this all
a part of Echidna's dream?

270
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,000
- You better start explaining!
- [gasps]

271
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,333
- What were you
trying to pull earlier?!

272
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,125
- Earlier? What?

273
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,416
- I'm talking about you
coming to me disguised as Rem!

274
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,041
Is that some power of yours?!

275
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,041
- N-No!

276
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,416
I-If I looked
like somebody else to you,

277
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,750
i-it's only because...

278
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,083
y-you wanted to see me that way.

279
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:14,750
- What?!

280
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,083
- I didn't want to,

281
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,625
but Echidna told me
that all I needed to do

282
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,041
was be kind and
dote on you a little bit.

283
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,250
- She's the one
who's behind this?!

284
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,250
ECHIDNA:<i> Going further</i>
<i>will endanger your life.</i>

285
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,125
- [gagging]

286
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,416
[coughs]

287
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,041
[panting]

288
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,125
- Carmilla's Faceless Bride
has the side effect

289
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,250
of making one forget to breathe
when in her presence,

290
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:42,833
but in the end, it'll make your
heart stop beating altogether.

291
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,416
- Echidna...

292
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,375
just what in the hell
have you been plotting?

293
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,083
- Isn't it obvious?

294
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,208
An evil scheme. I am a witch.

295
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,875
- [gasps] Why would you
do something like that?

296
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,333
- Because I felt it was

297
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,500
the most effective means
to an end, that's why.

298
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,250
If I'd left things alone,
your mind would have worn away

299
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,208
to nothing
over the course of the trial.

300
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,000
- So you're saying
you did it to save me?

301
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,416
- [chuckles]
Guess I can't make any excuses

302
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,083
for the fact that I wounded
your heart as a result.

303
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,958
I've resigned myself
to accept your rage.

304
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,833
- [cloth crinkles]
- [exhales]

305
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,958
- [sighs] I know what it is

306
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,416
you want to find out
more than anything right now,

307
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,250
so allow me
to explain the trial.

308
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,458
Just as it was
with the first one,

309
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,250
the second trial
puts you within a world

310
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,041
that's been recreated
from all your memories.

311
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,333
It's a thoroughly
well-constructed unreality.

312
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,125
- [sighs]

313
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,083
Then, I--

314
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,041
- However...

315
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,375
your Return by Death

316
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,916
is the Witch of Envy's
Authority, of course.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,125
And therefore, she's
the only one who truly knows

318
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,250
whether or not the things
that you witnessed

319
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,416
actually took place
or if they were just fabricated.

320
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,000
- Now hang on.
You mean all that stuff I saw

321
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,333
might have really happened
and it wasn't in my mind?

322
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,083
- I'm only saying
it's a possibility.

323
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:05,416
Instead of counting the people
you may have failed to save,

324
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,916
you should try focusing
on those you have saved.

325
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,125
- Dumb clichés like that
aren't gonna help me!

326
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,416
- I know you've given

327
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,625
all the mental and physical
strength you possess

328
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,208
to survive everything thus far.

329
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,583
The fact that you're
sitting here proves it.

330
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,041
- [sputters]
- Not a single, solitary thing

331
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,833
you've experienced
on your way to this point

332
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,541
could be considered a waste.

333
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,250
You've arrived at the
moment
you find yourself in now

334
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,875
by doing
everything in your power

335
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,250
at the risk of your own life,

336
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,875
and that is
something to be proud of.

337
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,416
- I just don't get you at all.

338
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I mean, what's with
all these attempts you make

339
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,958
to offer me encouragement?

340
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,041
- Trying to force a girl

341
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,166
to spell something
like that out for you, huh?

342
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,333
If you ask me, that's kind of
a mean thing for you to do.

343
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,083
[clears throat]

344
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,125
So, Subaru, I would like
to form a contract with
you.

345
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,041
Are you interested?

346
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,208
- A-A contract with me?

347
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,625
- Yes. You'd have
a formal arrangement

348
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,625
with the Witch of Greed.

349
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,083
What do you say, then?

350
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,583
Does that sound
attractive to you?

351
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,791
Well, I don't know.
What happens if I agree?

352
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,000
- It's rather simple, really.
With this,

353
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:11,791
whenever you
run into an obstacle

354
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,958
that you can't overcome,

355
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,416
when you feel
you're being crushed

356
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,541
by the weight of your sins,

357
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,750
I will give you my full support.

358
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,333
I'm quite confident
in the depths of my knowledge,

359
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,458
and I should be able to find
a way to deal with any
problem,

360
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,083
but most importantly,

361
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,541
I can share
in your Return by Death ability.

362
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,666
- And what does that mean?

363
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,250
Are you actually
sitting there and listing off

364
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,333
the selling points of going
into this thing with you?

365
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,291
- I believe it only makes sense

366
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,000
to explain
the merits of such an act.

367
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,583
And besides,
if it makes you lean

368
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,375
toward agreeing to it at all,
then so much the better.

369
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,625
It's calculated.

370
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,250
- [sighs]

371
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,333
Do you know what, then?

372
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,166
I think this isn't
such a bad idea.

373
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,708
- It isn't?!
- [gasps]

374
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,375
[dishes clatter]

375
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,583
- I mean, uh, right.

376
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,375
If you absolutely insist,

377
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,000
guess I wouldn't mind entering
into a contract with you.

378
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,666
- Kinda late playing it off now.

379
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,375
Anyway, assuming
that I'm ready to try this,

380
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,250
how would we get started?

381
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,541
- To establish
a formal contract,

382
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,666
the two of us would need
to form a direct link

383
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,208
between our souls
and bind them.

384
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:20,625
First, we raise our palms
to each other like this.

385
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,708
- [gasps]

386
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,666
[chuckles]

387
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,041
- [booming]
- What the hell?!

388
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,125
- It ends now.

389
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,250
I'm putting a stop to this!

390
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,541
SUBARU: The Witch of Wrath?

391
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,041
- I just can't accept it!

392
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,458
- So you're after him,
too, I take it?

393
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,125
It looks like someone's jealous.

394
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,916
- Come on! Stop teasing me!

395
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,125
I'm outraged,
and I'm indignant!

396
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,833
I'm at my wit's end, too!

397
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,958
I'm absolutely boiling
with anger! Understand?!

398
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,375
- Wait a minute.
How is she even here right now?

399
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,625
'Cause I thought
the only way other witches

400
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,500
are able to show up is by you
swapping places with them.

401
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,833
- That is a lie!
- [gasps]

402
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,083
- She's a malicious jerk
who plays mean tricks

403
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,208
like that for no good reason!
Now confess!

404
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,250
- I didn't want to just keep

405
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,541
popping witches into existence,

406
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,875
let alone allow one of them
to take you from me.

407
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,625
- I can't believe
how gullible you are!

408
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,458
Stop being fooled
by Echidna's smooth talking!

409
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,750
It's just sad! And besides,

410
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,458
she hasn't even told you
what parts of that contract

411
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,583
would be bad for you!

412
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,791
- [gasps] Hold on.

413
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,166
What is she talking about?

414
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,833
- Oh, she means your payment
for contracting with me.

415
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,291
To be fair, I think
that calling it a bad thing

416
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,750
is a bit
of an exaggeration, though.

417
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,083
- All right, so what
exactly
do you want from me,
then?

418
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,583
What do I
have to give you, anyway?

419
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,000
- The answer's quite simple.

420
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,666
Everything you feel,
everything you think,

421
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,125
everything that remains
in your heart,

422
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,666
the future as you know it,
all that you accomplish,

423
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,708
all the potential
you have inside,

424
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,458
all the fruits of the unknown

425
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,625
that's been produced from
the depths of your existence,

426
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,458
and more.

427
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,458
I have to have a taste of it.

428
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,083
- [gasping]

429
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,666
CARMILLA: Th-That's all true,

430
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,291
but, uh...

431
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:13,291
d-don't assume that she
just told you everything.

432
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,583
- The Witch of Lust?

433
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,750
- See, Echidna isn't--

434
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,791
she isn't lying, but there's...

435
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,208
a lot--a lot of things
that she's hiding from you.

436
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,500
- What they say
is of little consequence,

437
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,291
so I would pay no attention
to their ramblings.

438
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,791
Listen.
With our contract, Subaru,

439
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,666
I will begin, without fail,

440
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,625
to guide you down the path
of the future that you desire.

441
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,750
- This wouldn't be
the promise you always precede

442
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,416
with something like,
"in the end," would it?

443
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,750
- [sighs]
- Another one?

444
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,041
Who are you?!

445
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,500
- I am the Witch of Sloth,
Sekhmet.

446
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,750
[sighs]
Just letting you know my name

447
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,333
for the record and all. [sighs]

448
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,041
- You're the sixth one I've met.

449
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,291
- It's not my concern.

450
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,208
I've only come
to serve as a watchdog

451
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,791
and to make certain
that everything stays fair.

452
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:02,291
[sighs] But still, I'll
fulfill
my obligation to her. [sighs]

453
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,416
- Oh! You're also here, Baru?!

454
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,291
Hold on. Is everybody here now?

455
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,833
- That's so unusual!
- Ah!

456
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,583
It's been such a long time
since we had a tea party.

457
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,541
I assume I was invited,
too, right?

458
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,416
SUBARU: You keep showing up
one after another!

459
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,875
What is this all about?!

460
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,250
- I told you already. [sighs]
Weren't you listening?

461
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,208
Her promise
that's always preceded

462
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,375
by "in the end." [sighs]

463
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,250
- "In the end." Huh?

464
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,500
Echidna...

465
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,250
you did tell me
you'd be sure and guide me

466
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,583
down the path
to the best possible future,

467
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,833
now, didn't you?

468
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,250
- Yes, and that's quite true.
I swear it.

469
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,791
- And with the help
that you've agreed to give me,

470
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,541
would I get to that same future

471
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,041
without anything bad happening?

472
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,000
Why are you being so quiet?

473
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,875
I want you
to answer me, Echidna!

474
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,250
Now say something!

475
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,250
I know you heard me, damn it!

476
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
- [sighs]

477
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,583
In order to attain
the future you desire,

478
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,583
certain sacrifices
have to be made along the way.

479
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,416
In fact, you've made
that exact resolution yourself.

480
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,958
You do remember, don't you?

481
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,625
- Eh, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

482
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,250
- Afraid I can't do that.

483
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,541
You need
to understand this better.

484
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,041
Just think about it!

485
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,500
The Return by Death Authority
you possess

486
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,000
is a tremendous thing.

487
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,916
You don't understand
how truly useful it is.

488
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,625
With this ability,
you can restart the world

489
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,291
all you want until you reach
the future you covet.

490
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,250
It's the embodiment
of the ultimate ideal

491
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,500
any seeker
could possibly wish for!

492
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,916
Of course, I would never
force you to Return by Death.

493
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,250
You'll continue to use it

494
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,041
to achieve
the result that you crave,

495
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,791
and I'll uphold
my end of the contract

496
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,458
by lending you the wisdom
you need to fulfill your wish.

497
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,083
All of the results
that come about in the process

498
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,625
of you getting
additional chances

499
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,708
will contribute vastly

500
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,833
to the satisfaction
of my curiosity!

501
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,791
We'll agonize over,
struggle with,

502
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,750
and solve
the same problems together.

503
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,666
Then, with your ability
and my knowledge,

504
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,916
I know we'll both succeed!

505
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,333
To reiterate,
as I make use of your power,

506
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,000
I want you to use me also

507
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,000
and achieve
your best possible future.

508
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,666
My maidenly heart's
affection for you

509
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,750
and my longing to help you
are real and beyond reproach.

510
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,458
I'd be more
than content to have you

511
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,000
treat me as a convenience.

512
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,708
If it's what you want,
you're welcome to use my body

513
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:20,625
in any way
that would comfort you.

514
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,875
I quite happily offer it,
Subaru.

515
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,541
I will give you the strength

516
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,791
to get up and move forward
with my words.

517
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,000
Whether you want solace,
motivation, love,

518
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,916
or even hatred,
I'll offer it to you.

519
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,541
I can give you all that
and so much more!

520
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,041
You like girls
who give it all, don't you?

521
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,916
Look no further! You need me!

522
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,875
There's no one but you who
can satisfy my curiosity now.

523
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:42,916
If you use your power
to save somebody,

524
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,833
I want you to use it to save me.

525
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,083
I cannot control the depth
or extent of my own greed!

526
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,958
No matter what happens,
I will guide you

527
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,500
to the future you desire,
just as promised!

528
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,875
I swear it!
I absolutely swear it!

529
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,375
And the Sanctuary's freedom
lies beyond that.

530
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,333
You can rescue
everybody trapped there,

531
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,458
the one you love
and all those you care about!

532
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,833
For that purpose,
I need you to take me, use me,

533
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,666
and rob me
of all the greed you'd like

534
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,666
so we can take hold
of our future!

535
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,500
That is what I want from you,
what I hunger from you,

536
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,041
and everything
I can offer you in return.

537
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,625
I've told you everything now,

538
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,333
truly every last detail

539
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,333
with all the passion
in my heart.

540
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,083
This might be close to love.

541
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,958
Yes, it's a vow of love!

542
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,041
And how will you respond
to that love?

543
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,833
I want your answer.

544
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:28,958
After all,
this is one of the replies

545
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,791
that will satisfy my curiosity.

546
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,541
SUBARU: Echidna...

547
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,875
- Yes?

548
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,541
- you plan on using me?
Is that it?

549
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,166
- Indeed,
and you can do the same to me.

550
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,750
That's what
this contract is for.

551
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,708
If you want to criticize me
for using it

552
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,791
as a means to keep you
as my own, I'll accept that.

553
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,166
It is the truth.

554
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,708
- Well, it isn't
as if I never considered

555
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:02,458
that you might have a little
less than honorable
intentions.

556
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,166
Even so...

557
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,791
that's just so much.

558
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,791
You've gone
way over the line here!

559
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,666
- I don't get it.

560
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,458
So what exactly do you find
so problematic about this?

561
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:18,500
- Everything about your attitude
is so immature and shallow.

562
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,708
It's completely superficial!

563
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,791
When you laugh
or even when you're mad,

564
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,375
your whole frame of mind is--

565
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,958
Echidna, you're incapable
of understanding

566
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,583
how anybody else feels.

567
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,666
This is one of those times
when you could get angry.

568
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
- Now I see.

569
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,375
You've taught me a lot.

570
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,458
The next time
we have a chance,

571
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,833
I'll be sure to do that.

572
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,916
[snaps fingers]

573
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,583
But first, why not have a seat?

574
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:53,375
I'd like to discuss
our contract a little more.

575
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,625
- Just a minute.
There's one thing

576
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,000
that I wanted to ask you about
when I saw you again.

577
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,291
- Oh? What might that be?

578
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,875
- As soon as I hear your answer,

579
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,458
I should be able
to make a decision.

580
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,000
You know who Beatrice is,
don't you?

581
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,625
- I most certainly do.
I suppose you could say

582
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,666
I was rather involved
in her birth, in fact.

583
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,791
- She's lived her life
under a contract

584
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,208
forcing her to wait
for "that person,"

585
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,208
and I have reason to believe
it was made with you.

586
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,541
- You're right. I ordered her
to protect the forbidden
library

587
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,166
and await the one
who would come for her.

588
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,875
- And exactly who is
"that person," anyway?

589
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,708
How can I help to set her free?

590
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,041
- [laughs] Good question.

591
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,166
I wonder who it could be.

592
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,541
- [gasps]

593
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,708
You what? [groans]

594
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,541
Are you seriously telling me

595
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,875
you don't have any idea who
it is Beatrice is waiting
for?!

596
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,708
- Honestly, I don't know.

597
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,541
- But how? Why?

598
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,541
Weren't you the one
who told her to do it?

599
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:58,166
- Oh, there appears to be
a misunderstanding.

600
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,333
I didn't force Beatrice
to make that promise

601
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,125
so she'd give up
the forbidden library

602
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,625
to "that person" someday.

603
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:04,583
- You didn't?

604
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:05,208
- No, that wasn't the goal

605
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,958
I had in mind at all.

606
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,916
It's like this.

607
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,208
By making her swear to wait

608
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,083
for "that person"
to finally appear,

609
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:15,708
I get to find out
who it is that she'll choose

610
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:16,958
to be "that person."

611
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:19,750
- [gasps]

612
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,791
- Her staying there
for 400 years

613
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:24,750
without selecting anybody
was one possible outcome.

614
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,833
Her inability to pick anyone
after all this time

615
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:28,416
and wanting to die

616
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,125
as she agonized over

617
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,083
whether to keep upholding

618
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,583
the contract or not

619
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,000
represents another one.

620
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:38,041
- After what she's been through,
how do you feel about them?

621
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,750
- Huh?

622
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:43,250
Well, I think each one
is a wonderful possibility.

623
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,416
- Echidna...

624
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,250
you really are a witch,
aren't you?

625
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,166
A reprehensible monster

626
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,250
that's beyond
anything imaginable!

627
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,333
[inhales]

628
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:55,708
And I...

629
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,166
I refuse to take your hand.

630
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,625
I'm taking somebody else's,
instead.

631
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:03,791
It's the girl

632
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,125
who's been tied down for years

633
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,708
by the words you've spoken,

634
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,125
all so you could
satisfy your curiosity.

635
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,000

I've decided.

637
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,125
Hers is the hand
that I plan on taking.

638
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,916
I won't go with you.

- O-Oh, no!

643
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,666
I have nothing to do with this!

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,166
- A troublesome girl
just showed up

645
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,541
at a troubling time to start up
some trouble. [sighs]

00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,666
- Oh, my! I'm feeling hungry,

00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,125
so very, very hungry right now!

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,291
Long time, no see!
