EMILIA: I don't understand!

00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,708
Where did
this snowstorm come from?

7
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,166
- It only started to fall
a few moments ago,

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,250
but it's already started
to pile up quite heavily.

9
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,416
And of course we can't evacuate.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,166
Still, we've escaped
the worst of it thanks to this.

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,666
- Thank goodness,
but who made it for all of you?

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,791
- Huh?
- [murmuring]

13
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,250
- So are you saying

14
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,250
you aren't the one
who's responsible for this?

15
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,625
- You thought I made it? Mm-mmm.

16
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,375
- But that spirit said
if we wanted to thank someone,

17
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,583
it should be Miss Emilia.

18
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,875
Actually they said, "Lia."

19
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,666
- It was Puck.

- [grunts]

25
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,375
Everyone,
I've finished the last trial.

26
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,458
However, I think

27
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,541
it's too dangerous
to move at the moment,

28
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,583
so for now,
take refuge in the graveyard.

29
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,583
- You there.
- [grunts]

30

- [grunts] Right!

32
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,833
ELDER: And what is it
that you'll be doing?

33
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:27,666
- It seems...

34
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,500
I'm expected
to head in that direction.

35
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,500
Could you wait for me?

36
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,250
- [murmuring]

37
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:39,416
- We'll keep the vow we made
before you started the trial.

38
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,416
Stay safe, Miss Emilia,
and be careful.

00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,416
PUCK: You lost your temper
when she burned the book.

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,291
That's not like you.

44
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,708
But she was prepared
for what would happen,

45
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,333
'cause she's strong.

46
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:14,291
- Ram...

47
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,708
why did you...

<i>Master Roswaal, I love you.</i>

PUCK: You lost this time,
Roswaal,

51
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,416
and she got
just what she wanted.

52
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,333
She crossed that fine line.

53
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,166
Soon Lia will finish her trial,

54
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,375
and that book of yours is gone.

55
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,541
While your attachment to that
thing was pretty impressive,

56
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,458
you still--[gasps]

57
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,250
Snow?

58
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,000
No, it can't be.

59
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,000
[gasps]

60
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,625
You got me, didn't you?

61
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,750
You inscribed the spell
that calls the snow clouds

62
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,333
before the battle even began.

63
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,166
It'll fall,

64
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,458
then end up
the way Subaru was afraid of.

65
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,583
I'm gonna go
and try to delay that.

66
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,250
Roswaal, you really amaze me.

67
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,583
You're quite a magician.

68
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,708
As far as I know,

69
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,458
there's no human alive
as skilled at magic as you.

70
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,750
But no matter how far you go,
you're still a human.

71
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,333
You're never going to be
like<i> that</i> devil.

72
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,916
I made snow fall
as the Tome of Wisdom dictated.

73
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,958
What do I do now?

00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,500
Dear Ram.

That's it. Yes.

77
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,541
Teacher, talk to me.

78
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,625
Say something.

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,708
Please, tell me!

80
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,500
What should I do, Teacher?!
Answer me!

[shudders]

00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,583
Please, give me
your guidance again.

[wind howling]

- Mana's swirling around here.

86
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,041
Could this be what's
making all the snow fall?

87

[shards clattering]

88
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,458
Huh?

89
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,708
Puck is waiting. I have to go.

90
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,916
[gasps]

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,125
Miss Ryuzu?

92
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,791
- Miss Emilia. Why are you here?

93
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,791
- There are this many of you?

94
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:24,041
Making you all must have been
so rough on your poor mother.

95
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,916
- Explanations
regarding us clones can wait.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,208
Please, for now,
I just need you to stop me!

97
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:32,583
- Sorry, but I don't know
what you mean. [gasps]

98
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,750
You're Miss Shima, right?

99
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,625
- Miss Emilia,
the very fact that you are here

100
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,250
must mean
you have overcome the trial.

101
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,583
It seems
Young Gar's wager was correct.

102
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,583
- Is that Miss Ryuzu
inside the magic crystal?

103
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,416
Are you here to get her out?

104
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,583
Should we take her
to the graveyard together?

105
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,833
[breeze echoes]

106
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,083
- [Echidna's voice]
Unbelievable. You see this,

107
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,000
and that's the very first thing
you think of?

108
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,333
- [grunts] It's fine.

109
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,583
If we make a sled
and then put her on it,

110
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,625
I'm sure we can all manage
to pull her there.

111
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,958
- [normal voice] Your
kind gesture is appreciated,

112
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,541
But the reason I came here
is to fulfill my role

113
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,958
along with my ancestor,

114
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,625
who lies dormant
within this crystal.

115
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,333
- Fulfill your role?

116
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,500
- Indeed.
This crystal is the core

117
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,125
of the barrier
surrounding the Sanctuary.

118
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,291
Your recent activity
has undone its spell.

119
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,125
Once the core is gone,
the Sanctuary's role

120
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,875
will be completed,
and it will be liberated.

121
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,958
If it is gone, of course.

122
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,416
- U-Um, does that
have to happen right now?

123
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,791
I'm not sure if you've noticed,

124
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,541
but it's snowing
really hard outside,

125
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,666
so maybe you could just--

126
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,958
- In the event
that this facility is destroyed

127
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:51,625
and the one who runs it is lost,
the damage will be irreparable.

128
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,125
We are the key
to preventing that.

129
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,083
- [gasps]

130
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,958
- Miss Emilia, take this.

131
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,708
- [gasps]

132
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,625
Hold on. Is this Puck?

133
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,291
- The great spirit
visited here in advance

134
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,041
and managed to delay
the spell's activation.

135
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,500
His actions will save everyone,

136
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,125
though his strength
was exhausted.

137
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,166
- And he also made
that wall of ice

138
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,916
to protect everyone
in the Sanctuary from the snow,

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,083
then pushed himself to the brink
like this so I knew.

140
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,833
Oh, Puck, how many other
impossible things did you do?

141
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:37,000
- He lent us aid in many
forms,
all of which are appreciated.

142
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,041
Now that we have been given
this opportunity,

143
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:44,041
it is my responsibility
to fulfill our role.

144
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,708
RYUZU MEYER: Yes,
I understand that, but still--

145
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:51,166
- Our beloved grandson Garf has
been with me for ten years now.

146
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,000
At this very moment,
he is risking his life,

147
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,833
giving his all
to make it to the outside.

148
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:00,666
I will do everything
I can to try and help.

149
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,750
My sisters made from half of me,

150
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:06,958
I must ask you to please watch
and see where it takes him.

151
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,000
- [crying]

152
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,166
- Leave the rest to me.
I'll take care of it.

153
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,958
- [chuckles]

154
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,916
Seems you have grown
a shocking amount

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,833
in just half a day's time.

156
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,625
This is the one thing old folks
like me take sheer pleasure in.

157
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,000
[no audible dialogue]

158
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,000
[energy surges]

[Ryuzu Meyer crying]

160
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,000
EMILIA: Let's go, Ryuzu.

161
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,916
- Hmm?
- Dry your tears.

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,916

<i>- Suddenly, without hesitation,</i>

321
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,000

322
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,000
- What's up?
-<i> For whatever reason,</i>

<i>to the forbidden library.</i>

<i>that the faint hope I had</i>

330
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,333

<i>began to consume me,</i>

331
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:23,166
<i>so I sent him to the Sanctuary</i>
<i>according to Roswaal's plans.</i>

332
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,708
<i>Then Roswaal himself</i>
<i>departed for the Sanctuary,</i>

335
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,208

And now you--

How impudent you are, I suppose.

You're so childish! If

I am shutting you out for--

Because if you were
serious,

you're not "that person"!

That's what you said, so don't

You thought I'd lost my mind

didn't you?!

Well, maybe you're right.

392
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,375
I am a fool
who can't bring herself

to ignore
a 400-year-old promise.

So just forget it!

I'm not whoever
"that person" is,

Is she telling me
to leave here for good?

418
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,541
If every door
in this entire place burns down,

419
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,583
does that mean
her forbidden library will be...

420
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,291
-<i> Goodbye, and farewell.</i>

421
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,625
- "Goodbye, and farewell,"
my ass!

You think I'm just gonna give
up

There aren't
any other ones left.

This is the last of them.

that's the first thing you say?

We find ourselves
in a stalemate now.

I couldn't ask
for much more at this point.

447
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,583
The promise made with Mother's
been fully realized, I suppose.

448

- If that's true...

449
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,916
then I want you
to hear me out until the end.

- You have to help me.

451

Beatrice, please save me.

- Wait. What?

453
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,458
- I thought about all sorts
of cool things to say to you,

454
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,833
like how I was gonna stop you
from ever feeling lonely
again,

455
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:46,708
but honestly each one

456
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,125
just sounded more contrived
than the next.

[energy crackling]

458
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,000
You don't need me
to try and rescue you.

459
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:56,500
In fact, I'm pretty sure
you don't need my help at all.

460
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,375
You're strong, smart,
resilient, cute.

461
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,625
As far as I'm concerned,
that makes you

462
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,333
more than well-equipped
to survive on your own,

463
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,125
which means saying
I'd save you or help you out

464
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,625
wasn't enough,
not by a long shot.

465
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:13,708
Even so, with every one of those
amazing qualities you have,

466
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,833
you were afraid
to go on living alone.

467
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,916
You were hurting and sad,
weren't you?

468
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,875
So I completely understand.

469
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:22,750
No one could blame you

470
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,750
for clinging to the idea
of "that person."

471
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,791
- I-Is that so?

472
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,041
And now you think you
can
just reject how I'm
feeling?

473
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,625
What do you know about me?!

474
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,000

475
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,833

Even if I decided

you'll just die soon anyway.

Choose me, Beatrice.

might not happen, live with me

through a guaranteed lifetime
of tomorrows.

You'll never be bored.

I'm pretty weak,
which means I can be a handful.

And as caring as I know you are,

you'll stay busy
looking after me.

I'll keep you so occupied,

you won't ever have time to
think about being sad or lonely.

I beg you.

- But at some point,
you'll go away forever.

- That's just the way it is.

540
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:14,041
The future you're so afraid of
is gonna come sooner or later.

Even so...

542
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,291
- But you'll die
and leave me behind.

543
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,333
- Even so, let's be together!

544

We'll do things side by
side
and live with one
another!

Let's try and make
enough
memories to last a
lifetime,

546
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,458
one where you can finally say
you've had fun!

547
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:31,875
Take back those empty 400 years
you've had with interest,

00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,083
'cause you
definitely deserve it.

knowing that you'll die,

that I'll be alone!

552
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,500
- That's true.

553
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,666
And for somebody like you
who'll live for ages,

554
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,750
your time with me
might feel like an instant,

so I'll engrave each one
of our memories into your soul!

I swear it'll be worth it.

Someday, you'll look back
