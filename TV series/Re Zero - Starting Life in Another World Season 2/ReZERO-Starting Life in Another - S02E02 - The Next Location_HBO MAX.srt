1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,708
- Let me make it clear that
you're welcome to stay here.

2
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,291
I would gladly host
the both of you

3
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,625
for as long as you like,
whenever you like.

4
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:14,458
- We really appreciate that,

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,625
but for now,
it's important for us

6
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,166
to get the villagers back home.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,500
- Once they've all settled in

8
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,166
and we talk
to Emilia's sponsor, Roswaal,

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,500
then we'll come back and
take you up on that offer.

10
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,250
- All right, very well.

11
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,541
When you do, I hope you'll
give me the opportunity

12
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,250
to repay my great debt to you.

13
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,958
- It's really
not that big of a deal.

14
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:31,833
'cause you helped us out,
too, you know.

15
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:35,208
And besides,
we already got a reward.

16
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,416
[chuckles] Right, Patrasche?

17
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,333
- [coos]

18
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,250
- [yelps]
- Are you all right, Subaru?

19
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,791
- Man, those scales
are rougher than I expected!

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,583
Now I know
how a piece of cheese feels

21
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,333
when it's being grated.

22
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,416
[both laugh]

23
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
- Okay...

24
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,291
I've got Rem tucked in
and secure for the trip!

25
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,458
Just keep her still, all right?

26
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,833
- Uh, sure.

27
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,333
- And let me remind you
that you'll need your rest

28
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,291
when you get back
to the mansion, too.

29
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,625
- You mean me?

30
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,583
- Ever since you went
head-to-head against Sloth,

31
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,791
that gate of yours
has been working overtime.

32
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,333
I did clean up
all the toxins in your gate,

33
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:10,083
but you need to let it rest
for at least a couple of months.

34
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,666
- Two months downtime.

35
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,666
Well, surely
all this crazy stuff

36
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,625
can't keep happening
for that long.

37
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,791
Wait! I didn't
just jinx myself, did I?!

38
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:21,458
- Okay, I guess it's about time
for you to get going now.

39
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,833
Oh, yeah! Miss Crusch,

40
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,166
think you wanted to give 'em
a few parting words, didn't
you?

41
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,541
- Well, Miss Emilia, I want
to wish you a safe journey.

42
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,000
Stay in good health,

43
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,958
and I look forward
to seeing you again soon.

44
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,250
- [sighs]

45
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,833
You, too, Miss Crusch.
Take good care of yourself.

46
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,500
And next time, I won't be

47
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,500
the one who constantly
needs saving.

48
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,458
I'll be someone who can
step up and help others.

49
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,166
- [chuckles]

50
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,541
Mr. Subaru Natsuki,
I wish you a safe journey

51
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,500
and all the best
in the future as well.

52
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,333
- Uh...

53
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,625
[sighs]

54
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,416
- [trills]

55
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,791
- Until we meet again,
take care of yourselves

56
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,333
[wagons rattling]

57
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:25,375
- Guess we're on our way.

58
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,125
- [gasps]

59
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,000
You know, Subaru,
you always seem to sit beside me

60
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,000
as if it's the obvious choice.

61
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,833
- Oh, is there
something wrong with that?

62
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:38,416
- Mm-mmm. It did seem
a little odd at first,

63
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,208
but I must admit
it feels strange

64
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,833
if you don't now, so it's fine.

65
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,500
- [gasps] All of
my painstaking efforts

66
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,666
have finally been rewarded!

67
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,333
This is just the best!

68
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,333
- Now you're
just teasing me again.

69
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,583
I know you're
still worried about Rem.

70
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,833
There's no need for you
to hide that from me.

71
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,250
- Uh...

72
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,916
- She's important to you,
isn't she?

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,583
- She is! You have no idea!

74
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,458
She's just as important
to me as you are!

75
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,250
- I'm not sure if you're
aware of this, but...

76
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,708
you're being very selfish.

77
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,583
- You're right.

78
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,958
Frankly, I feel so scummy,
I wish I could die,

79
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,750
but even so,
it's the absolute truth.

80
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,708
- Subaru, I...

81
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,666
- Hey, did you just say my name?

82
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,250
- Uh...
- Huh?

83
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,583
- I know I didn't.

84
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,541
Hold on. Have you
been there all this time?

85
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,708
- Do you think this thing
just drives itself?

86
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,708
Of course I've been here!
Why do you think

87
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,708
I decided to work with you
in the first place?!

88
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,500
- I'm only kidding! You're here,

89
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,791
because you want to negotiate
with Roswaal in person.

90
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,458
I haven't forgotten that.

91
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,458
- Come on. Stop joking around.
I'm begging you!

92
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,375
My whole life
is riding on this, okay?!

93
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,333
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.
I got it.

94
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,166
We're gonna say goodbye
to you for now,

95
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,666
- though, all right?
- What? Hey, wai--

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
[both laugh]

97
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,291
- I'm certain
you'll get her back

98
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,541
and you'll find some way
to help her.

99
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,625
- [gasps]

100
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,916
You really think so?

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,083
- I also believe that you and I

102
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,791
have something
of a selfish trait in common.

103
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,791
We both base each of our actions
on our own desires.

104
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,625
I realize I'm participating
in the royal selection

105
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,291
for selfish reasons, too.

106
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,833
- What do you mean by that?

107
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,833
- I'm sorry. Guess I'm not doing

108
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,083
a very good job
of explaining it.

109
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,458
It's not like I want
to hide anything from you,

110
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,666
but I'm just not sure
how to put it into words.

111
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,041
- Uh...

112
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,791
[sighs]

113
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,625
Don't worry about it.

114
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,833
We can talk everything out
after we join up with Roswaal.

115
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,166
- [gasps] Huh?

116
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,000
- And besides,
he might even know something

117
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,125
about what happened to Rem!

118
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,083
- [grunts]

119
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,500
OTTO: Okay, you two!

120
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,458
We'll be reaching
our destination in no time!

121
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,291
[overlapping chatter]

122
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,375
[Petra sighs]

123
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,000
So where is everybody?

124
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,500
- [panting]

125
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,833
This whole place is deserted.

126
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,625
- What?
- [gasping]

127
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,541
- Ram and the others haven't
returned from the Sanctuary?

128
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,375
- Doesn't look like it, huh?
By the way, Mili,

129
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,875
do you know happen to know
where the Sanctuary is?

130
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,291
- Huh? Hold on.
I thought you knew where it was.

131
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,583
- Huh?
- [both stammer]

132
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,458
- I know it might seem
a little late to be asking this,

133
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,541
but what kind of place are
we talking about, anyway?

134
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,916
- Actually, I'm not sure.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,541
Roswaal just said it was sort
of
like a secret base and that...

136
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,833
- That what?
- Uh...

137
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,041
oh, it's nothing.

138
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,000
Really sorry. I guess I should
have asked for more details.

139
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,041
- No, no! Even if we
were
in a hurry to get to
safety,

140
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,833
I'm the one who was being
way too careless here!

141
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:39,083
- Uh...
- [all groan]

142
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,750
- We'll just have to head
to the mansion for right now.

143
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,583
Maybe we can even find
some clues there.

144
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,875
Hey, Otto!
You should come with us!

145
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,125
- What?! Over to the mansion?

146
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,916
SUBARU: We've come this far.
Don't be scared.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,041
Take the carriage
and ground dragons

148
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:52,791
around back, okay?

149
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,375
OTTO: A-All right.

150
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,500
SUBARU: We're here, Rem.
We're back.

151
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,416
- Are you okay?

152
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,416
- Yeah.

153
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,750
Come to think of it,

154
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,416
I don't remember
locking the door when we left.

155
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,583
Think we got robbed?

156
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,083
- Beatrice stayed here,

157
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,708
so there's really
no need to worry.

158
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,625
Maybe she'll even answer
the door for us if we
knock.

159
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,625
- [chuckles] She might come
flying right through it,

160
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,750
looking for Puck.

161
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,750
- You could be right.

162
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,625
How are you, Puck?

163
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,666
You awake?

164
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,083
Huh. I guess not.

165
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,041
He's not responding.

166
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,250
- Hope someone here does.

167
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:35,875
[woman] Yes? One moment, please.

168
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,416
- Huh?
- Huh?

169
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,666
- Welcome home, Miss Emilia.

170
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,541
I've been anxiously awaiting
your inevitable return.

171
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,083
- Wait. Frederica?

172
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,916
- [chuckles]

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes, it is I, Frederica, ready--

174
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,541
- Look at those chompers!

175
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,041
- Allow me to introduce myself.

176
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,916
My name is Frederica Baumann.

177
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,250
I worked here previously
and have returned.

178
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,625
- Uh, now that you mention it,
I was told

179
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,625
there was another maid who quit
just before I came here.

180
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,041
- Yes, I merely took
a temporary leave of absence

181
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,041
for some personal reasons.

182
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,166
At Ram's request,
I ended my respite

183
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,500
and returned to my post,
only to find the mansion empty.

184
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,333
Fortunately, a letter I found
in the master's office

185
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,708
gave me a good idea
as to what happened.

186
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,833
- A letter?

187
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,041
- So what made Ram
ask you to come back?

188
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,083
- Upon my return to this place,
I found the kitchen

189
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,833
and the trees in the garden
in quite a desolate state.

190
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,875
It was rather awful.

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,875
- That's a pretty
serious reason!

192
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,041
- Hmph!
- It is sort of strange, though.

193
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,500
Ram always worked
exceptionally hard for us

194
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,500
during the time
that you were away,

195
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,791
so why,
in just the past few days--

196
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,208
[gasps]

197
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,625
SUBARU: With Rem gone,

198
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,541
Ram couldn't handle
the mansion alone,

199
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,541
so she asked Frederica
to help? Huh.

200
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,291
- Would you mind explaining

201
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,500
who this girl
who looks so much like Ram is?

202
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,791
The resemblance is striking.

203
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,416
- That's her younger sister,
named Rem,

204
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
and she's a really nice girl.

205
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,875
She's so strong and kind
and a super-hard worker.

206
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,416
Even a stranger could tell

207
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,791
that she and Ram
were extremely close.

208
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,166
And I'm sure you were
a good friend to her, too.

209
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,750
- [sighs]

210
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,166
- Though you probably
don't remember at all, huh?

211
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,708
- Unfortunately, no.

212
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,916
I wonder how the master
and Ram will react

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
when they return
and discover our guest.

214
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,916
- There's no telling
what Roswaal will do.

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,083
I don't even want to try
to imagine how Ram will react.

216
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,583
- Oh, that reminds me.

217
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,541
Have you heard anything
from Roswaal, by the way?

218
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,083
Sadly, in these situations,
I have no way

219
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,291
of truly knowing what goes on
in the master's mind.

220
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,750
To the best of my knowledge,

221
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,958
there are only two people
in this world

222
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,041
he trusts enough to
share
those intimate details
with.

223
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,916
- And they are?

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,250
- Ram and the great spirit

225
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,583
of this mansion's
forbidden library.

226
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,583
- Great spirit
of the forbidden library?

227
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,916
- I'm referring to Beatrice.

228
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:04,958
- Hmm?

229
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,750
[grunts]

230
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,000
Hey, Beako! Long time no see!

231
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,500
- Oh, it's you.

232
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,333
No wonder the mansion
suddenly seemed so noisy.

233
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,625
SUBARU: Everyone's been worried
about you, you know.

234
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,791
Even if it's not right now,
you should apologize.

235
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,333
- Is that so? Why, exactly?

236
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,000
I fail to comprehend
why I must apologize

237
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,333
and to whom, I suppose.

238
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,000
- Well, if you'd prefer,
I could always do it for you.

239
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,541
I'll tell them
you were thanking me

240
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,666
with tears and snot
streaming down your face.

241
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,958
- Don't make up
such ridiculous stories!

242
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,166
I haven't shed tears
in a very long time, I suppose.

243
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,333
- I mean, It never hurts

244
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,375
to have a good wail
every once in a while.

245
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,666
- Those words carry
an extra level

246
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,208
of deep meaning
coming from you,

247
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,375
a man who bawled in the lap
of the woman he loves.

248
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,958
- Oh, would you
please just forget

249
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,625
about that incident, already?

250
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,875
- Could you please get
to the point, I suppose?

251
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,000
Pathetic weakling.

252
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,041
- Oh, yeah. [sighs]

253
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,666
I'm curious.

254
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,916
Exactly how well do you
know
what Roswaal is thinking?

255
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,291
- Hmm?

256
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,333
- See, I heard from somebody

257
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,416
that you can read him
pretty well.

258
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,958
- So is it true or not?
- Who said--

259
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,125
Aha. It must have been
that half-beast girl

260
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,500
who just came back to work.

261
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,000
I admit there may be
a bit of accuracy

262
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,041
to what she told you, I suppose.

263
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,750
However, my connection
with Roswaal has nothing to do

264
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,708
with the current circumstances,
understand?

265
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,375
- But you stayed here
at the mansion

266
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,000
all by yourself, right?

267
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,000
And without a single
countermeasure in place.

268
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,416
- I'm more than capable
of protecting myself,

269
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,833
thank you, which is the reason
I stayed, I suppose,

270
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,333
and Roswaal doesn't have
anything to do with that.

271
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,375
Although, guess I
couldn't honestly say

272
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,916
that he had nothing
on his mind at all, I suppose.

273
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,208
- Huh.

274
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,083
So were you and I
and everybody else

275
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,875
just giving him
the benefit of the doubt

276
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,875
about this
Witch's Cult situation,

277
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,750
thinking that he wouldn't
go up against them

278
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,208
without some kind of plan?

279
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,416
Oh, that's right.

280
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,000
- Look at this.
- Huh? [gasps]

281
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,166
A Gospel.

282
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,875
Now why do you, of all people,
possess one of those?!

283
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,250
- Just consider it
the spoils of battle.

284
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,000
It used to belong
to the guy in charge

285
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,250
of the witch cultists
who surrounded the mansion.

286
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,750
- I see. What became of him?

287
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,083
- He's dead now.

288
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,125
I was the one who killed him.

289
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,083
- Then it seems that you've
left me behind, too, I
suppose,

290
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,958
Betelgeuse.

291
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:30,583
- Eh, wait.

292
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,125
What'd you say?

293
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,791
- [sighs] None of your concern.

294
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,833
All right,
back to the matter at hand.

295
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,416
If you managed to destroy Sloth,
a Sin Archbishop,

296
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,125
then what happened
to his Witch Factor, I suppose?

297
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,083
- His what? Witch Factor?

298
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,833
- You seriously have
no idea what it is?

299
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,041
Well, if that's the case,
then why'd you even bother

300
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,041
to kill Sloth
in the first place?

301
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,291
And what exactly
is Roswaal doing--

302
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,125
- We went over this already,
remember?

303
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,500
Roswaal is at the Sanctuary,
and I'm the one

304
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,541
who wants to figure out
what he's thinking!

305
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,041
- The answers you seek
lie in the Sanctuary.

306
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,125
You'll find what you
want to know, I suppose

307
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,916
- [gasps] Seriously?

308
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,041
- His true intentions,
the meaning of the Gospel,

309
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:15,041
answers about the Witch Factor,
everything, they're all there.

310
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,041
If you want them,
then that's the place.

311
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,833
The half-beast girl
you met earlier

312
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:20,958
can lead you down there,
I suppose.

313
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,375
- Now hang on a second!
What's up with you?

314
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,833
Why are you so willing
to talk to me all of a sudden?

315
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,166
Also, why do I have to go
to the Sanctuary when you--

316
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,083
- I am not telling you.

317
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,875
I have the right to refuse
acknowledging your questions.

318
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,125
- [gasps]

319
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,500
- You've been told
how to find your answers.

320
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,541
Don't expect me to indulge you
any further, I suppose!

321
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,375
- Beako! Beatrice, please!
- Now begone.

322
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,166
I'm not a tool to be used
for your convenience!

323
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,500
- [yells]
- [humming a tune]

324
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,791
[both yell]

325
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,041
- [groans] Wh-What in the world
are you doing?!

326
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,458
Why did you fly into me just
as I was leaving the
bathroom?!

327
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,166
- Why did you have that look
on your face?

328
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,125
It seemed like you were
just about to cry again.

329
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,958
- Uh, do you think you
could get off of me now?

330
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,041
- So you really are allowed

331
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,000
to enter Miss Beatrice's
forbidden library.

332
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,500
- What do you mean by that?
You thought I wouldn't be?

333
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,625
- Well, Miss Emilia told me

334
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,833
what a reliable and
dependable person you are,

335
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,541
and she was quite thorough
in explaining

336
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,583
- exactly why she felt this way.
- Huh?

337
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,000
- So I must admit I was hoping
you'd live up to the hype.

338
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,375
- Huh?
- Hey, Frederica!

339
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,416
- Hold on!
What was it that you told her?!

340
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,416
- Wait. Listen!
It's not like that!

341
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,625
I did tell her about you,
yes, but she's
exaggerating.

342
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,208
- Oh, yeah? I happened to hear
what you said also.

343
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,583
It made me think there must be

344
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,291
more to Mr. Natsuki
than meets the eye.

345
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,041
- Not you, too, Otto!
- Aw, man! This sucks!

346
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,333
Why wasn't I around to hear
what you said about me?!

347
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,291
- I could never say it
in front of you, anyway.

348
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,458
All right, Frederica,
back
to what you were telling
us.

349
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,375
- [chuckles]
I do apologize, Miss. Of course.

350
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,291
I believe we need
to talk this over

351
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,083
so you don't find yourself
at a dead end.

352
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,541
- Uh, what do you
mean by that?

353
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,583
- Even if you were able
to see Beatrice,

354
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,291
whether she'd answer
your question or not

355
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,833
is quite another matter.

356
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,250
After all, the one thing

357
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,708
that both of you have in common
is your stubbornness.

358
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,125
- That description
is way too cute,

359
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,541
but yeah, you're right.
And what else?

360
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,375
- Well, there's a lot I want
to talk to Roswaal about also,

361
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,666
which is why I asked
Frederica to help us

362
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,458
by telling me
where the Sanctuary is.

363
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,750
<i>- The half-beast girl</i>
<i>you met earlier</i>

364
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,416
<i>can lead you down there,</i>
<i>I suppose.</i>

365
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,666
- So you're gonna tell
us
where to find it,
Frederica?

366
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,625
- Well, I was no match
for Miss Emilia's persistence,

367
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,000
even though I have been told

368
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,166
not to disclose
any more than is necessary.

369
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,458
But I'd like to ask

370
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,333
for a little time
to prepare for everything.

371
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,291
I think two days should do it.

372
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,541
- To prepare, huh?
Oh, yeah, that's right.

373
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,250
We'd all be leaving the mansion.
That makes sense.

374
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,791
- Oh, no, I'll be staying
right here on the premises,

375
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,333
so I won't be able
to accompany you.

376
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,291
- Wait a minute!
You're not gonna go with us?

377
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,250
Then how exactly are we
supposed to get there?

378
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,583
- [laughs]
- Huh?

379
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,250
- Guess you're pretty slow
on the uptake, aren't you?

380
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,375
- Uh...

381
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,916
Oh! I get it now!

382
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,750
So Otto's gonna get us
to the Sanctuary!

383
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,625
Because he thinks
that cooperating with Emilia

384
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,083
in any way possible
will give Roswaal,

385
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,958
- her backer, an overall...
- Hey, hold on a second!

386
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,041
- better impression of him.
- That's--

387
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,375
- Wait. Otto, is that right?

388
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,125
- Ugh! The purity
in Miss Emilia's innocent eyes

389
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,375
is killing me! Yes! I'm sorry!
That's exactly right!

390
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,250
- The way you wear
your ulterior motives

391
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,541
on your sleeve makes you
all the more likeable.

392
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,083
- Yeah, that's not
really comforting,

393
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:21,791
coming from somebody like you!

394
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,333
- I appreciate your help.

395
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,750
On that note, feel free

396
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,583
to tell the three of us
about the Sanctuary.

397
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,083
- Very well. As you wish.

398
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,500
What I'm about to tell you now

399
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,083
is the undisclosed location

400
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,208
of the Sanctuary of Clemaldy,

401
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,250
how to get to it,
and how to enter it.

402
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,541
Equally as important
is the name

403
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,708
of somebody you must not forget
as you travel there.

404
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,666
Beware of one
you will likely encounter

405
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,041
by the name of Garfiel.

406
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:50,458
Remember that name, while
at the Sanctuary
especially,

407
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,750
because he'll be the one

408
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,458
with whom you must exercise
the most care.

409
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,208
[birds chirping]

410
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,000
- Hey, Rem.

411
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,000
We're gonna be leaving now.

412
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:04,875
I told Frederica that she needs

413
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,708
to take extra special care
of you.

414
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,666
Wait right here for me, okay?

415
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,125
Hmm?

416
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,708
- You all set to go?

417
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,250
- Sure am, new recruit.

418
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,416
I see you're rockin'
that uniform already.

419
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,041
- You think so? [giggles]

420
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,750
What were you doing,
saying goodbye to Miss Rem?

421
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,541
- Yeah, something like that.

422
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,833
We're not planning on
stayin' out there very long,

423
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,791
but I wanted to see her
before I left.

424
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,708
Do me a huge favor,
and make sure that Rem

425
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,458
is well-taken care of
while I'm away, all right?

426
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,291
- Understood!
You can count on me!

427
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,250
- The ad about needing
a new maid

428
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,708
only went up two days ago,

429
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,250
and this is your first day
actually being in the mansion.

430
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,875
I'm pretty impressed you
found it without getting lost.

431
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,375
And I really admire
your decision

432
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,041
to leave your parents and home
at such a young age, too.

433
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,333
- I'm 12 years old!

434
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,541
I'm old enough
to be a working grown-up now!

435
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,291
Wait. I meant a working adult!

436
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,875
And I would appreciate it

437
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:05,916
if you'd treat me
more like an adult, too!

438
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,416
- Get better
at speaking politely,

439
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,583
and get Frederica
to fully initiate you,

440
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,375
and then I'll think about it.

441
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,708
- Hmm. I mean, yes, sir! I will!

442
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,500
- [chuckles]

443
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,166
- [gasps]
- Huh?

444
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,083
- I forgot
what a pain she can be

445
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,208
when she gets serious
about hiding.

446
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,875
- Is there really
a mysterious room in here?

447
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,791
- Yeah, it's Beatrice's.

448
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,625
I think you know her,
too, don't you?

449
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,958
So be sure to take care
of her also,

450
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,208
because you might randomly
bump into her

451
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,291
when you're opening a door
somewhere inside the mansion.

452
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,291
- Now hold on, Mr. Subaru.

453
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,791
Aren't you asking
a bit much of me?

454
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,958
- Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.

455
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,875
But you're the only one
I can ask.

456
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,416
I hope you forgive me
for this.

457
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,875
- [giggling]

458
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,583
Oh, all right. If you insist.

459
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,916
I'll just have to find the time
to help you out, then.

460
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,958
- Thanks.
You're a big help, Petra.

461
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:58,125
EMILIA: Look after
the mansion for us.

462
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,125
Rem, Petra, and Beatrice,
too, all right?

463
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,750
- Yes, you can rely on me.
Please take care,

464
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,208
and be safe during your travels,
Miss Emilia.

465
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,916
And bring this with you.

466
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,500
It'll allow you to get past
the magical barrier

467
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,250
in the forest
and enter the Sanctuary.

468
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,500
From that point,

to the location I
described.

470
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,541

to get through the barrier

471
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,500

the resolve and will.

that I mentioned earlier.

for Garfiel. I promise you.

- Hmm?

who later returns it
stained

journey

484
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,291
is an old custom.

485
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,208
It's thought to be
a sort of prayer

486
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,791
for safe travels
while he's away.

of those things, huh?

This sudden rebellious phase
is kinda making me sad.

494

hurry up and get going,

495

499
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,250
You'd better protect that lady!
You hear me?!

500
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,333
- Master, I did it exactly
as you instructed me to.

501
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,958
So now everything depends
on Miss Emilia

502
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,583
and how she handles
the Sanctuary.

There's nothing we can do,

Puck isn't showing up?

I've called out to him
several times,

507

and I can feel the link
from our contract, but...

ever happened before?

509

- Yes, but not very often.

There have been
a couple of times in the past

I have contracts
with lesser spirits, too,

518
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,083
and I can also fight with them
if the need arises,

so no matter what happens,
I can protect you!

Frederica did warn us.
You remember?

523
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,291
She told us that something
might happen.

524

- Yes, to beware
of Garfiel, right?

525
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,750

mentioned a few times

526
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,458
that he was gonna see him,
which seems kind of weird to me.
