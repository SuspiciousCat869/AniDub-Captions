You're Otto's helper?

Try "attendant."

the assistance of Otto

00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,500
to try and meet that end
was my own decision.

you're planning to do?

31
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,166

trying to do three days ago

I won't let you hide anything

Well, after ordering her

the Sanctuary is a given.

If I have the answer,
I won't even hesitate.

52

this is something only you
would be able to tell me.

54
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,208
So my question is,
is Beatrice...

00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,041
a member of the Witch's Cult?

56
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,000
- Now, now.
What makes you suspect

57
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,458
she would be involved
in such a thing?

58
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,375
- I saw her in the library,

59
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,250
and she was holding a Gospel.

and she is a witch cultist...

62
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,375
then that would make her
an enemy to us all.

63
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,958
Or at least to me.

64

true resolve to say.

However...

67
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,541
even if you speak them
with that pained expression,

68
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,500
they're not very convincing.

is a truly awful one.

Thus, I feel I should
offer you a helping hand.

73

That sounds like

74
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,625
one of the shadiest things
I've ever heard.

75
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,625
- Something that resembles
a Gospel rather closely

76
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,458
is indeed in her possession,

77
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,500
so I can see how you thought
it might be one.

78
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:31,250
But you have my word
that she is not a witch cultist.

79
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,583
- [gasps] Are you sure?

80
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:36,750
- While her book isn't a Gospel,
it is somewhat unique.

81
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,208
That magical text
tells the true future,

82
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,875
and only two copies exist
in the whole world.

In fact, it's the closest thing
there is to the Tome of Wisdom.

- So what you're
saying is that--

Now hold on a second!

86
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,166
She definitely told me
that book was a Gospel!

it lacks an official name,

then it's all right.

But now what I want to know

95
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:14,250
is how am I ever gonna
convince her to help me.

Tell her, "Roswaal said

instruction to Beatrice,

99
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,625
she should respond.

100
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,125

what you're talking about.

tell her this,

109
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:43,250
"I am that person,"
and that should do the trick.

110
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,125
- What's that supposed to mean?

111
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,916
Get Beatrice
to ask the question.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,458
Then answer it affirmatively.

113

If you do that, she will,

without a doubt,
stand by your side as an ally.

But how can you be so sure
that'll actually work?

in the contract

that she holds so dearly
and is powerless to override.

- And you're certain about this?

119
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,333
All right,
but if this doesn't work,

you're getting

might draw attention,

so you and I will need
to ride out of here together.

141
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,750
Is that all right?

142

Wait. Hang on a second!

Once we're out of the Sanctuary,

146
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,375
our first stop is the mansion,

Master Roswaal gave me

only amount to half a man,

164
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,500
you each take up
a whole man's space.

165

I don't think we'll all
fit on a single dragon.

it's no wonder
you didn't understand him.

204
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,250
- "Hoshin was Banan's sunset"
is a saying

205
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,791
based on the tale of how
the legendary trader, Hoshin,

206
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,583
brought the small nation
of Banan to ruin.

207
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,458
It gives your rival two options,

00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,416
surrender or face
an all-out attack!

better off not knowing that.

that you didn't
comprehend what I said?

but I am getting

to leave, do you?

keepin' me around is bad news.

Because to my dear master,

if Roswaal was upset?!

How much do you think
he cares about this place

or about the old hag
or anybody else, huh?!

He doesn't give a damn,
not even about you, Ram!

I have to get them back,

It's quite rare for someone

354
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,416
to attend one of my tea parties
a second time.

355

You should be proud.

- [gasps]

00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,333
This is creepy.

359
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,125
What is happening to me?

360
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,833
- It's due to the tea
you drank last time.

361
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,166
The contents therein
had a direct impact

362
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,416
on your Sloth Witch Factor,
encouraging stability.

363
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,333
If not for that,
your soul itself

364
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,791
would have crumbled to pieces.

365
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:10,250
Now I'm all ears and ready to
accept your words of
gratitude.

366
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,041
- Then can I assume
that this will keep on working,

367
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,291
even after I'm back outside?

368
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:18,208
- Well, we are talking
about your mental state, right?

369
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,208
As long as you remember
what happened here,

370
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,000
you should be absolutely fine.

371
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,041
Still waiting for a "thank you."

372
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,416
- Tell me...

373
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,166
is there any way that you know
of to try and overwrite the
vow?

374
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,208
- Hmm?
- You know, the one

375
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,583
that makes me
forget all about you

376
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,541
the minute I step outside.

377
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,875
Because as long as it stands,

378
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,375
my soul's still likely
to fall apart.

379
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,666
- I suppose that's true, but I--

380
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,250
- On top of that, my soul
isn't the only problem
here.

381
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,500
I still want to be able
to remember you, regardless.

382
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,208
- Huh?
- [slams table]

383
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,583
- And if that comes
at a price, fine.

384
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,291
I'll pay whatever you want.

385
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,250
- [gasps]
- In return,

386
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,125
I want assurance you won't
hide yourself in my memories.

387
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,416
- Uh, sure.

388
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,083
- Huh?

389
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,375
Really?! Thanks a lot!

390
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,416
And no changing your mind,
all right?!

391
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,083
- No, of course not. I wouldn't
ever do something so shameless,

392
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,583
though I will say

393
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,500
I think it's a bit unfair
to even presume that.

394

- [sighs]

395
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,041
Hmm.

00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,208
- Gulping down
my body fluids again, are you?

397
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
[gags] I forgot!

398
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,750
- I'll ask you once more.
Where's the gratitude?

399
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,083
- [coughing]
- I'm waiting patiently,

400
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:26,875
but I don't think
I've heard it yet.

401
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,250
- Whatever! Thanks for making me

402
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,625
this nasty bodily-fluids tea,
you witch!

403
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,666
- I'm afraid that only wounded
my maidenly heart.

404
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,250
- [grumbles]

[gasps]

407
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,791
- Anything else?

408
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,583
Something on your mind?

409
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,541
- Quit playin' around.

410
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,666
Exactly how much have you
found out about me, anyway?

411
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,208
- If that's your query,
I know only what I know.

412
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,166
If you're asking
what I want to know,

413
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,541
the answer is
everything in this world.

414
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,458
- There's no way
you aren't feeling strange

415
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,916
about all of this.

416
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,541
I have to assume, for you,
this is happening

417
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,666
right after your last tea party
with me, isn't it?

418
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,541
So if you don't think
this is strange, then...

419
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,250
that means...

420
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,333
- That means what?

421
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,083
- It means
you're not thrown by any this,

422
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,208
because you know
how it happened.

[sighs] You might
not even have enough time

426
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,333
to regret saying those words.

427
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,416
- If that proves to be true,
can I expect you to break down

428
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,750
physically and emotionally
and cry over my corpse?

it feels a bit embarrassing

I go back in time
and restart the world,

441
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,375
and it's happened a lot.

442
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,541
I call it "Return by Death."

And before I heard you,
I saw you.

Return by Death.
Return by Death.

but there's no need to--

I've been Returning by Death!

I've died and started again

I know every single step
you've taken on your path here.

I was watching you.

But watching is all I was doing.

So if you don't mind,

I'd like you
to tell me yourself

what you've been thinking

how much weight
you've carried, too.
