It's the very reason I want
you

164
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,583
[wind blowing]

165
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,583
[shudders]

166
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,041
Is there any--

167
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,791
any worth to my life at all?

168
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,875
What can I do now,
other than die and come back?

169
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,916
Can--Can I really believe...

170
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,958
that the people I care about...

171
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,916
also...

172
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,500
care for me?

173
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,958
SATELLA: I'll allow it.

174
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,208
- [gasps]

175
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,083
- You are the one
who rescued me,

176
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,250
so it would seem only fair

177
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,208
to grant you
the same opportunity.

178
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,041
I want you to know salvation.

179
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,666
Yes. That is my wish.

180
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,708
- [shudders]

181
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,125
[crying]

182
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,083
- Well, Minerva aside,

183
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,208
I have to admit I'm
actually a bit more surprised

184
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,916
by the way you two acted.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,208
- [sighs] Just stay
out of this, Daph!

186
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,833
- [sighs]
- When I last spoke to him,

187
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,625
Subarun made
some pretty big boasts to me.

188
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,958
It might be selfish,
but I'd love to see him

189
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,541
at least try
to follow through on them.

190
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,750
- Quite an intriguing thought,
indeed.

191
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,375
And, Carmilla,
I'm fairly certain

192
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,916
that it was you
who called him back

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,333
from the brink of death itself,
now, wasn't it?

194
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,458
You even implemented
Faceless Bride

195
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,750
to ensure that,
but whatever for?

196
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,708
- No reason.

197
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,625
I just think that...

198
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,083
l-love is important.

199
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,666
Even if he doesn't
want to see it...

200
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,958
th-there is love there.
I know it.

201
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,458
And, uh, to me...

202
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,166
it shouldn't be taken
and not returned.

203
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,166
Sekhmet and Typhon
stepped forward

204
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,875
to make sure
his wishes were respected,

205
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,291
Minerva healed him,

206
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,583
Daphne prolonged his life,

207
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,333
and Carmilla used her Authority

208
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,875
to make him aware
of the love he couldn't see.

209
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,291
So while each of you may have
your own reasons for doing so,

210
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,625
it's quite clear that you all
wish to help Subaru Natsuki.

211
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,625
[laughs]

212
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,125
Absolutely fascinating.

213
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,833
Wouldn't you say?

214
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,791
SUBARU: Seriously...

215
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,041
what's the deal
with all of you?

216
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,833
'Cause I can't
understand or agree

217
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,375
with almost any
of your reasons for backing me.

218
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,083
It's no wonder
they call you witches.

219
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,166
- Since you've gone back
to vilifying us,

220
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,000
is it safe to assume
you've recovered your strength?

221
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,125
- I don't know
how to answer that now.

222
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,916
I'm at a loss.

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,416
- If that's truly the way
you're feeling at the moment,

224
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
then I'd like to inquire
about something.

225
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,875
If I were to lend you
my assistance,

226
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,708
you can be assured that
you'll arrive at a future

227
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,041
in which you save those
in need of being rescued.

228
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,708
And since you find yourself
not knowing what you should do,

229
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,791
then would you consider
extending your hand to me?

230
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,791
With everything in my power,
I'll take you

231
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,708
to the future you're
longing for without fail.

232
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,791
I give you my word.

233
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,041
Echidna...

234
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,291
to be perfectly honest,
I'm frightened of getting hurt.

235
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:46,208
I hate suffering, pain,
sadness, and being afraid.

236
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,500
I just don't want to feel
that kind of misery,

237
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,791
and I don't want anyone else

238
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,791
having to experience
those things, either.

239
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,791
I'm not ready to die.

240
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,208
Since sacrifice
is a prerequisite

241
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,041
to taking your hand,

242
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,291
that's something
I can no longer do.

243
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,291
If there's even a chance

244
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,333
I might have value to them
beyond my own death,

245
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,166
I'm gonna look for it,
no matter what.

246
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,750
If I can find it,
I have a feeling

247
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,625
I can repay them in some way
other than just dying.

248
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,083
- That path
is lined with thorns.

249
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,083
If you thought of your death
as a tool,

250
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,750
your heart would be all that's
necessary to offer as payment.

251
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,416
But trying to deny that

252
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,375
in an attempt to claim
not only your heart,

253
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,916
but the future
of other people as well,

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,833
would be exceedingly difficult
and, above all...

255
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,750
terribly greedy.

256
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,125
- I won't pretend
that you haven't saved me.

257
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,250
You've done it
time and time again.

258
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,250
Regardless
of what you had in mind

259
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,916
when you did it,
that part is undeniable.

260
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,416
- That poor Garfiel
is pitifully dimwitted,

261
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,625
and he's petrified
of the outside world.

262
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,125
You'll need to break that spell

263
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,250
if you ever hope to release him
from his circumstances.

264
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,291
- You're helping me?
- It's nothing.

265
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,541
I'm just being
a sore, meddling loser.

266
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,041
I wouldn't want you
getting the ridiculous notion

267
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,416
that all of the other witches
you've met

268
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,416
are actually good at heart

269
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,458
and that only
I was evil to the end.

270
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,541
Do keep in mind
that I am a girl,

271
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,708
one just so who happens to be
terribly fond of you.

272
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,708
- As far as I'm concerned,
every single one of you

273
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,916
is a monster
beyond comprehension.

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,708
I don't think we'll ever
understand each other,

275
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,916
and I doubt
I could ever like you, but...

276
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,083
thanks for being willing
to let me die.

277
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,166
- [sighs]

278
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,791
- [slurps]
- And for not letting me die.

279
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,791
- I appreciate it.
- Hmph!

280
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,666
- I'm grateful
you let me hear the voices

281
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,916
of those I needed
to hear the most.

282
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,541
For all you've done, thank you.

283
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:06,250
As I said, you're someone
I can't understand,

284
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,458
but it's a fact that I've been
saved by the power you gave me

285
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,208
more times
than I can even count.

286
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,375
Is Return by Death

287
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,916
still something
that's available to me?

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,416
If not relying on it too much
is what it takes to love
myself,

289
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,875
then I don't know.

290
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,875
That definitely
isn't gonna be easy.

291
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,166
But I will try to like myself
a little more now,

292
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,291
exactly the way you asked me to.

293
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,958
- Are you sure?

294
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,416
- Yeah.

295
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,875
I mean,
compared to dropping dead,

296
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,541
that's not such a tall order.

297
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,083
[creaking]

298
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,791
SATELLA: Listen.
Don't fret all alone.

299
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,375
Fight alongside
the ones who care about you.

300
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,041
Rely on each other.

301
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,000
Never forget
that it's those people

302
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,708
and others you've affected
who will grieve when you die.

303
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,291
- I'll remember.

304
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,000
There will be a day...

305
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,208
when I'll need you...

306
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,625
[echoing]
to come and take my life.

307
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,666
- [echoing] You have my word...

308
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,666
I'm going to save you.

309
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,083
[gasps]

310
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,000
[insects chirping]

311
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,625
Glad to see you, too.

312
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,166
[groans]

313
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,625
- Oh, you're awake.
- Eh?

314
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,708
Otto?

315
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,708
This is...

316
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,625
I'd normally be inside.

317
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,458
Did you carry me out?

318
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,833
- No, that was all Patrasche.

319
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,958
She started thrashing around,
and then the minute

320
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,000
that I released her
from the carriage...

321
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,666
- Wait.

322
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,166
You get rejected
from the graveyard

323
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,375
without being qualified.

324
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,166
Why would you try
a crazy thing like that?

325
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,000
I mean, I would
have come outside

326
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,000
just as soon as I woke up,

327
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,750
so why did you save me?

328
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,000
- [squeals]

329
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,083
- Oh, come on.

330
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,583
You really have no idea why?

331
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,708
- Huh?
- [purrs]

332
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,916
- [sighs]
- [grunting]

333
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,208
- Well, of course. Yeah.
I would never dream of it.

334
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,916
- Do you understand her?

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,333
What did Patrasche tell you?

336
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,750
She just said,
"Don't make me explain it,"

337
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,000
so I better not.

338
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,166
But I can't believe
you still need me to!

339
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,750
- Huh?

340
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,291
- [sighs]

341
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,166
Let me put it this way.
Leaping to save somebody

342
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,666
when you think
that they're in danger,

343
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,208
helping them out even if
it means risking your own life,

344
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,916
it's simple. To me,

345
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,166
the feelings behind them
are exactly the same,

346
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,583
which is something
that holds true

347
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,958
whether you're a human
or a ground dragon.

348
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,708
- Uh...
- Wow.

349
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,708
Pretty dense, aren't you?

350
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,875
Just forget about it.

351
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,458
[gasps] Wh-What's wrong?

352
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,541
- Why are you crying?
- Sorry!

353
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,916
It's not what you think.

354
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,875
[crying] It's just the timing.

355
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,208
I see, Patrasche.

356
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,916
You actually like me, huh?

357
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,875
I never thought you'd be

358
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,541
the first one
I learned that from.

359
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,583
Well, I like you, too.
Thank you.

360
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,000
- [squawks]

361
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,208
- Are you all right?

362
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,958
Wh-What happened in there?

363
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,875
- Were you worried?
Hey, hold on a second.

364
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,333
Does that mean
you like me, too?

365
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,458
- Okay, there's no need
for things to get awkward.

366
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,125
I'm only thinking
of what comes next!

367
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,250
- Yeah, I know.
We are friends, after all.

368
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,250
- [gasps]

369
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,791
[sighs]

370
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,875
- Mr. Natsuki?
- So does this mean

371
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,416
I managed to pass
the second trial somehow?

372
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,166
- [force hums]
- [groaning]

373
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,291
[gagging]

374
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,708
- What happened?

375
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,416
- Damn it. What was...

376
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,750
Wait. It rejected me?

377
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,208
Could I have lost
my qualification?

378
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,916
But why is that?

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,958
[no audible dialogue]

380
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,333
What a nasty little...

381
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,750
- I'm still so lost.
Is there anything I can--

382
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,250
- Listen, there's something
that I've gotta do.

383
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,833
Now I want you to take Patrasche
back down to the carriage.

384
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:26,958
- But--
- Please, Otto.

385
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,875
- [grunts]

386
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,166
[fire crackling]

387
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,916
- A way to leave the Sanctuary

388
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,333
without going
through the graveyard?

389
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,875
My, that's certainly
a brazen suggestion.

390
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:54,458
I believe we may have spoken
of this before, haven't we?

391
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,791
It's the first time
that we've discussed this.

392
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,125
We've interrogated
each other so often now,

393
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,291
it'd be pointless
to even try and count.

394
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,833
- Is that so?

395
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,083
It would appear you have

396
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,041
quite the history with me,
don't you?

397
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,833
- Well, yeah. I've also learned
about a lot of other stuff, too,

398
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,916
like the facility Ryuzu's in

399
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,500
or even the fact that
Garfiel's
actually an Apostle of Greed.

400
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,458
My goodness,
that is splendid indeed!

401
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,791
But foregoing the graveyard
seems awfully cowardly,

402
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,500
as far as I'm concerned.

403
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,875
Any particular reason
to be acting with such haste?

404
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,333
- No, of course there's not.

405
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,083
It's just...

406
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,666
I can't stand watching Emilia
getting hurt over and over.

407
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,458
- But that is precisely
what you're for.

408
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,041
- [winces]

409
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,041
- Surely you're
not trying to tell me

410
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,208
that it would pain you
to undergo it for her?

411
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,125
- What? That's--
- Not the case?

412
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,208
Are you so certain?

413
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,083
If you love Miss Emilia,

414
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,416
then it should be
a simple task for you.

415
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,375
What is best for her
should come first

416
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,958
and your needs after.

417
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,000
- Am I wrong?
- But, I...

418
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,208
<i>- Never forget</i>
<i>that it's those people</i>

419
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,208
<i>and others you've affected</i>
<i>who will grieve when you die.</i>

420
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,416
- [gasps]

421
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,166
- [sighs] Rather disappointing.

422
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,875
It would seem that you still
haven't the fortitude
necessary

423
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,291
for the task you've been given.

424
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,000
Only a sliver.

425
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,375
Yes, I had only
a tiny sliver of hope

426
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,875
that maybe, just maybe

427
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:24,375
I would finally be able
to see the future I desired.

428
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,083
But it's clear
that you've yet to even stand

429
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,916
at the starting line
of your resolve.

430
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,125
- [gasps] What is it
you're trying to say to me?

431
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,250
'Cause I have no idea
what you're talking about!

432
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,250
- What do you think I--
- I expect you to possess

433
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,583
the determination
to carry out your objective,

434
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,458
even if it means trampling
on Miss Emilia's will.

435
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,375
- [gasps]
- Understand?

436
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:48,083
In my estimation,
if you do it all for her sake,

437
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,708
it stands to reason
that sometimes

438
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,458
you must ignore
the things she wants.

439
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,541
A child dreaming
of childish things

440
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,000
is simply incapable
of the conviction needed

441
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,833
to walk through the hell
that you must choose.

442
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,375
- But that's totally backwards,
isn't it?!

443
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,541
If it's for Emilia, then--

444
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,916
- Listen. There is life.
- [gasps]

445
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,416
- So long as there is life,
there is a future.

446
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,916
So long as there is a future,
there is hope.

447
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,916
So long as there is hope,
there is great possibility.

448
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,291
And with possibility,
people can still be saved.

449
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,625
Am I wrong?

450
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,708
- [gasping]

451
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,500
- You have nothing to say
in response to this, I take it.

452
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,833
Unfortunate.

453
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,125
How many more times
must you disappoint me?

454
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,166
In any case, while you continue

455
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,250
to work on honing
your intention,

456
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,125
I'd like a moment to press you
on one more matter.

457
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,250
- Hmm?

458
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,500
I believe you've already faced

459
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,250
many of the problems that arise

460
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,250
within the grounds
of this Sanctuary.

461
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,541
Although there are some

462
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,458
that aren't limited
to the Sanctuary alone.

463
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,583
- Y-You mean the mansion, right?

464
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,458
Are you telling me
you know about what ha--

465
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,166
- Of course I do.

466
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,916
After all, the order given
for the assassins to attack...

467
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:07,708
that command was one
that I personally issued.

468
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,083
- [gasping]

469
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,000
Wait.

470
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,500
Just hang on a second.

471
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,583
It was you?

472
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,333
- I sent assassins
to the mansion

473
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,500
to help sharpen your resolve.

474
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,833
- You what?

475
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,125
- Even with
the Authority that you have

476
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,250
at your disposal,
it's infeasible to save both.

477
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,666
You must weigh the options

478
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,541
and decide
which is more important.

479
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,875
Once you make that choice,
you can never take it back.

480
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,208
Eventually,
you will be perfected

481
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,375
as a being who can only
rescue one and no others.

482
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,583
[no audible dialogue]

483
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,125
- Y-You're seriously insane.

484
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,416
- Yes, indeed.

485
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,125
And I've been that way
for quite some time now.

486
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,500
From the moment I was enchanted
by those eyes 400 years ago,

487
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,083
It's fair to say
that I've been rather unhinged.

488
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,500
- 400 years ago?

489
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,666
- Now I'm curious, Subaru.

490
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,541
After all that's
transpired,
why aren't you insane
yet?

491
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,708
To face seemingly
impossible circumstances,

492
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,625
to walk the path of solitude,

493
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:19,083
the human heart
is only an impediment.

494
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,166
So I've made the decision
to force it upon you.

495
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,250
What now, then?

496
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,666
What is it you hope to do?

497
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,666
- Please.

498
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,083
Please forgive me. I beg you.

499
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,750
It was--
It was all my fault, so--

500
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,583
- You must get off your knees
and raise your head, Subaru.

501
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,833
Nothing is your fault.

502
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,083
- This is--
- You're wrong!

503
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,250
I want to do what you said,

504
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,666
but I can't. I lost
my qualification for the trial.

505
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,666
- You what?
- Please.

506
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,291
Sending assassins to the mansion
won't do any good.

507
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,416
No matter who dies, it won't--

508
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,625
So please...

509
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,541
[creaking]

510
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,958
- I refuse.
- [gasps]

511
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,791
- I now see
an even greater need to do so.

512
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,375
Echidna will surely restore
your qualification.

513
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,166
If you earnestly wish to
receive it, then just ask her.

514
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,166
That's just the nature
of her avaricious personality.

515
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,166
You're still able to fix this.
You only need her assistance.

516
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,375
Therefore, my actions
will not change.

517
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:28,125
I will continue to corner you,
to strengthen your focus

518
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,208
until I deem you
as one who's perfected.

519
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,500
- [shuddering]

520
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,708
- Don't get conceited
about this.

521
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,625
You're not the only one

522
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,333
who understands
how Echidna's mind works.

523
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,708
- If--If you hate me,

524
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,250
punish me alone.

525
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,458
- You think
that's how I feel about you?

526
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,500
I could never hate you.

527
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,583
Of that, you can be certain.

528
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,500
You're my beacon of hope.

529
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,541
The only ones who allow me
to experience even a
flicker

530
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,541
of that sentiment at all
are you and Rem.

531
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,208
From the very bottom
of my heart,

532
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,583
I believe in you.

533
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,250
- I will...

534
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,166
I will never be like you.

535
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,875
I have my humanity.

536
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,500
Got that?

537
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,416
And I always will.

538
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,791

[panting]

Damn it! Damn it!

[groans]

544
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,958
So what do I do now?

545
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,250
What can I do?!

546
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,750
What do I do?

547
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,666
What do I do? What do I do?

548
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,500
What do I do?

549
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,625
What do I do? What do I do?

550
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,333
What do I do?

551
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:13,458
What do I do? What do I do?

552
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,541
What do I do?!

553
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,958
What do I do?! What do I do?!

554
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,833
OTTO: Hey!
Would you like me to tell you

555
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,333
- what you should do?
- [gasps]

556
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,125
["Memento" playing]

557
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,416
- Otto?

558
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,416
- That's me. Hello there,

559
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,416
and good morning to you.

560
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,750
Now, are you ready
to answer my question?

561
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,333
- Morning? Uh...

562
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,458
what are you doing here?

563
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,833
- Let's put that aside
for the moment.

564
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,916
I think we need
to talk about you first.

565
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,666
'Cause you were
muttering deliriously

566
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,750
and looking like
you were about to die.

567
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:48,833
- Are you serious?

568
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,416
- Yeah.

569
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,750
- I see.

570
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:56,625
Man, you always seem to find me

571
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,458
when I'm
in the freakiest states.

572
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,708
- Well, what can I say?

573
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,125
I am a trader, after all.

574
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,458
- Sorry, but I don't have time

575
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,833
right now to mess around.

576
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,708
Give me a second, okay?
I need to think.

577
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,416
You were feeling
hopeless, right?

578
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,541
And you wanted to know
what it is that you should do?

579
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,916
Just leave it to me.

580
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,833
- What do you mean?
Leave what to you?

581
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,750
- Listen, this is gonna take

582
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,458
a little preparation.

583
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,500
- Preparation?

584
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,958
Right. First off,

585
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:22,833
you're gonna need to take
a long, deep breath, okay?

586
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,708
- Huh?
- Quickly, now.

587
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,958
- [breathes deeply]

Huh?

591
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,041
- That's enough.

592
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,916
Stop putting on
a tough-guy front

593
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,791
around your friends,
Subaru Natsuki!
