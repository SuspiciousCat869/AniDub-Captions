1
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,583
SUBARU: An ironic ending, huh?

2
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,083
You get that
from your precious book, too?

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,750
You don't have
a will of your own.

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,250
Everything you say
comes straight from those pages.

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,291
That's what you're saying,
right?

6
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,250
- I have no intention
of repeating myself.

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:27,375
- [groans] Man, I still can't
believe how stubborn you are.

8
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,666
It's definitely
gonna be a chore

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,708
gettin' you out of this place.

10
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,416
- Getting me out?

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,791
What in the world are you
talking about, I suppose?

12
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,041
I don't recall ever
asking you to take me anywhere.

13
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,750
- I guess
you didn't expect to hear that.

14
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,583
But how's that possible
when every single thing I do

15
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,375
is in that little book of yours?

16
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,250
- [gasping]

17
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,458
- Quit clinging
to that damn thing.

18
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,291
- [gasps]

19
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,500
- [groans]
When you're talking to me,

20
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,250
I want you to look
into my eyes, not at this!

21
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,458
- Wait! No! [gasps]

22
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,791
- [gasps]

23
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,541
- It was some time ago...

24
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:10,791
when that book stopped showing
what the future held for me,

25
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,291
many long years now.

26
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,833
Maintaining and curating
this library of knowledge

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,791
is what my contract demands.

28
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:28,708
- A library of knowledge, huh?

29
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,708
- She enjoyed
storing up information

30
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,916
more than anything else,
I suppose.

31
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,291
- Tell me something.

32
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:41,333
You're a spirit contracted
to Echidna, aren't you?

33
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,291
There's nothing written
inside this book...

34
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,666
but despite that, you...

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,333
- The last thing
she said to me was,

36
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:54,125
"One day, that person
will appear in the library."

37
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,958
My job was to wait
until that day arrived.

38
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,500
All this time,
I've been patiently doing so.

39
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,541
- [gasps]

40
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,333
- But that person
never appeared,

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,333
and the book didn't specify
as to who it would be.

42
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:10,375
Years just continued to pass,

43
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,208
and then...

44
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,875
Look, I don't really care

45
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,291
if you're not "that person."

46
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,625
If the one who can finish me,

47
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,750
who can bring
my long contract to an end

48
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,000
and take my life is you,

49
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:26,208
then I'll settle for that,
I suppose.

50
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,458
- [gasps] What?

51
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,708
Hold on a minute.

52
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,375
Are you telling me
you don't want to live anymore?

53
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,625
- When put that way,
it isn't completely accurate.

54
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,625
I only want you to release me
from the binding contract

55
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,000
that's claimed me
for eternity, I suppose.

56
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,458
- And just how
is that any different

57
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,000
from wanting to die, huh?!
[gasping]

58
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,750
Don't you even joke about that!

59
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,583
Maybe you can say it
to some other people,

60
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,250
but I won't let you
say it to me!

61
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,875
- That's a very selfish thing
to proclaim.

62
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,333
- [gasps]

63
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,583
- What do you really
know about me, I suppose?

64
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,000
I've existed here for ages,

65
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,791
living in accordance with
my contract for 400 years now.

66
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,333
- Four centuries?

67
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,750
- It never worried me,
I suppose,

68
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,500
because I still had the book.

69
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,458
So many times, I had dreams

70
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,250
of its last page
finally being filled in.

71
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,916
But when someone would
lay a hand on that door,

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,625
my heart was always betrayed,
I suppose.

73
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,833
As the years kept going by,
I realized something.

74
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,083
- You realized what?

75
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,041
- The reason
nothing further was written...

76
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,541
is because that's where

77
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,958
the owner's future
is meant to come to an end.

78
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,416
- You're wrong!
I just don't get you.

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,208
I mean, why in the hell
are you always

80
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,041
jumping to your own conclusions
like that?!

81
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,875
If you want someone
to do something for you,

82
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,708
then you have to say so!
There's no point

83
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,916
in making a damn game
out of it, all right?!

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,458
If you told me you need help,

85
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,583
don't you think
I'd do all I could to--

86
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,250
[panting]

87
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,333
- Please, do something.

88
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,750
- That's it. Yeah.

89
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,666
Just come right out
and ask me for it.

90
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,833
- Please help me.

91
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,250
- Yes, that's it!

92
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,833
By reaching out your hand to me,

93
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,625
- I know that you--
- If you really mean it,

94
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,958
then I want you to kill me,
I suppose.

95
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,000
- [gasps]
- [gasps]

96
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,750
- Do you have any idea how long
I've been waiting for that?

97
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:30,208
Did you believe I had just
given up entirely, I suppose?

98
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,541
Are you saying you'll pull me

99
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,333
out of this darkness
that's so deep,

100
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,375
I can't see my own hand
stretched out in front of me?

101
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,958
If you say
that you'll do that for me,

102
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,500
then why, why--

103
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,541
why did you leave me alone here
like this for 400 years?!

104
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,500
You're going to help me,

105
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,041
to save me?

106
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,041
Then why didn't you
bother to do it any sooner?!

107
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,791
My pleas for help
and the salvation I'd hoped for

108
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,708
are long behind me now.

109
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,750
Those wishes
have all died and gone away.

110
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,708
If you still say
you want to rescue me, then...

111
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,458
- What can I do?

112
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,541
- You can make me...

113
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,416
your priority.

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,000
Put me first!

115
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,333
Think of me before anyone else!

116
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,166
Overwrite my contract!
Paint it over!

117
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,000
Blot it all out,
and take me away from here!

118
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,083
Pull me toward you! Hold me!

119
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,500
But there's no way that you
can do such a thing, I
suppose.

120
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:38,083
So then I want this utter
failure destroyed instead.

121
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,791
Just end it all.

122
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,000
Or are you really going
to be "that person" for me?

123
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,458
If that's not
something you can do,

124
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,958
then I want you...

125
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,666
to kill me with your own hands,
I suppose.

126
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,000
Spirits aren't even capable
of dying on their own.

127
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,458
- [sobs]

128
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,000
Why does it have to be me?

129
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,583
- It must be. Why, you ask?

130
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,875
[sighs] It's simple.

131
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,791
The reason
I'm entrusting my life's end

132
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,541
to you is because--

133
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,000
ELSA: So very sorry
for the interruption,

134
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,416
but I couldn't help
overhearing you.

135
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,666
Might I become "that person"?

136
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,791
- Who gave you permission
to come here, I suppose?

137
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,791
This is my forbidden library,

138
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,125
and nobody may enter
without my consent.

139
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,916
- The magic you've chosen
to isolate spaces

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,083
uses doors as its medium,
doesn't it?

141
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,166
Once I became aware of that,

142
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,083
all I had to do
was leave each one open.

143
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,791
- Simple solution, no?
- [gasps]

144
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,041
- It did take
a bit more time than I'd like,

145
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,000
but I'm relieved to find you,

146
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,583
and thankfully before
Maylie
returned from the village.

147
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,916
- Hold on. Wh-Why the village?

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,708
- Well, that's where all
of the other targets fled to,

149
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,666
so we've divided up
the workload.

150
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,250
- You what?

151
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,708
- There are more of them
in the village of course,

152
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,166
but the target here
is quite superior.

153
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,083
After all, I'll have
the chance to open up a spirit

154
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,708
and take a look inside.

155
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,666
[slurps]

156
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,375
- [gasps]

157
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,041
- You hope to protect her?

158
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,041
- You're damn right.

159
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,916
- You two are rather close.

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,416
How enviable.

161
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,208
I'll send you
to meet the angels together.

00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,041
- What do you plan to do now,
I suppose?

165
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,833
- Head for the village!

166
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,666
[panting]

167
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,750
- It won't do any good
to go there by this point.

168
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,416
- Now don't be stupid!

169
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,833
- Oh, my goodness! It's you two.

170
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:47,000
What could have possibly brought
you all the way out here?

171
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,000
That Elsa is so sloppy.

172
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,125
- Listen--

173
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,250
Wait. I've seen you before.

174
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,458
- I can't tell you
how much fun I had

175
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,750
the day you came out
and played with us.

SUBARU: You're a mabeast user?

181
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,875
- My name is Maylie Portroute.

182
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:18,458
Simply calling me by what
I can do is rather unappealing.

183
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,875
- [growls] No, the village.

184
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,333
What'd you do to Rem
and the others?!

185
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:26,041
- I have no idea
who this Rem is,

186
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,500
but I did exactly
what I was asked to do,

187
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,750
"Take care of the big maid
and the little maid

188
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,416
who are living in the mansion."

189
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,250
It's a shame, though,

190
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,625
because I really
wasn't expecting

191
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,041
the little one to be Petra.

192
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,583
- Why did you say,
"It's a shame"? What are you...

193
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,125
- Oh, don't worry about it.

194
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,750
She was my good friend,
remember?

195
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,791
I made certain
it was over in one bite

196
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,750
so she wouldn't suffer.

What? You want to fight me?

201
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,541
A pity. I do hate it when
my plans fall apart, you know.

202
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,041
- Then you have my condolences,
I suppose.

203
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,958
- But I'm still going to allow
my partner to take care of you,

204
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,041
per our agreement
to split up the work.

205
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,833
- It wasn't very friendly
of you to run away.

206
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,791
- If you think that shadow magic
can't be used offensively,

207
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,916
then you're very naive.

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,625
- What a lovely surprise.

209
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,250
I didn't know you could do that.

210
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,250

Fall apart where you stand,
I suppose.

- Aww, what just happened?

221
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,750
I guess Elsa truly was a fool.

222
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,208
Too bad, really.

223
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,708
- You'll be joining her
very soon.

224
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,291
- Hang on!
Look, she's only a little kid.

225
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,333
- True, but an enemy
is an enemy, I suppose.

226
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,833
- She's working
for someone else,

227
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,583
so we should get her
to tell us who that is.

228
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,000
- Sorry, but that
won't be happening.

229
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,375
Otherwise, I'd be in trouble.

230

you
take down a kid, all
right?!

That was cruel, even for you.

- It's that spirit over there
I have true pity for.

You went away

You don't understand.

00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,458
I should have explained
everything.

- Uh...

would return, Subaru. [giggles]

And if I did my very best

you would come to my rescue.

I thought maybe
it finally happened,

that you'd actually started
to get sick of me.

I assumed
you'd grown to hate me.

I got frightened and came here,

306
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,083
but honestly,
it didn't help at all.

So I can't tell you how happy
I felt when you showed up,

here beside me,

I don't need anything else.

I'm sorry. I know I haven't
said these things before,

you feel the same way.

- She said she loves me

323
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:04,291
and, as long as she has me,
she doesn't need anything
else.

324
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,458
- Bastard. [growling]

325
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,291
- With her cute face,
in her sweet voice,

326
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,208
so close that we could
have melted together...

327
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,500
that's what she said.

328
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,041
- You think
this is the time for--

329
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,875
- Don't you get it?!
There's no way in hell

330
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,666
Emilia would ever tell me
that she loves me!

331
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,375
- [gasps]
- Like there's any chance

332
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,208
she'd ever say that,

333
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,125
that she doesn't need
anything else,

334
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,083
never.

335
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,083
- Wh-What are you...

336
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,625
- If only Puck
had been there by her side,

337
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,250
there would have been no way

338
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,666
she'd fall
all over me like that.

339
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,041
Someone must have--
must have pushed her

340
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:42,916
to where she had no choice

341
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,958
and she was forced
to rely on me.

342
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,916
- That's why
there's snow everywhere?!

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,250
Drag her out here, then.
That half-witch better--

344
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,416
- You want me to bring Emilia
outside to stop the snow?

345
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,000
I can't do that.

346
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,666
- Why not?!

347
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,541
- Emilia's not the one
causing it to happen.

348
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,458
It's someone else.

349
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,791
- What do you mean?

350
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,458
- I need you
to tell me where Roswaal is.

351
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,041
- Huh?

352
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,791
- [gasping]

353
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,708
Getting a straight answer
out of that guy,

354
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,291
that task is the last goal
I need to reach in this world.

355
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:23,333
- My, what an unusual pair
you two make.

356
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,708
- I want you to admit it.

357
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,083
You're the one making it snow
in the Sanctuary,

358
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,500
aren't you, Roswaal?

359
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,208
- I'm curious.

360
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,208
Did I tell you
I'm the one to blame?

361
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,041
- Uh...

362
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,416
- Hmm. I see.

363
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
How very regrettable.

364
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,250
- [gasps] You smug freak.

365
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,666
So you're
not even gonna deny it?!

366
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,833
- Well, I suppose
I could feign ignorance,

367
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,583
but you clearly
have some grounds

368
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,083
for asking me about this,
so instead,

369
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,666
I'm choosing to respect
whatever grounds those may be.

370
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,083
GARFIEL: Hah! Thanks for that!

371
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,291
Maybe I should return the favor
by showin' you

372
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,583
a little respect
for your stupidity! [gasps]

373
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,500
- Do not insult Master Roswaal.

374
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,333
- Listen, this is
no time for you to butt in!

375
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,291
- I don't plan
on telling you again, Garf!

376
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,000
- I don't wanna
have to take this out on you.

377
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,125
- [blow stabs]
- [gags]

378
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,125
- Thank you.

379
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,375
You've proven to be
a most excellent servant

380
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,875
once again, Ram.

381
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:20,791
- [groaning]

382
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,250
[gags]

383
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,041
[gasping]

384
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,875
- [gasps]

385
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,791
- Master, why?

386
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,791
- I am a man of my word

387
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:40,333
As such, I shall offer this soul
in your great honor.

388
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,708
[Garfiel gasping]

389
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,208
[groans]

390
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,416
Roswaal.

391
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,791
Ram, no.

392
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,166
Ram, please,
just open your eyes for me.

393
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,500
Come on.

394
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,458
Ram!

395
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,791
Please, damn it!

396
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,125
Ram, open your eyes!

397
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,166
- [flesh stretching]
- Don't die!

398
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,375
- [gasps]

399
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,000
- I cannot have you
making your transformation here.

400
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,291
Now, then,
in accordance with my vow,

401
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:19,583
perhaps we should discuss
a few things, Subaru Natsuki.

402
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,708
- Why'd you kill them?

403
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,750
- Because they were both
interfering with our discussion.

404
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,833
It was an awful thing
to do to Ram,

405
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,333
but had I
not created an opening,

406
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,833
I stood very little chance
of defeating him.

407
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,291
- Huh?

408
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,208
- That's unexpected.

409
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,125
In times past,
you've always proven to be

410
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,333
the type who would blindly fly
into a rage

411
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,333
during situations
such as these.

412
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:46,250
- What are you getting at,
you bastard?

413
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,166
There's no way in hell
I'm gonna--

414
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,875
- Let me get away with this?

415
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,416
- [gasps]

416
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,625
Stop it.
Stop looking at me like that!

417
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,500
I wanna know
who in the hell you are!

418
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,708
You just killed them both,

419
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,208
you talked about
the witch's cult,

420
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,541
and you've been dodging me
over and over again!

421
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,208
- "Over and over."

422
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,708
Yes. Over and over,
indeed, Subaru.

423
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,000
- [gasps]

424
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,375
- Very well.
Since you don't understand,

425
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:16,833
I will attempt to
explain it
to you as if I do
myself.

426
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:17,750
- [gasps]

427
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,875
- You watched them die,

428
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,291
but seem to feel
no grief over it.

429
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:26,541
You feel shock and indignation,
but not genuine sorrow.

430
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,708
Is it not because you sense that
this is something you can undo?

431
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,875
- [gasps]

432
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,583
You knew?

433
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,250
- I'm confident
that showing you this

434
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,916
will most likely be
the fastest way to explain.

435
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,250
- [gasps]
- It isn't a Gospel,

436
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,708
nor a defective tome.

437
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:46,250
It's the genuine article,
of which only two exist.

438
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,958
- So you also have
one of those books?

439
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,041
- It appears
that there's no need to reveal

440
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,708
who's in possession
of the other text

441
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,958
or to explain
what's found inside.

442
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,666
Judging by your expression,

443
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,375
I assume Beatrice
succeeded in fulfilling

444
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,666
her dearest wish to disappear?

445
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,583
- [gasps]

446
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,375
What are you saying?

447
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:08,375
You mean dying in such
a brutal and pointless way

448
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,000
was her dearest wish?!

449
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,541
Is that what you're
trying to tell me?!

450
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,625
- It was precisely
what she wanted.

451
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,625
I'm envious of her.

452
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,291
Unfortunately, it would
seem
that I'm rather incapable

453
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,291
of achieving my greatest desire.

454
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,458
- I don't understand.

455
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,791
What is it that you want to do?

456
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,416
Why are you like this?!

457
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,791
- I cannot say.
I've made a vow of my own.

458
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,791
However, I will say this.

459
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,958
Without fail,
I'm constantly doing my utmost

460
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,791
to realize my own dearest wish.

461
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,750
My schemes, inhumanity,
and the assistance I offer

462
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,583
are all for that purpose.

463
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:47,541
- You're following
the book, too. Is that it?

464
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,458
[gasps] Is the snow
also in its pages?

465
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,125
Were you told to make it
come down out there?!

466
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,666
'Cause I want to know why!

467
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,750
- Why do you think?

468
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,916
To keep Miss Emilia isolated.

469
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,833
- Wh-What?

470
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,333
- An unseasonal snowstorm
after her arrival

471
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,000
on grounds with
a deep connection to the witch,

472
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,458
Garfiel would condemn her,

473
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,708
and the villagers have some
experience with cold spells.

474
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,333
Understand? Miss Emilia would
then feel increasingly
detached

475
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,541
and grow emotionally unstable.

476
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,833
- Do you mean...

477
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,791
- And you'd never
distance yourself from her

478
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,333
if she were to lean on you.

479
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,333
- Bastard. That explains
what you did to my letter.

480
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,083
- Letter?

481
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,750
In any case, your current self

482
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,666
cannot bring about the future
indicated in the text.

483
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,458
If there's a discrepancy,
then it must be corrected.

484
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,375
- [gasps] Hold on.
Are you gonna kill me?

485
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,458
- That would be putting the cart
before the ground dragon.

486
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,916
No matter what happens,

487
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,333
I need you to try it again
at the next opportunity.

488
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,791
- Huh?
- I, myself, cannot kill you,

489
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,375
but there are other
unpleasant things that I can do.

490
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,375
For instance...

491
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:50,750
- [groans]

[gags]

- This may not exactly be

494
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,541
the smartest way
of doing things,

495
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,750
considering the future
you and I share,

496
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,708
but this might hurt a bit.

497
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,625

[groans]

500
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,291
- Even after this,

501
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,083
you have no mind
to start over?

502
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,458
- Roswaal, you're...

503
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:23,166
you're asking me about
beginning all of this again,

504
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,458
but planning out
what you do to somebody

505
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,750
based on the assumption

506
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,625
that they'll just start over
is insane.

507
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:36,500
- It would appear
that our discussion is finished.

508
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,708
<i>Goa!</i>

509
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,958
Ah, yes, I see it now.

510
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,916
So this is
how it comes to an end.

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,791

- The Great Rabbit?

515
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,458
But it's only the second day.

516
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,083
- It's likely due to this snow.

517
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,333
- Daphne told me before
that the Great Rabbit

518
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,500
is always drawn
to large amounts of mana.

519
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,666
Roswaal, I'm calling
a truce for now,

520
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,000
'cause our focus should be
on getting everybody outside.

["Memento" playing in Japanese]

522
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,458
- How would we do that?

523
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,166
Until the trial is completed,

524
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,208
those in the Sanctuary
cannot leave the barrier.

525
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:22,416
- Hang on! I'm not finished yet!

526
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,625
You might think
it can wait until next time,

527
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,791
but I'm telling you...

528
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,125
- You seem to be mistaken

529
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:30,333
about one important factor,
Subaru.

530
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,041
While you may well
have the ability

531
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:34,083
to start over, I do not.

532

- [grunts]

533
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,000
- My present self will end here.

534
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,791
It's sudden,

535
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,083
but that's quite all right.

536
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:41,875
Another version of me
will be there

537
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:42,875
after your return

538
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,833
to the beginning.

539
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,791
As long as he fulfills my goals

540
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,625
one day, it makes no difference.

541
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,750
- But that isn't how

542
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,250
any normal human thinks.

543
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,666
- There's not
a single doubt in my mind

544
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,458
that the time will come
when you truly catch up to me.

545
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,083
Now listen carefully.

546
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,166
There is only one thing

547
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,500
that is clearly and above all

548
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,083
the most precious to you
in this whole world.

549
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,583
You have to get rid
of everything else but that

550
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,541
and think of nothing
but making sure

551
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,666
what you hold so dearly
is protected.

- you can then...

558
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,125
become just like yours truly.

Oh, my goodness.
Where have you been?

566
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:00,791
I was getting
so worried about you.

567
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,541
Are you all right? Exhausted?

568
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,041
[giggles]

569
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,500
Okay, I see then.

570
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,833
That's good to hear.

571
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,500
Hey, Subaru!

572
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,291
Come here! You like resting
your head on my lap, don't
you?

573
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,208
Aww. Are you sleepy?

- Don't force it, okay?

577
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:41,500
You always end up
pushing yourself too hard

578
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,791
for the sake of other people.

579
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,166
It gives me mixed feelings.

580
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,791
If I'm being honest,

581
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,041
I only want you
to do that for me,

582
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,833
although I wouldn't
like a Subaru

583
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:53,791
who never looked
at anybody else.

584
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:56,166
Sorry.

585
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,041
I'm pretty selfish, aren't I?
