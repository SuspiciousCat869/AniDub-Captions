while also getting us to leave
and overcoming this hardship.

that by breaking your promise
and opening the seal,

00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,541
You should calm down
and listen.

164
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,083
We need to have
a discussion regarding--

165
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,750
- Keep your mouth shut!
- [yelps]

166
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,750
- No, Emilia!

167
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,708
Wait! I didn't mean to--
I would never...

168
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,875
- Your reality
is plagued with confusion.

169
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,708
Can't you direct that emotion
to the one you despise?

170
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,583
- [gasps]

171
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,666
- I would never tell you
to love all people

172
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,083
as you love your daughter,

173
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,250
but there are things
that can change

174
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,208
with a little empathy
and benevolence.

175
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,416
- That's ridiculous!
You're insane!

176
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,541
Who would listen
to some thing like you?!

177
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,500
- Then why not try another way?

178
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,166
Have your daughter
do what I wish

179
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,666
using your own words
instead of mine.

180
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,041
I've verified my suspicion
that she possesses the key,

181
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:19,083
but she hasn't shown any desire
to try and open the door,

182
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,666
because she wishes
to keep her oath with you.

183
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,750
- [gasps]

184

- [whimpers]

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,916
- Well, I'll promise you this.

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,833
If the seal is finally opened,

187
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,708
then we'll leave this forest
and do nothing further.

188
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:38,166
"Promise" is
such a nice word, isn't it?

189
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,750
- I'm so sorry, Emilia,

190
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,875
sorry for putting you
through all this.

191
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,625
- Did you come here alone?

192
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,750
Where's Archi?

193
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,875
- I'm not sure.
He told me to run

194
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,083
toward the white flowers
between the trees.

195
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,833
[no audible dialogue]

196
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,000
So I did!

197
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,750
I ran and didn't look back!

198
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,166
- [gasps]

199
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,500
Emilia...

200
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,041
I'm proud of you.

201
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:14,083
Thank you for having the courage
to keep your word to me.

202
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,041
What a good girl.
What a good girl.

203
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,916
- Mother!

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,166
Mother, I--

205
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,083
I'm sorry. I just wanted--

206
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,750
- None of that now.

207
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,125
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

208
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,833
You're such a treasure to me.

209
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,041
- What beautiful, motherly love.

210
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,791
I'm deeply moved by it.

211
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,791
How special.

212
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,291
I feel lucky to see
such a display of emotion.

213
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,791
FORTUNA: I won't open the seal,

214
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,791
and I won't let you have her.

215
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,916
Now get ready.

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's time to turn into
an ice statue and die!

217
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,250
- I finally caught up to you!
Come on!

218
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,625
FORTUNA: Geuse!

219

it's over!

- That should be
more than enough this time!

233
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,625
Miss Fortuna,
you need to be careful!

234
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,833
Keep your guard up!

I'll make sure that she's--

PANDORA: None of this
is your fault.

00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,916
You were in a blind rage.

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,958
You mistook what you saw.

It can't be!

00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,916
It can't be! It can't be!

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,916
It can't be!

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,583
- What did I just--
What did I just do?!

251
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,583
What did I just do?!

252
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,333
Impossible!

00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,708
Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!

Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!
Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!

Why?! Why did I do this?!

256
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,500
- That's simple.
It was all for love.

257
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,000
You offered up your very soul
for a chance to save

258
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,041
the one you cared about
more than anybody.

259
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,916
All that you've done
was the result of that emotion,

260
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,416
a beautiful,
wonderful symbol of love.

261
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,875
- Love. Love. Love...

262
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,958
- Yes. There's nothing
for you to fear

and nothing to regret.

264

This inevitable path
was the one you've chosen.

265
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,416
This is
what it was leading to,

266
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,958
and all the love that you're
feeling is not wrong.

267

It's for love.

I'm sorry I let you down.

any of the things...

you wanted and told me to do.

I know your wife...

You're my mother,

You've always taken care of me.

287
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,875
You loved me just as much
as my mom and dad did,

288
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,583
and I knew, no matter what,
you were by my side.

nothing at all.

Your Emilia

00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,041
so much!

293
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,458
So much, Mother Fortuna!

00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,416
[crying] I love you.

Eh? Mother?

00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,000
so very much.

00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,041
you're ready to choose the hope
that you'll break the seal?

- What do you mean? I don't...

307

- The circumstances
have changed,

308
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,750
because the mother
you made your promise to

309
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,416
has sadly passed away.

310

Since you're no longer
shackled by any vows,

I assumed your decision
would be a bit easier.

[wind blowing]

PANDORA: What
a dangerous thing to do.

316
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,083
- Die.
- What brought that--

317
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,500
PANDORA: Please, calm yourself.

318
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,625
We can talk it over
until you under--

319
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,458
- I said die.

320
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,416
- Such viciousness
from a tenderhearted child.

321
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,625
Your mother
would be sad if you--

322
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,166
- Now die.

323
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,833
- This is quite a problem.

324
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,250
It's having the opposite effect.

325
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,166
Just die.

Die! Die!

328
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,041
Die!

329
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,083
Die! Die...

330
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,833
- It's a shame when my wish
is just out of reach,

331
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,041
but it's time
to end this for today.

332
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,000
To continue
beyond your current state

333
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,125
might force you
into the impossible.

334
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,083
- Die! Die!

335
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,125
You need to die!
You need to die!

336
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,916
You need to die!
Just die! Die...

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,458
- At the rate you're going,

338
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,916
I'd say there's
a high likelihood

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that you'll fall
into a deep sleep soon.

340
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,375
- Die! Die...

341
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,541
- The power you're
releasing
will envelop this forest

342
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:57,000
with frozen soil
that will never thaw.

343
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,458
Either your mana
will eventually run dry...

344
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,125
or it'll be offset
at some point.

345
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,250
But that could only happen

346
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,708
through someone
with power comparable to yours.

347
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,875
Until then...

348
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,166
- You need to die!

349
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,583
You need to die!
You need to die...

350
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,875
- Sorry, but I
won't be doing that.

351
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,000
- Die! Die...

352
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,041
- As surely
as the seasons change,

353
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,500
as surely as snow melts
and the glacial period ends,

354
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,000
we will meet again.
- Die! Die...

355
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,375
However, it would make me sad

356
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,750
if you still hated me
when that day arrives.

357
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,166
- You need to die!
You need to die!

358
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,041
You need to die...

359
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,458
- So to make sure
that doesn't happen,

360
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,791
your memories thus far
will end with today,

361
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,708
as you forget my existence.

that's left behind

364
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,583
however you wish.

365
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,875
And, indeed,
you did your very best

366
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,208
to keep your promise
to your mother.

367
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,708
I'd be pleased if you'd
engrave that in your heart

368
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,666
and remain torn between duty
and your own regret forever.

369
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,791

our two paths cross once again.

ECHIDNA: If you blame yourself

381
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,750
for falsifying your memories,

382
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,791
I'd say you're barking
up the wrong tree altogether.

383
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:56,666
The one you saw all those years
ago was the Witch of Vanity.

384
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,416
I'm certain it was her Authority

385
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,125
that padded out
your distorted recollections.

386
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,208
- Regarding Pandora,

387
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,833
could I ask you about her?

388
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,250
- I have been known to seek out
conversations with others,

389
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,000
but in your case, I have
no interest in digressions.

390
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,916
- I see. All right.

391
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,166
I'm responsible
for turning them all into ice,

392
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,833
and I did it when they were
struggling to try and rescue me.

393
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:28,666
- By recalling the past,
you saw the end of your anguish.

394
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,958
The only thing that remains
is to give your answer.

395
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,250
- To what?
Do you mean the trial?

396
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,333
- The first one
comes to a conclusion

397
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,291
whenever you find
the courage necessary

398
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,333
to part with
your greatest regret,

399
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,291
either by accepting
or rejecting

400
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,958
that which is your past self.

401
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,833
- [breathes deeply]

402
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,708
- The fact remains that the
repercussions of your own sin

403
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,291
caused your mother,
your friends, and your family

404
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,500
to turn into a collection
of ice statues.

405
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,291
Your determination to save them

406
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,250
can't even be called idealistic.

407
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,250
Ultimately, it was
no more than a dream.

408
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,875
So what could possibly
be left for you?

409
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,333
- Well, that's simple.

410
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,041
It's all so clear to me now.

411
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,416
Mother loved and protected me
as if I was her own,

412
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,791
which is why I wanted to do
everything within my power

413
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,750
to see that she was rescued.

414
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,083
I wanted to sleep
in her arms again

415
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,541
together in the same bed.

416
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,416
I wanted to tell her over
and over how much I loved her.

417
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,250
- Are you saying
you feel contrite?

418
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,333
- No, of course not.
Why would I?

419
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,458
I stood my ground,
refused to yield,

420
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:50,041
and kept my promise.
I don't regret it.

421
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,583
If I'm disappointed
about anything,

422
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,708
it's that I wasn't
strong enough at that age,

423
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,875
wasn't smart enough
to do better.

424
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,208
But I'll never regret

425
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,083
keeping the solemn vow
I made with Mother

426
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,291
and not giving in
to what Pandora wanted,

427
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,833
not for a single day.

428
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:07,750
Because...

429
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,208
[no audible dialogue]

430
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,958
Mother told me in the very end

431
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:16,458
she was proud of me
for keeping my promise to her.

432
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,916
She said that I was
her greatest treasure.

433
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,541
- But given that you
can't save her now,

434
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,291
doesn't that mean
you've completely lost

435
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,333
your reason to fight?

436
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,125
- No, I don't see it that way.

437
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,583
- While I couldn't
rescue Mother,

438
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,333
I can't say that for
certain
about everyone else
yet.

439
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,458
They're still
sleeping in the ice,

440
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,291
waiting for me
to finally set them free,

441
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,791
and I'm the only one
who's able to do it.

442
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,791
- The forest was contaminated
by the Black Serpent.

443
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,583
Even if you thaw
the frozen soil,

444
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,250
what if their bodies have
become corroded by disease?

445
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,291
What if none of the land

446
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,875
your people owned
for generations remains?

447
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,291
- You're just
imagining the worst.

448
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,583
They're all hoping
to be released.

449
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,958
I need to wake each of them up
soon and let them scold me.

450
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,416
Then they'll smile and tell me

451
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,416
they're so happy
I'm still alive.

452
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,041
- What a foolish delusion.

453
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,625
- Not at all.

454
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,500
It's the prediction
of a bright future.

455
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,416
Mother told me that, one day,

456
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,000
each of us
would leave the forest

457
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,083
and have the chance
to live out normal lives.

458
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,458
In exactly the same way

459
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,333
we were friends
with Geuse and his people

460
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,875
and the way Subaru confessed
that he was in love with me,

461
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,166
the world where Geuse and Mother

462
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,000
should have walked
side by side will come!

463
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,791
There's no doubt about it!

464
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,375
- Are the villagers
who turned into ice statues

465
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,916
in this imaginary world, too,

466
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,875
all the ones you froze
and have long since abandoned?

467
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,958
- Yes! Each one of them.

468
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,041
And I'll apologize
over and over

469
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,166
'til they choose to forgive me.

470
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,375
After my apologies
have been accepted,

471
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,791
I can show them all
a beautiful world,

472
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,500
then tell them we don't
need
to live in hiding anymore.

473
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,875
They'll see
that this is the world

474
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,250
Mother Fortuna told us about!

475
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,500
[inhales]

476
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,625
I'll sing my dreams
'til my throat goes dry!

477
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,375
That way, even Mother up
in the skies above will hear me!

478
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,250
I'll tell her that I'm
going to live happily

479
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,041
in the world she dearly loved
for the rest of my life!

480
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,125
[ice shatters]

481
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,583
- I understand.

482
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,875
Yes, it's clear to me now.

483
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,166
I thought I understood before,

484
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,250
but this exceeds
my expectations.

485
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,500
You really are that pushy,

486
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,250
insolent, brazen,
and delusional,

487
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,208
the peak of hypocrisy.

488
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,375
- Maybe.

489
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:22,458
Is that bad?

490
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,666
- Your trial's officially over.

491
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,500
Regardless of its
rather self-absorbed ending,

492
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,875
your past has
most definitely been settled.

493
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:34,166
Continue using your mother's
sacrifice as an excuse.

494
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,208
Then her martyrdom

495
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,541
will see your pompous wish
to the very end.

496
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,666
- Say what you want
to try and hurt me.

497
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,583
It's fine. I'm used
to your constant insults by now.

498
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,583
- [sighs]

499
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,916
One trial down,
and two more remain.

500
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I must say
I'm sincerely looking forward

501
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,458
to more of your
pathetic struggling.

502
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,083
- Huh? Hold on.

503
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,083
I still have more trials
to go through?

504
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,250
There's two more.
So that's three in all?

505
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,125
- Don't worry.
I doubt the next ones

506
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,291
will pose that much
of a challenge for you.

507
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,958
- Oh, they won't?

508
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,458
- Now that you've
been fighting back,

509
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,583
they'll likely be
quite a poor fit.

510
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,291
In a sense, you've abandoned
all thought entirely.

511
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,041
- Oh, wow. That's really mean.

512
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,458
- [chuckles]

513
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,791
Well, I do despise you,
remember?

514
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,458
- That may be true,

515
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,125
but I don't hate you
half as much as you hate me.

516
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,125
[chorus vocalizing]

517
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,666
[groans]

518
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,666
[sighs]

519
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,833
Thanks. I appreciate it.

520
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:51,125
[whimpers]

521
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,250
Mother Fortuna...

522
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,583
I'm so sorry.

523
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,583
[crying]

524
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,791
Mother, I...

525
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,250
I'm so sorry!

526
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,041
[crying]

527
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,833
SUBARU:
Sorry to push you like that,

528
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,250
but you told me
a lot more than I expected.

529
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,375
Thank you.

530
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,500
- I've had this fear
for some time

531
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,708
that removing the barrier

532
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,541
would trample
upon the wishes of Ryuzu Meyer,

533
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:30,333
the ancestor to each one of us.

534
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,541
- I get how you feel,

535
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,583
but I have total confidence
in Emilia,

536
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,666
so when she aces the trial
with flying colors

537
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,708
and everything works out
the way that it should,

538
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,000
we'll be able to call
the whole world a Sanctuary.

539
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:45,125
- Then I will leave
these matters to you, Young Su.

540
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,500
- Just take it easy.

541
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,625
Your wish of 400 years
is on me now.

542
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:52,416
- Okay, then. I'd like
to let Shima rest for a while.

543
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,041
Hey, Ram, you think you
can take care of that for me?

544
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,291
- Ah! Old Hag Shi's hideout
would be better

545
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,541
than Old Hag Ryu's place
for a little downtime.

546
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,125
I can go with 'em and make su--

547
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,500
- Whoa, wait a minute,
Garfiel!

548
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,833
I don't think you should be
pushing yourself yet, either.

549
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:07,250
We need to let Miss Ram
and Miss Ryuzu handle this.

550
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,416
- Really?

551
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,041
- Listen, if a brute like you

552
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:12,291
charged at Miss Shima
and interrupted her rest,

553
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,583
then it would defeat
the purpose entirely.

554
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:17,416
- I suppose I should go,
too, as suggested.

555
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,166
- Thank you. I would
appreciate that very much.

556
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,083
I'd feel guilty
leaving Miss Ryuzu

557
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,416
in the care of two men

558
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
who clearly lack
any shred of empathy.

559
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:26,500
- That's right.

560
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,750
Hang on here!
You weren't counting me

561
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,291
as one of those two men,
were--

562
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,625
So then I guess Miss Ram

563
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:35,166
must have sensed
what's likely to happen?

564
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,166
Well, the fact
that she just overlooked--

565
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,541
[sighs] No, wait.

566
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,583
The fact she was willing
to help us at all

567
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,333
meant there was reason
to keep hoping.

568
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,125
- That's enough, you guys.
I can't take it anymore!

569
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,041
Don't just walk around
and talk in code,

570
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,375
ignorin' me like one guy
with ten morgrelo!

571
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,750
- We'd both be stuck
if you left us behind,

572
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,666
and since Ram
is an unknown variable,

573
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,291
I wanted her
out of the group.

574
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,416
- Wait. You what? Hang on.

575
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,083
I don't understand a damn thing
that you're sayin' anymo--

576
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,750
- Okay, listen.
We're on our way

577
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,625
to pay a visit
to Margrave Mathers now.

578
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,541
- Huh?
- And you have two arms,

579
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,666
plus both of us
dragging you down.

580
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,458
That should be enough
to get there, right?

581
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:13,125
- We just need to make it back
before Emilia comes out,

582
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,416
because there's no way
I wanna miss that.

583
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,541
- Well, look who we have here.

584
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:24,250
Never did I expect you
to stop by at a time like this.

585
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,541
What brings you
to my humble abode at this hour?

586
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,500
SUBARU: Look at you.
Greeting us in full makeup, huh?

587
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,833
It's embarrassing when you're
that eager to see us.

588
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:34,791
- You may make such commentary

589
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,541
and pointed judgments
if you wish,

590
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,583
but let me remind you
that you're the one

591
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:41,333
who said the next time we met,
I should be made up again.

592
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,791
- Yeah, you're right.
I guess I did say that.

593
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,333
- But in any event,
my grand attire,

594
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:47,541
along with these cosmetics,

595
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,166
are my way of preparing
for a fight I can't lose.

596
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,708
- I see. So it's literally
your uniform and war paint.

597
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:55,500
- Enough about me, Subaru.

598
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:57,333
Let's get back
to what brings you here.

599
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,541
- Well, I think
you should know by now

600
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,708
that the game board
you set up so carefully

601
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,291
is completely falling apart.

602
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,833
- Yes, indeed I do.

603
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,708
And seeing
who you've brought with you

604
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,708
tells me that the situation
has changed.

605
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:12,541
I must say
they've certainly succeeded

606
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:15,333
in taming you,
haven't they, Garfiel?

607
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,333
- What?!

608
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,583
- Easy, boy.

609
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:20,333
The one who concerns me the most
among you is actually...

610
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,291
- You mean--Is it me?

611
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,333
- From the moment you came
into this room, I wondered,

612
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:29,833
"Just who could
this cloaked lad be, anyway?"

613
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,791
- Damn, Otto! Imagine that!

614
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:32,875
You actually got left out

615
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,541
of the prophecy
foretelling the future!

616
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,208
- That doesn't make me
feel good at all,

617
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:37,333
and it's pretty hard to hide

618
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,291
how shocked I am
that none of this makes sense!

619
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,875
- Clearly somebody like this
is here as a witness

620
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:44,208
to the battle
between Subaru and me.

621
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:47,625
Interesting. His mere presence
must mean that I--

622
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,458
- Now you're getting it.

623
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,750
The first gear's
come out of alignment.

624
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,500
- OTTO: Huh?
- Everything you've been

625
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,250
setting up so very carefully

626
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,541
has been disrupted
by an unknown factor.

627
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,291
That's starting
to change the flow.

628
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,250
All thanks
to my insignificant friend here,

629
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,958
who isn't even mentioned
anywhere in the prophecy.

630
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:06,666
["Believe In You" playing]

631
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,708
- Apologies, but would you
mind
telling me your name again?

632
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,333
- [sighs]

My name is Otto Suwen,

636
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,333
And I feel honored
to have this rare opportunity

637
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,666
to make your acquaintance,
truly.

638
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,666
Even though I'm nothing more

639
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,833
than a humble merchant,

640
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,333
it's my great pleasure.

641
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:29,458
- I shall remember that then,
Otto Suwen.

642
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,791
The next time we meet,
you will not be overlooked.

643
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,625
This, I can assure you.

644
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,541
- Way to go! Good for you, Otto!

645
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:36,666
You left a bigger impression

646
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,708
on Roswaal than ever,

647
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:38,958
like you hoped for!

648
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,916
- This wasn't how I wanted him
to remember me, though!

649
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,333
This whole situation
is just weird!

650
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:44,458
- So thanks to him,

651
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:46,291
you managed to make it
back on your feet

652
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,791
thus finding the spirit
and backbone needed

653
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:49,833
for the last fight.

654
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,958
- That about covers it.

655
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,375
But yeah, you're right, Otto.

656
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,541
It does seem kinda weird.

657
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,916
Shouldn't it be the main heroine

658
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,291
getting me back on my feet

659
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,916
instead of someone like you
playing that role?

660
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,958
Thanks a lot for stepping
in
and messing everything
up.

661
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,291
- Why are you acting like
all of this is my fault?

662
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,958
- I don't know why, either!
- Come on.

663
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,458
I'm just kidding, man. [laughs]

664
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,583
- I will ask you once more.

665
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,458
Why is it you've
come here to see me?

666
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,541
- [gasps]

667
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:18,958
To say you need to surrender.

668
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,625
- [grunts]

669
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,500
- Thanks to Shima,
I know the truth now,

670
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,750
the real reason
behind the Sanctuary,

671
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,708
and it's time for us
to talk about it.
