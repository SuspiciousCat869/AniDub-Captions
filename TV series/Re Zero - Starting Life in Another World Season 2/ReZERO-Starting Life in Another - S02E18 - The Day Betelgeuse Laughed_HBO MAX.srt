1
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:05,375
- Ryuzu Shima,
are you feeling okay?

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:07,333
- [moans]

3
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:10,083
- I believe I have explained
this before, Young Su.

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,625
Our bodies are in
a constant state of depletion,

5
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,083
the same way that the energy
of a spirit's is.

6
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,166
- I know there are
three of you Ryuzus

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,416
that always take turns,

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,416
but since you were removed
from the rotation,

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,708
there hasn't been a replacement.

10
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,625
- [moans]

11
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,541
I am unsure if I will be
able to make myself last

12
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:27,750
until Miss Emilia returns,

13
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:32,125
so I will go ahead
and say what must be said.

14
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,583
- Now hold on. You don't
have to push yourself like that.

15
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,541
The healthy old hag right here
can step in and--

16
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,041
- You're making this
way too confusing.

17
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,166
Just call them
Old Shi and Old Ryu!

18
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,166
Besides, I understand
what you're saying,

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,541
but in this case,
it wouldn't work.

20
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,125
Shima's the only one
who can tell us this.

21
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,750
Yes, that is correct.

22
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,000
Only I, the one
who has entered the graveyard

23
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,583
and attempted the trial,
can truly speak of it.

24
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,166
- Huh?

25
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,125
- The tale you are
about to hear now

26
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,208
concerns the memories
of Ryuzu Meyer,

27
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,125
the ancestor
we copies are derived from.

28
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,708
It involves events
that happened many years ago,

29
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,708
a long time before this place
became known as the Sanctuary.

30
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,666
<i>At the beginning</i>
<i>of this unknown memory,</i>

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,458
<i>there was a young girl</i>
<i>with a lovely face,</i>

32
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,333
<i>with porcelain skin</i>
<i>as white as the snow</i>

33
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,458
<i>and very pale blue eyes.</i>

34
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,500
- [gasps]

35
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,291
- What is it, I suppose?

36
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,750
You can look at me that way
to your heart's content,

37
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,250
but I'm not giving you anything.

38
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,208
- Uh...

39
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,916
- Hmph! Still silent, are we?

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,375
What a boring, cowardly girl
you are, I suppose.

41
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,791
[door opens]

42
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,500
- ECHIDNA: Beatrice...
- [both gasp]

43
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,541
why the negative attitude?

44
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,500
- Miss Echidna.

45
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,375
- What's gotten into you?

46
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,041
Did I teach you
to behave that way?

47
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,500
- Uh, I don't know what you're
going on about, Mother,

48
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,541
'cause I haven't
done anything at all.

49
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,166
It's just...

50
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,750
- this girl was...
- [gasps]

51
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,166
- Ah, I see.

52
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,541
Well, then why don't we listen

53
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,375
to what she has
to say for herself?

54
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,625
- What?

55
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,458
Um, well...

56
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:27,833
I, uh--

57
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,625
I'm sorry about this.

58
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,208
I saw her standing there,

59
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,666
looking so elegant and wistful,
and I was captivated.

60
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:39,333
- Oh, is that so? Interesting.

61
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,625
Well, Beatrice?

62
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,458
You did hear Ryuzu, did you not?

63
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,541
RYUZU: Huh?

64
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,250
- [moans]

65
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,625
- Referring to you as childish
wouldn't be accurate,

66
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,458
since you are a child,

67
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,833
but you've yet
to learn tolerance.

68
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,416
While there's no question
that you're rather special,

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,333
you don't have the right
to look down on others.

70
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,291
- [moans]

71
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,791
- I'm sorry
to have startled you.

72
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,250
This is Beatrice.

73
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,625
I suppose you could say
she's like a daughter to me.

74
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,291
- I'm not just
"like" a daughter to you.

75
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,750
I am your daughter, I suppose!

76
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,416
- Yes, well, there you have it.

77
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
I believe,
from this point forward,

78
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,375
she'll be accompanying me
here quite often.

79
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,250
Please do be kind to her.

80
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,583
- Yes, of course. You can
count on me, Miss Echidna.

81
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,541
- I don't need her.

82
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,208
If it's all the same to you,

83
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm perfectly fine on my own.

84
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,541
SHIMA:<i> And that was it.</i>

85
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,666
<i>That is how the two girls met.</i>

86
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,083
<i>Afterwards,</i>
<i>the witch and her daughter</i>

87
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,958
<i>visited the settlement</i>
<i>occasionally,</i>

88
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,666
<i>just as she said they would.</i>

89
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,958
- [sighs]

90
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,791
- Why are you
just standing there, I suppose?

91
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:51,000
I see that you've remained
your usual dull self.

92
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,625
- Miss Beatrice.

93
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,083
- Mother's busy
having a discussion inside.

94
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,958
- She'll be back
when she finishes,

95
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,791
so hurry up, and put
that irritating laundry

96
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,000
in the basket, I suppose.

97
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,791
- Huh. Of course.

98
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,166
Excuse me.

99
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,000
Um, Miss Beatrice?

100
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,666
- Don't mind me. It's nothing.

101
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
I'm just killing time,
I suppose.

102
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,541
- Eh?

103
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,000
[grunts]

104
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,708
Miss Beatrice...

105
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,500
u-um, I was just curious.

106
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,500
If you don't mind,
I was wondering

107
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,375
if you would help me
fold the laundry.

108
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,791
- Huh?
- [gasps]

109
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,791
Oh.

110
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,166
- If it's too much for you
to handle alone, then fine.

111
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,875
I guess I have no choice but
to lend a hand with the
folding.

112
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,541
- Huh?

113
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,541
- I won't say it again,
I suppose.

114
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,916
Well, get going, then.
Let's go, I suppose.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,541
Hmph! Hmph! Hmph! Hmph! Hmph!

116
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,291
- [panting]

117
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,041
U-Um, if it'd be all right,

118
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,625
as long as you're helping me,

119
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,125
would you carry
a little bit of it?

120
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,583
- Okay, listen.

121
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,041
I'm feeling generous,
but don't go pushing your luck.

122
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,500
Just this much, I suppose.

123
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,416
SHIMA:<i> So during the moments</i>
<i>when the witch</i>

124
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,833
<i>had her own business</i>
<i>to attend to,</i>

125
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,708
<i>the young girl</i>
<i>would find herself</i>

126
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,791
<i>spending more and more</i>
<i>of her time with Ryuzu Meyer.</i>

127
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,083
- You, there. Pardon me.

128
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,916
I do believe Miss Echidna
is here somewhere.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,708
Have you seen her?

130
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,000
- What?

131
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,583
M-Mr. Mathers!

132
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,125
- My family name.

133
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,916
I'm not fond
of being addressed that way.

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,375
So with that in mind,

135
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,333
would you
call me Roswaal instead?

136
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,500
- SUBARU: Hang on a minute!
- [panting]

137
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,625
- Are you saying Beatrice
was in the Sanctuary,

138
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,958
and Roswaal, too?

139
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,916
- More accurately,
the Master Roswaal

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,833
of several generations ago.

141
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,375
But from the sound of it,

142
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,083
Miss Beatrice
hasn't changed that much at all.

143
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,750
- Yeah, yeah, look.

144
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,458
I'm more interested
in the witch.

145
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,416
I mean, sure, I know
this is the facility

146
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,750
where she was doin'
her experiments and everything,

147
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,750
but other than that,

148
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,500
I've never really heard
her story before.

149
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,000
- What? You didn't
run into her even once

150
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,750
when you were
going through the trials?

151
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,750
- The only reason I went in
was to settle a score.

152
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,750
She didn't cross my path.

153
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,833
When you put it like that,
it sounds like maybe...

154
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,166
- So can I assume you have
met the Witch of Greed, Barusu?

155
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,291
- Yeah.

156
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,791
- Huh.

157
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,458
- To one who was not alive
during that time,

158
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,041
I do understand the dilemma,

159
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,083
as the witch may indeed seem
quite out of reach.

160
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,041
Of course,
even my own memories

161
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,791
are actually those of another.

162
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,500
Therefore I do not
know her personally myself.

163
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,875
- Seeing one who looks
identical to me saying that

164
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,958
makes me feel as if I have
gone mad. How frightening.

165
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,875
- Okay, it is now official.

166
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,625
Things are getting
pretty surreal around here.

167
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,166
- Miss Beatrice continues to be
an exceedingly common presence

168
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,916
in the memories of Ryuzu Meyer.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,791
Those two
had quite an interesting

170
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,916
and heartwarming friendship.

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Go ahead,
and finish up the story.

172
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,000
This place seemed
so peaceful on the surface,

173
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,625
so what happened here exactly?

174
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,583
- Eventually it collapsed.

175
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,666
It was then that the true
reason
for the Sanctuary's existence

176
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,791
came along
and made itself known.

177
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,166
- Wait. The true reason for...

178
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,125
the Sanctuary's existence?

179
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,041
- [moans]

Regulus Corneas.

184
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,833
- Sin Archbishop
of the Witch's Cult?

185
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,625
GEUSE: What are you
doing out here?

186
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,000
I've already been given
the assurance that nobody

187
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,791
could ever get involved
with this forest except me.

188
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,500
- "Assurance," huh?

189
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, I think you
completely fabricated that rule

190
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,708
and simply offered it
to yourself.

191
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,666
And now you're trying
to force other people

192
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,291
to go along
with this foolish notion?

193
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,333
I must admit that's pretty cocky
for a worthless spirit.

194
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,375
- If you truly dislike the rule,
then my suggestion would be

195
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,041
that you talk it over
with the church!

196
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,875
I ask again, why are you here?!

197
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,083
- WOMAN: Why?
- [gasps]

198
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,833
- It was something
I ordered him to do.

[Emilia gasps]

201
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,625
- Do you have some sort of issue

202
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,791
with that command,
Bishop Romanée-Conti?

203
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,958
- Wait. No.

204
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,125
What is that woman doing here?!

205
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,083
I want you to answer me!

206
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,000
What is the meaning of this?!

207
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,750
- Hah! Take it easy.

208
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,708
This was entirely her choice.

209
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,791
Why are you blaming everything
on me, anyway?

210
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,208
You got something
against me or what?

211
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,083
- Easy, Bishop Corneas.

212
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,166
It would appear
that he's rather confused.

213
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,916
Do try not to be
so critical of him.

214

- [grunts]

215
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,333
Now bring the key and seal to me

216
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,041
so the Witch's Cult can fulfill
its long-cherished desire.

217
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,583

220
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,958
- Enjoy being skewered!

221
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,041
Apologize to my brother
and his wife!

222

REGULUS: Hey, come on.

224
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,166
You weren't even aiming
anywhere near me,

225
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,583
but you used
a crazy, wide-burst attack

226
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,583
that you knew would hit me, too?

227
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,333
I take such a careless affront
personally.

228
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,333
That's the same
as trampling on my life,

229
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,416
on my existence,
on my authority,

230
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,666
on my humanity itself,
now, isn't it?

please take Miss Emilia,
and leave this place.

236

- Mother, I'm scared.

237
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,833
- Don't worry, dear.

238
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,166
- It's all right.

239
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,416
Have no fear.

240
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,958
I wouldn't remain here
if I didn't have a plan.

Okay, I'll do it.

00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,833
But I'm coming back to help you!

244
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,083
- I swear it!
- No, wait! Geuse!

245
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,666
- Keeping the trial in mind,

246
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,875
I presume you'll be
following yourself, right?

247
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,875
Or will you?

248
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,125
REGULUS: Hey, that was
pretty admirable of you.

249
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,583
A shame, though.

250
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,375
No one gave you permission
to let them get away.

251
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,250
I consider you
acting out on your own

252
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,166
a direct violation
of my actions and authority.

253
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,750
- I don't need your permission.

254
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,083
And even if it means
risking my life,

255
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,208
I will never allow the two
of you to get past this point!

- Eh?

00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,958
Wait. You're not
actually planning on...

258
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,291
- I must confess. I don't have
the knowledge to adapt to this.

259
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,208
For that reason,
I've merely held it

is what it was meant for!

Bishop Regulus Corneas.

00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,666

276
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,166
Prepare yourself.

277
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,958

- I told you, you witch.

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,208
What you're
witnessing now is hope,

281
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,833
a great debt,
an unforgettable one

282
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,458
to the people
who made me what I am.

283
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,333
I won't back down.

284
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,166
So if I'm worthy
of spitting up blood...

285
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,250
- After such a transformation,
I have to ask.

286
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,958
What do you see
with those crimson eyes,

287
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,083
Bishop Romanée-Conti?

288
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,416
Love itself.

289
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,333
You will go no further.

290
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:47,250
You will not pursue them.

291
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,708
I swear you won't
get past me, never!

Wh-What did you do?!

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,416
PANDORA: A splendid show
of your determination,

296
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,583
Bishop Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti.

297
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,000
And in the name
of the Witch of Vanity,

298
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,875
for your resolve and
steadfast force of will,

299
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,166
I grant you the title of Sloth.

300
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,541
- Do you really think
I would want such a title?

301
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:18,250
There's only one thing
I desire right now,

302
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,000
peace for that mother
and her child

303

for the rest of their lives!

304
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,250
- Ah, yes.

305
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,416
Love. How wonderful.

306
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,666
- Keep that word
from your mouth.

307
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,166
Your lies are a warmth
that shouldn't come to pass.

308
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,125
Face me!

00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:40,791
- What is with you?

311
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,500
This is far beyond
even my comprehension.

312
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,125
I showed up, I'm standing here,

313
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,541
and then you're
just going to ignore me?

314
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,875
- What are you thinking?
- How did...

315
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,958
- Regulus Corneas!

316
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,750
- You're really pissing me off.

317
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,458
There's no way you should be
chosen by the Witch Factor,

318
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,125
but you're holding on to it

319
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,291
with no regard
for the payment it requires?

320
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,125
- I don't care what you say!

321
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,625
Now stay away from them!

322

something of great significance

is putting himself through.

Are you actually suggesting
that we leave?

whether or not
sheer force of will

333

could have had
an effect on the outcome.

334

Then what's the harm
in just standing here, watching?

Don't go! Don't leave me behind!

I'll tell the truth from now on!

Tell me,
are the villagers safe, Archi?

- The news isn't good.

370
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,041
Our people are trying
to stand their ground,

371
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,500
but they're all fighting
Bishop Corneas' men.

If we stay in the forest,
they'll find us for sure.

It seems
they've come here to take--

- The seal. That's it, right?

Fine, then.
I'll be right there.

- I beg you,
let the rest of us fight.

You need to take Emilia and
leave the forest immediately!

00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:35,875
- And what would happen
if I were to go now?

00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,875
If they manage to get
their hands on the seal,

will come to an end this time!

sorry you went through all this
just trying to protect us.

387
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,750
- Please don't say that!

388
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,500
Who would show such disdain
for a family member?

389
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,708
- Do forgive me.

390
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,583
Listen.
I need to go back for a bit.

391
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,583
I have an important duty
to fulfill

392
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,833
by protecting
the people of the forest,

393
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,250
and that means
I'll need to leave you

394
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,875
- for a little while, all right?
- No, please!

You can't! I don't want you to!
Please don't go!

00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,333
- Emilia, now do as I say.

397
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,250
I want you to leave
this forest with Archi.

398
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,333
- Understand?

399
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,916
Miss Fortuna, I...

- There must be a--

401
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,375
it's a bit early,

402
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,583
but I'm entrusting you

403
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,625
with the mission
of the forest dwellers.

404
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,375
Please take Emilia
away from here.

405
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,291
This world
isn't easy to live in,

406
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,458
but I know there's hope.

407
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,583
I'm sure of it.

408
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,708
- But I can't do that!

409
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,458
I must stay
with everyone until--

410
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,666
- Take Emilia.

411
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,625
I beg you.

412
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,791
She's the daughter
of my brother and his wife,

413
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,750
but she's my daughter as well.

414
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,708
- It's not fair.

415
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,458
When you put it that way,

416
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,625
you know it's impossible
for me to refuse you.

417
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,458
- I apologize.

418
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,291
We're unfair,
but please forgive us.

419
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,625
- Emilia--

420
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,291
- No, you're not
leaving me behind!

421
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,458
I wanna stay with you!

422
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,750
I promise I'll be good
and I won't be in the way!

423
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,500
Just don't leave me!

424
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,833
I don't wanna be alone!

425
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,208

You'll never be alone.

426
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,458
- Listen, sweetheart.

427
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,333
I will always
be right here with you

428
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,208
in the memories that come forth

and picture me...

00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,333
where you hug yourself
and feel warm,

432

in the echoes you hear
when you shout into the sky.

433
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,291
I'll be with you
every step of the way,

00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,250
forever and ever, my little one.

everything turn out this way?

00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,750
Was it because I broke
my promise and left my room?

- No! None of this
is your fault at all!

No one is to blame for this!

- Then if that's true,

00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,041
why do we both
have to leave the forest?

Would it be better if I'd
stayed
locked up in my room forever?

Maybe then,
no one would have to go,

Is that why everybody hates me

and why I just end up alone?

farther from the truth!

Over there.

489
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,750
Do you see those white flowers
right between the two trees?

490
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:26,666
- Uh-huh.

- Could you head
toward those flowers for me?

492

I'd like you
to run through them

493
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,708
and then just keep going.

494

- Okay, I'll run.

495
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,000
I can, but...

- No, don't worry. I'll be fine,

Don't look back,

your determination

for your overall weakness.

Believe me, I'm not doing this

because I'm a sadist

It only looks
like I'm tormenting you,

How dare you
come back here and--

keep you from dying.

I couldn't endure such a long

I suppose I'm weak that way.

go?!
