EMILIA: Tell me,
why are you crying?

00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:24,083
- Because I just
left you all alone.

8
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,625
- I don't understand.
What do you mean?

9
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,416
- Because I--

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,083
I couldn't--

11
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,083
I couldn't find you
all this time.

12

You don't think those words

If so,
then you're quite foolish.

- [sighs] I was
genuinely worried about you.

- I need none of your concern
whatsoever.

35
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,250
There were a few too many dreams
happening at once. That's all.

to be merely
a figurative expression.

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,125
More accurately,
it's a separate world

42

and reflecting the consciousness

43

of those who choose
to undergo the trial.

44
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,791

I appreciate the explanation,

any ridiculous ideas

about me actually being
a nice person or anything.

48
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,208
It's simply my nature

49
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,458
to answer any questions
that are asked of me.

50
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,166
I understand.

51
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,208
- Do you remember the pathetic
struggle you endured

52
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,708
the last time
you attempted the trial?

53
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,375
- I was so helpless then.

54
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,208
I can't even argue
with your description of it.

55
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,583
I guess
I covered up my memories

56
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,208
because I didn't want
to see them.

57
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:38,708
Maybe that's why I can't even
recall one of them on my own.

Everything's just so fuzzy.

Even now,
I'm still not prepared.

00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,458
- Then it would be no surprise
if you failed again, right?

61
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,416
Making an excuse before you
even start is awfully defeatist.

62
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,250
- No, it's not that.

63
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,000
I've thought of a way to use
this place to ready myself.

you desperately wanted

to keep locked up inside it.

68
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,416

I was often sent here to play
back when I was little.

Oh, right.
I can't touch the door.

something important again?

with their responsibilities
to make time for me,

FORTUNA: I want to thank you.

00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,583
You've done so much for us
time and time again.

123
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,041
- That isn't necessary.
I know we've brought you

124
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,000
more than your share
of inconveniences.

125

be said for us, Geuse.

- Also...

I know that I ask this
every time we meet,

but does the seal remain intact?

129
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,666
- Yes, don't worry.
There have been no changes.

130
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,000
And it needs to stay that way.

131
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,541
If the worst were to happen,

132
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,958
I could never face
my brother and sister.

- Your brother and his wife,
you mean?

134
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,291
- It's all right.
I'm aware of that.

135
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,166
But no matter the circumstances,
I mustn't forget

136
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,666
the responsibility
I've been tasked to carry.

137
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,041
I don't want to abandon it
or see it partway.

Don't you feel the same?

139
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,958
- Well, actually...

140
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:45,958
[sighs] to be completely
honest with you,

141
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,458
I don't have anything else.

142
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,416
So I suppose it's a different

143
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,958
sense of responsibility
from yours.

00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,708

the seasons don't change
very much in the forest,

things like clothing and
books.

We truly appreciate it.

with forcing all of you

00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,083
to live in such
an inconvenient place like this.

"a place like this."

have been transferred.

- Thank you, Archi.
I appreciate it.

161
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,708
- I can see you're only growing

162
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,333
more and more dependable,
aren't you?

163

of forest dwellers,

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,583
I know I can't be regarded
as a novice forever.

165
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,750
- I pray that your good health
will persevere,

166
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,583
for the forest and the seal,

167
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,958
for your family, and of course
for yourself as well.

168
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,708
Oh, yes,

169
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,083
I almost forgot to ask you.

170
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:05,083
About Miss Emilia,
does she remain in good health?

171
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,041
- [gasps]

172
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,250
- No need to worry.

173
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,208
She's growing into
a very kindhearted

174
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,041
and healthy young lady.

175
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,708
But I apologize.

176
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,750
I still can't allow her
to meet you.

177
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,750
- It's all right.

178
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,541
As long as I know
Miss Emilia's growing up safe

179
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,125
and in good health,
then that'll be enough.

180
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,875
A sinner such as myself

181
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,750
wouldn't ever dare to ask
for anything more than
that.

182
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,250
- Bishop Romanée-Conti...
- [gasps]

183
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,708
- are you ready?

184
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,125
- Yes. I'm all finished here.

185
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,125
It's time for us transgressors
to be on our way.

186
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,625
Miss Fortuna,
until next time then.

187
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,375
- Even if no one else here
will say it,

188
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,208
please know that we're
extremely grateful to you,

189
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,125
and I truly mean that.

190
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,083
- That's kind of you to say.

191
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,416
Your words of praise alone

192
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
would surely carry me through
a hundred years of turmoil.

193
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,958
[wind blowing]

194
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,416
- [sighs]

195
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,583
- Miss Fortuna,
are you feeling tired or--

196
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,750
- Of course not! Don't treat me
like such an old lady.

197
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,208
I know I may seem elderly

198
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,166
compared to
a young boy like you,

199
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,791
but I'm still in good shape.

200
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,208
- Th--No, that wasn't
what I meant at all!

201
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,125
I just thought
this must be hard

202
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,833
when you also have
the forest dweller duties.

203
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,791
- Then maybe I'll take advantage
of your kindness

204
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,291
and let you handle
the rest of them.

205
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,166
Right now I need to go
and free a little princess

206
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,166
who must be getting
pretty bored.

207
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,083
- [gasps]

208
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,291
What do I do? What do I do?

209
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,958
What do I do?
What do I do?

210
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,000
What do--[yelps]

211
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,125
What do I do? What do--

212
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,791
What do I do? What do I do?

213
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,208
[gasps] Oh, no.

214
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,708
What do I do? What do I do?

215
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,333
[gasps]

216
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,208
[energy surges]

217
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,750
Wow.

218
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,916
- Emilia, are you awake?

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,833
- Uh, y-yes, I'm awake!

220
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,916
But...[sighs]

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,333
- But what?

222
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,000
- Why are you so flustered?
- [glass clatters]

223
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,000
[gasps]

224
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,958
- Um, I-I'm sorry.

225
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,833
I wanted to draw, but I
spilled the ink everywhere.

226
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,166
- Ah, dear.

227
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,291
Mother Fortuna, I-I'm sorry.

228
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,958
Honestly, you worry
about things too much.

229
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,083
You don't need to be so afraid.

230
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,833
I'm not angry, okay?

231
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,458
You didn't hurt yourself,
did you?

232
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,083
[cloth flutters]

233
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,208
- What's wrong?

234
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,750
- Nothing. It's nothing.

235
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,500
I just really missed you today.
That's all.

236
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,708
- Uh...

237
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,708
- You spoiled girl.

238
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,833
Hey. Wanna know something?

239
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:49,833
- Hmm?

240
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,291
- I love you.

241
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,916
ECHIDNA: Perhaps the sights you
locked deep within your heart

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,125
have begun to overlap,

243
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,125
intertwining with scenes
from your memories a bit.

244
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,583
- I'm shocked.

245
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,833
I thought you'd have
some stinging comments ready,

246
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,250
mean and petty things
to say about Mother and me.

247
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,541
- Even if that's
what you thought I would do,

248
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,833
I wouldn't recommend
putting that out in the open

249
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:14,750
and saying so.

250
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,958
My opinion of you
is already low enough.

251
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,375
And with these
petty accusations,

252
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,416
you're making it
plummet even further.

253
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,041
- Oh, no need to worry.
I hadn't planned

254
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,083
on telling anyone about this
to begin with.

255
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,416
- For better or for worse,

256
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,791
it seems the influence
that boy's had over you

257
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:31,208
has grown rather strong.

258
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,291
- You think so?

259
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,916
Thanks for telling me.

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
- [sighs]

261
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,083
Anyway,
back to the task at hand.

262
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,291
You've recalled your mother,

263
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,375
some people you knew,
and that so-called fairy.

264
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,916
Are you ready
to face your past now?

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,416
- No, not yet.

266
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,000
- [gasps]

267
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,416
- There are still some
important memories I'm missing.

268
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,958
- What more could there be?

269
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:57,875
- There's the seal.

270
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,333
- Little fairy, let's get going.

271
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,958
We're escaping again today.

272
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,458
[gasps]

273
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,916
- Hello? Emilia?
- [yelps]

274
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,125
- Hmm? Is something the matter?

275
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,125
- Nope! I'm just fine.

276
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,416
What was it you needed, Archi?

277
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,208
- Well, first thing's first.

278
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,666
I thought I'd bring
some snacks over for you.

279
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,208
Now eat these up,
and be a good girl, all right?

280
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,791
- Okay. Thanks.

281
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,375
Archi's been
such a worrywart lately,

282
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,625
so I need to be extra careful.

283
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,625
[yelps]

284
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,833
[grunts]

285
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,833
Geuse's group
is here again today.

286
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,875
I thought
whatever they were hiding

287
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,333
would be something fun.

288
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,458
Mother and the others
are really weird.

289
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,250
FORTUNA: I have to say

290
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,000
Emilia's been
so full of energy lately.

291
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,416
She's always coming home
with her clothes all muddy.

292
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,666
- [laughs] That she's so lively
can only be a good thing.

293
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,500
I'll bring some new clothes
for her soon.

294
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,500
- You've already done so much.

295
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,833
I'm sorry to be asking
for even more.

296
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,500
But do you have
adult clothes, too?

297
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,166
- Yes, of course we do.

298
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,833
So why not take a look?

299
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,958
I'm sure we have
something
that would be lovely on
you.

300
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,000
- [gasps] Hold on.

301
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,833
We may have known
each other a long time,

302
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,375
but there's no need
to embarrass me

303
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,125
- with comments like that!
- [grunts]

304
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,625
I only spoke
what I felt to be the truth.

305
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,208
Was there something strange
about how I said it?

306
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,958
- [sighs]

307
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,125
- Uh...

308
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,125
eh?

309
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:27,833
- [gasps]

310
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,291
Hey, uh, what are you doing?

311
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,041
- Oh, I-I was just
remembering something.

312
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,166
There was once a time

313
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,083
when you seemed unhappy
while talking to me,

314
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,541
and it turned out
you had a rather high fever.

315
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,083
You're not warm now, though.

316
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,416
- Come on.
You're just being silly.

317
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,083
That was decades ago.

318
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,416
Stop treating me like a child!

319
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,291
You're so ridiculous.

320
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,041

00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:51,750

Oh, yeah!
And stupid Archi, too!

GEUSE: Tell me,

326
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,291
does the seal
still remain in place?

327
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,041
- Just as always, yes.

328
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:04,833
It's very conscientious of you

329
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,416
to check on it
each time you're here.

330
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,583
- That is my duty after all.

331
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,583
The state of affairs
outside the forest

332
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,375
is dubious at the moment.

333
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,041
Perhaps my concern is baseless,
but I wanted you to be aware.

334
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,958
- Of course.

335
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,416
- Please continue
being diligent

336
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,958
for Miss Emilia
and for the two of them as well.

337
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,333
- Wait. What seal?

338
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,166
Huh?

Yes, please. [giggles]

ECHIDNA: A door?

344
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,625
Strange to see one out here.

345
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,541
EMILIA: This is the seal.

346
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,666
And its very existence
is the reason.

347
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,083
- So you found the answer,
did you?

348
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,125
- This is what they've
been talking about?

349
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,375
- Some other guy saw my letter

350
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,166
to the girl who I'm
in love with before she did.

[whimpers]

352
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,000
My life is over.

353
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,083
- Aw, come on. You're way
too damn depressed about this.

354
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,333
Gotta try and get ahold
of yourself, man.

355
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,333
- I never imagined
that Garfiel would be there

356
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,583
in the shadows
waiting to settle the score.

357
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,333
- Look, you're always
hitting on her

358
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,666
in front of other people,
anyway.

359
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,500
So why get
so embarrassed about it

360
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,500
just because you put it
in writing this time?

361
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,458
- Normally I'm prepared for
her
to brush off stuff like this.

362
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,125
Since that's
what always happens,

363
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,333
I've gotten used to it!

364
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,250
But I was going for broke
and being serious for once!

365
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,500
And it was literally
a late-night love letter,

366
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,208
the most embarrassing kind!

367
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,666
- Hey, don't beat yourself up
about it, boss.

368
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,416
If anything, it made me wish

369
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,375
that I could sponge off
of your good luck.

Am I right?

372
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,166
- I know you wanna
make me feel better,

373
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,000
but no matter what you say,
it still sounds

374
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,125
like you're just trying
to pick a fight with me!

375

[Subaru groans] It took Garfiel

376
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,375
about an hour for the trial
when he went in,

377
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,375
so I guess
it'll take her about the same.

378
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,375

completes it, that is.

00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,708
- You're this oblivious, and
you call yourself a merchant?

383
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,250
- Comments like that
hurt a lot more

384
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,416
- than a flick to the forehead.
- Anyway...

385
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Miss Shima would like to have
a word with you, Barusu.

386
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,000
She wants to continue
the discussion from last night.

387
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,833
- What did Gran--Uh, I mean,
what did the old hag

388
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,625
wanna talk to you about
for so long, boss?

389
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,625
- There's no point in trying
to cover it up now,

390
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,375
because we all know
you're a granny's boy.

391
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,666
Mostly, she told me
what happened

392
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,250
when you went
into the graveyard.

- Oh, really?

00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,458
- I had my hands full yesterday

figuring out
how to deal with Garfiel.

396
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,041
And even though
most things were sorted out,

397
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,500
we still put off
the most important part.

This whole thing
is Mother Fortuna's fault,

and it's Geuse's fault, too.

Okay, time to go home.

I'll paint the sky red

Of course.

Yes, I couldn't be better.

Nothing is wrong
in the slightest.

Do you want to know why?

Because I--[cries]

Because I've just...

If you've been saved,

450
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,333
then why are you crying?

451
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,916
- It's quite simple.

452
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,458
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

453
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,375
I'm so happy,

454
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,250
and I feel elated.

455
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,500
I'm truly blessed.

It's all right, Geuse. Easy.

460
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,416
It's all right.

461
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,000
It's all right.

It's still hard.

Not too long ago,

466
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,666
I wouldn't have been able
to accept this.

467
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,416
But now it's different.

468
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,750
I may be scared,

469
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,791
but I won't shy away in fear.

470

- You're opting to abandon

471
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,458
depending on a man
or father figure,

472
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,291
even though it's so typical
of a filthy woman like you?

473
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:42,958
- I'm sure
Subaru would forgive me

474
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,666
if I were to make that choice,

475
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,208
but I'd still be weak,

476
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,208
and that's something
I don't want to just shrug off.

477
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,000
Besides, I don't want
all those encouraging things

478
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,791
he wrote for me
to end up being wrong.

479
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,166
He really believes in me,

480
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,833
and that's why
I can't allow myself

481
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,625
to be embarrassed
by his feelings.

482
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,750
- Do what you believe
to be right.

483
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,250
Regardless of your path,

484
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,500
I will simply find satisfaction
in your suffering.

485
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,541
- So everything is ready now?

486
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,166
- That's correct,
and the warm-up round is over.

487
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,500
The trial that broke you once
is beginning for real.

488
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,458
Get ready.

489
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,291
GEUSE: Please wait, Miss Emilia!

490
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,750
It's dangerous
to run around like that!

491
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,833
- That's a big no!

492
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,625
Come on! Just try to catch me!

493
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,958
- [panting]

494
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,541
- She's pretty mischievous,
isn't she?

495
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,291
At times, even we
can barely handle her.

496
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,750
- It's good to be young
and full of such energy.

497
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,375
But I-I just wish

498
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,458
she would avoid
doing anything too dangerous.

499
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,958
If she could jump around
in her home,

500
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,375
healthy and bathed in sunlight,

501
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,041
with no concerns
about hurting herself

502
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,041
or breaking things--

503
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:52,875
- Geuse.
- Huh?

504
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,833
- Come on.
That wouldn't exactly be easy.

505
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,416
- [stammers]

506
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,916
You--You don't think so?

507
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,666
Well, for Miss Emilia's sake,

508
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,708
I only wish
there was some way to--

509
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,000
Some way to just--

510
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,500
- [laughs]

511
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,833
- EMILIA: Hey!
- [gasps]

512
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,666
- What's gotten
into you, anyway?

513
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,750
Why aren't either one
of you chasing me?

514
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,541
Aren't we still in the middle
of playing a game?

515
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,041
- Ah, I'm so sorry. Forgive me!

516
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,791
Never before have I made
such a terrible mistake!

517
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,041
Now, there's no need
to spoil her like that.

518
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,541
Emilia, come over here, please.

519
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,083
- Okay, Mother. Be right there.

520
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,416
[sighs]

521
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,000
Honestly, you are so spoiled.

522
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,125
Eep!

523
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,750
- Right into my trap.

524
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,625
It looks like
you've been captured,

525
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,750
which means I've
officially won the game.

526
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,916
- Aw, come on. No fair!
That's cheating!

527
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,916
You're playing dirty!
Say you're sorry!

528
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,750
- My goodness!

529
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,958
You're definitely a handful,
little girl.

530
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,625
Now let me ask you something.

531
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,083
Have you put
the least bit of thought

532
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,875
into what I said to you earlier?

533
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,583
Tell me,
why exactly do you think

534
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,708
Geuse and I were chasing you?

535
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,583
- Uh...

536
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,791
I-I can explain.

537
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,041
The fairies said
we should go outside and play,

538
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,791
so, I, uh...

539
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,708
- Seriously, Emilia,

540
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,708
you shouldn't blame things
on other people,

541
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,000
fairies or otherwise.

542
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,083
- [moans]

543
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,833
You're right. I'm sorry.

544
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,166
Since I made friends
with Geuse while I was out,

545
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,958
I only wanted to find a way
to tell you about it.

546
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,541
And since he's a crybaby,

547
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,916
I felt like I had to do
my part to help him.

548
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,875
- Now, that feeling is
something very special.

549
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,125
However, you made
a solemn oath to me

550
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,625
that you'd never go
to that place, didn't you?

551
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,125
- Eh, yes, I did.

552
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:29,958
- Well, then, you needed
to keep your word.

553
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,125
- [moans]

554
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,583
- Listen carefully.

555
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,875
A promise
is the embodiment of trust,

556
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,791
and to break it
is to betray that trust,

557
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,875
so you mustn't ever do it again.

558
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,416
You have to promise me, Emilia.

559
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,833
I want you to swear
that you'll do your best

560
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,000
to keep your vows
from this moment on.

561
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:51,000
- All right. I will.

562
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:51,791
[crying]

563
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:56,166
I'm really,
really sorry, Mother.

564
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,166
- Okay.

565
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,000
That's good enough for me.

566
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,750
- [crying]

567
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,833
[Geuse crying]

568
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,500
- And what about you, Geuse?

569
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,500
Are you all right?

570
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,708
- I-I'm sorry.

571
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,000
I-It was just
such a dazzling sight.

572
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,583
I couldn't--
I couldn't hold back my tears.

573
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,541
- [laughs]

574
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,500
- Uh...

575
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,666
- Anyway, Emilia.
- Eh?

576
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,958
- You mentioned
that fairies talked to you?

577
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,333
- Oh. Uh, yes, they do,

578
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,916
and they've been coming to
help me out for a long time now.

579
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,750
- Wanna see?
- Huh?

580
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,375
[gasps] Are these
lesser spirits?

581
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,958
I can't believe
how many there are!

582
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,833
- A wonderful surprise, indeed.

583
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,791
Miss Emilia possesses
the natural talent

584
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,083
to be a spirit user.

585
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,875
- Lesser spirits?

586
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,083
And what do you mean
by "spirit user"?

587
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,041
- The things
you've been calling fairies

588
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,208
are actually beings
known as lesser spirits.

589
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,958
Those who communicate with them,
form contracts with them,

590
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,041
and borrow their powers
are known as spirit users.

591
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,750
- You mean
I can be one of them?

592
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,958
- Hold on.

593
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,041
Please don't give her
any crazy ideas.

594
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,625
- I must point out
that Miss Emilia

595
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,250
won't be a little girl forever.
Knowing that,

596
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,583
at times in the future
when nobody's by her side,

597
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:15,583
they'll be a great source
of strength for her.

598
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:19,250
- Maybe, but that sounds
like it could be dangerous.

599
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,583
I can't let my sweet Emilia--

600
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,000
- Eh?

601
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,791
- Listen!
I'm on Geuse's side today!

602
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,250
He says I'm gonna be
a spirit user. So there!

603
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,250
- Nyah!
- You see?

604
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,250
She's taken you seriously.

605
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,958
So what are you going to do now?

606
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,625
- Oh, uh, well, I--

607
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,250
uh, I don't know.

608
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,916
I, uh...

609
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,333
What a predicament.

610
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:40,958
- Hmm?

611
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,125
You know, the way
that you two are carrying on,

612
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:44,916
you're acting like
a mommy and daddy.

613
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,875
- Wha--

614
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,125
D-Don't say
silly things like that!

615
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,375
Geuse and I have known
each other for a long time,

616
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,250
- that's all!
- Yes, that's right,

617
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,708
- Miss Emilia!
- That's why we speak--

618
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,500
- To one who's lived
as long as I have,

619
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,291
even Miss Fortuna
is little more than a child.

620
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,500
- [groans] Now I think that
may be going a bit too far.

621
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,000
I'll admit you are older,
but do you even know my age?

622
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,791
- No! Wait! I didn't mean to--

623
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,625
Just poor phrasing! I'm sorry!

624
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:10,125
Of course I'm quite aware
of your precise age,

625
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,625
and you are
certainly far too beautiful

626
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,000
and too mature
to be a mere child.

627
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,125
- Mm-hmm.

628
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,958
Very well, then.
I'll forgive you.

629
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:20,958
- [gasps]

630
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,875
- But look,

631
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:23,875
you'd better be really sorry.

632
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,750
- Uh, of course.

633
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,666
What I was trying to say,
though poorly,

634
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,750
is that I've known Miss Fortuna
for a long, long time,

635
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,291
more years
than you could imagine.

636
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,583
In fact, I've known her

637
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,125
since the days
when your mother and father--

638
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:37,833
- [gasps] Geuse!
- [gasps]

639
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:41,833
Oh! Forgive me.

640
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:43,083
- But what about
my mother and father?

641
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,875
["Believe in you" playing]

642
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,791
- I'm sorry, Emilia.

643
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:50,625
- Huh?

644
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:53,291
- We'll talk about that
another time.

645
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,791
Go on back to your room now.

646
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,791
- Hope you don't forget.

647
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:02,333
I'm gonna hold you
to that, okay? [groans]

648
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:03,708
[exhales]

649
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,125
- Come on. Be a good girl.

650
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,041
I know you can do that.

651
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,083
And if you're extra, extra good,

652
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:11,041
I'll let you see Geuse again
soon, too, all right?

653
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:11,666
- You really mean it?

654
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,125
You'll make a solemn vow,

655
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,416
and you won't break it?

656
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,291
- [chuckles]

657
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,625
- [gasps]

658
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:26,333
- Yes. You have my word.

659
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:30,041
It'll be a very important
promise, okay,

660
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,958
an oath sworn between us both.

661
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,000
- [grunts]
That's good enough for me.

662
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,625
Thank you.
I'll go back to my room now.

663
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,708
- Uh...

664
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,791
- I'll see you soon, Geuse.

665
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,541
Just be sure not to cry
too much, all right?

666
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,791
Make it a promise
until we both meet again.

667
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,875
- As you wish.

668
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:54,833
Because I'm certain

669
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:56,333
we'll meet again soon as well.

670
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:58,416
[singing in Japanese]

671
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,333
- There's someone
approaching now.

672
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,500
- Oh? [gasps]

673
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:10,541
[song ends]

674
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,791
- [both gasp]
- GEUSE: Huh?

675
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,166
[ominous music playing]

676
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,166
- Huh?

677
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,333
- Who are you?

678
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,458
- I do believe when you
want to know someone's name,

679
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:34,416
it's considered common courtesy

680
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,291
to give your own first,
is it not?

681
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:39,291
We've never seen one another
before, now, have we?

682
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,458
Therefore, I feel
we should be on equal footing

683
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:44,125
as far as building
a relationship goes.

684
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,708
What gives you the right to
demand my name ahead of yours?

685
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,333
You think you're
so much better than I am?

686
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,791
- I think I've heard enough.

687
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,125
For a man, you sure like
talking a lot, don't you?

688
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,333
- Oh, "for a man," you say?

689
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:55,416
Thanks for showing me
you don't even know any men

690
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,250
you could possibly
compare me to.

691
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,000
My, what an attitude.

692
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,041
I can't just
let that slide, you know.

693
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:03,333
Doing so would mean
disrespecting my individuality,

694
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,916
my authority, and my--

695
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,041
- I said enough!

696
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,041
Stop talking like you're
in love with yourself,

697
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,458
and tell me who you are!

698
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,916
[dramatic music playing]

699
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:19,541
- [chuckles]

700
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:23,500
I'm the Sin Archbishop
of the Witch's Cult,

701
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,333
representing Greed,

702
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:27,333
Regulus Corneas.
