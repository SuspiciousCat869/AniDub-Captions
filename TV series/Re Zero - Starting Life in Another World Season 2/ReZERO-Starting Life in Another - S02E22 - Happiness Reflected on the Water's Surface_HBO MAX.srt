You're simply wonderful.

the boss is countin' on you

to do your part, too,

BEATRICE: Why are you here?

out of here, Beatrice.

00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,833
But this time, things are
gonna be different than before,

44
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,041
'cause I intend to drag you out.

We're heading into the sunlight
to play in the mud

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,833
until that dress of yours
is covered in it.

47
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:18,708
- You're what?
Getting me out of here?

48
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,416
Mind your own business,
I suppose.

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,208
No one asked for you to do
such a thing in the first place.

50
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,791
- We don't have time
to argue about this, all right?

51
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,541
'Cause in case
you haven't noticed,

52
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,791
things are
gettin' bad out there.

53
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,375
- Do you mean the intruder?

54
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,208
I'm aware, I suppose.

55
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,125
But this is a great spirit's
forbidden library.

56
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,083
No matter
what threats exist outside--

57
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,208
- No, you're wrong.
I know that Door Crossing

58
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,541
only works on closed doors,
and she does, too.

59
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,625
- Now, how does the enemy

60
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,708
know that particular weakness,
I suppose?

61

- [murmurs]

62
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,916
- Because Roswaal told her,
didn't he?

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,666
- [gasps]

64
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,875
- So that's how it is, huh?

65
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,125
Then this means
my demise was written

66
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,333
in Roswaal's Tome of Wisdom,
I suppose.

67
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,791
[sighs]

68
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,166
- H-Hold on.

69
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,291
Why do you have
that look on your face?

70
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,291
I accept that my fate's
already set in stone.

71
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,416
- Seriously?
Does that book of yours

72
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,625
say you have to let
that psycho kill you?!

73
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,916
- It doesn't say anything,
I suppose.

74
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,250
My destiny's blank,
just as it's always been.

75
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,833
- Then this
"already set in stone" crap

76
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,166
doesn't make sense!

77
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,833
Why let yourself end up
the way Roswaal wants?!

78
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,583
Come on. Why don't you decide
for yourself what you wanna do

79
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,833
the same way
that you always have before?

80
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,375
- Decide for myself?

81
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,791
I'm not sure what you mean,
since I can't ever remember

82
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,541
a time when I've
actually done that.

83
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,375
I've continued
to obey Mother's orders

84
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,208
throughout my stay here
at this mansion all alone.

85
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,291
What part of this
did I get to choose?

86
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,625
What has this Beatrice done?

87
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,583
Who is she?

88
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,875
- Uh, Beatrice, I...

89
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,166
- My life is pure white,
I suppose.

90
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,791
It's completely blank,
well and truly.

91
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,416
This one book
was really all that I needed.

92
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,666
After all, I do have a soul.

93
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,291
As time passes,
I think about so many things.

94
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,791
I worry and cease to believe,
I suppose.

95
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,250
There were moments

96
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,333
when I couldn't remember
Mother's smile,

97
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,083
so I scraped
all my memories together

98
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,958
and did whatever I could
to try and cling to them.

99
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,000
Sometimes I was afraid!

100
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,000
I was scared to be alone
and longed for companionship!

101
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,833
But everyone--
everyone just leaves me behind,

102
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,833
Mother and Roswaal...

103
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,541
and Ryuzu also!

104
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,291
- [gasps]

105
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,500
- The spirit Beatrice
is fated to be alone,

106
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:49,041
meant to be left behind
by everybody else forever.

107
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,041
- But...
- [gasps]

108
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:55,958
- I do feel a tiny bit
relieved now, I suppose.

109
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,833
If it's true
that I was mentioned

110
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,375
in the Tome of Wisdom,

111
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,541
then I feel relieved,

112
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,916
'cause that's definitive proof

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,875
Mother didn't forget
about me after all.

114
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,083
- [gasps]

115
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,041
- Give me a break.

116
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,041
- Huh?

117
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,000
Listen to yourself.

118
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,916
You're such a fool.
You know that?

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,625
This is pathetic!
I can't stand it anymore!

120
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,041
- [stammers]
- You've had 400 years!

121
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,625
Why is something so extreme

122
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,041
the only answer
you could come up with?!

123
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,750
Haven't you ever even once
considered the possibility

124
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,208
that your mother gave you
the wrong book by mistake?!

125
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,708
- You would dare insult Mother,
I suppose?!

126
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,041
She would never make
such an idiotic blunder!

127
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,125
- Oh, yeah? What makes you
so sure about that?

128
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,083
With all her powers
and infinite wisdom,

129
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,875
you actually believe she
gave you a book about the future

130
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,083
that was completely blank?

131
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,416
- That's not--

132
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,916
Must you put it that way?
What exactly is it

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that you're trying
to get me to say, I suppose?

134
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,458
- Okay, I'll come
right out with it then,

135
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,541
and I hope your stupid mother
can hear it, too.

136
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,750
Don't let something
like a blank book

137
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,416
and a 400-year-old promise
rule your life forever,

138
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,791
because you're better than that.

139
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,583
You can choose what you want
to do for yourself, Beatrice.

140
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,666
You know you can!

141
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,291
- [sighs]

142
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,708
- 400 years? After that long,

143
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,333
I'd say you've
more than earned the right

144
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,666
to have at least one
rebellious phase by now.

145
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,500
No matter what you tell me,
I'm still under a contract,

146
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,125
and it cannot be changed,
which means that--

147
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,291
- Pretty strange hearing this

148
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,958
from the one who tried
to find a back door out of it,

149
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,833
then wanted to die
when they couldn't.

150
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:23,791
If keeping a promise

151
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,250
means that you have to stop
living altogether,

152
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,666
then I'd rather break it
and keep you alive!

153
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,875
Is it so weird
that I'd make that choice

154
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,083
and try to save you?!

155
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,833
- Th-That's a very defiant

156
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,791
and selfish way to think,
I suppose.

157
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,458
- You're absolutely right.

158
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,750
It is defiant,
and it is selfish.

159
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,083
But...

160
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,500
I won't compromise
on something important to me.

161
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,333

You've gotta be kidding me.

Mr. Otto.

You didn't even put me

I brought her along with me,

If we're really friends,

Well? Shall we go, then?

325
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:58,958
What is it?

326
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,375
- Well, I-I do hope

327
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,583
it doesn't offend you
to say this, but--

328
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,500
- How long
have we known each other?

329
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,541
I assure you,
there's nothing you can say

330
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,875
that would offend me, all right?

331
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,625
- Well, then, Miss Fortuna,

332
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,500
I think that outfit you're
wearing looks so lovely on you,

333
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:18,083
and if I'm being honest,
I find myself captivated by it.

334
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,500

GEUSE: I don't understand.

338
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,916
Was that rude?

339
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,500
EMILIA: Oh, no, not at all.

340
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,250
She just feels embarrassed.

341
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,916
Mother's so cute, isn't she?

342
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,291
- You can't just blurt out
anything you want!

343
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,375
Pretty mean-spirited
if you ask me!

344
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,458
- Ah! Miss Fortuna!

345
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,583
- And Emilia and Geuse
are with you, I see.

346
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,125
- You three are such
a close-knit family, aren't you?

347
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,083
- We're not--

348
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,458
- You're loved dearly
by so many.

349
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,500
- [whimpers]

350
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,375
Well, I guess that's true.

351
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,625
- [laughs]

352
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,208
GEUSE: Huh?

353
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,125
[Fortuna sighs]

[all laugh]

358

GEUSE: Isn't this nice?
[chuckles]

359
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,083
- Eh? Come on now, Lia.

360
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,125
There's more to being grown-up
than height, you know.

361
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,416
- [giggles]

362
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,458
- It would appear
that the two of you

363
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,500
are just as close as ever.

364
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,125
Simply watching you both
is so heartwarming.

365
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,958
- Why don't you join us, Geuse?

366
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,333
The three of us
could live together!

367
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,333
- [coughs]
- Uh...

368
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,125
- Emilia, you...

369
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,083
- Are you feeling all right?
- [gasps]

370
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,541
- Thank you for the offer,
Miss Emilia.

371
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,333
It's very kind.

372
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,291
And I wish
from the bottom of my heart

373
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,583
I could actually do so.

374
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,958
- I'm not sure what you mean.
Why couldn't you?

375
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,541
Is it 'cause I'd be in the way?

376
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,291
- No, not in the slightest.
- Oh, absolutely not.

377
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,958
- See?
You two get along so well.

378
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,166
- Miss Fortuna
has been entrusted

379
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,000
with a very important duty.

380
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,875
If somebody like myself
moved in and it led to rumors,

381
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,958
then that would be
rather problematic for her.

382
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,708
EMILIA: I think
it's too late for that, though.

383
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,541
Remember what Aunt Tanse
and the others

384
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,458
said to us on the way here?

385
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,375
We all looked
like a close-knit family!

386
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,125
- Uh...

387
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,875
I-I thought she was just
talking about you two, not me!

388
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,750
- You understood her,
didn't you, Mother?

389
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,083
- [sighs]

390
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,041
- Well, I think
it's a great idea!

391
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,375
Really, it would be wonderful!

392
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,375
And the people of the forest
won't think it's weird at all!

393
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,708
Every one of them
would support us.

394
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,833
In fact, I'd never let anybody
say it was a bad thing!

395
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,208
Okay. I guess
that about covers it.

396
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,000
So now I'll just leave the rest
of the discussion to you.

397
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,333
- [sighs] Honestly, Emilia,

398
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,166
where do these little ideas
of yours come from?

399
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,625
- [grunts]

400

[both laugh]

402
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,583
- Oh, I swear,
you are way too cute!

403
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,708
- Yes, indeed.
Miss Emilia's grown up

404
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,916
to be so healthy and happy,
which brings me endless joy.

405
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,708
- She is my daughter,
someone I'm truly proud of.

406
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,416
- But of course.
How could she not be?

407
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
[both laughing]

408
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,750
EMILIA: Huh, that's weird.

409
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,583
I think I've got
something in my eye.

410
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,416
I'd better go wash it out.

411
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,083
- Oh, are you all right?

412
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,791
Just be careful not
to hurt yourself in the process.

413
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,791
You did get
those beautiful purple eyes

414
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,166
- from my brother, after all.
- I know.

415
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,625
And they're the same pretty
color as yours, too, Mother.

416
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,250
- Uh...

417
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,500
[chuckles]

418
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,458
- W-Wait for me, okay?

419
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,375
Don't leave,
and stay really close

420
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,625
forever and ever.

421
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,750
FORTUNA: Of course we will.

422
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,583
You're such a worrywart.

423
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,666
GEUSE: We'll wait
as long as it takes,

424
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,208
all right, Miss Emilia?

425
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,333
- [sighs]

426
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,541
I love you both...

427
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,250
so very much.

428
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,208
[birds chirping]

429
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,875
- Emilia?
- [gasps]

430
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,416
- It's dangerous for you
to be up here alone.

431
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,750
- Hello, Archi.

432
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,833
- I take it the bishop is
in the forest today, isn't he?

433
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:15,916
You're not with--

434
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,833
Eh?

435
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,333
He's over there, I see.

436
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,583
Were you
giving them some privacy?

437
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,125
- Mm-hmm. I was.

438
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,791
So what do you think
of the two of them?

439
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,375
- I think
they suit each other well.

440
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,291
Miss Fortuna has a tendency
to be quite harsh on herself,

441
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,375
and I just wish that she'd
give a little more thought

442
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,000
to her own happiness.

443
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,333
It may be difficult right now,

444
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,416
but with time, they could
find that bliss together.

445
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,750
- They won't.
- Huh?

446
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,916
- 'Cause such a world
doesn't exist anywhere, does it?

447
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,916
- Emilia...

448
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,416
- [sighs]

449
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,333
- Having beheld
an unthinkable present,

450
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,291
does living here not seem
a preferable alternative?

451
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,750
I'm certain that you wanted
the two of them to be happy.

452
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,916
This is your ideal present,

453
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,708
the future you've often
thought about and dreamed of.

454
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,833
- You're right. It is.

455
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,083
- Miss Fortuna
has already passed,

456
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,375
it's unknown if the bishop
is still alive,

457
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,291
and the people of the forest
are ice statues.

458
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,708
- Yes.
- Your homeland is frozen,

459
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,791
you're persecuted
by people from the outside,

460
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,333
and you had to say goodbye

461
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,916
to the spirit
who was like family to you.

462
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,375
- I know.

463
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,916
- But here, in this place,

464
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,583
you could live in happiness.

465
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,875
Seeing you continue to wish

466
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,791
for that other world
pains me greatly.

467
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,541
- I'm sorry, Archi.

468
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,500
- Why do you desire that future?

469
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,708
- I want to be
an admirable person.

470
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,250
- What do you mean?

471
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,500
- Like Mother Fortuna,
who's my role model,

472
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,083
or Geuse,
who's so kind and strong.

473
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:56,833
Like Archi, who kept smiling
until the very end,

474
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,833
- just so I wouldn't be scared.
- [gasps]

475
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,541
- Or Puck,
who always protected me

476
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,250
and never left me alone.

477
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,250
Like Ram, who wished
to do the one thing

478
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,416
that would be most helpful

479
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,791
for someone
who's truly precious to her.

480
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,916
Like Otto, who does
his very best for his friends,

481
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,375
or Garfiel, who never
once
uttered a word of
complaint.

482
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,541
Like Subaru,

It just makes me

He's a child,

All of us are in such awe.
