- We're really
goin' to the mansion?!

3
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,708
- I know
what's about to happen there,

4
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,416
so we've both
gotta hurry and stop it,

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,541
'cause this witch,

6
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:16,833
she's drawn to me,
which means--

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,291
- If you say
somethin' stupid right now

8
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,583
like we gotta use you as bait,

9
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,291
I'm gonna bite off
one of your fingers!

10

The old hag and Ram

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,041
and everybody else
livin' around here

12
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,625
- already got swallowed up.
- [gasps]

13
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,250
- Which means
there's no way in hell

14
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,500
I'm gonna let that thing
get ahold of your dumb ass, too!

15
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,583
- The shadow...

16
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,250
did it really
get to all of them?

17
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,083
- [grunts] Yeah.

18
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,583
Before I even knew
what was goin' on,

19
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,750
the ground was already covered.

If I hadn't been saved
by Ram's wind magic,

21
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,125
that damn thing
would have also gotten me.

22
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,458
- So Ram and Ryuzu
were just...

23
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,541
and Otto...

24
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,458
And Emilia, too?

Why'd something like this
have to happen now?!

28

- [brush rustles]
- [gasps] Who's there?!

29
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,125
Wait. Is this some kinda joke?

30
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,458
- Well, I was really hoping
that
you wouldn't have to see this.

31
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,500
- Are all of those
clones of Ryuzu?

32
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:18,250
- Look, don't worry about them,
okay? They ain't her.

33
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,791
They're empty on the inside.

34
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,333
- Hang on a minute.

35
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,875
What is it
you're planning to do?

36
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,291
- What do you think?

37
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,000
First,
we'll overwhelm that thing,

38
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,875
and then
we're gonna kick its ass!

Don't you ever call me that!

- The first real "I love you"

61
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,416
given to me in this world
was so powerful

62
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,250
that I believed
a loser like me

63
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,583
could actually defy the odds

64
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,666
and find the courage
to become a hero!

65

The top two places in my heart
have already been taken up,

66
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,375
and there's no room left
for someone like you!

67
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,125
In fact, compared to you,

68
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,500
I'd have an easier time
loving Echidna

but you did the opposite,

140

so why do you even exist?

- After you came in
wanting to help me,

142
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,625
it's really a shame
you got so worried

that you started crying.

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,583
or you'll make me do it again.

It just seems like

you're always
the one helping me.

00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,791
don't say that.

To be completely honest,

I'd rather not let you
ever see that side of me.

I would think any less of you

167
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,958
even worse every single time?!

168
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,375
- Take it easy now.
Miss Ram's attitude

169
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,041
is just her way
of showing that she cares.

170
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,708
- Hmph.
- [yelps]

171
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,250
- [chuckles] Eh?

172
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,458
[groans]

173
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,500
- Well, I wasn't sure

174
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,833
what was gonna happen
for a minute,

175
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,625
but I'm glad
you made it back all right.

176
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,291
Guess a little breeze
won't knock the gafgalon fruit

177
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,875
off the tree. Know what I mean?

178
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,166
[laughs]

179
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,166
- Ow! Wait.
- Eh?

180
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,125
- Is that all you've got to say?

181
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,750
- Huh?

182
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,708
SUBARU:<i> Well, if nothing else,</i>

183
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,833
<i>he isn't getting hostile</i>
<i>right now.</i>

184
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,750
<i>The trial didn't break</i>
<i>Emilia's spirit,</i>

185
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,833
<i>and Garfiel is still</i>
<i>maintaining his neutral stance.</i>

186
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:44,041
<i>This is easily the best</i>
<i>starting point I've had so far.</i>

187
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,041
<i>I just need to figure out</i>
<i>what I can test</i>

188
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,375
<i>and what I can bring back.</i>

189
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,916
<i>I don't want to mess this up.</i>

190
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,041
Ram, I want to talk to you
about something.

191
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:55,791
- You pervert.

192
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,958
- Way to jump to conclusions!

193
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,708
- SUBARU: Stop it!
- Hmph.

194
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,583
- I mean, I've never looked
at you in that way once, have I?

195
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,041
- True. You usually have
a much vaguer look.

196
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,583
- Huh?

197
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,916
[gasps]

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,833
- What is it
you wanted to ask me?

199
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,875
- It's about Garfiel.

200
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,875
I'm about to do something
behind his back,

201
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,208
and there's
a pretty good chance

202
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,083
that he's gonna try
to interfere.

203
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,291
What I want is for you

204
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,750
to keep him busy here
for a little while.

205
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,416
- That's a strange look
in your eyes, Barusu.

206
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,791
- Are you always
this suspicious?

207
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,791
- All right, very well.

208
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,458
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

209
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,083
- Ten favors in return.

210
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,583
- Damn! How many?!

211
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,666
- [running footsteps crunching]
- [panting]

212
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,708
<i>When I was inside that shadow,</i>

213
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,333
<i>I merged</i>
<i>with many consciousnesses.</i>

214
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,208
<i>Those were probably</i>
<i>her victims's memories.</i>

215
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,750
<i>They were all just a bunch</i>
<i>of disjointed fragments,</i>

216
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,666
<i>but I was still able</i>
<i>to bring back</i>

217
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,166
<i>more than</i>
<i>my own life is worth.</i>

218
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,041
<i>Now I just need</i>
<i>to verify those memories.</i>

219
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,750
[panting]

220
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,041
I found it.

221
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,333
[groans]

222
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:13,875
Eh?

223
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,583
[gasps]

224
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,166
[gasps]

225
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,333
[gasps]

226
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,666
Wait a minute.

227
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,833
Is that Ryuzu?

228
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:51,833
- [footsteps echo]
- [gasps]

229
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,666
- I never expected you
to discover this

230
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,458
only half a day
after arriving, Young Su.

231
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,500
- I learned of it
through memories,

232
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,666
ones of somebody
who knew of this place

233
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,166
and was swallowed up
by the Witch of Envy.

234
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,833
So tell me,
is the girl on the left

235
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,625
the one who led me here
this afternoon?

236
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,291
- That is highly unlikely.
The girl beside me

237
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,166
is one of the guards
assigned to this place.

238
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,833
It was another
who met you in the forest,

239
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,083
one of the Sanctuary's eyes
and nothing more.

240
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,166
- I've got a question
I want to ask you.

241
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,250
After that, I'd like to request
your help with something,

242
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,500
if that's all right.

243
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,375
- I shall not ignore
your request, Young Su.

244
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,708
You are the Apostle of Greed.

245
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,208
After all...

246
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,208
that is what has been written
in the contract that binds us,

247
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,833
the copies of Ryuzu Meyer.

248
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,958
[insects chirping]

249
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,625
- She seems
awfully attached to me.

250
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,041
- You do know who is responsible

251
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,291
for creating this place,
do you not?

252
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,666
It should be clear.

253
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,375
- I think so. Pretty sure it was

254
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,875
the Witch of Greed,
Echidna, wasn't it?

255
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,291
- Yes, this is a place
built by said witch's hand,

256
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,916
an experimental facility
created to fulfill her dream.

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,375
- And what was she
experimenting on?

258
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,416
- Did you not see it
directly in front of you?

259
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,750
- Huh?
- Was there not a girl

260
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,083
who looked just like me

261
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,833
trapped within the confines
of the magic crystal?

262
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,750
That was the first
and true Ryuzu Meyer.

263
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,083
All the other Ryuzus,
including myself,

264
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,875
are actually copies of her,
imitations.

265
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,750
Does knowing
that I am not the original

266
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,041
change how you see me?

267
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,125
- Uh...

268
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,125
[sighs] Well, I--

269
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,708
I'd really like to say
that it doesn't at all, but...

270
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,708
I don't know.

271
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,291
- [giggles]

272
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,958
How kind you are, Young Su.

273
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,500
Our replica bodies are built
upon cores of artificial od

274
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,958
which have been
produced by magic.

275
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,458
Those cores are wrapped in mana
and given physical form,

276
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,916
- resulting in these bodies.
- [gasps]

277
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,333
Wait a minute. You're talking
about literally creating life!

278
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,041
Why in the hell
would she ever want

279
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,958
to take on
an experiment like that?

280
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,083
- To add something
to those bodies, obviously,

281
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:22,166
specifically personalities,
memories, and knowledge,

282
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,125
in other words, a soul.

283
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,583
She filled Ryuzu Meyer's body

284
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,250
with everything
that made up her own being,

285
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,291
and each time
one of these bodies perished,

286
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,625
she would make a new vessel

287
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,333
for the single purpose
of inheriting its soul,

288
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,583
which would make her...

289
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,125
- What's essentially
an immortal being.

290
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,458
[gasps]

291
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,333
I see! Makes sense.

292
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,041
That's why she kept acting
so familiar with me.

293
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:47,666
- Hmm?

294
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,791
-<i> Return by Death</i>

295
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,250
<i>basically makes me</i>
<i>immortal, too.</i>

296
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,833
<i>Was she just happy</i>
<i>to find a kindred spirit?</i>

297
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,583
Tell me, was Echidna's
experiment successful?

298
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:03,416
- No. Echidna's soul
was not inherited.

299
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,541
The witch's plans
only came to pass

300
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,125
in what is considered
an imperfect form.

301
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,458
- And what do you mean by that?

302
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,375
- Ryuzu Meyer proved to be
an insufficient vessel

303
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,125
to house the likes
of the Witch of Greed.

304
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,958
- Are you serious?
And she couldn't

305
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,125
have figured that out
before she tried it?

306
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,041
- After the witch's death,
this facility remained,

307
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,083
and more copies
continue to be produced.

308
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,291
Since our bodies
are made of mana,

309
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,250
the saving grace
of our existence

310
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,541
is that we require
no resources to survive.

311
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,416
- [slurps]
- It still looks

312
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,083
like you're drinking tea,
though.

313
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,208
- This is merely
a hobby of mine,

314
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,833
an individual quirk I acquired

315
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,000
over my exceedingly long
life span.

316
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,416
I was one
of the first four made

317
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,791
during the creation
of the initial batch,

318
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,041
which occurred 400 years ago.

319
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,458
I was given
the wisdom and personality

320
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,916
to manage
the ever-increasing copies,

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,541
as well as the Sanctuary.

322
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,250
- So you were created that way?

323
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,208
- I did suffer at first.

324
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,916
I had no memories,
only a job to do.

325
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,375
For years,
I carried on like that--

326
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,000
I have no idea how many--

327
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,041
before I truly felt
like I was alive.

328
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,833
- [gasps]

329
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,958
- Now, now. No need to be sad.

330
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,250
In my own way,
I have found significance

331
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,916
and fulfillment
in honoring my purpose.

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,750
- Okay, but what
exactly did you mean

333
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,000
by calling me
the Apostle of Greed?

334
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,583
- Put simply,
the title refers to the one

335
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:36,333
given the right to command
all the copies of Ryuzu Meyer.

336
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,166
Did the witch
not bestow upon you

337
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,500
some symbol of her apostlehood
while in the graveyard?

338
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,500
- What kind of symbol?

339
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,500
- It would need to be
a part of her body,

340
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,375
such as a strand of hair
or a fingernail.

341
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,958
- [gasps] Of course!
The Chidna tea!

342
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,125
- Chidna tea?

343
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,125
- She got me to drink
her bodily fluids

344
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,666
by passing 'em off as tea
twice already.

345
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,125
- So you ingested
a part of the witch.

346
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,541
All joking aside,
that surely must be it.

347
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,625
- Can't believe
that smug little brat.

348
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,750
What the hell
did she make me drink?

349
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,958
[no audible dialogue]

350
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,833
Hey, wait a minute.

351
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:12,583
If the right
to command all the copies

352
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,208
makes somebody her apostle,

353
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,500
did Garfiel
also go into the graveyard

354
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,916
and take on the trial?

355
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,208
[sighs] Ryuzu...

356
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,166
don't let Garfiel know
that we met like this

357
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,375
or that I'm an Apostle of Greed,

358
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,500
because the less you say,
the better off we'll be.

359
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,416
- Young Gar would certainly
have something to say

360
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,416
if he knew a member of his group
was meeting with his lover.

361
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,541
- Not only is that
something I would never do,

362
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,708
it's also really messed up.

363
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,000
But, yeah,
I suppose we're okay, then.

364
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,583
I'm probably
gonna need your help again

365
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,541
in the near future,
so I hope I can count on you.

366
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,708
- Do as you please.
I cannot defy you.

367
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,458
Should you need
a ward or a hug pillow...

368
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,708
- Could you stop making me sound

369
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,375
like a guy
who's eternally frustrated?!

370
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,541
And I'll need you to keep
up
the good work as an eye.

371
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,416
[bare feet patter]

372
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:13,791
Thanks a lot, Ryuzu.

373
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,541
By the way, you said

374
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,500
the original surname
was Meyer, right?

375
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,708
But I thought
you told us yours is Bilma.

376
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,166
Where'd that come from?

377
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,541
- Going by the name Ryuzu

378
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,541
is a duty
that is instilled in me.

379
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,333
Therefore, we must learn

380
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,500
to express our individuality
in other ways,

381
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,083
such as hobbies,
preferences, and names.

382
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,458
- Oh, Young Su.
- Hmm?

383
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,083
- If you do not mind doing so,

384
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,666
would you ask me that
same question one more time?

385
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,416
Well, after tomorrow, I mean.

386
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,333
- [footsteps crunching]
- [wind blowing]

387
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,250
- The village.

388
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,750
I need to get everyone
back there safely somehow.

389
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,583
<i>I don't wanna</i>
<i>go through that again.</i>

390
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,166
- Subaru?
- [yelps]

391
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,291
- What are you doing out here?

392
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,708
Hey, it's more
than a little unsettling to me

393
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,208
when you act super-duper spooked
like that.

394
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,958
- "Super-duper"? Wow.

395
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,708
Who says that
in this day and age?

396
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,583
- I guess
I was worried for nothing.

397
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,333
- Trust me. I wasn't doing
anything worth worrying about.

398
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,250
Everything's fine, okay?

399
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,375
[gasps]

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,666
You almost look
like a fairy right now, Mili.

401
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,750
You're glowing.

402
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,208
- Hey! It isn't very nice

403
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,583
to say mean things like that
about somebody.

404
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,583
Even I can get angry, you know.

405
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,458
- That was supposed
to be a compliment!

406
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,708
- But fairies are known
as a type of evil spirit, right?

407
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,541
How's that
supposed to be a compliment?

408
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,791
- Man, foiled again
by the cultural barrier, huh?

409
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,125
Anyway, what are
you doing out here?

410
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,583
It's awfully late
to be out walkin' around.

411
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,583
If Puck were here,
he'd probably tell you

412
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,291
that's bad for your skin.

413
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,708
- Maybe.

414
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,375
I don't really have an excuse.

415
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,791
I just haven't been able
to sleep well,

416
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,791
so I thought it'd be nice
to feel the night breeze.

417
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,375
- Is it because you're
worried about the trial?

418
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,625
- No, it's not that.

419
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:19,291
Well, suppose that
could be possible. I'm anxious,

420
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,833
and I'm not entirely certain
what the issue is

421
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,500
I was just walking around,

422
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,666
hoping to figure it out,
I guess.

423
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,833
I feel so uncertain.

424
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,333
I really wish Puck was here.

425
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,625
- [sighs]

426
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,333
Looks like no matter where I
go,
I'll always be a pinch-hitter.

427
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,166
- Huh?

428
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,083
You're amazing, Emilia.

429
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,250
No one would blame you
for wanting to run away,

430
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,583
but you face things
like this head-on.

431
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,708
I respect that.

432
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,791
- [stammers]
That came out of nowhere.

433
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,500
Why the sudden compliment?

434
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,500
- It's not sudden at all.

435
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,041
I've always
thought that about you.

436
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,333
I just couldn't
say it until now.

437
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,458
- Subaru.

438
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,000
- To be completely honest,

439
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,500
I have no idea
how much help I can be to you,

440
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,333
but I'll still tell you
exactly what I feel.

441
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,125
You're gonna be fine, okay?

442
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,500
You'll get it done for sure.

443
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,291
Promise,
I'm always on your side.

444
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:18,875
- [chuckles]

445
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,541
Thank you for that.

446
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,958
And I mean it.
You've given me so much courage.

447
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,458
- [snoring]

448
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,250
- There you are.
I was getting worried.

449
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,958
You were gone for
a really long time, Mr. Natsuki.

450
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,583
I thought maybe
you'd wandered into the forest

451
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,250
and gotten lost.

452
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,250
- Don't worry, Mom.

453
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,666
Your little boy's
safe and sound.

454
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,416
- Couldn't you have at least
compared me to your dad instead?

455
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,250
- Listen. I know you've
had a hard time lately,

456
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,875
but you can always
confide in me if it'll help.

457
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,125
- Are you sleep-talking
or something? It's weird.

458
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,791
- Honestly! That's what you say

459
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,500
to somebody
who's worried about you?!

460
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,041
- [gasps]
- [snoring continues]

461
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,416
- Just be quiet,
and go to sleep, will you?

462
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,875
'Cause if your little outbursts
get the villagers all riled up,

463
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,583
both of us will be in for it.

464
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,625
- All right, but I didn't
mean that as a joke, you know.

465
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,291
- Yeah, yeah. I hear you, Otto.
I know you didn't.

466
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,000
And that's exactly
why I can't tell you.

467
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,708
I'm going alone.

468
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,833

470
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,958

<i>Roswaal, or the villagers.</i>

It's assumed
I'll redo everything here,

00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,875
so it's not like
this even makes sense.

00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,708
<i>I don't want Emilia</i>
<i>to be unhappy.</i>

480
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,500
<i>My goal's</i>
<i>a victory at the mansion.</i>

481
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:07,458
<i>I need to figure out</i>
<i>exactly what's going on there.</i>

482
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,375
<i>If I don't,</i>
<i>there's no way to deal with it,</i>

483
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,166
<i>but if I can, I could even</i>
<i>ask Echidna for help.</i>

484
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,000
So I'll keep on testing
until I win,

485
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,875
'cause that's something
only I can do.

- [gasps]
- [wails]

487
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,333
GARFIEL: Hah! You're really
pumped up this morning, huh?

488
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,666
Tell you one thing,

489
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,625
that's a damn gutsy
ground dragon you got there.

490
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,791
- Seems to be some kind
of misunderstanding

491
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,291
between you and me.

492
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,708
- A misunderstanding?
Like hell, there is!

493
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,916
Bet you and
that witch stench of yours

494
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,166
are up bright and early

495
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,625
to go do somethin' evil,
aren't you?

496
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:45,708
- I won't deny the smell,
but why bring it up now?

497
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,958
You didn't say a single word
about it yesterday.

498
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,416
- [growls]
- Looks like that was

499
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,375
an inconvenient question
for you.

500
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,916
It's written
all over your face, Garfiel.

501
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,500
- [growls] Watch your mouth.

502
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,916
Don't go makin' me even
more pissed off now. Understand?

503
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,875
- [grunts]

504
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,791
- [snarls]

505
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,750
- Don't even think about it,
ground dragon!

506
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,416
Make one move, and your
precious master gets thrashed!

507
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,708
What's that smirk about?!

508
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,166
- You...

509
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,750
you're so easy to read,
like an open book.

510
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,083
- Huh?!

511
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,208
- Now I've
got an even better idea

512
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,833
of what gets a reaction
out of you

513
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,166
and what makes you
really pissed off.

514
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,916
[no audible dialogue]

515
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,541
- [gasps] You bastard!
- [coughing]

516
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,416
So you were tryin' to test me?!
Is that it?!

517
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,583
That's just insane.

518
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,041
What in the hell
do you think you're doin'?!

519
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:44,916
Your life's at stake here!

520
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,500
- If my life was enough,

521
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,041
that'd make things
a whole lot easier.

522
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,625
- ["Memento" playing]
- Huh?

523
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,416
- Keep an open mind,
and let me off the hook, okay?

524
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,875
- If I do,
can you make a guarantee

525
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,458
that you won't turn around and
do something bad to us later
on?

526
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,791
- I promise.
I won't betray Emilia,

527
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,583
and I won't do anything bad
to the Sanctuary.

528
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,000
You can trust me.

529
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,458
- [sighs]

530
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:09,791
- Listen, Garfiel.

531
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:10,958
I know you have some secret
that you're hiding,

532
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,333
and I won't stop

533
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:13,875
'til I find out what it is,

534
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:14,791
I swear to you.

535
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:15,791
- Shut up!

536
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,791
- Just as long

537
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:18,750
as I keep on going,

538
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,458
there won't be any secrets.

539
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,416
You'd be wasting your time
trying to stop me.

540
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,833
- What do you wanna do
to this place, to us?!

541
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:25,958
What is the endgame here?!

542
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,208
I already told you
what my goal is.

543
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:30,458
It's helping Emilia,
and as I said,

544
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,791
I don't intend
to harm the Sanctuary.

545
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,666
It's won't be easy,
and there might be some trouble,

546
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,291
but I want to help you.

547
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,000
- Just who the hell

548
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,458
do you think you are, huh?!

549
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,708
You don't know shit

550
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:40,666
about this place
or the old hag or anyone!

551
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,125
- What I don't know, I'll learn.

552
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,500
I consider that to be

553
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,083
the entire reason
I'm doing this.

554
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,833
- What the hell
are you gonna accomplish

555
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:48,458
with all that uppity bullshit?!

556
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,416
You've got no idea

557
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,083
what real pain
and suffering are,

558
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,583
so you need to quit
runnin' your damn mouth!

559
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,916
- I do know.
- Huh?

560
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,625
- I've looked
into the mouth of hell...

561
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,750
and I've seen it
many times now.

562
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,666
- [song ends]
- [sighs]

563
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,916
- I want to make sure

564
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,958
I'm the only one
who knows that place.

565
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,625
And that's the reason.

566
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,166
That's why I'm out here.

567
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,791
[birds chirping]

568
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,000
FREDERICA: We should
leave the mansion entirely

569
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,916
and take cover
in the village for now?

570
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,375
This is what you wish
for us to do?

571
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,708
- Yeah, if you would.
Sorry about this,

572
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,625
but I know you can handle it,
Frederica.

573
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,750
- My! I believe
you've got me blushing.

574
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,125
You certainly know
how to win a young maid's heart,

575
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,708
now, don't you, Subaru?

576
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,500
- And I agree!
You do, absolutely!

577
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,750
- Oh, and this, thanks again.
It helped a lot,

578
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,833
although it probably wasn't
in the way that you intended.

579
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,166
- Oh, wow! Really?
So I was useful to you?

580
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,125
- Uh-huh. You saved my life.

581
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,875
Eh, that's not totally
accurate,
but that's how helpful it
was.

582
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,333
- I'm so glad.

583
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:14,916
In that case, you can
thank me with one date!

584
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
- Sure, you got it.
It'll be an honor

585
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,125
for me to be
your very first date, Petra.

586
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,083
Let's make it awesome!

587
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,708
- Sounds like a promise to me!

588
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:25,125
I'm gonna go get ready now,
but I'll be back soon.

589
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:25,708
[giggles]

590
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,625
- I hope we can make
more promises like that.

591
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:34,625
- She's such a good girl,
isn't she?

592
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:35,916
- No doubt.

593
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,541
Lay low, okay?

594
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,958
Keep an eye on Rem,
Petra, and Patrasche,

595
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,583
just for a while.

596
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:45,250
Stay safe, and I'll join you
just as soon as I can.

597
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,583
- Of course.
I look forward to it.

598
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:48,958
We'll see you soon then,

599
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,208
with Miss Beatrice
right beside you.

600
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,708
[door creaking]

601
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:59,833
- Well, you're finally
back here, I suppose.

602
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,208
- Yeah, I'm back once again,

603
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:05,125
but it's for a different reason
this time around.

604
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,416
- Fine. Do as you wish.

605
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,291
It's all quite ironic
either way, I suppose.

606
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,625
- [grunts]
- The end of a contract

607
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,541
that lasted a long time.

608
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,083
By bringing an end
to the end of the end,

609
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,916
I will truly be set free
this time around.

610
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,666
But of course...

611
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,833
the very fact
that it has to be with you

612
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:29,958
makes it an ending that's far
too ironic for me, I suppose.
