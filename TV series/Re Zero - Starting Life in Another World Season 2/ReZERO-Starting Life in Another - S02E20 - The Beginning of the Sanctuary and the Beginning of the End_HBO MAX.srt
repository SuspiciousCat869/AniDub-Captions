[continues gasping]

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,875
ECHIDNA:
That seems rather serious.

4
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,125
It's quite remarkable

5
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,583
that you've endured
this long without dying.

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,666
- A-And who are you?

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,166
[mysterious music playing]

[gasps]

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,583
- You have no idea how to vent

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,416
your accumulated mana,
now, do you?

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,583
Your lack of understanding
is quite lamentable.

13
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,166
- [gags]

[gasps]

18
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:09,958
- Well, how was that?

19
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,500
Are you beginning to feel
a little better?

20
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,750
- Wait. What is it
you've done to me?

21
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,666
How could a young lady do that?

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,291
- It was simply a way for me
to suck out your mana
directly.

23
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,291
- Mana?

24
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,750
- What you're experiencing
isn't a disease.

25
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,166
It's a Magic Release Period.

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,458
- Sorry. A what?

27
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,833
- It's something
that's extremely rare.

28
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,625
I'm certain that nobody
has ever truly accepted you

29
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,625
because of it.

30
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,125
But let me assure you

31
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,500
that I completely understand
your suffering

32
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,958
as one who's experienced
those feelings herself.

33
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,375
- [gasps]

34
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,625
[crying]

35
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,625
Please tell me, who are you?

36
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,875
- I'm an evil witch,

37
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,750
one who still shows kindness,
at least occasionally.

38
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,291
And who might you be?

39
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,875
- So, Betty, what do you think

40
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,541
about my teacher-student
romance?

41
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,041
- There's nothing to think,
since 'til now, I hadn't heard

42
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,208
a single, solitary thing
about it, I suppose.

43
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,750
And "romance" is a stretch.

44
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,791
You are being
far too familiar toward Mother.

45
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,500
- You're right. That was
just an excuse to say it.

46
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,166
Call our relationship
what you will,

47
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,416
but I still remember
every word from that day.

48
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,208
- This childish infatuation
of yours

49
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,625
would cause nothing but trouble
for Mother, I suppose,

50
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,000
or for me, of course.

51
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,208
- Come now. You shouldn't say
things like that, Miss
Beatrice.

52
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:47,583
I can understand these feelings
Mr. Roswaal is struggling with,

53
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,541
'cause I'm someone who was
rescued by Miss Echidna, too.

54
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,083
- Hmph!

55
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,458
- Yes, you must be quite
grateful to her as well, Ryuzu.

56
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:56,958
- Indeed.

57
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,416
- She truly saved me.

58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,416
If the two of us hadn't met,

59
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,291
I'm certain I'd still
be suffering alone now.

60
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,875
Either that, or in my despair,

61
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,291
I might have done
something tragically rash.

62
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,500
Instead, I bested
my parents and siblings

63
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,416
to overtake
the Mathers family entirely,

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,541
and it's all thanks to her.

65
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,833
- Hmph!
How shameless, I suppose.

66
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,250
It's so cowardly to coerce
someone into showing gratitude.

67
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,500
RYUZU: But I've also
heard you do that.

68
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,541
You often say things like,
"You'd better be grateful."

69
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,625
- What's your problem?!

70
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,875
Are you on my side
or Roswaal's, I suppose?!

71
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:34,666
What the?

72
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,708
Listen, I don't like
you staring at me

73
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,916
with that lukewarm look
in your eyes. Understand me?

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,416
If there's something you want
to say, then say it, I
suppose.

75
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,458
- All right.
Then how about, "I love you"?

76
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,750
- Don't say disgusting things
like that, you big pervert!

77
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,750
- [door opens]
- [gasps]

78
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,916
- RYUZU: Oh.
- Teacher!

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,083
- All three of you are here?

80
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,375
How nice. Have you been
getting along and not fighting?

81
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,333
- But of course!

82
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,791
- Naturally, I suppose.

83
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,708
- [giggles]

84
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,708
- My goodness.

85
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,500
It looks like
you're still a handful

86
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,416
and even more so as a group.

87
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,625
[Beatrice groans]

88
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,208
- Hmm.

89
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,666
I'm a bit surprised
you heard that story.

90
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,708
- Oh, yeah? It was
from Ryuzu Meyer's memories.

91
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,000
Shima saw them in the graveyard.

92
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:20,333
- Interesting. Then I suppose
it's reasonable for me to
assume

93
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,458
you know what else happened
at that time.

94
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,791
It was the day of birth

95
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:28,291
to this place
we call the Sanctuary.

96
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,333
- [water flowing]
- BEATRICE: Really, that Roswaal

97
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,625
is so mind-bogglingly
irritating, I suppose!

98
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,125
The man's utterly intolerable!

99
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,083
- Now that I've spent
more time around him,

100
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,041
I believe the only reason
Mr. Roswaal was avenging me

101
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,833
was because
you were being so mean.

102
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,666
- Hey, hold on.

103
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,916
Don't say I was being mean,
I suppose!

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,708
My clever antics were
much more refined than that.

105
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,791
RYUZU: No matter
how many doors I opened,

106
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,166
they led to the same room.

107
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,958
It was a really frightening
experience for me.

108
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,250
- It was only
a little yin magic, I suppose.

109
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,500
There's nothing to get
so bent out of shape about.

110
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,125
- ROSWAAL: I see.
- Huh?

111
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,375
- Even though I did
the same to you with yang magic,

112
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,791
you didn't get
"bent out of shape."

113
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:06,416
- [shrieks]
- You smiled

114
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,541
and took it in stride, right?

115
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,166
- [gasps]

116
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,041
- My, what a great expression,
Beatrice.

117
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,541
Your face is my favorite one.

118
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,791
Well, second only
to your mother's, of course.

119
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,708
- Why do you blurt out
odd things like that?!

120
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,916
You're just some lucky guy

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,958
blessed with a modicum of talent
and a good family,

122
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:22,791
who just happened to find

123
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,791
the best teacher
in the world, I suppose!

124
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,375
Don't let it go to your head,
weirdo!

125
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,750
- Miss Beatrice, I think
you're only complimenting him.

126
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,541
- Now, Ryuzu, if Beatrice
ever bothers you again,

127
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,625
just come find me,
and I'll handle it.

128
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,708
I'll spank her pretentious
and pampered bottom

129
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,458
to teach her a lesson.

130
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,250
- Hah!
Your sadistic offer is wasted!

131
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,583
This girl's never
going to rely on you, I suppose!

132
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,958
Now go on! Tell him!

133
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,000
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

134
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,416
If anything happens,

135
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,083
I'll most certainly
let you know.

136
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,416
- How dare you, I suppose?!

137
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,583
- [moans]
- Eh?

138
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,708
Sorry I interrupted
your reading.

139
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,333
I apologize
on behalf of Beatrice, as well.

140
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,583
RYUZU: Please, don't
concern yourself with that.

141
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:04,583
I can't exactly call what I'm
doing reading yet, anyway.

142
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,916
- Likely not.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,125
Still, perusing books is
a good thing, I suppose.

144
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,500
It makes your life richer,

145
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,458
as it increases
your wealth of knowledge!

146
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,416
- So says Beatrice,

147
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,083
echoing the same words
her teacher used

148
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,791
- to pass off as her own.
- [growls]

149
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,958
ROSWAAL: Oh, that just
gave me a wonderful idea!

150
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,958
Beatrice, why don't you
become Ryuzu's instructor?

151
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,625
- Wait. Me? Teach her?

152
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,958
- Uh, I couldn't trouble
Miss Beatrice with such a thing

153
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,125
when she's so busy.
I'd feel terribly guilty.

154
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:34,041
- Now hold on. I didn't say
that
I wasn't willing, I suppose.

155
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,708
Such tutelage would be
quite the simple task.

156
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,916
- [gasps]

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,791
- What's the problem, I suppose?

158
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,250
If you don't want to,
you don't have to, you know.

159
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,625
It's not as if
I'm all that enthusi--

160
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,125
- Oh, no! I'd be happy
for the opportunity...

161
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,500
It would be an honor
for you to teach me.

162
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,500
- Well, if you insist,

163
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,583
then I don't have any choice,
I suppose.

164
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,833
My goodness.
You really are one lucky girl.

165
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,000
Huh? [gasps]

166
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,166
- What's the matter?

167
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,583
- Mother is calling, I suppose.

168
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,208
- Roswaal, come on!

169
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,666
Mother's calling for you, too!

170
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,208
It's urgent, I suppose!

171
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,875
- Yes, I know.

172
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,916
For it would appear...

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,416
he has arrived.

174
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,666
[energy whooshing]

175
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,125
ROSWAAL: I have confirmation.

176
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,833
It's definitely him.

177
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,416
ECHIDNA: I see.

178
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,333
- We should flee this place
immediately.

179
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,000
If he comes here, then our plan
will most assuredly fail,

180
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,625
and it would be impossible
to start over.

181
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,166
Please! There's no time
for hesitation!

182
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,708
Though I cannot be
of any use to you yet,

183
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,291
if you ask me to be your shield,
then I will gladly do so.

184
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,750
But there must be
countermeasures in place.

185
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,791
ECHIDNA: It isn't as if
there's nothing we can do.

186
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,125
The plans for the Sanctuary
are ready to an extent.

187
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,041
- [gasps]

188
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,583
ECHIDNA: Construction
of the theory is complete.

189
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,583
- Then shouldn't we--

190
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,791
- It's not enough.

191
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:04,583
We're still without the core

192
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,208
necessary
for generating the barrier.

193
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,000
And without that component,
it simply won't function.

194
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,625
- So all the work
we've done will be...

195
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,875
[sighs] The Sanctuary was just
one step away from completion!

196
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:17,666
[sighs]

197
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,125
- Um, regarding this core
you don't have yet...

198
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,583
- [gasps]
- [gasps]

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,750
- isn't there something
I could do to be of use?

200
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,666
- Ryuzu.

201
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,125
- I know.
I've heard about it already.

202
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,083
The only one of us who meets
the requirements to be the
core

203
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,041
for Miss Echidna's barrier
is me.

204
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,875
- Did Beatrice tell you that?

205
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,833
- Yes.

206
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,083
- It is true.

207
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,625
There's a rather
strong probability

208
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,166
that you could function
as the barrier's core,

209
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,916
but that would only be
after your mana and the land

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,750
adapted more to one another.

211
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,833
- So you're saying
I can't do it right now?

212
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,250
- We're dealing
with an unusual barrier.

213
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,208
We spent years gathering those

214
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,208
with mixed human
and demi-human blood

215
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,458
on a scale large enough
to activate it.

216
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:09,291
You're the last push needed
for its completion.

217
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,791
However...[sighs]

218
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,750
- I understand.

219
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,041
Still, I'm sure you both have
a way to make it work, right?

220
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,708
[both gasp]

221
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,291
- The two of you saved me.

222
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,833
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for you.

223
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,958
And I've been so happy to live

224
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,666
without being ostracized
or looked down upon.

225
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,166
If I can repay you for the time
I've had to live this way,

226
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,791
I'm more than happy to do so.

227
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,708
It would give my life meaning.

228
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,166
- [sighs]

229
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,458
- Teacher.

230
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,583
- We'll use your od
as the catalyst

231
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,208
needed to create
the Sanctuary's core.

232
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,208
That should greatly shorten

233
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,250
the expected timeline
of the process

234
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,083
and allow the barrier
to function.

235
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,333
- Then the Sanctuary
will be saved?

236
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,291
ECHIDNA: That would
make it possible

237
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,000
to drive away
the current threat.

238
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,333
- And how long
would it take to get started?

239
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,791
- We'll do so right away.

240
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,083
I could have Beatrice prepare

241
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,291
the location
where the core will be placed.

242
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,000
After that, all I would need

243
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,166
is enough time
to construct the spell.

244
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,000
- I'm assuming
that will be my job, correct?

245
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,083
I'll buy you that time.

246
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,833
You can depend on me.

247
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,333
I'm so sorry, Ryuzu.

248
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,000
Sadly, my strength alone

249
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,375
isn't enough
to protect our teacher.

250
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,750
- No, think nothing of it.

251
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,291
You've given me so much,
Mr. Roswaal.

252
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,541
If anything, I'm grateful.

253
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:38,083
I have no reason
to resent you in the slightest.

254
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,291
- [gasps]

255
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,000
Then I will go at once.

256
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,708
Please
have the barrier prepared,

257
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,041
and call Beatrice here
as soon as possible.

258
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,875
ECHIDNA: Should we consider

259
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,166
leaving her in the dark
about this?

260
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,541
- No. If we don't involve
Beatrice in everything,

261
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,291
she'll most assuredly
despise the both of us forever.

262
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,208
Although, that might well
be the outcome either way.

263
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,833
- Right.
I'll consider your advice.

264

[door closes]

265
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,375

You're too noisy.

You're annoying me.

You pain in the ass.

I'm tired and bored.

stop you right here

It brings me down so much.

I'm so sad, so distraught.

This is easily the worst

Do you think
I ended up like this

because I wanted to
for some strange reason?

301

- Listen, no matter how you
try to twist the way you live,

302
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:42,875
you've had plenty of occasions

to choose
what to do with your life,

304

makes me feel hurt
and uncomfortable.

It's so rude, so annoying.

and your heart is splintered.

314

With that out of the way,
I can now tend to other matters.

- Well, well.

317
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,041
I suppose it would be a stretch
to say I made it in time.

- Not at all.
You're right on schedule.

00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,333
to keep me here
and buy you enough time

321
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,791
to do whatever it is
you're trying to do.

322
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,083
ECHIDNA: This hurts
more than I expected.

323
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,791
- If you need a moment to cry,
we can set some time aside.

324
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:37,708
- You haven't changed a bit,
have you?

325
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,041
You're the same
as when we parted ways.

326
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,500
- And it would appear you still
have no clue how to talk to me.

327
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,416
You were so adorable then,

328
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,208
I just allowed you
to get away with it.

329
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,041
- [whimpering]

330
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,083
- How long are you
going to lie there

331
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,333
holding your head and
looking pathetic, I suppose?

332
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,458
- Huh? Miss Beatrice?

333
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,083
- Stop spacing out, and get up.

334
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,041
We need to move while Mother is
busy out there buying us time.

335
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,333
- B-But...

336
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,208
- The preparations are complete.

337
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,083
That's what Mother said,
I suppose.

338
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,208
- [gasps]

339
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,583
All right, then.

340
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,500
Let's go do our part,
Miss Beatrice.

341
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,250
[door creaks]

342
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,125
[mysterious music playing]

343
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,083
[gasps]

344
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,291
- If you don't want to become
a part of this crystal,

345
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,166
do something besides standing
there, mindlessly staring.

346
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,458
- I'm sorry.

347
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,500
I know this isn't the time.

348
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,375
- So what happens now,
I suppose?

349
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,083
The only thing Mother told me
to do was bring you out here,

350
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,041
but beyond that,
nothing else was mentioned.

351
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,708
- Yet even
with such an uncertain task,

352
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,375
you can still do
as Miss Echidna tells you.

353
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,708
- Of course, I suppose.

354
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,333
Because to me, Mother and
what she says is absolute.

355
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,541
I think that you and
the people living here

356
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,500
are truly blessed
beyond measure.

357
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,125
Once this is all taken care of,

358
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,541
you can repay that by working
your hardest, I suppose.

359
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,458
- [sighs]

360
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,500
- While you may be smiling,

361
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,625
that isn't a very agreeable look
on your face.

362
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,750
- [gasps]

363
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,083
[crying]

364
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:21,458
- [gasps]
- [gasps]

365
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,333
I-I'm sorry!

366
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,791
I must have gotten
something in my eye.

367
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,416
- Actually, I think
you ought to stay right here

368
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,000
and do nothing, I suppose.

369
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,750
I'll go back out there and see
what I can do to help Mother.

370
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,666
I should probably start
with saving Roswaal

371
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,333
before he ends up dead,
I suppose.

372
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,208
So from tomorrow on...

373
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,291
- [sighs]

374
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,333
Miss Beatrice...

375
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,208
thank you for everything
that you've done for me.

376
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,041
- Huh?

377
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,291
- The moment's come
to say goodbye.

378
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,500
- H-Hold on. "Goodbye"?

379
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,708
What do you mean?

380
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,166
- I have a mission.

381
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:57,875
This facility
has been prepared

382
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,708
to place a barrier
over the forest.

383
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,666
I was originally
supposed to activate

384
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,250
the barrier at its core,

385
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,708
but the time I have
is no longer enough to do so.

386
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,708
- I don't understand
what you're saying.

387
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:13,250
If--If that man
is interfering, I'll--

388
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,208
- You can't win
just by fighting him.

389
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,208
It's what the Sanctuary is for.

390
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,875
The reason
Mr. Roswaal sacrificed so much

391
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,041
is because he knows
that he won't be able

392
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,416
to save Miss Echidna otherwise.

393
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,541
If we complete the barrier,
we can protect this place,

394
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,666
and for that very purpose,
I'm offering myself.

395
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,500
- What kind of absolute insanity
are you blabbering about?!

396
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,708
Your big plan is to "offer
yourself up for that purpose"?

397
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,250
You don't even know magic,

398
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,708
so how are you going to do
something like that, I suppose?!

399
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,000
You have no--[gasps]

400
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,625
So this magic crystal
will be the catalyst

401
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,750
to form the barrier,
using your od as the core?

402
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,625
- Yes, that's right.

403
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,833
- It was all
Miss Echidna's idea.

404
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,500
- Wait a minute!
You have to be mistaken!

405
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,708
I'll go have a word
with Mother about it myself

406
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,208
right now, I suppose!

407
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,250
She dotes on me.

408
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,666
I know she'll listen
when I tell her that--

409
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,333
- We haven't a minute to lose.

410
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,541
The decision has to be made
one way or the other now.

411
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,750
- If those are the options,
then my decision

412
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,750
is to go back and help Mother,
I suppose!

413
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,208
Together, with our abilities,

414
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,458
I know the two of us
can easily defeat him!

415
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,416
To make sure everyone
gets away from here safely,

416
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,208
we can just
use my Door Crossing.

417
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:24,916
- [gasps]

418
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,208
- Right! That's the plan, then!

419
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,166
It'll be difficult for me
to do so with this many people,

420
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,083
but I can pull it off,
I suppose!

421
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,500
I'll just need
to find an opening

422
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,166
to grab Roswaal
and get Mother away, I suppose!

423
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,541
You see? That should...

424
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,416
[gasps]

425
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,083
- Do you want to live
your life running away,

426
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,625
always afraid
of being chased again?

427
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,791
We finally have a place
where we can enjoy peace,

428
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,166
thanks to Miss Echidna
and Mr. Roswaal.

429
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,458
If we abandon their effort,

430
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,208
how long will it take
to build a new Sanctuary?

431
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,291
I've been granted
more than enough time

432
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,125
to enjoy warmth and kindness.

433
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,250
This place
means everything to me,

434
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,916
and I'm truly happy
that I was able to live in it.

435
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,500
I love the smiling faces
of everybody who lives
here.

436
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,041
I can't stand
the thought of losing them.

437
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,916
- Well, no matter
how much you like this place

438
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,416
or care for the people in it,
the fact of the matter

439
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,416
is that it doesn't exist
for people like you!

440
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,833
- Yes, I know.

441
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:28,416
- [gasps]

442
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,416
Then why?

443
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,708
If you know that,
then why do such a thing?

444
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,708
- It's okay.

445
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:40,333
That may have been true
in the beginning, but...

446
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,791
there's no way
all the time we spent here

447
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,416
and all the things we did

448
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,666
can stay as they were
from the start.

449
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,541
The chance to live here,
to talk with you,

450
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,541
to get to know
Miss Echidna and Mr. Roswaal,

451
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,541
these were choices
that I gladly made on my own.

452
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,125
I haven't lost anything.

453
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,750
Those moments
haven't simply vanished.

454
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:06,500
I still have
everything I've been given.

455
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,833
Being here made me happy.

456
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,541
So to protect the things
that are truly precious to me,

457
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,666
I must go.

458
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,875
Getting to know you
has been an honor.

459
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,375
I offer my affection
and gratitude to you,

460
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,500
Miss Beatrice,
over and over again.

461
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,458

463
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:30,583
- And remember...

- [gasps]

465
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,833
- I know they may be delicious,

466
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,416
but try not to eat
too many sweets.

467
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,541
[hand thuds]

468
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,250
- Th-The books.

469
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,458
I made a promise

470
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,458
to teach you
how to read and write.

471
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,916
- Thank you.

472
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,833
[laughs]

473
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,875
Goodbye...

474
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,791
Betty.

475
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,833
- And that's it.

476
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,958
That's everything I was told.

477
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,541
- Your point being?

478
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,791
Assuming that such a
fantastical
story is even partially true,

479
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,791
- what of it?
- [gasps]

480
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,666
I'll say it again.

481
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,833
Surrender!

482
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,833
The course of events
has changed.

483
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,625
Stop the people
you sent to the mansion.

484
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,750
If you do that, all of this
can be reconciled! Understand?

485
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,625
- [sighs]

486
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,291
- I absolutely refuse, Subaru.
- [gasps]

487
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,500
I didn't come
through these 400 years

488
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,291
only to bend
to such a miniscule change.

489
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,166
If you think bringing in
a pawn from outside the board

490
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,666
and removing Garfiel
gives you an advantage,

491
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,708
I'm afraid
you're quite mistaken.

492
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,666
- What was that?

493
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,125
- Well, am I wrong?

494
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,916
You always snapped
rather vigorously

495
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,541
at every outsider
you encounter,

496
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,000
but now you seem to have joined

497
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,583
Subaru's merry little band
of friends, haven't you?

498
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,375
I'm honestly quite surprised

499
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,000
at how quickly
you changed your tune.

500
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,041
- [scoffs] Nothin' you say

501
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,916
carries any weight
with me, Roswaal.

502
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,916
- [sighs] Is that so?

503
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
After clinging
to one single desire

504
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,541
each day
for the past ten years,

505
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,208
then letting it go
with such ease,

506
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,833
you would dare
say that about me?

507
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,458
What an incredibly
pathetic joke.

508
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,833
- [growls]

509
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,458
- A wish does
not simply go away.

510
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,375
Though, your transformative
attitude has me curious.

511
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,625
If you cared about your mother
and family as you profess to,

512
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,541
would you truly change
so readily?

513
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,708
Or could it be
that all of this time,

514
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,666
they actually meant
nothing to you whatsoever?

515
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,041
Is a dream that folded

516
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,083
the moment
your fangs were broken off

517
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:03,500
what you really
spent the last decade on?

518
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,416
- Sounds like you've got
the wrong idea.

519
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,708
- Enlighten me, then.

520
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,208
- I didn't just decide
to hang with the boss man here

521
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,541
because he beat me in a fight,
if that's what you mean.

522
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,875
I spent ten years holdin' on

523
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,916
to a past
that was full of pain.

524
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,541
But I'm over that.

525
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,000
I was finally able
to face it head-on.

526
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,166
- Wait. You confronted
your past? Seriously?

527
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,750
- Yeah, and I ain't interested
in tellin' you what I saw

528
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,208
or why I started
followin' my boss.

529
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,833
However, since you have such
a snarky attitude about it,

530
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,416
I'll tell you
the one big reason

531
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,375
I chose to side with him
instead of you.

532
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,750
'Cause rather
than bein' with the one

533
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,875
who told me
to stay weak forever,

534
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,666
it made a hell of a lot
more sense to go with the guy

535
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,000
who looked me over and said he
needed me because I was strong.

536
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,583
[grunts] What?!

537
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,500
- Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

538
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm really counting on you, man.

539
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,791
Like he said,
Garfiel faced the past,

540
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,958
and he's standing here
as a result,

541
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,583
but it doesn't mean
the love he had for his family

542
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,625
before that time
has ever gone away.

543
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,708
The strength of his feelings
hasn't changed.

544
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,958
He was able to move forward
without losing who he is.

545
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,000
Well, the same goes for you.

546
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,125
If your methods,
if you were just facing

547
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,833
the same direction
as the rest of us,

548
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,750
then we could get along.

549
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,000
It's not too late to turn back.

550
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,125
- You're forgetting.

551
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,958
I still have the advantage.

552
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,625
- What do you mean?

553
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,041
- Per the terms of our wager,

554
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:36,083
your greatest weapon was bound,
making you an ordinary person.

555
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,750
And what could
somebody so common

556
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,583
ever hope to achieve?

557
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:41,375
Absolutely nothing!

558
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,333
You're ordinary,
less than ordinary!

559
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,666
What could you possibly do
that would have an impact?

560
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,625
In the Sanctuary,
no one can violate

561
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,833
the feelings carved
into you by time, no one!

562
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,833
And that circumstance
will not waver!

563
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,500
My 400 years won't change!

564
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,750
They won't be overturned
by the likes of you!

565
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,500
You are insignificant!

566
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,833
- And that's because
feelings don't change.

567
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,125
- Is that it?
- Of course!

568
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,083
- Because you
believed that for so long

569
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:04,958
and seen no evidence
to think otherwise?

570
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,541
- Yes, without question!

571
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,500
- You need to take
a closer look.

572
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,166
There's more to see than
just the weakness of feelings!

573
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,208
What about caring
for someone for years?

574
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,500
That emotion's strong,
as you know damn well!

575
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,000
How can you see
the frailty in it

576
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,500
and not the power it holds?!

577
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,208
- Because that is my truth!

578
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,166
Because it is what I believe!

579
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,083
In the same way you find hope

580
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,041
by having faith
in another's strength,

581
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:30,583
I believe, in the end, everyone
always remains helpless!

582
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,708
They're so fragile
that they're only capable

583
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,541
of clinging on
to one precious thing!

584
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,875
Fulfilling their own desires

585
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,583
or grasping
for anything beyond that

586
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:38,833
is out of their reach entirely!

587
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:39,958
Of that, I am certain!

588
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,875
For four centuries,

589
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,500
there's one woman
I've ever truly loved.

590
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,708
That's far longer
than we spent together.

591
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,333
And even after being
without her for all that time,

592
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,375
her image
is forever burned into me.

593
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:56,625
It never stops burning,
scorching my very soul.

594
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:57,416
My heart's still in pieces,

595
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,791
as it has been
since the day we parted.

596
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,750
No force, outside or in,
has changed that!

597
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,291
- [gasps]

598
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,541
- I'll say it once more.

599
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,416
I still have
a great advantage over you.

600
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,583
If specific parts
of our stories don't match,

601
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,041
what difference does it make?

602
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,750
In the grand scheme of things,

603
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,125
so long as that
one crucial person remains,

604
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,875
the battle will never end
for either one of us.

605
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,083
- You shouldn't
underestimate Emilia.

606
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:23,958
Despite what you think,

607
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:26,916
she won't go along
with your ideas anymore.

608
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
She's gonna overcome it all.

609
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,125
- You really believe
that's possible?

610
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,916
She'll be stranded
with nowhere to go,

611
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,833
and her own regrets
will crush her.

612
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,041
She'll be sorry
that she ever even aspired

613
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,083
to make such a change,

614
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,916
and she'll hold you
while drowning in tears.

615
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,208
That's what suits someone like--

616
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,375
- Crying doesn't suit anybody,
you inhuman bastard!

617
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,625
And for your information,
she's terrible at it.

618
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,875
I've never seen a girl
who sucked that bad at crying!

619
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,416
- In the end, she'll be hurt
and held in contempt.

620
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,000
Such is the tragic fate
of the half-elf.

621
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,625
Those who are born
with the curse

622
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:57,291
of sharing the same lineage
as the Witch of Envy

623
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:01,791
will inevitably
be scorned as one themselves.

624
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,000
- What a load of shit!

625
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,125
Just how in the hell
is she a witch?!

626
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,583
You're the ones
ganging up on her

627
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,166
to turn her into one,
and I've had it!

628
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,083
Has anybody ever even bothered

629
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,083
to tell her
that's it's okay to cry,

630
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,291
that if she's hurt or sad,

631
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:15,041
it's the natural way
to let it out?!

632
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,958
If she can't wipe
her own tears away,

633
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,083
then someone
will gladly dry them for her!

634
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,541
Has anyone ever told her

635
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,125
that there's someone
out there who cares,

636
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,208
someone who loves her enough
to be that person for her?!

637
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,833
If no one else will tell her or
do so themselves, then I will!

638
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,166
These feelings...

639
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,666
these curses...

640
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,333
if you believe they're things
that can never change,

641
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,666
then we're just gonna
have
to pound the truth into
you!

642
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,833
My name is Subaru Natsuki!

643
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:41,791
I am the knight of Emilia,

644
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,875
who's the silver-haired
half-elf!

645
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,500
I don't have a doubt in my mind
that she's coming.

646
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,166
The one who you've
convinced yourself

647
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,333
to be so fragile and delicate

648
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:58,166
is about to sever
that last desire of yours.

649
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,041
- My suspicions were correct,
Subaru Natsuki.

650
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,291
It's good to see.

651
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:03,916
- What's that?

652
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,083
- You and I are rather alike...

653
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,125
in the sense that we
both force our lofty ideals

654
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,958
upon the women we love.

655
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:12,791
- You believe in weakness.

656
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,958
I'm someone
who believes in strength.

657
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,250
And as much as I
hate to admit it,

658
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,833
on that point at least,
the two of us are the same.

659
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,416
Let's go.
