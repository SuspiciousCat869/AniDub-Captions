Gusteco, the land to the north
where I was born,

378
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,291
was a very cold
and desolate place.

379
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:12,916
- Huh?

380
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,416
- I was abandoned as a child.

381
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,875
I hurt people and stole
from them day after day.

382
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,708
I had no time
to think about things

383
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,875
like truly living or happiness.

384
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,666
Once, during a blizzard,
I was stealing from a shop,

385
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,291
and its owner captured me.

386
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,666
- Hey, shut up! Nobody cares!

in stripping off all my clothes.

But in a frantic search,

390
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,833
I happened to find
a shard of glass.

391
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,541
There was no thought
or hesitation.

392
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,250
I held it tightly
and thrust it into his belly.

393
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,875
After I did, while naked
and shivering in the cold,

394
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,708
I began thinking.

- [growls]

396
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,250
- The blood and the entrails,

397
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,208
they looked so very warm.

398
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,666
If there's happiness
in this world,

399
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,791
it's when you have enough warmth
to make you forget the cold.

400
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,291
It was the first time
I ever knew joy.

401
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,916
But that's lost on you,
isn't it?

402
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,291
- If you knew that,

403
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,291
then why the hell'd
you keep yappin' about it?

404
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,500
- Ah, excellent question.

405
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,208
Maybe it's because
I find you so very endearing.

406
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,625
- Sorry, but there's
already a girl I like.

Of course, as you are now,

you should still be able

Will you not attempt to do so?

450

- Are you proposing I ask
the great spirit to stall you

and use that as an opening?

You must be kidding me.

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,916
It's something
I couldn't begin to do,

and even if I tried,
my wish wouldn't be fulfilled.

will only get worse
if we continue.

but even a great spirit
is not perfect.

459
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,833
- I've gotta hand it to you.

460
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,875
You're definitely thorough,
aren't you?

461
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,708
When did you
put the spell on Lia?

462
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,166
- Before I headed
to the Sanctuary.

Doctoring the contract
between you and Miss Emilia

464

while she was
in the throes of depression

465
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,833
after a fight with dear Subaru
was quite simple.

466
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,500
- And your goal in doing this

467
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,750
was to make sure
she stayed discouraged?

468
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,666
- Indeed.

469
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,583
Admittedly,
restricting Subaru's actions

470
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,041
took more effort
than anything else.

471

He's the last key
to unlocking my dearest wish.

472
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,958
Unlike you,
I'm not merely attempting

473
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,833
to put him through
a series of tests

474
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,375
to see if he's worthy
of my precious daughter.

475
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,541
Don't get full of yourself,
witch's disciple.

476
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,458
- Am I correct in guessing
that you now remember

477
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,000
what happened
before your contract?

478
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,541
- There are plenty of guesses
you could make. Although...

479
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:24,125
I was actually remembering a man
who spoke a whole lot like you.

480
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,125
Is it so I'd recall
what happened,

481
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,208
a punishment, maybe?

482
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,583
Either way,
you're just stuck in the past.

483
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,125
- I suppose that's true.

484
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,625
Yes. Yes, of course.

485
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,166
I am forever looking longingly
upon my former years,

486
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,125
because, for me, that's when

487
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,625
all the wonderful things
that ever happened took place.

488
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,041
What exists now
is just an impostor

489
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,125
standing atop
a pile of corpses.

490
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,666
PUCK: I'm not going to fault you
for what you are, but...

491
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,458
- Go on.

492
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,291
- You're gonna make
Betty sad, Roswaal.

493
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:04,125
- Enough.<i> Ul Goa!</i>

494
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,000
- This is how you act
when you're called out?

495
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:06,583
Childish!

496
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,708
-<i> El Fu--</i>
- Too late.

497
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,625
- [grunts]
- Get back!

498
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,166
If you don't get up now,
the next one'll do you in.

499
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,833
- You make it sound so simple.

500
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,666
ROSWAAL: I couldn't be
more disappointed, Ram.

501
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,583
I wanted you to succeed.

502
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,458
I wanted you
to attain true happiness

503
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,666
by exacting justice
for your brethren.

504
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:40,625
- [crying]

505
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,208
- Ram?

506
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:45,166
- After repeating it
over and over,

507
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,708
touching upon it so many times,

508
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:50,541
you still haven't realized
my true intentions.

509
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,750
I wish I was simply a demon...

510
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,208
one that burns with hatred

511
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,750
in her desire
to avenge her people.

512
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,208
If revenge was
the only thing I sought,

513
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,916
my heart wouldn't torment me so.

514
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,625
[singing in Japanese]

515
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:07,625
But there's more.

516
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:10,833
Please listen.

517
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,333
There's something
I need to tell you.

518
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,583
Master Roswaal, I love you.

519
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,250
- [gasps]

520
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:24,500
- Is something wrong?

521
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:27,708
- You would seriously
ask me that question,

522
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,458
standing there
and mocking my heart,

523
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,583
after everything
that's happened?

524
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,500
I only told you
what I truly feel.

525
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,000
- Stop lying!
I know that can't be so!

526
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,750
You? You say you love me?

527
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,000
How dare you?! You hate me!

528
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,250
I'm the man who caused
the death of your family

529
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,291
and the destruction
of your homeland!

530
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,125
You loathed me so much,
you wanted to take my life!

531
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:48,250
- That was true at first,

532
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,083
but not anymore.

533
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,916
What's true now is this.

534
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,333
I love you.

535
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,916
- How could you
possibly love me?

536
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,750
Such cheap emotions
make no sense!

537
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,833
What of your revenge?
Did you not swear

538
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,208
on the souls of your brethren
to achieve it?!

539
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:07,000
- Yes, and I do feel
as though I've wronged them.

540
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:10,166
But still,
I can't help caring about you.

541
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,666
My love will be prioritized
over the feelings of the dead.

542
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,041
Now, Great Spirit!

543
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,000
- You got it!

544
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,041
Next to my beloved daughter,
of course,

545
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,833
it's girls in love
that I'll always side with!

I just got a little bigger,
that's all!

00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:43,333
- As far as I'm concerned...

567
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:47,500
this is the root of all evil.
