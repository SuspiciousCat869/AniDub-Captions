Hey, Petra...

8
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:43,958
aren't you a little close?

9
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,291
- Yeah, maybe, but she
had you all to herself earlier,

10
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,166
and I don't think that's fair!
It's my turn.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,250
- Listen, I think you've
got this all wrong, Petra.

12
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,875
Subaru and I were just--

13
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,125
Uh, we had important things
to talk about.

- [groans]

No matter what it takes,

16
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,041
I'm not gonna lose to you.
Understand me?

17

- [gasps]

18
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,625
- Take it easy, Mili.

19
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,750
She's only a kid.
Just forget about it.

20
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,375
When they say outrageous things,

21
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,583
you've gotta smile
and laugh it off, you know?

22
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,875
- I can't do that!
- [gasps]

23
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,708
- Even if they're
only words from a child,

24
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,333
I refuse to take
such a lackadaisical attitude.

25
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,041
- Who uses words
like "lackadaisical" anymore?

26
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:19,958
- [growls]

27
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,208
You can't stop teasing me,
can you?

28
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,791
- I'm not a kid,
so don't talk to me like one!

29
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,666
- [both groan]
- Okay, okay, you two.

30
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,333
Take it easy.
Look, I'm sorry, Petra,

31
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,166
and I need to thank you.

32
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,250
You made a promise
not to leave Mili alone,

33
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,166
and you stuck to your word
through thick and thin,

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,666
so I really appreciate it.

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,666
Once things calm down,

36
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,333
there are actually
a lot of people I need to thank.

37
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,166
I'm grateful
to Crusch and her gang.

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,125
Anastasia and her people
helped a lot, too.

39
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,791
I hate to admit it,

40
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,291
but the same goes
for Julius and his crew.

41
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,750
And, you know,
I'm even indebted to Otto.

42
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:59,000
- Sorry. Were you trying
to say something to me?

43
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,875
- Nah, nothing in particular.

44
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm just super grateful
to you, too, buddy!

45
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,666
- [gasps] My goodness.
What brought that on?

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,833
You're making me blush.

47
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:08,875
- Also...

48
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:11,833
[chuckles]

49
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,708
- What's wrong, Subaru?
- [gasps]

50
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,208
Oh! [laughs] Just, uh--

51
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,166
So listen, Mili.

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,250
[sighs]

53
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,208
There's something
extremely important

54
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,000
that I need to tell you.

55
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,416
- Okay. What is it?

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,833
- This is gonna be
pretty hard for me to say,

57
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:31,708
but please hear me out.

58
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,625
And of course
it goes without saying

59
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,000
that I am completely prepared

60
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,583
to be knocked out by Ram
when I tell her!

61
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,000
But I wanted you
to hear it first.

62

- [grunts]

63
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,875
- This is--
This is actually about Rem.

64
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,375
She--She said that, uh...

65
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,375
<i>- And you'll still</i>
<i>keep me by your side</i>

66
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,000
<i>no matter where you go</i>
<i>from now on?</i>

67
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,250
- S-So you see
what I'm getting at, right?

68
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,166
I mean, well, Rem said

69
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,041
some really nice things
to me, and, uh...

70
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,000
- Easy, Subaru. Just calm down.

71
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,166
Now, I'm not exactly sure
what you're trying to say to me,

72
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,750
but I can tell it means a lot

73
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,375
and you're trying your hardest
to say it, okay?

74
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,958
Just take it slow,
like a good boy.

75
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,250
- "Like a good boy," huh?
Not exactly encouraging.

76
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,125
But all right. Here goes.

77
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,250
[grunts]

78
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,041
Time for me to man up!

79
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,750
Come right out, and say it!

80
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,333
You see...

81
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,083
the thing is,
Rem said that she loves me,

82
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,375
and she meant it in the same way
I told you that I love you!

83
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,833
All right, there! I said it!

- Yes?

88
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,875
- I'm confused.

89
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,291
Who is Rem?

CRUSCH: You don't look
very happy, Rem. What's wrong?

97
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,333
Listen, there's
nothing to worry about.

98
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,500
- I know, but...

99
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,500
- We've got
the best of the best here.

100
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,083
Felix, Wilhelm, and all
of those volunteers are with us.

101
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:51,083
Ricardo and the Iron Fang
are lending us their aid, too,

102
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,291
so there's no way we can lose.

103
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,208
- Yes, I'm sure you're right.
It's kind of selfish of me

104
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,208
to worry despite all that,
isn't it?

105
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,125
- Just remember
what Subaru Natsuki said.

- [gasps]

107
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,375
- Try to smile,

108
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,000
because you look best
when you're smiling.

Honestly...

113
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,041
that Subaru
is such a troublemaker.

114
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,125
[sighs]

115
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,083
Well, I'm sure you'd look

116
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,333
quite different
with a smile, too.

117
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,291
You always carry yourself
with such dignity.

118
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,041
I believe you'd look so lovely
if you'd smile now and then.

119
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,333
- Maybe so.

120
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:35,166
Unfortunately I'm not very good
at that sort of thing.

121
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,375
It's actually
something I still regret,

- I wish
you wouldn't have done that.

137
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,500
Why run me over
when I'm not doing anything?

138
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,333
That's not something any
decent human being would try,

139
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,291
if you ask me.

140
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,041
- How dare
you do such a brutal thing

141
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,000
to those brave
and loyal soldiers?

142
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,625
Now tell me,
just who are you, anyway?

143
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,333
- Ah, I see. Things are
becoming much clearer.

144
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,291
You have no idea who I am.

145
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,583
On the other hand,
I know exactly who you are.

146
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,375
You're a candidate
to be the next ruler

147
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,291
of this fair nation.

148
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,125
- Whoever you are,
you talk too much.

149
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,500
Answer my question!

150
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,541
Next time, I will kill you!

151
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,375
- Come on, now.
That's just mean.

152
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,750
But I suppose one could never
hope to properly rule a
country

of arrogance.

I can't comprehend
that sensibility myself...

- I warned you!
- but I do recognize its place.

156
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,041
- No second chances!

157

- Huh?
- [gasps]

158

Now listen here!

159
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,333
Who taught you
that it was acceptable behavior

160
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:23,083
to swing a sword at someone
while they're speaking?

161
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,666
I do believe that's a violation

to freely express myself!

but it's never enough!

I eat. I devour.

and just look at this bounty!

191
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,416
I expected them
to be a good, ripe bunch,

192
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,250

managed to kill a beast

that had been rampaging
unchecked for over 400 years,

I absolutely despise

silently watching me sleep.

331
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,083
Rem...

332
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,458
I am so sorry.

333
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,166
I kept trying
to sound all brave,

334
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,416
saying that I'd die
as many times as it takes.

335
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,416
[sighs] But it just
doesn't seem to matter.

336
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,583
I never make it in time.

337
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,375
[shudders]

338
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,750
- [energy pulsing]
- [gasps]

339
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,958
Oh, hey, Puck. It's only you.

340
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,958
- "Only" me?
That wasn't necessary.

341
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,291
You're so mean.

342
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,208
- It is getting
pretty late, you know.

343
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,833
What brings you
over here, anyway?

344
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,208
- I have a strong connection
with this girl, too, remember?

345
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,375
So what's the matter
with me taking the time

346
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,208
to drop by and check in on her?

347
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,166
- [gasps] Wait a minute.
- Hmm?

348
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,291
- Couldn't you help her out?

349
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,083
- Eh, you'd think so, but sorry.

350
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,541
Not even my power
can do anything to wake her up

351
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,750
from the kind of sleep
that she's in.

352
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,416
- [sighs]

353
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,166
- Now, it might not do much
to make up for that...

354
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,500
- Hmm?
- but I could give you

355
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,833
a little information
about Gluttony if you like.

356
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,000
- And who's that?

357
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,500
- He just so happens
to be the individual

358
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,583
who devoured
her name and memories.

359
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,500
- [gasps]

360
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,458
- To put it simply,

361
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,625
the Authority of Gluttony
is a power for eating.

362
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,833
He can eat someone's name and
make everyone forget about them

363
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,000
or make that person

364
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,041
lose their own memories
by eating them.

365
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,958
If both your name and memories
are taken using this power,

366
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,625
there won't be anything
left of you, but an empty shell,

367
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,916
And that's exactly
what happened to her.

368
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,791
- [shudders]

369
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,041
- Subaru.

370
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,708
- Yeah? What is it?

371
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,000
- I hate to ask a favor of you

372
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,208
when you've already got
so much on your mind, but...

373
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,166
- Eh?

374
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,708
- Take care of Lia for me.

375
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,875
I'm really
counting on you, okay?

376
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,708
[chuckles]

377
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,666
CRUSCH: So this is
where you were. How is she?

378
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,583
- As of right now,
there haven't been any changes.

379
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,208
'Course, it's not as if I
can do something to help.

380
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,500
I know I'm weak and pathetic,
so all I can do is worry.

381
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,708
- No, that's not true at all.

382
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,291
Whether she can show it or not,

383
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,958
I believe your presence
made her quite happy.

384
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,916
- [stammers]

385
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,208
- I'm sorry.

386
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,583
I crossed a line, didn't I?

387
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,041
I've made you upset.

388
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,750
- I'm okay.

389
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,041
Anyway, why'd you
come up here looking for me?

390
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,541
Was there something you needed?

391
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,666
- Yes. Everyone's
gathered in the lounge

392
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,250
to discuss the current state
of affairs, and I was told...

393
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,166
to get, uh...

394
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,333
[sighs]

395
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,791
- It's Subaru Natsuki. Remember?

396
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:15,500
- I'm sorry. Of course.

397
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,791
You're Subaru Natsuki.

398
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,916
I'm told that I owe you
a great deal,

399
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,875
and yet I've been nothing
but rude. Please forgive
me.

400
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,750
- It's okay.
Don't worry about it,

401
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,916
'cause I'm sure
you must have a lot of things

402
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,125
on your mind right now.

403
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,750
It's not a big deal, really.

404
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,666
Just forget it.

405
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:33,791
FELIX: I'm sorry for making you

406
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,166
deliver that message,
Miss Crusch!

407
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,166
- No, it's quite all right,
Felix. Thank you, though.

408
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,666
FELIX: Enough with
the formalities!

409
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,708
You and I have
known each other for ages.

410
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,625
It makes me sad
when you talk to me

411
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,250
like you don't
know me very well.

412
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,958
- I'm sorry.

413
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,583
I know it won't be like before,

414
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,166
but I'll try my best.

415
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,291
Is that okay, Felix?

416
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,791
- Oh, absolutely!
There's no need to rush.

417
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,791
Just know that you
can always count on me

418
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,500
to be on your side,
no matter what!

419
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,791
But I must confess,
this is kinda fun!

420
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:05,125
It feels like I'm seeing
a whole new side of you
now!

421
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,625
- [gasps]

422
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,041
- Are you all right?
- Huh?

423
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,583
Yeah, I'm okay.

424
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,833
I've had some time
to calm down a bit.

425
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,125
I'm fine now. Thank you.

426
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,958
- Well, now that Mr. Subaru
and Miss Crusch have returned,

427
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,541
let us get down to business,
shall we, everyone?

428
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,166
- Then, why don't
we begin by reviewing

429
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,083
where we all currently stand?

430
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,416
By the time the Iron Fang
members who got away

431
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,416
brought back reinforcements
from the capital,

432
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,208
the only ones left were
the casualties and also, uh...

433
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:35,416
- Those who now find themselves
in situations similar to mine.

434
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,333
- So then,
Crusch's memories were eaten,

435
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:42,000
and Rem lost both her name
and all of her memories. Damn.

436
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,791
- The capital has also had
many cases of memory loss

437
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,333
that no healer could fix,
like what Miss Crusch's
got,

438
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,375
and an unexplained malady
rendering people
unconscious

439
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,750
that they're calling
the "Sleeping Beauty disease."

440
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,041
But now we know all these things
originated from the same source.

441
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,916
WILHELM: Indeed.

442
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,958
They're the work
of the Witch's Cult.

443
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,416
- [gasps]

444
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,750
- I meant nothing
against you, Miss Crusch,

445
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,291
so please forgive me,

446
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,708
and I must sincerely apologize
for frightening you.

447
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,708
- No, I'm the one
who should apologize

448
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,458
for being
such a hopeless master.

449
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,208
I've been trying my hardest
to remember you as well,

450
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,166
but I'm still having
some difficulty.

451
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:19,833
- [sighs]

452
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,041
We finally took care of Sloth,

453
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,041
and now there's
another Sin Archbishop

454
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,166
mucking up everything?

455
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,041
I gotta say, this really sucks.

456
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,333
But we all knew from the moment

457
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,000
Miss Emilia became a candidate
in the royal selection,

458
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,166
the Witch's Cult
was sure to get involved.

459
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,916
- So maybe everything
really is my fault after all.

460
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,083
- FELIX: Oh, definitely.
- [Subaru gasps]

461
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,750
FELIX: They're fixated
on getting rid of Emilia,

462
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,250
the one they see
as the half-elf troublemaker.

463
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,708
What's going on now

464
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,291
is just a tiny part
of whatever diabolical--

465
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,791
SUBARU: Stop it!
That's ridiculous!

466
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,041
Try thinking a little more
before you open your mouth!

467
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,833
The only ones at fault here
are those cultist scumbags!

468
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,750
Don't put all the blame
on the wrong person!

469
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,083
Hurting your own allies
with misdirected guilt

470
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,458
won't help anything!

471
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,833
- Huh? That's so much
more convincing

472
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,166
coming from you, Subaru.

473
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,750
I guess it's the difference
in experience?

474
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,208
- CRUSCH: Felix.
- Eh?

475
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,125
- I'm not going to ignore
the comment you just made.

476
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,791
- Oh.
- Apologize now.

477
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,291
- [moans]

478
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,000
- Subaru Natsuki
is absolutely right.

479
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,000
It's crystal clear
where the blame

480
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,250
should fall in this matter.
Understand?

481
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,875
You have no ground to stand on

482
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,791
when you ridicule someone
simply for being correct.

483
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,875
- [whimpers] Of course.

484
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,458
Yes, Miss Crusch.

485
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,833
I apologize, Miss Emilia.

486
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,708
And you as well, Subaru.

487
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:36,958
- Just forget about it.

488
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,041
Think we should get back
on topic now, okay?

489
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,416
- Sure,
but let me say this first.

490
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,333
- Huh?

491
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,500
- Regarding the alliance

492
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,416
that we were all
speaking of earlier...

493
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,791
can't we just scrap that idea?

494
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,166
- Wait. What do
you mean by that?

495
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,583
How did this discussion somehow
lead to dissolving the alliance?

496
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,833
FELIX: They're only formed

497
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,500
when it benefits
every party involved, right?

498
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,333
Yet you expect us
to align ourselves

499
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,041
with Miss Emilia,
the enemy's target?

500
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,583
Knowing what we know right now,
can you solemnly swear

501
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,250
that Miss Crusch won't be
hurt again if we do that?

502
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,208
- [gasps]

503
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,000
You may have a point.

504
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,041
WILHELM: I'm sorry, but I
am
opposed to that opinion.

505
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,875
- Why would you be against
such a thing, Old Man Wil?!

506
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,583
Look what's happened
to Miss Crusch!

507
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,416
Why should we keep helping
Miss Emilia and her
friends?

508
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,125
I don't see the point!

509
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,875
- Has it yet occurred to you,

510
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,041
with regard to this
Gluttony
who attacked Miss Crusch,

511
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,166
we may be given a chance
to exact our revenge?

512
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,708
- So is vengeance more important
than her actual life?

513
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,541
- I don't think so!
- Felix, please.

514
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,250
- 'Cause I know how difficult
this must be for her.

515
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,958
She has no idea what's going on,
and she can't remember anything,

516
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,375
so how can you possibly
expect her to fight, then?!

517
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,125
I'm only thinking of you
and your best interests.

518
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,458
I'm certain that I can do
something about your memories.

519
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,458
Even if it's
just a little right now,

520
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,250
I'll eventually fix them
completely with my magic!

521
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,125
So please don't put yourself
in any more danger!

522
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:06,875
- [sighs]

523
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:13,250
Thank you.
I do appreciate your concern.

524
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,500
At this particular moment,

525
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,416
there's simply too much
I don't understand.

526
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,416
I can't remember a single detail

527
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,000
about just who it was
that I used to be.

528
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,541
I'm sure each of you
must be completely puzzled

529
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,125
as to how you should
interact with me, too.

530
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,125
And for that, to everyone

531
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,416
who still retains their respect
for me despite this,

532
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,708
I must express my thanks.

533
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,541
- Huh?

534
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,208
- Felix, I know
your concern for me is genuine

535
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,208
and that you're trying to
guide me down the safest path.

536
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,958
I could simply do as you wish
and remain out of harm's way,

537
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,333
and nobody here
would think less of me,

538
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,708
but I absolutely loathe
the thought

539
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,625
of going on with my life,
knowing nothing.

540
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,416
If I have a choice
in the matter,

541
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,000
I would rather choose for myself
than simply do as someone says.

542
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,000
- [shudders]

543
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,166
Miss Crusch, I only wanted to...

544
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,250
[crying]

545
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,208
- Thank you, Felix.

546
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,541
- [crying]

547
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,166
- If this is Miss Crusch's will
on the matter,

548
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,083
surely no one favors
dissolving the alliance.

549
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,416
- Yes, that's right.

550
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,666
I know I'll be a great deal
of trouble to you,

551
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,250
so please allow me
to apologize in advance.

552
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,000
- No, really, it's all right.

553
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,291
Though we can't exactly say

554
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,041
we're all
on the same page now, either.

555
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:55,833
Let's rejoin Ram and those
at the Sanctuary and talk.

556
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:59,666
We should apprise Roswaal
of this, too.

557
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,375
[Subaru grunts]

[sighs]

560
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:12,416
You once told me I was strong,

561
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,875
but without you,
I just feel so uncertain.

562
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,500
I can't even manage
to find the Subaru

563
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,416
who could put on
that tough guy act. I'm lost.

[door opens]

565
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,333
EMILIA: I knew you'd be here.

566
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,500
- [gasps]

567
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,541
Oh, Emilia.

568
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:31,666
Did you need something?

569
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,416
- Well, am I not allowed
to be in here if I don't?

570
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,208
After all,
I know this girl, too.

571
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,458
I believe you said
her name was Miss Rem.

572
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,583
- "Miss Rem," huh? Yeah.

573
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,500
- Oh, that's right.

574
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,666
When you were asking me
about her earlier,

575
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,041
I just called her "Rem."

576
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:51,583
- You got to know her
while being Roswaal's guest.

577
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:55,291
I don't need to explain
that she's Ram's sister, do I?

578
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,250
- No. I can tell.

579
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,208
She looks just like her.

580
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,541
There's no mistaking that.

581
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,583
Subaru, you haven't slept,
have you?

582
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,208
Maybe you should rest
for a while.

583
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:11,500
- Maybe. I've got no reason
to be tired, though.

584
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:13,291
What can I do, anyway?

585
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:17,458
- Look, I can tell you want to
do something about all of this.

586
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,666
If your spirit is
desperately trying to help,

587
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,416
after a while, the stress will
eventually wear your body out,

588
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,791
so please, rest.

589
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,750
- [chuckles]

590
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,750
Man, I am so pathetic.

591
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,291
What a joke.

592
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,250
- No, that's not true,

593
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,541
because you've helped me
so much, Subaru,

594
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,333
and in so many ways.

595
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,666
I really mean it.

596
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,208
Everything will be just fine.

597
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:45,250
Not that I have any right
to talk like I'm certain,

598
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:49,666
but I want to understand,
to know how you feel,

599
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,166
though I don't remember
this girl at all.

600
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,125
And that makes me think,

601
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,625
whatever I say would only end up
hurting you, instead of helping.

602
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:05,166
Either way, please let me
tell you something.

603
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,458
I want you to know

604
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:10,291
you don't have to carry
this burden all by yourself,

605
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:11,708
so let me share it.

606
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,708
Whatever you need,
I'm here to help.

607
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:16,458
- But, Emilia...

608
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,208
why, though?

609
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,541
You already told me you don't
remember anything about her.

610
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,625
- Is it wrong to want to help

611
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,958
simply because
I don't remember her?

612
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,250
She's obviously
important enough to you

613
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:31,291
that what happened to her
is making you miserable, right?

614
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:34,166
So then, is it really so strange

615
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,750
that it makes me want
to help her, too?

616
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,208
- [gasps]

617
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,208
- You saved me, remember?

618
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,833
I want the opportunity
to save you this time.

619
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,666
If you're in pain,
I want to help you.

620
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,250
I want to do something!

621
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,875
- You're amazing, Mili.
You know that?

622
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,666
- I am? I think
you're much more amazing

623
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,833
than I could ever be.

624
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,750
- No, I'm really not.

625
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,791
I'm glad it was you.

626
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:12,875
- [gasps]

627
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,250
- [chuckles]

628
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:21,458
Hey, Emilia, I have
a small favor to ask of you.

629
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,833
Sure. What is it?

630
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,583
- Could you please
turn around for me?

631
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:27,291
I'm gonna cry.

632
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,375
- [sighs] Yes, of course.

633
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,875
- [crying]

634
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:04,708
[gasps]

635
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:21,791
I swear I'll get you back.

636
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,416
I promise you.

637
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,500
I will get you back.

638
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,916
Your hero
is going to come for you!

639
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,666
I give you my word!

640
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,416
Just wait for me...

641
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,416
Rem.
