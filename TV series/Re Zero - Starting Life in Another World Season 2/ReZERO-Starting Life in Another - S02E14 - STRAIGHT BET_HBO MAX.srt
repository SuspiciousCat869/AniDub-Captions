- [Subaru groaning]

3
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:07,708
Huh?

4
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,125
- That's enough.

5
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,166
Stop putting on
a tough-guy front

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,041
around your friends,
Subaru Natsuki!

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,666
Your head is nothing
but a big, jumbled mess now,

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,125
and you have no idea
what you're going to do, right?!

9
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,250
You get into situations where
you have to reach out and
help,

10
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,666
but your arms and mind are both
too weak to reach far enough,

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,375
so all you ever end up
doing
is wasting precious time

12
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,708
and desperately
flailing around!

13
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:31,541
- [gasps]

14
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,541
- Do you hear me talking to you?

15
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:37,166
If you do, then say something!

16
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,375
- [groans]
What the hell was that for?!

17
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,375
[yelps]

18
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,041
- Looks like you finally
managed to lose your
temper,

19
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,250
but you paid no attention
to your footing.

20
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,416
I guess that pretty much sums
you up perfectly, doesn't it?

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,291
Pathetic.

22
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,875
- Oh, yeah?

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,416
[yelps]

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,541
[groans]

25
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,000
- That's really
all the strength

26
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,541
you're able to muster up,
isn't it?

27
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:05,125
Now putting on an act for a
girl
that you care about is fine,

28
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,708
and you can do the same thing

29
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,750
with a girl who likes you, too.
Nobody would disagree.

30
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:12,708
But that is it.
That's as far as it goes!

31
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,750
Deep down, you know that
you're just not good
enough.

32
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,583
You know you can't reach,
don't you?

33
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,416
You want to impress that girl
you like, don't you?!

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,291
And be someone
the girl who likes you

35
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,458
can be proud of,
now, don't you?!

36
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,208
Then why? Why don't you ever
try
and accept help from someone?!

37
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,750
Someone...

38
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,541
who's truly your friend.

39
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,750
- I-I did that. I tried.

40
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,500
I reached out
to somebody for help,

41
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,166
but it still didn't work.

42
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,625
- Okay.

43
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:48,333
- But you didn't ask me.
- [gasps]

44
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,625
- As far as I can recall,
you never have.

45
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,333
- Well, I--uh, the thing is...

46
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,125
My head is just full of knots.

47
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,333
It's overloaded with stuff

48
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,458
that you wouldn't believe
if I told you.

49
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,500
And honestly,
I don't even know how to begin.

50
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,708
- Just start talking.
I'll listen until you finish.

51
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:14,208
- Yeah, but if I do that, then--

52
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,750
- Stop it! What did I tell you
about putting up a front?

53
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,125
If you have the time

54
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,666
to overcomplicate
all these thoughts in your head,

55
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,625
then go ahead,
and spit them out!

56
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,666
- Easy for you to say,
but I can't--

57
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,375
- Spit out
each one of those knots!

58
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,708
And when you're finished,

59
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,916
just tell me to believe
every single word!

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,541
'Cause that's what friends do!

61
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,791
- [sighs]

62
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,875
[wind blowing]

63
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,583
All right.

64
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,375
You might not believe me, but...

65
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,458
[music playing]

66
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,500
SUBARU: Roswaal!

67
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,708
We need to make a bet,

68
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,791
one where the stakes are my wish
and yours all on the line!

69
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,791
- [singing in Japanese]

70
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,500
- I must admit I'm more
than a bit surprised to see you.

71
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,708
I certainly didn't
expect
to do so again in this
life.

72
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,875
- Let's consider this wager
to be our final showdown.

73
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,208
I'm gonna rescue the Sanctuary
and the mansion in this loop.

74
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,875
No matter what it takes,
I'll do it.

75
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,500
I'll throw a wrench into
every damn one of your plans.

76
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,916
- You want to start over now,
when you have me in check,

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,208
but in doing so, you would
leave behind your only power.

78
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,916
- [gasps]
Being able to start over

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,375
and being able to save them
are different things.

80
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,833
You and I were both
too arrogant.

81
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,416
As far as I'm concerned,

82
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,333
this power
isn't even all that useful.

83
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,416
- Fine, I'll bite.

84
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,250
If you say this
is the last time,

85
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,583
what is it you want from me?

86
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,416
- Actually, my demands
are plain and simple.

87
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,541
If I manage to save both
the Sanctuary and the mansion...

88
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,833
- [gasps]

89
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,916
- you'll ditch that book
and come with me.

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,708
Emilia will be the new ruler.

91
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,000
I can make this happen, but I'm
gonna need your help to do it.

92
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,541
- Ridiculous.

93
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,750
What you're suggesting here
is absolutely warped.

94
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:13,916
How could you
ever forgive what I--

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,750
- If this hinged on me forgiving
you, I wouldn't even ask.

96
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,000
'cause there's no way in hell
I'll ever do that.

97
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,875
Instead, I'll have to learn
to bury that to get what I want.

98
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,458
Up until this point,

99
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,583
nothing deadly
has happened at all.

100
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,000
So if I solve things
this time...

101
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:28,916
Get it?

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,375
- How can such an idea
be so convenient?

103
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,833
- Hey, come on!
I love convenient ideas!

104
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,750
Emilia's gonna do her best
to become the next ruler,

105
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,250
and I'll be by her side
to congratulate her.

106
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,958
I want you to be there
as a part of her entourage.

107
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,541
That will be mandatory,
of course.

108
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,250
- [gasps]

109
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,958
You really expect
to fulfill your desire

110
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,041
without letting go of anything?

111
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,958
Furthermore, you're saying
that my involvement is necessary

112
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,833
and insist on including me in
the foundation for the future?

113
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,500
You can see it, can't you?

114
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,041
- See what?

115
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,291
- The audacity to believe
that you can have it all,

116
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,416
the utter greed
of that solution.

117
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,458
- [gasps]

118
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,500
[chuckles]

119
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,583
Your enemy has become
the strongest card in play here.

120
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,458
Is that still
not enough for you?

121
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,416
- No matter how you may fight it
or what you have in mind,

122
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,875
you cannot break through this.

123
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,666
With Miss Emilia
unable to stand,

124
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,833
the barrier will remain.

125
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,958
The Sanctuary
will be covered in snow,

126
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,541
and the mansion
will become a bloodbath.

127
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,041
- Uh-huh.

128
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,625
That ought to make the
sight
of you crying even better.

129
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,375
- I see now.
You make a good point.

130
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,041
It isn't the worst idea
in the world

131
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,041
to start laying some groundwork
for the next me.

132
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,458
- [laughs] If you're
willing to admit that,

133
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,166
does it mean
you're agreeing to the bet?

134
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,791
- [chuckles]

135
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,875
- Well, since it looks
like things are all settled,

136
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,750
I can get started.

137
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,666
- Oh, Subaru...

138
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,250
the snow in the Sanctuary

139
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,250
and the attack on the mansion
begin in three days.

140
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,375
Do try your hardest to fight it
and fail miserably.

141
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,625
- Whatever you say.

142
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,250
Put your face on!

143
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,083
I've gotten used
to the clown makeup,

144
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,541
and you're
throwin' off my game.

145
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,458
As two clowns
at the mercy of fate,

146
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,333
I say we fight this out
fair and square.

147
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,541
- How are things going
with that conspiracy

148
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,875
you're plotting
with your friend?

149
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,083
- What about you?
Have you come to accept

150
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,791
what it is
that Roswaal's doing?

151
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,583
- I think you should know
the answer.

152
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,208
There's only one thing
I value above all else,

153
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,916
and there will never be anything
to alter that. Understand?

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,208
So don't bother waiting around
for me to change my mind.

155
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,083
- You know what they say.
"Never say never."

156
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,583
- Enough. Be quiet.

157
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,958
You've placed your hopes
in Miss Emilia?

158
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:01,750
- Yes, I have. I believe in her.

159
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,666
- She still hasn't
been able to figure out

160
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,958
why she's been struggling.

161
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:05,916
- [gasps]

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,833
- And until then,
the outcome won't change.

163
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,541
- We've already strayed
from what's written in the book.

164
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,750
Roswaal's free now, understand?

165
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,500
She actually gave me
some advice.

166
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,625
Hold on. She doesn't
like me, too, does she?

167
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,916
Now don't just go and
blurt out something like that,

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,875
'cause if she heard
what you said about her,

169
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,958
she'd be furious.

170
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,583
Besides, with Miss Ram
working with the margrave,

171
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,208
doesn't that make
you two enemies?

172
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,208
- Uh, wait. Ram's my enemy?

173
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,166
- [gasps]

174
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,625
[sighs]

175
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,625
Never crossed your mind, huh?

176
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,166
Well, I see how deeply
you trust her now.

177
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,833
So what happened
with the margrave himself?

178
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,125
- Everything's set.

179
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,833
Our wager is officially on.

180
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,625
- That's good to hear.

181
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,416
Of course,
I don't think he's ever lost

182
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,583
at anything before
in his entire life,

183
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,708
so I was pretty sure he'd agree.

184
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,041
But now for the next step...

185
00:07:56,125 --> 00:08:00,291
- Oh, yeah, right. Garfiel.

186
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,750
Before that, there's something
I'd like to look into first.

187
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,875
- Okay. Sounds good

188
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,666
And I'll continue on
with my part of the plan.

189
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,791
But, uh, what about Miss Emilia?

190
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,291
- I won't be able to rely
on your help with that one.

191
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,625
Honestly,
I can't even rely on myself.

192
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,125
I haven't even
scratched the surface

193
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,875
of what's hurting her.

194
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,708
Maybe I'm a little scared
of what I'll find.

195
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,583
- Oh, there's no doubt of that,

196
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,625
so don't even try
to play that one off.

197
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,208
- Hey, easy!

198
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,208
- Tell me, are you prepared

199
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,833
to scratch the surface
this time and go deeper?

200
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:39,541
- Well, at the very least,

201
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,166
I am prepared
to ask her about it.

202
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,708
Unlike Garfiel, I don't
have to worry about dying.

203
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,000
- That's dark.
Guess I'm not sure

204
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,625
if I should
laugh at that or not.

205
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,250
- Ah, don't worry about it.

206
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,208
Anyway, you've always
been a risk taker, right?

207
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,083
- I suppose so.
But taking on a bet

208
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,291
without even considering
my odds of winning...

209
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,666
that's a first for me.

210
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,625
[leaves rustling]

211
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,250
- Ah. I thought
you'd be here, Ryuzu.

212
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,916
Guess I was right.

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,958
- That's rather peculiar.
You talk like someone

214
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,000
who already knows me
remarkably well.

215
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,500
- You're right about that.

216
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,208
I'd say I know
just about everything,

217
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,208
even what your goal is here.

218
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:27,083
- Then I suppose the one
Young Roz was waiting
for...

219
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,083
- was you.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

220
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,875
That whole thing's
been called off.

221
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,541
- Huh?
- Anyway, I'm in the middle

222
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,750
of a huge showdown
with Roswaal now.

223
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,250
I want it to end in a way
that's good for everybody,

224
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:42,833
which is why I'm here,
and I was hoping you'd help me.

225
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,125
- Why not use
your authority as an apostle

226
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,041
to demand my assistance?

227
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,541
- I don't want to rely on that.
- Huh?

228
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,916
- Listen, I came out here
to talk to you one-on-one.

229
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,250
- Young men are so quick
to put on a tough front.

230
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,250
Now, what seems
to be the trouble?

231
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,875
- Well, basically, I guess
you could say the two of us

232
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,041
are in an argument
about liberating the Sanctuary.

233
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,125
I know that you're against it,

234
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,708
but I still thought your insight
would be helpful to me.

235
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,833
- You think I am opposed
to freeing the Sanctuary?

236
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,291
- Huh? Wait a minute.
Are you saying you're not?!

237
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,041
Seriously?!
You've gotta be kidding me!

238
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,875
Then why did you...

239
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,333
- [sighs]

240
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:28,166
Though your suspicions
are not entirely misguided.

241
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,250
- What?
- Tell me,

242
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,208
what is your opinion
of Young Gar?

243
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,708
- Well, frankly

244
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't think there's a way
to avoid clashing with him.

245
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,250
- I see.
- Although...

246
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,000
I haven't given up yet.

247
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:43,958
Maybe,
when everything's behind us,

248
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,458
we can still be friends
in spite of all that.

249
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,708
- Huh?

250
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,916
- At least,
it's what I'd prefer, anyway.

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,291
So to try and
make that happen,

252
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,833
I'd like to find out
some more about him.

253
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,333
- [sighs]

254
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,291
I must say
you are quite skilled

255
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,791
at deceiving the elderly,
Young Su.

256
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,833
I believe you asked the witch
about me, did you not,

257
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,208
regarding the copies
of Ryuzu Meyer

258
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,041
and possibly even the purpose

259
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,541
of creating them
in the first place.

260
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,000
- She told me about
the immortality experiment

261
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,291
and that you Ryuzus were
the successful cases for
it.

262
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,416
- To this very day,
I protect and oversee

263
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,250
the crystal
that creates the copies.

264
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,208
The four of us alternate
bearing the role of supervisor.

265
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,416
That has been our arrangement.

266
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,000
- Right, I did hear
about the "first four."

267
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,208
Which means that the other three
besides you must be...

268
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,958
[gasps] My name
is Subaru Natsuki.

269
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,250
What's yours, your full name?

270
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,750
- Ah, yes.
My name is Ryuzu Arma,

271
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,541
and I am one
of the first four copies.

272
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,166
- Arma?

273
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,208
-<i> I am Ryuzu Bilma.</i>

274
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:02,333
- The first Ryuzu I ran into
called herself "Bilma."

275
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,416
I know that you never intended
to hide things from me,

276
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,166
but I don't understand.
Why go through all the hassle?

277
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,750
- Our bodies are not like yours,
made of flesh and blood.

278
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,166
They are made of artificial od
clothed in mana.

279
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,375
Any task consumes that mana,

280
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:22,125
making continuous activity
for a full day impossible.

281
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,708
- So in other words,
you're like the spirits then,

282
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,333
and that's why the four of you
need to keep alternating.

283
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,416
But are--are you okay with that?

284
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,416
- You are very kind to ask,
Young Su.

285
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,333
[clears throat]

286
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,291
However, there is an exception.

287
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,458
One of the first four,
Ryuzu Shima,

288
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,875
is not quite the same
as the rest of us.

289
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,041
- Ryuzu Shima?

290
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,958
-<i> I will tell no one.</i>

291
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,833
<i>You have my word</i>
<i>on the name of Ryuzu Shima.</i>

292
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,541
- About ten years ago,
she caused quite a problem.

293
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,958
She was removed
from the role of supervisor

294
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,041
and is now living in the forest
with the other copies.

295
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,291
For that reason,

296
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,833
three of us fulfill
the supervisor role now.

297
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,500
- So what did she do, exactly?

298
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:11,041
- She violated the contract
with the witch who created us

299
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,416
by entering the graveyard.

300
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,291
Her goal was
to bring back Young Gar

301
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,458
when he broke the rules
by attempting to face the trial

302
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,833
- and did not return.
- [gasps]

303
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,208
- I have not seen Shima once

304
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,958
since she was stripped
of her duty.

305
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,375
But it would be no surprise

306
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,583
if Young Gar
has been meeting with her,

307
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,458
with whom he shares memories
that we do not.

308
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,250
- I'm not sure
I understand what you mean.

309
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,875
- I'm referring to the past

310
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,166
that Young Gar saw
in the graveyard trial.

311
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,000
- [gasps]

312
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,333
- Are you aware
of the circumstances

313
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,625
surrounding
his family situation?

314
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,958
- Well, I know
that Frederica is his sister,

315
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:48,791
but they have
different fathers,

316
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,833
and since she has
less non-human blood,

317
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:52,958
she left the Sanctuary
ten years ago.

318
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,541
<i>Tell me, why did you</i>
<i>leave the Sanctuary?</i>

319
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,458
<i>- I suppose I wanted to</i>
<i>try</i>
<i>and set things in</i>
<i>motion.</i>

320
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,000
<i>I wanted to create</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

321
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,375
<i>and give all the people there</i>

322
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,875
<i>the option to leave</i>
<i>once the barrier was broken.</i>

323
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,125
<i>I needed to make</i>
<i>a place for them.</i>

324
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,208
- At least,
that's what she told me.

325
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,583
Wait a minute.
Did the past that Garfiel saw

326
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,333
involve the time she left?

327
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:24,125
- I don't think so. I believe
what he saw was most likely

328
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,916
the moment that Young Gar
and Fred were left behind

329
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,250
by their mother when she
departed from this place.

330
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,583
<i>- That poor Garfiel</i>
<i>is pitifully dimwitted,</i>

331
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,166
<i>and he's petrified</i>
<i>of the outside world.</i>

332
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,958
- [gasps]

333
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,583
So he's against liberating
the Sanctuary

334
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,833
because of what his mother did,
choosing the outside.

335
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,875
It's his bitterness
from being abandoned?

336
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,291
- The boy has chosen to refer
to himself as Garfiel Tinzel.

337
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,083
That is
his mother's family name.

338
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:58,875
I believe he goes by that name
so he will not ever forget her.

339
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,083
Whether it was done out of anger

340
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,416
or out of sadness, however,

341
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,833
is something most likely known
only to him and to Shima.

342
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,916
[knock at the door]

343
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,916
- Emilia, you here?

344
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,041
Where'd she...

345
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,125
[door closes]

346
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,375
- Subaru?

347
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,041
- What are you doing down there?

348
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,333
You're just gonna get dirty.

349
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:29,125
- Oh, I'm a restless sleeper.

350
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,958
I'm sorry. That's a lie.

351
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,083
The truth is,
I couldn't get to sleep.

352
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,583
But don't worry,
because I'll be sure

353
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,166
to get plenty of rest
by tonight, okay?

354
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,958
It's almost noon already,
though.

355
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,250
Are you talking about sleeping
'til it's nighttime?

356
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,041
Come on, Mili.

357
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,375
[sing-song]
That's pretty slothful.

358
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,250
- [sighs] The way you said that,

359
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,291
it just gives me
a really weird feeling.

360
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,125
[sighs] You can be so mean.

361
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,041
- [chuckles]

362
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,125
- Oh. Thank you.

363
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,916
- Now listen. I want to know
if you feel up to telling me

364
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,208
exactly what it is
you saw during the trial?

365
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,625
- [gasps]

366
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,750
- I make no guarantee

367
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,958
you'll feel better
talking about all this,

368
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,333
but still, if you do,
we'll worry about it together.

369
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,500
Now, I'm not sure
that I can be of any help,

370
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,208
but would you
give me the right

371
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,083
to fight
the same enemies you do?

372
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,583
- [gasps]

373
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,166
Subaru, you--

374
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,625
you always have
so much faith in me.

375
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,666
- [breathes deeply]
- [stone clinks]

376
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,708
[sighs]

377
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,208
I'll try.

378
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:42,708
- [gasps]

379
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,000
- The past that I saw,

380
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,416
I think--
I think it was a memory

381
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,625
from before I went to sleep.

382
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,625
I'm almost positive
that I never told you this,

383
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,583
but, for quite a long time,
I was frozen in ice.

384
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,916
- I don't understand. You--

385
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,333
- For years,
I was out there in the forest,

386
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,625
frozen and alone.

387
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,833
That is, until Puck
found me and got me out.

388
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,500
If he hadn't come along
and saved me,

389
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,416
there's no telling how long
I would have stayed like that.

390
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,416
- How long had it been?

391
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
- Since I was six or seven.

392
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,333
We all lived
in the forest together

393
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,375
- before it froze, I think.
- You think?

394
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:23,375
- The time before my rescue
is just kind of a blur.

395
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,291
- And what about your family?

396
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,000
- I don't remember
my family being in the forest.

397
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,750
But there was someone
who was like a mother.

398
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,333
Huh? Hold on.

399
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,750
[gasps]

400
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,750
My...

401
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,583
my mother?

402
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,583
- [gasps]

403
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,250
- [crying]

404
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,208
- Calm down. Take it slow.

405
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,125
What do you remember?

406
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,416
Please tell me about it.

407
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,375
- [shudders] They were...

408
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,375
like me...

409
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,583
frozen in ice.

410
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:58,000
I lived in that same forest
with Puck.

411
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:02,083
We were waiting there
for all of them to wake up.

412
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,541
But that day never came.

413
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,333
So I finally left

414
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,541
and then joined
in the royal selection.

415
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,625
- Uh, what does the forest have
to do with the royal selection?

416
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,250
- It was Roswaal.
He made me a promise.

417
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,750
<i>- If you succeed</i>
<i>in taking the throne,</i>

418
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,375
<i>perhaps I can find a way</i>

419
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,625
<i>to thaw the ice</i>
<i>that encases this forest</i>

420
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,000
- Does that make you
think less of me?

421
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,708
All the other candidates
who are participating,

422
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,083
they all seem to have

423
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,833
such solid goals
and resolutions in mind,

424
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,291
but my reason is something
that's very personal.

425
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:43,750
- So is that the selfish reason
you were talking about before?

426
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,166
There's nothing bad
about wanting to rescue others,

427
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,125
especially the ones
you care about.

428
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,833
Whether it's a lot of people
or just a select few,

429
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,250
it doesn't make the gesture
any less noble.

430
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,875
- Yeah.

431
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,208
Thanks, Subaru.
I appreciate it.

432
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,375
- Uh...

433
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,666
Emilia?

434
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,208
- [breathes softly]

435
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,083
<i>- Those memories</i>
<i>still buried in her mind,</i>

436
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,750
<i>do they hold some clue</i>
<i>to getting through the trial?</i>

437
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,458
- [soft whisper]

438
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,208
-<i> Maybe she can't remember,</i>

439
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,333
<i>but if I ask</i>
<i>someone who does...</i>

440
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,291
[sighs]

441
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,833
[gasps]

442
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,250
Sorry, but I-I have to.

443
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,208
[winces]

444
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,708
Come on! You didn't have
to go that far, did you?

445
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,958
PUCK:<i> Oh, I don't know.</i>

446
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,291
<i>It seems like you're</i>
<i>a bit on the needy side,</i>

447
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:55,333
<i>so I'm a little scared</i>
<i>to let you stay next to Lia.</i>

448
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,416
<i>Should I erase you?</i>

449
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,833
- Don't just say that
like it's no big deal!

450
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,750
Anyway, you should know that
she's been really sad lately,

451
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,708
ever since her pet,
slash family member, ran off.

452
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,875
<i>- Well, I didn't</i>
<i>exactly run off.</i>

453
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,541
<i>I've always been a part of her.</i>

454
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,000
<i>It was good of you</i>
<i>to call me, though,</i>

455
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,541
<i>and I have to say that</i>
<i>made me feel happy, Subaru.</i>

456
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,333
[wind howling]

457
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,916
WOMAN:<i> Emilia!</i>

458
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,833
- [gasps]

459
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,333
[sighing]

460
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,666
PUCK: Did you have
another scary dream?

461
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,500
- You're back!

462
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,541
- [chuckles]

463
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,750
- Thank goodness.
Now where have you been?

464
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,625
I was so worried about you.

465
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,750
Please don't ever disappear
like that again, okay?

466
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,750
Hey, uh...

467
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,250
- Is it just me,

468
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,541
or do I look a little smaller
than usual? [laughs]

469
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,500
Suppose my limit came up
faster than I thought.

470
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,958
But I was consciously trying
to break our contract,

471
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,666
so I guess it makes sense

472
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,333
that I'd lose my greatest
strengths as a spirit.

473
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,833
- Wait a second. Break our con--

474
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,458
Wh-What are you saying, Puck?

475
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,291
- I've been
right here by your side

476
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,708
for quite some time now.

477
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,708
I couldn't talk to you
about this before

478
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:09,958
due to personal reasons

479
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,291
and because
of your own problems.

480
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,041
But just know,
from this moment on...

481
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,500
- Huh?

482
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,458
Huh?

483
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,791
No! Wait!
Please don't do this!

The stone--
the stone where you live--

487
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,583
- I'm really sorry, Lia.

488
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,666
I wish I could explain
everything to you,

489
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,583
but there
just isn't enough time.

490
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,250
As much as it hurts me,

491
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,333
I'm entrusting you to somebody

492
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,333
who cares about you
almost as much as I do.

493
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,083
- Wh-What? What are you saying?

494
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,666
There's no one--

495
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,000
There's no one who--

496
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,000
- Lia, it's time for me

497
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,708
to break the contract
between the two of us.

- I'm truly sorry
this is so one-sided,

500
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,291
but once I'm gone, the seal
on your memories will be lifted.

501
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,583
Remembering them will
most likely make you very sad.

502
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,500
You'll want to cry
more than you do right now.

RYUZU: Miss Emilia
fell unconscious?

514
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,208
- Uh-huh.
Seems the spirit user's spirit

515
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,541
left her high and dry.
I wouldn't really care,

516
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,583
but if it drives her so
nuts
that she misses the
trial,

517
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,125
then what good is she to us?

518
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,416
- Do not say such things.

519
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,750
This is a matter of the heart,
so it makes me sad for her.

520
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:05,583
Show some empathy.

521
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:09,916
Incidentally, Young Gar,
about Young Su...

522
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,458
- The dude
who's covered in miasma?

523
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,958
- Indeed. I know
what I said a bit earlier,

524
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,583
but he does not appear to have
any connection with the witch.

I don't know about that.

00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,541

00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,500
- Yeah.

00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,583
I guess. Yeah.

00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,625
And, if not,
then I want to believe

534
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,500
I'll be just fine
in the morning.

Well, I can't offer a lot,

- Please, just hold my hand.

And would you mind
staying here until morning?

544
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,583
It might help.

545
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,041
If you do, I think I...

546
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:13,833
I'm sorry.

then it's not a problem
for me at all.

In the morning, you'll be

I had planned to talk
things over with you here.
