- Are you sure
that you're feeling okay?

28
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:12,125
- Mm-hmm. I think it's 'cause
Subaru was there for me.

29
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:16,041
Anyway, we need to talk
about the trial.

30
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,541
- Oh, yeah.
I bet I have a pretty good idea

00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,208
- what you're gonna say.
- [gasps]

You saw your past, right?

- [gasps]
- Your what?

34
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,750
- Wait a minute.
How the hell do you know

35
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,166
what happens in the trial,
anyway?

36
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,916
- You saw the ruins
glowing earlier, right?

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,666
That's 'cause
I was qualified, too.

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,708
And what's more...

39
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,500
- I passed it.

Young Su passed, did he?

RAM: Quite an achievement,
if he's not joking.

44
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,208
This means
we can remove the barrier.

00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,791
Garf, how does it look?

46
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,208
- No changes so far.

- How dare you lie
to all of us like that?

48

- Okay, way to jump
to conclusions!

49
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:58,541
[gasps] What's wrong, Garfiel?

50
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,666
- Are you kidding me?
There's not a damn thing wrong.

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,125
- Huh?

52
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,791
- Subaru, if that's really true,

53
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,500
then what did you see?

54
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:11,291
- Well it's less about
what I saw than what I realized.

55
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,333
And the thing that I've
come to understand

56
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,291
is there's more than one
of these sadistic trials.

57
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,708
Turns out
there are actually three.

58
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,500
- So two more?

a suggestion for you.

But I have to warn you,

62
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,583
there's a chance
you're not gonna like it.

63
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,833
- A suggestion?
- Mm. If it's all right,

64
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,208
I'm prepared to take on
the other trials in your place

65
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,208
- and pass them for you.
- [gasps]

66
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,541
- I want to try
and be your strength.

67
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,708
I have no idea what awful things
you saw in your past,

68
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,166
but if it made you cry that hard

69
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,541
and put you through
so much pain,

70
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,000
- then I want to help if I can.
- GARFIEL: Hang on!

You're spewin' all this garbage

to sit here and listen to it?

Well, it's time for you
to hear me out now.

I don't want anybody
but the princess, Miss Emilia,

75
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,750
to go through the trial,
all right?

76
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,250
In fact, you're the last person

gettin' rid of the barrier,

actually surprised

84
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,250
I have a problem with it,
are you?

Man, you're even
more of a dumbass

86
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,833

- Subaru...
- [gasps]

88
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,208
so are you saying...

89
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,000
you don't trust me
to do this myself?

90
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,458
- Huh?
- Because you saw me struggling

91
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:33,541
and felt that I was failing,
now you'd rather do it
instead?

92
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,541
- No! But you shouldn't
have to face your past if--

93
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,583
- Stop it! If I don't face it,
then I'll never pass the trial!

94
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,500
No. I can't just avert my eyes
from things I don't like,

95
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,125
leave them all to you,
and run away.

96
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,458
That would only leave me
with nothing.

SUBARU: You got a minute?

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,750
Why were you so against
what I was saying back there?

102
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,541
And tell me the real reason.

103
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,791
- Because it's--

104
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,916
- Because it is what
Young Roz wants us to do.

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,416
- Huh?
- He believes Miss Emilia

106
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,625
should be the one
to liberate the Sanctuary

107
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,416
and stands rather firm on it.

108
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,541
- Seriously?
And both of you guys

109
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,000
actually back him up on that?

110
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,500
- Listen, I never said that,

111
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,583
and I hate that son of a bitch
every bit as much as you do.

112
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,916
But even so, don't you get it?!

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
- So I guess,
even if the barrier vanished

114
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,833
and the Sanctuary officially
became part of his domain--

115
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,666
RYUZU: This land is completely
overseen by Young Roz.

116

None of us dare defy him
and endanger our position.

117
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,708
I apologize to you
and the others.

118
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,375
- I see. Man...

119
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,791
trusting Roswaal just keeps
getting harder and harder.

120
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,000
- Yeah. Anyway, the princess
has to go through the trial.

121
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,500
Even if you are qualified,

122
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,458
I'm not gonna let you
give it a shot, no matter what.

123
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,458
- Damn it. Emilia.

<i>I'm worried about.</i>

129
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,416
<i>Does she have ties</i>
<i>to Elsa somehow?</i>

130
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,916
<i>In any case, I need</i>
<i>to get back to the mansion</i>

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,875
<i>as fast as I can.</i>

132
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,166
- How fascinating.

133
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,083
And what is it you would
like me to do about it?

134
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,666
- Get the people
of Arlam Village back home.

135
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,500
And I want you
to bring up this idea

136
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,333
to Ryuzu, Garfiel,
and all the others,

137
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,541
'cause this time around,

138
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,708
I don't think I'll be able
to get them on my side.

139
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,875
- "This time around?"

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,916
Oh? And why would that be?

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,125
- That Garfiel punk
has made no secret

142
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,791
of the fact
that he hates my guts.

143
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,083
He's way too impulsive.

144
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,625
I'll never convince him
to go along with me.

145
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,458
Oh, yeah,
and there's one other thing.

146
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,416
I wanna go and tell the people
who are still in Arlam

147
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,916
that their families are safe,

148
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,458
and I plan on heading back there
myself to tell them that.

149
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,375
But of course,
I'm goin' to the mansion,

150
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,416
where Frederica's
planning something, too.

151
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,791
- Indeed,
Ram's informed me of this.

152
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,500
But given what I know about her,

153
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,958
Frederica would
not be so hasty in--

154
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,583
- And what do you know?

155
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,833
Frederica handed over
that glowing stone to Emilia,

156
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,625
which is all the proof I need
that she's up to no good.

157
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,083
- And if she turns out
to be an enemy of yours,

158
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,833
what are you going to do?

159
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,125
I'm sorry to say this,

160
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,708
but you stand
no chance against her.

161
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,791
- [gasps]

162
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,125
Emilia's dealing
with the barrier,

163
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,583
you're seriously injured,

164
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,875
and Otto won't take part
in any of this.

165
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:28,958
We're stuck.

166
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,208
- That is true,

167
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,333
with the exception
of one person.

168
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,416
- If I may be blunt,
I don't like this.

169
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,000
- You're still
talking like that, huh?

170
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,416
Are you serious right now?

171
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,000
- Then let me
spell it out for you.

172
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,000
With the current condition
that Roswaal is in,

173
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,625
it doesn't feel right
to leave his side.

174
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,125
- Well, yeah, but it isn't like

175
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,750
you can do anything
for him, right?

176
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,625
I couldn't believe it
when I heard that Garfiel

177
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,625
was the one who put
all those bandages on him.

178
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,083
- Don't be a fool.
What if I had applied them

179
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,458
and then made his injuries
even worse than they were?

180
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,750
- Oh, show some guilt!

181
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,500
GARFIEL:
Makin' your triumphant return

182
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,625
with a pretty girl
on each arm, huh?

183
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,833
You've really got some nerve.
You know that?

184
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,583
- I didn't think
you would come out

185
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,708
so early in the morning
to see me off. So you heard?

186
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,166
- Frankly, it pisses me off
that this entire thing

187
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,125
was pretty much decided
behind my back,

188
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,958
but I ain't gonna fight it.

189
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,958
- Oh, yeah?
I'm glad to hear you say that.

190
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,875
If you'd tried to stop me,
I would have

191
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,916
had to throw Ram off
into the distance as a decoy.

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,875
- As if that would ever work!

193
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,000
Wait. Would it?

194
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,416
- Eh, how would I know?!

195
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,291
You should
say something to, uh...

196
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,708
Ram, what's wrong?

197
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,625
- This stupid conversation
gave me a headache. That's all.

198
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,208
- Well, I'm out of here.
Guess I'll see you.

199
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,083
I should be back tomorrow,
so look after things until then.

200
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,541
- Hey, hold on a minute.
You're leaving

201
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,208
without saying goodbye
to the princess?

202
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,916
- Wow, I'm surprised you're
actually concerned about Emilia.

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,208
But don't worry. It's okay.

204
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,875
I left her a letter
explaining things.

205
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,875
Uh...

206
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,666
by the way, don't you have
something you wanna give me?

207
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,833
- Eh, what the hell
are you talkin' about?

208
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,708
- [sighs]

209
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,250
- All right, then, how about
showing concern for me?

210
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,708
The woman you love is leaving
to fulfill her duty.

211
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,208
Have you no desire
to offer assistance?

212
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,833
- Guess you're only nice to me

213
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,208
when you think you'll get
something out of it, aren't you?

214
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,750
- [stone clinks]
- Happy now?

215
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,875
Take care of Emilia.

216
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,375
And try to make it clear to her
that I'm genuinely sorry, okay?

217
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,083
- Why don't you
tell her that yourself?!

218
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't work for you, you know!

219
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,958
- So, Barusu,

220
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,708
will this thing Garf gave us
be of some use?

221
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,583
- I don't know.
What do you think?

222
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,875
'Cause after all,
you've known him

223
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,291
a whole lot longer than I have.

224
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,875
- I'm honestly not sure,

225
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,791
but since it's part
of a matching pair,

226
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,208
I assume it means
something important to him.

227
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:48,208
- [gasps] Doesn't seem like
you're very happy today.

228
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,000
- What you were
saying earlier...

229
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,166
- Huh?
- when you told Garfiel

230
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,958
that you'd throw me as a decoy.

231
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,625
For some reason,
that bothered me

232
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,916
more than I would have
expected it to.

233
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,083
It's as if...

234
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,583
that had actually
happened before somehow.

235
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,083
Barusu?

236
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,791
Look, Ram...

237
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,791
there's something important
I need to tell you.

238
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,916
In fact, it's about
what's most important to you.

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,625
- Well, the only thing
that truly means

240
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,250
that much to me is Roswaal.

241
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,750
- No, it's something else.

242
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,166
Now listen to me. This is
something that you need to hear.

243
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,000
There's a girl. Her name is Rem.

244
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,625
SUBARU:<i> Please don't</i>
<i>let anything happen.</i>

245
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,333
<i>I'm here two days earlier</i>
<i>than last time.</i>

246
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,833
<i>If things</i>
<i>still go wrong somehow,</i>

247
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,333
<i>I'll have to take off</i>
<i>on Patrasche</i>

248
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,333
<i>the minute I wake up</i>
<i>in the graveyard.</i>

249
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,416
<i>If Frederica</i>
<i>turns out to be an enemy,</i>

250
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
<i>it's crucial for me to know</i>
<i>when she's gonna take action.</i>

251
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,666
- Barusu?
-<i> Should I attack or run?</i>

252
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,125
<i>If it's Elsa I'm dealing with,</i>

253
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,416
<i>I'd better just get</i>
<i>the hell out of there.</i>

254
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,416
<i>Which means--</i>

255
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,416
- Barusu!
- [gasps]

256
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,958
Oh, yeah, hey. What is it?

257
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,958
I was just thinking about, uh...

258
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,500
- It's a pleasure
to welcome you back, Mr. Subaru.

259
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,166
And I must say,
you returned here

260
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,416
much sooner than I expected.
[giggles]

261
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,875
[gasps]

262
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,166
What is it?
Is there something wrong?

263
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,500
- Oh, man!

264
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,333
- No, you're just so cute!
- [gasps]

265
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,875
- Sorry. I can't help it.
- Wait!

266
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,125
Uh, Mr. Subaru!

267
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,833
- I just--[crying]

268
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,041
You've no idea what kind
of hell I've been through.

269
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,583
Seriously. Damn it.

270
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,416
Uh...

271
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,000
Is that a...

272
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,458
- Uh-huh.
It matches the one I gave you.

273
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,750
- [gasps]
- [shudders]

274
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,583
You're not hurt, are you?

275
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:55,791
- Not a bit.

276
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,541
From the bottom of my heart,

277
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,791
I'm just incredibly relieved
to see you again.

278
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,166
I'm really happy
to be back here, Petra.

279
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,875
RAM: If I may be blunt,
I don't like this.

280
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,541
- Why does that sound familiar?

281
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,500
- 'Cause I'm being direct,
as always,

282
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,125
the adorable quality of a Ram

283
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,875
who's been quite forgotten
and left at a loss.

284
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,500
- Uh, hi. I guess
you must be Miss Ram, right?

285
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,583
I was recently hired
as a new maid

286
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,750
in service
to the lord of the mansion.

287
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,333
I'm Petra, and it's truly
a pleasure to meet you.

288
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,750
- You seem to know your place,
unlike Barusu.

289
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,916
Very good.
A passing grade, then.

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Needless to say,

291
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,583
- you fail, Barusu.
- Huh?

292
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,250
- You may not cross
this mansion's threshold.

293
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,833
- What was the point
of even coming back

294
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,083
- in the first place, then?!
- [giggles]

295
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,791
- Oh, hey, uh, Petra,

296
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,541
has anything weird happened
here while we were away,

297
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,291
like with Frederica,
for example?

298
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,916
- I haven't seen anything.

299
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,041
She seems pretty normal
if you ask me.

300
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,791
- Is she inside now?

301
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,291
- Frederica's out patrolling
the forest barrier.

302
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,458
It may be a while
before she gets back.

303
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,166
- Our timing's
either good or bad.

304
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,250
What's our next move, Barusu?

305
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,208
- I want to see
what she's gonna do,

306
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,541
so let's wait with Rem
in the meantime.

307
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,833
- I should probably
get back to the cleaning now.

308
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,750
Please call for me
if you need anything.

309
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,500
- You're nervous, aren't you?

310
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,791
- That is ridiculous.

311
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,416
Well, to be honest,
you should be,

SUBARU: I'm so glad
you're all right.

316
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:44,875
- Barusu.

317
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,416
- Yeah? What?

318
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,291

for a bit?

321
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,625
Well, it's a start,

322
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,166
a really good start.

323
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,458
- Ah! It seems you've returned
sooner than I anticipated.

324
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,541
I must admit
I'm rather surprised.

325
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,250
Since Emilia wasn't able
to come along and join you,

326
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,708
might I assume
the trial isn't completed yet?

327
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,333
- Uh-uh, but there are

328
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,625
a few things
I wanted to ask you about.

329
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,250
First, there's this.

330
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,375
[stone clinks]

331
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,250
- [gasps]

332
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,708
But that's...

333
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,791
- Huh?

334
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,708
- [stone clinks]
- That's Garf's stone, isn't it?

335
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,958
- That's right.
So you do know him.

336
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,166
I mean you really
are related, then?

337
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,458
- I'm a little confused.

338
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,291
Garf didn't tell you that
himself, did he?

339
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,208
- I can see it in your faces.

340
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,083
And I'd guess that he's
your younger brother, right?

341
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:55,166
- You are indeed correct.
[sniffs]

342
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,916
See, the truth is
that I'm Garf's--

343
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,375
I'm Garfiel's older sister
by blood. So now you know.

344
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,583
- Then answer me this.

345
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,083
Why did you use
that glowing stone

346
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,250
to set a teleport trap?

347
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,375
And I want you
to be honest with me.

348
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,041
- [stammers]

349
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,833
- Can't tell me that
because
of your oath, either,
huh?

350
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,833
Too bad, 'cause this is
one thing you need to--

351
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,750
- Wait. I have no idea
what you meant by "teleport."

352
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,000
- [gasps]

353
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,208
- I'm not sure
how to respond to that look.

354
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,916
- Aw, come on! Give me a break!
You don't fool me!

355
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,958
I know you're working
with the conservatives

356
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,083
who don't want
the Sanctuary to be freed!

357
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,208
- Wait. Who?
Afraid I don't understand.

358
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,875
Maybe it would be best if you
just started from the
beginning.

359
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,541
- [gasps] You're really
not acting? Or signaling?

360
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,041
- Private time with Frederica
in my absence?

361
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,708
It would appear you have no need
for your life, Barusu.

362
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,875
- Uh, no, I was--

363
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,833
I see your tea-making skills
haven't improved at all

364
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,250
since we left. What a shame.

365
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,083
- Oh, no. In fact, making tea

366
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,000
is the one thing
I truly excel at.

367
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,583
My, what a hateful creature
you are.

368
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,833
- Nonsense.
I'm perfectly lovable.

369
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,208
Any more so, and the world
would be in danger.

370
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,791
- Always ready with
a sharp retort, aren't you?

371
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,833
Honestly...

372
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,208
it's so typical.

373
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,333
- And? If you don't know
about the teleporting,

374
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,333
why give Barusu
that stone, then?

375
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,083
- Well, I...
- You can't tell us

376
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,208
because of your little oath.
Is that it?

377
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,083
If so, that's a feeble excuse,
Frederica.

378
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,500
- [sighs]

379
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,875
Yes, you're exactly right.
I'm truly sorry,

380
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,833
but I cannot tell you
anything about it.

381
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,416
- Sticking to it, I see.

382
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,833
All right. Then there's
nothing more to discuss.

383
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,000
- Uh, hey, take it easy!

384
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,708
- Your refusal
to answer the question

385
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,166
makes your betrayal
crystal clear.

386
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,333
We'll restrain you
and take you to the Sanctuary.

387
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,041
Then we can finally determine

388
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,791
who's been giving you
your orders this whole time.

389
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,125
- Yeah, but this--

390
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,500
- If you insist on taking me
to the Sanctuary,

391
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,416
- then I won't resist.
- There. You see?

392
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,083
Even Frederica--Wait. What?

393
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,166
- I don't have any intention
of resisting you, none.

394
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,375
- Oh, you won't, huh?

395
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,500
- And why not?
- How slow can you be?

396
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,250
Frederica isn't able to break
the oath of her own free will,

397
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:09,125
so obviously you'll have to use
force to make her, Barusu.

398
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:13,000
That's the kind of excuse
she needs.

Wow, you two are

401
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,916
- Well, naturally.

402
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,875
- We've known each other
for ten years now.

all it's gonna take,

404
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,875
then frankly I'm relieved,

00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,208

She's your sister!
You love her, and she loves you,

Surely you know that losing
you
along with Frederica and me

would be a far greater loss
for our side.

- Yes, she may be

that the same blood

flows through hers, too.

Still, if she is my sister,
this is what she would say...

470
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,166
"If the day should ever come,

471
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,291
please sacrifice me
to save Master Roswaal's life."

472
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:04,708
- I-I didn't bring you here
to make you say that.

473
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,958
FREDERICA: I believe
we should save the two of them.

474
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,541
We have to. Listen to me.

475
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,375
Both Beatrice and Rem
are also vital to our side.

476
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,083
If we just leave them behind,
we're done for sure.

477
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,666
- Yes, me, too! I believe we
should rescue them both as
well!

478
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,208
I agree with her.

- We're not taking
a majority vote on this.

480
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,583
Now be quiet, child.

481
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,333
- I may be young,
but I'm plenty grown-up!

482
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,333
In fact, Frederica even told
me
I'm more useful than you are!

483
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,666
- Well, Frederica,
what else did you say to her?

484
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,333
- Since it was my idea,

485
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,500
I'll assume the task
of stopping the enemy.

again, I see.

You are just like Garf.

491
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,625
- I see you girls as
my precious junior colleagues.

492
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,500
Also, it's incorrect
to say I'm just like Garf.

493
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,375
After all, Garf is
the one who's imitating me.

when you're like that?

- Of course.
I'm still me, after all.

503
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,125
Well done.
You fought the urge to scream.

Ram, I leave the rest to you.

But don't fall behind,

I'll fetch the ground dragon

00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,833
I'll send you
to meet the angels.

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,125
<i>Even if this world won't last,</i>

633
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,791
<i>I refuse to let her hurt Rem!</i>

634
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,333
Rem!

635
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,125

Why...

638
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,583
Why did you save me?!

639
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,000
Beatrice!
