162
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,708
- A series of delusions has
clouded and possessed his mind.

163
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,125
They've cursed his soul,
ensnared it,

164
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,583
and kept it bound
for quite a long time now.

165
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,416
Initially, I might
not have minded that.

166
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,541
Even if he wouldn't look at me,

167
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,791
even if he thought of me
as nothing more than a tool...

168
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,125
- R-Ram...

169
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,125
- But his delusions
have already strayed

170
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,583
from the path
toward a clean conclusion.

171
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,458
His wish has lost its direction,

172
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,833
and he clings to words
written purely for aesthetics.

173
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,208
I'm asking for your help
to break through all that.

174
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,583
- All right, then.

175
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,125
What do you want me to do?

176
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,916
- I need you
to assume the throne.

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,916
- [gasps]

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,583
- Once you take your place
on the royal throne of Lugunica,

179
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,541
Master Roswaal's dream
will be fulfilled.

180
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,750
No matter how far
he's walked astray,

181
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,083
the day his wish is realized
will come.

182
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:22,833
Please.

183
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,125
I'm asking you
to do this for him.

184
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,750
Give him a reason to live

185
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,458
through both the present
and the future.

186
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,500
You're the only one
who can bring him back.

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Please. Please rescue him.

188
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,625
- I don't really understand
your request.

189
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,958
I'm not sure how my assuming
the throne of Lugunica

190
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,541
could save Roswaal.

191
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,125
I appreciate your conviction.

192
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,708
I'm just having trouble seeing
how one affects the other.

193
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,833
But...

194
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,125
this is the first time
you've asked anything of me,

195
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,666
and that means something.

196
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,833
Okay, Ram.

197
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,833
I appreciate your faith in me,
and I want to repay that trust.

198
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,208
Beginning now,

199
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,208
I know that's something
I need to take upon myself.

200
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,708
- [gasps]

201
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,916
[shudders]

202
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,875
[gasps]

203
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,708
- ROSWAAL: My, look at this.
- [gasps]

204
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:36,791
- Tell me, would you mind

205
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,791
if I offered my congratulations
to you as well?

206
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,375
[tense music playing]

207
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,083
- [gasps]

208
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,125
That's close enough.

209
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,750
[energy surges]

210
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,541
- Look at you.

211
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,000
What a fine welcome
this is, Miss Emilia.

212
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,416
Despite how I may appear,

213
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,416
I assure you
my concern for you is genuine.

214
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,916
In fact,
you could even say I pity you.

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,750
- And what do you mean by that?

216
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,458
- Just what I said,

217
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,625
from the very bottom
of my heart.

218
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,333
You have no idea how to be loved

219
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,958
other than to simply do
what people expect of you,

220
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:12,916
yet you were forced to confront

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,750
the painful events
of a past you never wanted.

222
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,958
Allow me to offer you
my felicitations

223
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,291
with all of the mercy

224
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,166
and compassion
that I have to do so.

225
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,125
Well done!
You overcame the trial!

226
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,291
And I was convinced
you were quite incapable of it.

227
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,083
- It's not very easy
to say "thank you"

228
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,791
when you put it that way.

229
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,041
You just said you didn't think
I could pull it off.

230
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,666
But now you've
changed your mind?

231
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,166
I know that I must have worried
you a great deal, Roswaal.

232
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,875
All I've been able to do
is lose my nerve.

233
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,875
I've caused
so much trouble for Puck,

234
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,250
for Subaru, everyone.

235
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,791
But despite that, each of them
ended up rescuing me.

236
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,250
I was utterly useless,
and they lent me a helping hand.

237
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,875
Because of their faith in me,

238
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,125
I realized I can't
just go on being discouraged.

239
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,083
- [laughs]
- [gasps]

240
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,250
- You're saying the same
sort of things Subaru did.

241
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,250
Are you merely
repeating his words?

242
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,833
- [gasps]
- Master Roswaal!

243
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:12,666
- Your echoed sentiments,

244
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,291
the place that has
been prepared for you,

245
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,333
even your
oh-so-brave trial attempts

246
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,916
were choices made
after the stage was set.

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,666
Subaru knows
of these circumstances,

248
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,625
yet still urges you
to do awful things.

249
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,250
- No, that's not true at all!

250
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,500
- He wants me to be--
- We both know him.

251
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,708
He wasn't speaking
with logic or reason.

252
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,791
He just gave you a rather loud
pep talk, didn't he?

253
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,041
The boy imposed his will on you,

254
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,000
forcing you
to fit his pompous ideal

255
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,041
while asserting
that you could do it.

256
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,750
I understand. I truly do.

257
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,750
After all,
as we've come to realize,

258
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,750
he and I are two of a kind.

259
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:47,708
- Hold on a minute.

260
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,875
That doesn't make sense.
What do you mean?

261
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,041
- We're like-minded
in that we force our values

262
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,708
- upon the women we love.
- [gasps]

263
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,458
- Since you've met,
I'm sure he's spoiled you,

264
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,208
treating you with
the utmost kindness and care.

265
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,541
Yet he never even considered

266
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,666
that you're far
from a normal girl, now, did he?

267
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,541
The you he loves
is the ideal you

268
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,291
living within his own mind,
not who you really are.

269
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,250
Am I wrong?

270
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,708
- [sighs]

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,458
So is that all?

272
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,916
Surely that can't be it.

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,916
Is that the only thing making
you think you're exactly
alike?

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,583
Because if that's all
you have to say on the matter,

275
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,833
then I can assure you
you're wrong.

276
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,833
You couldn't be more different.

277
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,166
- [gasps]

278
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,708
- Subaru said
I was annoying him.

279
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,000
He told me that I was
a real pain in the ass.

280
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:40,666
- He what?

281
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,250
- He asked who I thought I was,

282
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,916
causing trouble for him
when he's done so much.

283
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,416
He said
I shouldn't keep brooding

284
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,166
over what happened in the past.

285
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,166
He told me I was all talk
and he couldn't put up with it.

286
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,833
Truth is,
everything he said was right.

287
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,125
I was just a weakling, all talk,

288
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,625
and insufficient
in every possible way.

289
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:07,333
'Cause Subaru
really sees me for who I am.

290
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,458
That's how I know
you're wrong, Roswaal.

291
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,250
You two are nothing alike.

292
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,791
When I want to try something,

293
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,125
when there's a change
that I want to make,

294
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,250
he takes my hand
and helps me along.

295
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,458
He taught me there are others

296
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,000
who will do the same
for me, too.

297
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,458
- You don't think
he was simply deceiving you

298
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,791
to tactfully get you
back on your feet?

299
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,083
- No. He spoke his mind.

300
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:36,000
What Subaru felt when he said
he believed in me wasn't a
lie,

301
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,250
nor will it be.

302
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,666
I'll turn those lies
into wishes.

303
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,583
That's what I
need to do right now.

304
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,208
But more than that,
it's what I want to do.

305
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,041
[wind blowing]

306
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,083
- [chuckles]
My, you do continue to change.

307
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,875
Although, everything you've said

308
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,916
is exceedingly difficult
for me to accept.

309
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,916
- What do you mean?

310
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,166
- Your decision is priceless,

311
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,666
and your will to walk forward
is noble,

312
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,041
yet these observations
are precisely why I pity you.

313
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,291
The choice you've made
that justifies you getting hurt

314
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,208
is already pointless

315
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,375
in this world
that will soon come to an end.

316
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,416
EMILIA: The world will what?

317
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,541
- To be more specific,
it's moving toward its end.

318
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,875
This world's strayed
from the correct path

319
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,083
and is now proceeding swiftly
into the wrong destination.

320
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,041
The Sanctuary
and the royal selection

321
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,458
have already lost all meaning.

322
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,416
- How could you say that?

323
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,041
Don't tell me you're
considering giving up now.

324
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,125
'Cause after all,

325
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,375
weren't we the ones
who started this?

326
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,250
And you would decide
to quit before it's over?

327
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,583
I won't allow it!

328
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:49,250
- Then what is it precisely
that you wish to do?

329
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,166
- I'm not exactly sure,
but it doesn't make sense!

330
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,500
What's wrong is wrong!
You can't just back away!

331
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,500
That's way too selfish,
even for you!

332
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,166
- It's funny.

333
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,250
You really did sound just
like Subaru when you said that.

334
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,208
[inhales]

335
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,500
It makes me wonder

336
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,958
how much of your boastful speech

337
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,416
could ever
even possibly be realized?

338
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,541
- You won't have
to wait long to find out.

339
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,583
I'm about to show you.
In the graveyard--

340
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:16,083
No. Outside the Sanctuary, too.

341
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,208
- Miss Emilia.

342
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,916
- I'm going now, Ram.
And don't worry.

343
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,833
I promise I'll take care
of the favor you asked of me.

344
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,125
- It was my teacher and I
who started it all.

345
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,708
That's the one little detail
you got wrong, Miss Emilia.

346
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,250
[energy surges]

347
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,125
I'm impressed.

348
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,791
It seems her resolve
is stronger than I realized.

349
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,750
- Exactly how much
of our conversation

350
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,666
were you able to hear,
Master Roswaal?

351
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,125
- Oh, I heard quite a bit
and saw you kneel before her.

352
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,166
I applaud your acting skills.

353
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,041
Incidentally,
I also heard you were an asset

354
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,125
in assisting them with Garfiel.

355
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:12,875
Of course, I'm sure you thought

356
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,958
it was the "right thing"
at the time.

357
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,166
- So what's the next move?

358
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,583
What is it you intend to do
at this point?

359
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,583
- While some intricacies
may have changed,

360
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,666
what I desire has not,

361
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,625
though I will now be forced
to work a bit harder for it.

362
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,541
- What should I--
- You shall remain here

363
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,375
and await Miss Emilia's return.

364
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,000
If no one were here

365
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,833
to welcome her brave
and triumphant soul back,

366
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,083
even my own heart
would ache for her.

367
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,666
RAM:<i> The reason</i>
<i>I decided to take that bet</i>

368
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,333
<i>was because it seemed</i>
<i>like the best chance</i>

369
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,958
<i>for me to get my wish.</i>

370
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,333
OTTO: Hello, Miss Ram.

371
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,333
Sure is a lovely evening,
isn't it?

372
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,458
The breeze feels so nice.

373
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,750
- You're the boy
who was with Barusu.

374
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,333
- Mr. Natsuki's
judge of character

375
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,666
leads me to believe
that you're not the enemy here.

376
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,625
And if he's correct,
then let's have a discussion.

377
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,541
'Cause I think
we can be of assistance

378
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,083
in getting you
what you really want.

379
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,208
- So annoying.

380
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,708
- Huh?
- I said you're annoying.

381
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,208
Fine. Out with it.

382
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,208
Now give me all the details.

383
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,666
[insects chirping]

384
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,708
OTTO: That's my idea.

385
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,333
So not bad, huh?

386
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,458
- Hmph.

387
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,125
If you want my help,
then I have three conditions.

388
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:38,833
First, I'm strongly in favor
of taking Garfiel down a
notch.

389
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,791
But after you do, I'll need you
to let me handle him

390
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,583
from that point forward,
all right?

391
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,583
- Okay, got it.

392
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,208
- Then there's Miss Emilia.

393
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,708
Do something about her.

394
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,458
- Well, that would be up
to Mr. Natsuki and Miss Emilia,

395
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,250
more than likely.

396
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,125
And third?

397
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,250
It feels like this one
is gonna be a doozy.

398
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,416
- Idiot.

399
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,833
The final condition
is that you mustn't tell Barusu

400
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,250
why I took this bet
in the first place.

401
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,166
I would prefer
not to give up my last endgame.

402
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,666
[footsteps echoing]

403
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,708
[energy humming]

404
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,875
- Ah, you found me.

405
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,291
Though, I suppose
it would be easy to get here

406
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,458
if one used clairvoyance.

407
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,625
I ordered you
to wait for Miss Emilia

408
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,625
to emerge from her trials,
did I not?

409
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,125
- Yes, I believe that you did.

410
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,541
- Then tell me, for what reason

411
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,416
did you disobey that order
and come here?

412
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,083
- It's quite simple.

413
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,291
I've come to take you away...

414
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,625
Master,

415
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,250
from the witch's delusions.

416
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,125
- Oh, so that's what you
think they are, do you?

417
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,500
It's been quite a few years

418
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,125
since you
pointed your wand at me.

419
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,708
A shame
that you're doing so now

420
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,166
and that you called them
meager delusions.

421
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,041
- I've always
considered them as such.

422
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,750
I just never said it out loud.
Isn't it obvious?

423
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,166
- Just listen to you.

424
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,791
So defiant.

425
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,958
Though, from your standpoint,

426
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,500
those mortifying days
yielding to me have been long.

427
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,458
I considered your behavior

428
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,416
to be your way of expressing
your level of devotion.

429
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,208
- I have my reasons
for everything,

430
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,333
and beating up Garf
served two purposes,

431
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,375
to fulfill my goal as well
as rectifying his idiocy.

432
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:26,416
I have no idea what they
planned
to do if I hadn't been there.

433
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,708
- I cannot deny
that it all worked out

434
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,291
rather well in the end.

435
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,166
Subaru will naturally
choose
to walk a very fine line

436
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,708
in the final confrontation.

437
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,791
- But the one good thing

438
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,541
Barusu always has
going for him is his timing.

439
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,833
In the end, betting on
that single quality of his

440
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,833
won't ever be a mistake.

441
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,333
You have the book,
don't you, Master?

442
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,791
In the place chosen
for the last showdown,

443
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,500
at the stage
when you step forward

444
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,916
and take action yourself,

445
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,125
there's no way for you to do so
without the Tome of Wisdom

446
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,291
that you rely upon
above everything else.

447
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,750
- In my many years
in this existence,

448
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,333
I have never once forgotten

449
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,125
the one and only vow
you and I exchanged.

450
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,666
- If you live by the sword,
die by it,

451
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,583
if by magic, die by magic,

452
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,875
and those who spread fire
should die by fire.

453
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,541
- Those who ask favors
of a demon

454
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,208
should die by that demon.

455
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,125
Whatever one relies upon in life

456
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,541
should be the thing
that brings about their death.

457
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,875
And now the time
has finally come.

458
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,208
I've lost what I desired,

459
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,625
the meaning of my
existence,
so I offer myself to you.

460
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,625
If you don't mind
that I am but an empty husk,

461
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,833
do with me as you please,
as that was our vow.

462
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:43,500
- Whether you live or die
is up to me.

463
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,000
- Seems you can
conclusively
achieve your retribution.

464
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,708
- [gasps]

465
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,916
- After all...

466
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,750
you were forced to swear loyalty
against your own will,

467
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,500
pledging fealty to one
who destroyed your homeland

468
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,500
and then living with him.

469
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,708
Although you had to do so
after losing your horn,

470
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,000
as well as the ability
to maintain your form,

471
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,250
a level of suffering
to this degree is quite rare.

472
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,375
There is no pawn
more useful than you,

473
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,458
which is why I find this
to be such a shame.

474
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,583
Your decision
was the slightest bit...

475
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,375
premature.

476
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,291
It is impressive that you
were able to create a situation

477
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,625
in which I had to carry
the book with me.

478
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,083
For this last step,
you should have overlooked

479
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,333
this final action
I plan to take, however.

480
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,500
That alone is the true shame!

481
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,750
- [grunts]

482
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,458
- This is
the precious young girl

483
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,625
who offered her own life
to save her friend

484
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,333
by becoming
the Sanctuary's core.

485
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,791
But my objective
does not involve her.

486
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,875
- You intend to use
the power of this crystal

487
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,750
to cast some form
of great magic?

488
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,625
Great enough
to change wind and weather.

489
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,458
In accordance with the Tome,

490
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,458
I will make snow fall
in the Sanctuary.

491
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,500
And in order to use that magic,

492
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,958
I require
a tremendous level of focus

493
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,458
and a highly delicate
use of mana.

494
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:04,500
If I had already been engaged
in such a colossal
undertaking,

495
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,416
you definitely
could have bested me.

496
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,125
- But there would have been
no meaning in doing so.

497
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,833
- And there is meaning
in forcing me into capitulation

498
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,541
when I'm in my glory?

499
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,625
Or was it that you
wanted to destroy me

500
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,000
as quickly
as you possibly could?

501
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,333
- Not at all. A shame.

502
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,375
You truly
don't understand anything.

503
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,833
I won't allow your wish
to come true.

504
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,750
Being offered a husk of you

505
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,666
after your dream
had already been realized

506
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,958
would mean nothing.

507
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,458
Receiving you
in such a broken state

508
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,916
would not satisfy me.

509
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,875
- Well, my goodness,
how incredibly greedy of you.

510
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,875
But now that the time has come,
do you think you can defeat me?

511
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,458
- No, I'm sure I can't.

512
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,916
My understanding of your power

513
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,750
is second only
to that of your teacher's.

514
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,875
- Really?
How do you intend to achieve

515
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,875
such an ambitious goal, then?

516
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:58,708
- I can't win this alone.

517
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,416
That much is clear.

518
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,458
Therefore...

519
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,875
PUCK: If it's two against one,
I suppose we have the
advantage!

520
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:09,500
- [gasps]

521
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,708
So am I to assume that this is

522
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,666
the main reason
you agreed to Subaru's plan?!

523
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,000
I told you, Master,
when I arrived,

524
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:21,375
I'm going to take you away
from the witch's delusions.

525
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:28,375
- And, as for me,
I'm just a passing stray spirit.

526
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,791
- All right!
Let's pick up where we left off.

527
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:31,583
This ought to be fun!

528
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,583
[chuckles]

529
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,666
- We begin!

530
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,458
- [chuckles]

531
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,791
- As you wish, Master!

532
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,541
[rumble]

533
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,125
- [panting]

534
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,208
I have to run! I have to run!

535
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,958
[gasps]

536
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,625
Miss Rem.

537
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,208
B-But--But she...

538
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,083
uh...

539
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:04,166
she's here, and I can't just...

540
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,083
So what! I know this is
what Subaru would do!

541
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,125
[grunts] I'm coming!

542
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,500
[panting]

543
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,083
Miss Rem.

544
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,208
[footsteps echoing]

545
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:27,750
- My, what an adorable
little girl.

546
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,708
[dramatic music playing]

547
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,500
[blade scrapes]

548
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,541
- [gasps]
- Am I to presume

549
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,750
you're the smaller maid
I was told about?

550
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,166
- Are you shaking?
- [whimpering]

551
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,166
- Don't worry.

552
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,708
I'm quite positive your entrails
are absolutely beautiful.

553
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,041
[slurps]

554
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,000
Good girl.

555
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,875
I'll send you
to meet the angels.

556
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:52,875
- [gasps]

557
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,000
- Petra!

558
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,000
- Miss Frederica!

559
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,208
- You're a bad girl, Petra!

560
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,166
I told you
to run far away from here,

561
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,541
so you'll be punished later.

562
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:03,791
- You're right. Sorry.

563
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,791
- How lovely.

564
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,708
I believe you must be
the bigger maid, then.

565
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,875
I'm glad I've been able
to meet you together

566
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,708
and that the two of you
are such good friends.

567
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,583
I'll lay your guts
next to each other

568
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,083
and see if your insides
get along well together, too.

569
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,041
- From your first word
to the last,

570
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,750
nothing that you've been saying
makes any sense at all.

571
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,041
They're just
tasteless ramblings.

572
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,208
- Demi-human blood, I see.

573
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,416
Well, after an experience
in the royal capital

574
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,541
that nearly killed me,
my skills have greatly improved,

575
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,291
so you can't handle me.

576
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,625
- I blame the person
who didn't have the strength

577
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,666
and failed
to finish you off then.

578
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,250
- [chuckles]

579
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,708
- [gasps]

580
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,750
Petra, get outside
the mansion right now.

581
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,833
- B-But I--

582
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,875
What about...

583
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:48,958
- [grunts]

584
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,750
I don't have any idea
who sent you here,

585
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,250
but it appears that Petra and I
are your targets.

586
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:59,750
- Yes. Two maids along with
a little spirit girl,
actually.

587
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,916
I've never cut open a spirit...
- Get out of here!

588
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,333
- Right!
- so I'm excited.

589
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:07,875
- Your personality's
worse than your taste.

590
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,041
- She's sweet.

591
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:10,833
- Indeed.
I'm quite proud of her!

592
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:13,333
- [panting]

593
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:16,375
[rumbling]

594
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,833
[gasps]

595
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,625
Miss Frederica. [gasps]

596
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:26,041
Maybe Miss Beatrice will be
able to do something about this!

597
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:26,791
In here?

598
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,666
Wrong room.

599
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,125
Here?! No.

600
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,333
That's not it!

601
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:31,625
Not here.

602
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,208
[sighs]

603
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,250
She's not in this one, either.

604
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:39,250
[gasps] Big Sister.

605
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,958
[crying] And Miss Rem.

606
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,000
[panting]

607
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:58,041
Subaru...

608
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,416
please help me!

609
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,416
[crying]

610
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,083
SUBARU: All right. You got it...

611
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,291
Petra.

612
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,375
- [gasps]

613
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,916
Huh?

614
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,291
- Sorry I'm a little late,

615
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:15,708
but I've come
to help you out, okay?

616
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,125
So don't you worry.

617
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,708
You're safe now.

618
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,208
- Are you really here?

619
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,291
You came to rescue us?

620
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,375
- It's me, and I did.

621
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,208
- Thank goodness!
Miss Frederica is--

622
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,875
- "Just leave everything to me,"

623
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,250
is what I'd like to tell you.

624
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,958
However, if I rush over there,

625
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:35,000
then I'll be dead
in a heartbeat.

626
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,541
So knowing
that would be the case,

627
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,833
I sent in some superstrong
reinforcements instead.

628
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:42,000
For a homecoming like this,
the people that are in the way

629
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,458
are just a little
too in the way, if you ask me.

630
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,250
- [groans]

631
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,666
Why do you insist
on aiming just below my chest

632
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,750
every time you attack me?

633
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:52,125
- I guess
you could call it my hobby.

634
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,916
I am the Bowel Hunter,

635
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,958
and I love cutting open bellies!

636
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,291
- The boss-man says...

637
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,333
[clang]

638
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,916
the best defense you can have...

639
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,041
is a good offense...

640
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:08,208
so if I use a shield meant
for defense to attack instead...

641
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:08,958
[clang]

642
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,000
the best defense
and the best offense

643
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,958
both come together as a team,
which ends up making me

644
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:16,416
the strongest one
in this whole damn place!

645
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,416
Don't you think so...

646
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,708
Big Sis?

647
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,333
[yelps] Man, you're huge!

648
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,875
Whoa! Wait a minute.
Are you really my sister?

649
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,208
Or maybe I ought
to call you Big Bro.

650
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,208
[groans]

651
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,000
- We haven't seen each other

652
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,000
after all this time,

653
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,666
so don't be rude. Uh...

654
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:34,875
[chuckles]

655
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,875
Look at you.

656
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:37,750
You've grown up to be so big.

657
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,375
That sounds like
sarcastic bullshit to me,

658
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,708
because I'd say you're the one

659
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:44,291
who's practically
a damn giant now!

660
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,875
- Pardon me...

661
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,291
but I was wondering
if I could interrupt

662
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,750
your happy little reunion.

663
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,416
- Yeah, sure. It was real nice
of you to wait for us.

664
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,875
Yo, Sis, do--[gasps]

665
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:57,250
Yo, Big Sis, do you happen
to know a chick named Rem?

666
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:00,416
- Hmm. I do,
and she's here in the mansion.

667
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,833
Mr. Subaru told me
she was Ram's twin sister.

668
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,250
- You've gotta
take her out of here

669
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,333
as soon as you get an opening.

670
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:08,958
Pretty sure I'm gonna have
my hands full with this bitch.

671
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,916
- [gasps] Hold on.
What are you saying?

672
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,125
- Sorry, Big Sis.

673
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,083
She ain't the type I can take on

674
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:17,291
worryin' about who's behind me,
understand?

675
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,500
- But, Garf...

676
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:22,083
- You can see
what's on my arm, can't you?

677
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,541
This is the same shield
the two of us

678
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:27,250
used to play with
when we were just kids.

679
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,375
Honestly, it was runnin'

680
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:29,833
with you all those years

681
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,041
that gave me strength.

682
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,125
Now I'm
the strongest one around. Heh.

683
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:36,333
- [chuckles]

684
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,041
All right, bitch in black,

685
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:41,625
bring it on!

686
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,250
'Cause I'm in the mood

687
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,458
for a little celebration.

688
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:46,625
I'm out of the Sanctuary!

689
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:49,166
And to kick things off,
the first thing I'm gonna do

690
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,916
is smash your head
into the wall!

691
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,958
- [chuckles]

692
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:52,916
- [laughs]

693
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,875
- [door opens]
- Huh?

694
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,083
[hinges creak]

695
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:05,541
Why are you here?

696
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:07,958
'Cause I don't remember
requesting your presence.

697
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,541
SUBARU: Sorry,
but you should know by now

698
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,333
that I'm a guy who shows up
whether he's asked to or not.

699
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:15,000
- Self-serving as ever,
I suppose.

700
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,000
- Yep. I'm pretty selfish.

701
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:20,000
And I'm getting you
out of here, Beatrice.

702
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,166
But this time, things are
gonna be different than before,

703
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,250
'cause I intend
to drag you out.

704
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,666
We're heading into the sunlight
to play in the mud

705
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,833
until that dress of yours
is covered in it!
