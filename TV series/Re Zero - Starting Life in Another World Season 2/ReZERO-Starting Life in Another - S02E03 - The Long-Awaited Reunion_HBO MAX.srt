1
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:04,250
My name is Echidna,

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:05,583
but that's not my title,

3
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:08,416
so perhaps you'd know me better
as the Witch of Greed.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,208
- [gasps]

5
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,250
- It hurts to see you

6
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,583
look so alarmed by me.

7
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,083
Despite who I am,

8
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,583
I'm still a tender young maiden,
you know.

9
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,416
- Sorry, but...

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,041
there's no way
I'm not gonna be alarmed

11
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,083
when you tell me
that you're the Witch of Greed

12
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,375
the first moment
we meet each other.

13
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,250
- Ah, I see.

14
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,041
Well, that is a fair point.

15
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,166
[Echidna giggles]

16
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,250
- What is this place?

17
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,083
I was in some dark ruins
just a minute ago.

18
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,583
When did you move me?!

19
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,125
- I'm sorry, but unfortunately
you're quite mistaken.

20
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,541
You weren't physically moved
anywhere at all.

21
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,750
You were merely invited
to my tea party.

22
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,958
- Your tea party?

23
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,291
- Indeed.
It's a witch's tea party.

24
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,791
So are you just going
to stand there forever?

25
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,750
Why don't you at least
come over and sit down

26
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,458
before the tea gets cold?

27
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,625
- [gasps]

28
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,291
Ah, damn it! All right!

29
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,833
Yeah, fine! Whatever!

30
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,083
- Well, you're quite
the brave one, aren't you?

31
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,333
Downing tea served by a witch
in a single gulp.

32
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,708
- [scoffs] If you
really intended to kill me,

33
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,458
then I'd already be
a little pile of ash right now.

34
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,125
What kinda tea is this,
anyway?
'Cause it's a little bland.

35
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,208
- It's actually
something that's produced here.

36
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,375
To put it bluntly,
it's a body fluid of mine.

37
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,416
- What the hell did you
just let me drink?!

38
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,291
- [laughs] You're truly

39
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,083
a fascinating individual,
now, aren't you?

40
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,458
Standing there in front of me

41
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,333
like it's
a totally normal thing to do.

42
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,375
- Hah! You think
you're so pretty,

43
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,833
your beauty would make
a normal person's eyes fall out?

44
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,875
Yeah, right!
I'll have you know that my eyes

45
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,750
are blessed all day
long
by the prettiest girl
alive!

46
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,500
So give it up, all right?

47
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,583
No matter how many times
I look at you,

48
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,666
I'm not exactly gonna think
you're beautiful.

49
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,750
- No, most normal people tend to
vomit when they stand before me.

50
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,250
Pretty funny, isn't it?

51
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:53,708
- Yeah,
that's freakin' hilarious!

52
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,583
- [laughing]

53
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,625
- Now what is it
you want with me, anyway?

54
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,541
- Oh, nothing, really.

55
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,958
You've come here
completely of your own accord.

56
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,666
If you want to go back,
I can send you there,

57
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,833
but are you sure
that's what you want?

58
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,250
- Huh?

59
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,041
- This is an opportunity

60
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,500
to talk to the Witch of Greed.

61
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,375
It's not something
that just anyone,

62
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,791
other than you,
can earn quite so easily.

63
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,333
The only real requirement
to have a dialogue

64
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,375
is for both of us to exist,

65
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,125
so let's remove
the unnecessary things.

66
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,250
All we need are our words.

67
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,958
Let me affirm the desires,
the curiosities,

68
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,541
and the greed that you seek
to satisfy with answers.

69
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,875
- [woman vocalizing]
- [overlapping whispers]

70
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,291
Now, then, what is it
you'd like to ask me?

71
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,875
- [gasps]
- Do you want to know

72
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,875
about Daphne,
the Witch of Gluttony,

73
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,583
who created beasts
that defied the will of God

74
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,833
to save the world
from starvation?

75
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,916
Maybe you want to hear about
Carmilla, the Witch of Lust,

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,708
who granted emotions
to nonhumans

77
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,375
in an attempt
to fill the world with love.

78
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,958
Or about Minerva,
the Witch of Wrath,

79
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,291
who struck people to heal them

80
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:03,041
as she lamented the state
of her war-torn world.

81
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,000
Perhaps you're more curious
about Sekhmet,

82
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,916
the Witch of Sloth,
who drove a dragon

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,583
past the great waterfall
just for a chance to rest.

84
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,666
Or Typhon, the Witch of Pride,

85
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,875
who, out of innocence
and cruelty,

86
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,875
judged criminals
one after another.

87
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:20,708
Or Echidna, the Witch of Greed,
whose thirst for knowledge

88
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,541
led her to do things
she regrets, even in death.

89
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,708
But of course the price

90
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,458
of knowing everything
knows no bounds.

91
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,750
- [gasps]

92
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,125
Or there's the Witch of Envy,

93
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,000
who killed all the other witches
and used them as sustenance

94
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,125
while making the whole world
her enemy.

95
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:37,708
She is the most detestable
of them all.

96
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,333
[whispering stops]

97
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, what a shame.

98
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,750
It looks like
I've frightened you too much.

99
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,791
It's in a witch's nature.

100
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,583
Bothersome, isn't it?

101
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,333
- [gagging]

102
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,541
- Oh! That took less time
than I thought it would.

103
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,250
People who are compatible
really do adapt quickly.

104
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,833
- What are you talking about?

105
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,708
- The tea
that you drank earlier,

106
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,541
I used
the Envy Witch Factor on it

107
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,500
as a means to strengthen
your resistance a little bit.

108
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,166
Now you and I can talk
freely and leisurely.

109
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,791
So, then, what would you
like to ask me?

110
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,208
- That's enough!

111
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,875
You're not gonna
get away with this!

112
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,875
What did you do to my body?

113
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,666
- Please don't get
the wrong idea.

114
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,166
I didn't make you drink that tea

115
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,458
with the intention
of doing anything bad.

116
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:31,708
In fact, I find your existence
a rather desirable thing.

117
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,958
I'm a bit embarrassed, really.

118
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,250
- Huh?

119
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,583
- Sometime over these
past few days, you killed

120
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,875
the one who possessed the Sloth
Witch Factor, didn't you?

121
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,750
At the moment of his death,

122
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,500
the Witch Factor chose you
as its new dwelling.

123
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,833
That's also why you entered
this burial ground unharmed.

124
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,958
- This what? I'm in a cemetery?

125
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,250
- Mm-hmm. Where you're standing
is the Witch's Graveyard,

126
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,541
where my soul
is being held prisoner,

127
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,916
the Sanctuary.

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,250
- You're saying you know
where the Sanctuary is?!

129
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:05,958
- [gasps] I don't have
enough experience

130
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,416
to get a read on you yet.

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,333
Either you're somebody
who's incredibly brave

132
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,708
- or just very bold.
- Figure it out later!

133
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,833
Now what you're saying is

134
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,333
the forest
where those old ruins are,

135
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,875
where I was before you
zapped me here,

136
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,708
that is the Sanctuary?

137
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,041
- You're so mean.

138
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,166
But actually
you happen to be correct.

139
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,750
The Sanctuary
is just outside of the ruins.

140
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,750
So what other questions
would you like for me--

141
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,333
- And if I ask you to,
you'll let me back out, right?

142
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,458
- Y-Yes, absolutely.
I can guarantee that.

143
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,458
But isn't there anything else
you want to ask me?

144
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,916
'Cause now's your chance.

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,083
- Sorry, but I'd rather
meet up with Emilia outside

146
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,583
than spend another second here
talking to you.

147
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,458
- Huh? [gasps]

148
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,583
Wait! Y-You're kidding,
right?!
But I'm the Witch of Greed!

149
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,416
People from around the world
have come to me

150
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,458
in search of my knowledge,
very powerful people!

151
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,083
So relax, okay? We can just
sit down and talk for a while.

152
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,625
I have knowledge about the truth
of this world that no one-

153
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,000
- Not interested.
- [wails]

154
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,333
- I'll make it a point
to chat over tea with you

155
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,583
some other time
in the future, okay?

156
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,958
- [groans] You'd ask
a dead woman, a witch at that,

157
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,500
to agree
to delay our discussion

158
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,750
as if it were the simplest thing
in the world?

160

ECHIDNA: I've never had
a tea party like this.

161
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,375
If you're really going back,

162
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,750
I'll just take
my compensation first.

163
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,000
- [gasps] Just so you know,

164
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,541
these days, I'm what
you'd call completely broke.

165
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,541
- Compensation for a witch
doesn't mean money.

166
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,708
What I desire from you
is to make a promise to me.

167
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,416
You'll tell no one of what
transpired at this tea party.

168
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,666
That is my condition.

169
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,666
And since
you insist on leaving,

170
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,291
I'll send you away
with a souvenir.

171
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,375
I've decided
to grant you the right

172
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,916
to face the Trial
of the Sanctuary.

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,666
- What are you talking about?

174
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,125
- You may not understand now,

175
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,125
but once you learn where it is,
you'll realize its true worth.

176
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,916
I wonder, what feelings

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,458
will you have towards me
when that happens?

178
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,750
The mere thought of it gives
me
such beautiful expectations.

You really are a witch, huh?

183
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,000
- Without a doubt.

184
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:17,666
and I just so happen to be
a very, very evil magic user.

you won't tell a soul

to know Frederica, do you?!

just hear that name

come out of your filthy mouth?

for a minute, and--

I guess I'll need
to bash your skull in first!

- Quit jumping to conclusions,
and listen to me!

231
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,208
It's because
we all know her, too, okay?!

Now, if you guys know her
like you say you do,

that name before, right?

that I have anything to do
with Frederica?!

- Uh, you're not
actually serious, right?

- I just got beat up
for nothing.

What am I supposed to do

this pent-up anger inside?

"Hey, sorry, about that,

00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,000
Looks like I kinda
jumped the gun," an apology?!

247
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,208
GARFIEL: Eh, if you'd shown me

248
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,083
that thing sooner,
that woulda done it.

You gotta act on a ganglion
without thinkin'.

251
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,333
- Judgin' by that hair,

252
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,666
I'm guessin'
that's the famous Emilia,

253
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,125
the silver-haired half-devil
that Roswaal's been helpin'
out.

254
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,416
- She's a half-elf, got it?!

255
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,291
So don't you ever call her
something like that again!

into your voice after all.

Wanna know how it feels

to be a bazomazo
being flung back and forth?

260

- I gotta ask you something.

261
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,375
Is there
some sort of translation glitch

262
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,000
going on between you and me?

263

Oh, man. I'm glad you're okay!

267
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,875
- Subaru, where--

268
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,291
[gasps] Who are you?!
Just so you know,

269
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,875
I'm not going to let you
lay a single finger on him!

270
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,458
- Hang on, Mili!
I appreciate it,

271
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,583
but as a guy, I have
mixed feelings about this!

272
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,125
- I'm not gonna do anything,

273
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,375
'cause I don't want Ram
givin' me hell later on.

274
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,000
- What?

275
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,000
- Yeah, so, this guy's Garfiel.
- Hold on a minute.

276
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,208
You mean the same one that
Frederica was telling us about?

277
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,791
- Yep, that's right,

278
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,875
and he's showing us
the way to the Sanctuary.

279
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,083
We're headed out there now.
Uh, and that's where

280
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,916
the villagers
from Arlam and Ram are.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,375
Isn't that what you told me?

282
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,833
- You don't wanna believe me,
that's your call,

283
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,958
but either way, there ain't
no turnin' back now, guys.

284
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,083
We've already made it
past the barrier.

285
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,125
- [gasps]
- Huh?

286
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,416
Then we're in the Sanctuary
right now?

287
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,083
- Come on. Gimme a break.
You of all people should know.

288
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,416
Weren't you asleep 'cause you
got too close to the barrier?

289
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,250
- What do you mean by--

290
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,125
Wait. When the stone glowed...

291
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,500
- That's exactly
when it happened.

292
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,416
So this pendant was reacting
to the barrier. Is that it?

293
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,333
Okay, but why did
only Emilia pass out?

294
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,125
I mean,
I got transported somewhere,

295
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,083
but Otto was here.
Why didn't the same th--

- [ Garfiel scoffs]
- [both gasp]

297
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,458
- Don't play dumb.
You know damn well

298
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,958
why the barrier reacted that way
to her and not both of you.

299
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:49,250
And it isn't only half-elves
that thing reacts to, either.

300
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,458
It works on me
and a lot of others, too.

301
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,958
Figure it out yet?

302
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,125
Is it because
you have mixed blood like I do?

303
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,458
- [chuckles]

304
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,958
- Let me make sure
I've got this.

305
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,291
So the Sanctuary is a place

306
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,166
where demihumans
with mixed blood live?

307
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,208
- That's right! Nice guess!

308
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,083
We welcome you here,
Miss Emilia,

309
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,791
and your escorts, too!

[Otto gasps]

311
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,666
GARFIEL:
Roswaal likes to go around

312
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,875
callin' this area the Sanctuary,

313
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,291
but it ain't really
the kinda place

00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,916
that deserves
such a fancy title.

315
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,125
Nothin' there
but a ragbag of halfwits.

316
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,750
It's just
a dead-end testing ground.

317
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,958
- Um, where should we--[gasps]

318
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,041
- So you're finally back?

319
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:33,958
It took you long enough.

320
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,500
SUBARU: Ram!

321
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,333
- I've no clue
which Barusu you are,

322
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,041
but I'm disappointed by how long
it took you to get here.

323
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,583
Although I suppose I was a fool
to expect more of you.

324
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,416
- If your story is gonna be
you have no clue who I am,

325
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,458
then at least stick to it!

326
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,916
- Whatever.
- [growls]

327
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,750
- I would like to welcome you

328
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,791
to the Sanctuary, Miss Emilia.

329
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,833
Master Roswaal
is waiting inside.

330
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,250
Allow me to show you the way.

331
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,000
Garf, I want you to take
the ground dragon and carriage

332
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:03,875
somewhere suitable, all right?

333
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,666
- Now, is that
any way to treat me?

334
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,000
That's just
how I like it, though.

335
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay, cabbie, follow me.

336
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,375
Are you referring to me?!

337
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,875
That's the worst name
you've called me yet!

338
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,791
And why do I have to be
alone with you?!

339
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,333
- I'll grab what's left of you.

340
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,708
OTTO: Why is everyone
so mean to me?

341
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,083
- Hey, what are
you talkin' about?

342
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,375
I'm not being mean.
When I was unconscious,

343
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,500
Emilia only stayed safe
because of you.

344
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,875
I'm grateful.

345
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,000
- Oh? Is that really true,
Mr. Natsuki?

346
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,875
Well, all right, then.
As long as you're appreciative.

347
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,208
See you soon!

348
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,458
- Too easy.

349
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,208
- [gasps]

350
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,041
- What's the matter?
- [gasps] Oh.

351
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,083
Uh, just wondering how you
were doing, that's all.

352
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,750
Remember what was going on
the last time I saw you?

353
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,416
I couldn't get in touch
with you after that,

354
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,958
and to be honest,
I was really worried.

355
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:56,083
- Well, as you can see, I'm
just
as lovely and healthy as ever.

356
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,166
And the villagers of Arlam
are all safe as well,

357
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,166
so don't worry.

358
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,583
- [sighs] That's good to hear.

359
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,625
But more than that,
it's a huge relief to me...

360
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,000
really.

361
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,541
Uh...

362
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,958
so listen. I, uh...

363
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:14,125
[sighs]

364
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,958
- Hey, Ram...

365
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,916
this isn't much of a place
to stand around and talk.

366
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,458
Would you mind
showing us inside?

367
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,250
- Oh, no. Not at all.

368
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,333
- Subaru, are you all right?

369
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,166
- Yeah.

370
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,083
- I'm sorry for interrupting,

371
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,458
but you just seemed to--

372
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,291
- No, it's okay. I get it.

373
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,041
I freaked out a little.

374
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,541
With all that's going on,

375
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,291
for her
to not even ask about Rem...

376
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,583
I'm pretty pathetic, huh?

377
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,041
- Hmm?

378
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,708
It's only natural
for you to feel frightened.

379
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,333
I'll never think
your having emotions

380
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,541
- is the least bit pathetic.
- [sighs]

381
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,083
- Come on. We've come this far,

382
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,541
so let's fix
what happened to Rem

383
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,458
and everything else, too.

384
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,625
Sounds good.

385
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,083
And no matter what happens,
you can count on me

386
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,250
to be your human shield
and keep you safe.

387
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,958
ROSWAAL: Ah, Miss Emilia
and dear Subaru.

388
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:19,166
Feels like it's been so very
long since I last saw you
both.

389
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,416
SUBARU: I was gonna slug you
when I saw you again, but
now...

390
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,000
What the hell happened?

391
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,041
EMILIA: What could have
hurt you like this?

392
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,583
- Well,
It's a rather long story.

393
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,500
Where shall I begin?

394
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,375
SUBARU: Hey, before that,
just one thing.

395
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,250
The alliance with Miss Crusch
is on now.

396
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,416
Are you satisfied

397
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
with the results you got
from ditching me?

398
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,500
- Oh, yes.
I feel most satisfied, indeed.

399
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,958
Truly, you were
the once-in-a-lifetime windfall

400
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,666
I had long waited for.

401
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,666
- Oh, really?

402
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,625
- Roswaal,
what exactly is this place?

403
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,916
- Since we got here--

404
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
No, since we made contact
with the barrier,

405
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,125
I've had this anxious feeling
in my chest. I can't relax.

406
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:01,000
Even though I've heard it
called the Sanctuary,

407
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,666
it really doesn't seem
like one to me at all.

408
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,375
In fact, it feels more like--

409
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,541
- More like a Witch's Graveyard?

410
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,208
Does it seem to make far more
sense for you to call it that?

411
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,500
- [gasps] Wh-What do you mean?

412
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,708
Exactly what I said,
nothing more, nothing less.

413
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,083
These are the very grounds
where the Witch of Greed Echidna

414
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,708
met her end
a long, long time ago,

415
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,125
and in my mind,
it's worth calling a Sanctuary.

416
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,916
- Echidna, huh?

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,541
- EMILIA: Subaru?
- [gasps]

418
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,708
- Are you all right?

419
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:36,250
- Uh, y-yeah, I'm fine.

420
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,958
And why are you
overseeing a place

421
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,333
that has
such a seedy back story, anyway?

422
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,291
- It's quite simple, really.
This land has been overseen

423
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,416
by the heads of the Mathers
family for generations now.

424
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,250
- So then the Mathers family
and the Witch of Greed have--

425
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,541
- It's Echidna.
- Huh?

426
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,416
- Please, when you speak of
her,
I do prefer you use her name.

427
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,958
"The Witch of Greed"
is rather unbecoming.

428
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,750
It makes her sound so sinister.

429
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,875
Not very nice, is it?

430
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,166
- Um, then the Mathers family
and Echidna

431
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,166
have been acquainted
for a long time,

432
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,083
and that's why they've
always overseen this place?

433
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,166
- Indeed,
although saying, "oversee,"

434
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,916
is a bit of an exaggeration.

435
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,291
The barrier here
does most of the work,

436
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:19,666
thwarting entry from outsiders
who don't follow procedure.

437
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,375
In addition to that, the barrier
triggers certain effects

438
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,125
on those whose blood
meets specific conditions.

439
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,458
I believe you experienced this
yourself, Miss Emilia.

440
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,125
- [gasps]

441
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,500
- That doesn't explain
how you got so jacked up.

442
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,541
You're bandaged in a bed,
recuperating.

443
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,458
- [sighs]

444
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,500
- Did you not find it the least
bit strange, Miss Emilia?

445
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,125
- Huh?

446
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,541
- That all the people
who fled to the Sanctuary

447
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,166
along with Master Roswaal
and myself

448
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,750
ended up remaining here instead
of returning to the mansion?

449
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,625
- Uh, oh, well, I...

450
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,208
You stayed around 'cause
you're hurt, didn't you?

451
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,416
- It's because
none of us can leave.

452
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,416
We're all being held
under house arrest

453
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,416
here in the Sanctuary.

454
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,791
- BOTH: Huh?!
- Myself, Ram,

455
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,666
the people of Arlam, everyone.

456
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,166
And I'm sure that goes
for the two of you as well,

457
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,708
trapped from the moment
you arrived.

458
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,250
- What the hell?

459
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,416
You guys are still
flappin' your gums in here?

460
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,833
- House arrest?

461
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,333
- So Roswaal's injuries are--
- Nope, not at all.

462
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,333
Roswaal here got hurt 'cause he
was rejected by the Trial.

463
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,750
- Wait. What?
- I don't understand.

464
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,583
- You've seen what happens when
you enter this place, right,

465
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,583
when you make contact
with the barrier?

466
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,583
Mixed-bloods who go through that
and still come inside,

467
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,000
you're stuck here forever
like the rest of us.

468
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,583
- [gasps]

[Emilia gasps]

470
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,625
- The barrier doesn't mean
jack squat to most people,

471
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,125
which seems a little unfair
if you ask me.

472
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,333
Don't you think, Miss Emilia?

473
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,666
The only way to break it

474
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,791
is to go through
the Graveyard's trial.

475
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,750
But if anybody
who isn't a mixed-blood

tries to take it on...

477
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,208
All of the villagers
have been rounded up

478
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,708
in one place here.

479
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,875
Long as they don't act up,
we won't hurt 'em.

Break the barrier.

The only one allowed
to go through the Trial

and make that happen is you.
If you can't,

we won't let any of
the villagers leave this place,

If I remember correctly,

you bowed your head to us

so we'll all back you
in the royal selection,

so long as you say so.

But if you have some

reason for taking this
risk,

then we have a right to know.

I don't have

it wasn't for very long,
