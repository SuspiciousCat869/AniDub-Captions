1
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:04,875
ECHIDNA: It's terrible.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,583
And, no, I'm not referring
to your behavior.

3
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:09,833
I simply can't help

4
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:13,041
feeling overwhelmed
with a sense of rage

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:16,083
toward the one who put you
through so much hardship.

6
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,625
- Do you mean...

7
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,416
- Yes, the Witch of Envy.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,000
- [shudders]

9
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,708
- I'm certain you're well aware

10
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,208
the power you possess

11
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,250
is undeniably that of a witch.

12
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,666
You've known for some time.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,666
Thing is,
I've had plenty of people

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,083
tellin' me about a witch,

15
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,416
but I still don't have any idea

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,708
why she's gotten
so fixated on me.

17
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,291
- And why should you?

18
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,125
No one's capable
of understanding

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,875
just how her mind works.

20
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,125
Though, honestly, even
if
I could, I wouldn't want
to.

21
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,291
[cup rattles]

22
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,083
- Hey...
- Eh?

23
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,500
Do you think there's a limit

24
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,083
to how many times
I can use Return by Death?

25
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:58,250
- Ah, yes. I suppose that is
the obvious question to ask.

26
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,250
I'll tell you in advance
that I'm only
speculating...

27
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,500
but I would presume...

28
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,833
there isn't.

29
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,208
ECHIDNA: Vexing as it may be,

30
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,791
the power that lets you
Return by Death

31
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,625
is the witch's
intense delusion.

32
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:22,041
As long as that delusion
persists, so will your power.

33
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,500
- Do you have any clue
why she passed it on to me?

34
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,166
- I would assume
it's to keep you from dying.

35
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,541
It forces you
to redo your destiny

36
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,166
and doesn't let you
make any mistakes.

37
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,750
- In that case,
something's wrong,

38
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,291
because I...

39
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:41,000
[gasps] I still
couldn't get Rem back.

40
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,625
If she's making me
change the outcomes,

41
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,916
why am I stuck
where that's irreversible?

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,750
- Because she was
never taken into account

43
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,458
as a part of your destiny.

44
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,833
- Huh?
- The Witch of Envy,

45
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,500
she hopes you will
never be trapped

46
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,916
by the dead end
that is true death.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,416
Anyone who is not you
isn't a part of that plan.

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,125
The decision
to use the witch's power

49
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,583
to save someone else
is yours and yours alone.

50
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,458
- [gasps]

51
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,875
- You'll overcome destiny

52
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,541
through countless challenges
from this point on.

53
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,041
However, if you manage
to change its path

54
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,208
at the expense
of too many sacrifices...

55
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,375
- Then I won't have
a chance to get back

56
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,333
the ones who were sacrificed
in the process.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,875
- I'm afraid
that's just how it is.

58
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,208
[faint singing]

59
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,333
[vocalizing]

60
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,291
- All right, fine.
If that's how it's gonna be

61
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,541
and you're reserving that favor
for me alone,

62
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,833
I know what I have to do now.

63
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,666
I'll use this Return by Death
power that you gave me

64
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,750
'til there's
nothing left to use!

65
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,625
Yeah, that's it.
I've made up my mind.

66
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,750
I can betray expectations
like a pro!

67
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,583
There's nobody
who does it better!

68
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,583
- You certainly bounced back

69
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,416
with a surprising
amount of ease.

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,583
- It wasn't easy at all.

71
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,125
Normally, I would've just
tried taping my broken
heart

72
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,166
back together
out of pure desperation,

73
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,750
but this time around, I...

74
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,875
[sighs]

75
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,083
- [chuckles]

76
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,583
Aren't you going to finish?

77
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,333
You can speak freely.

78
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,708
- Well? Go on.
- [grumbles]

79
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,541
Look, you know damn well
what I was gonna say.

80
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,708
Anyway, getting your input's
been really valuable,

81
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,208
and it helped me
make up my mind, too,

82
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,750
so thanks. I appreciate it.

83
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,625
- Just for that part?

84
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,708
That was all
you intend to thank me for

85
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,750
after sharing your deepest
and darkest secret with me?

86
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,625
- [gasps] Ah, shut up!

87
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,000
Think I've shown you
enough gratitude, all right?

88
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,041
You should be trying
to make me ask you questions,

89
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,625
like the last time I was here!

90
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,041
I'll pay whatever you want,

91
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,333
'cause you're the only one
who I can depend on.

92
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,000
- [sighs] All right.
I'm convinced you must have

93
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,666
some kind of knack
for seducing witches

94
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,625
So what would you like
to ask me, then?

95
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,041
- There's still
so much I don't know,

96
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,375
but first and foremost would be
what happened earlier...

97
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,375
when I died by being eaten.

98
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,375
Those rabbits
could've fit in my hand.

99
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,541
- Ah. You mean the Great Rabbit.

100
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,041
- How's it called that?

101
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,916
- In this case, it's great
not in size, but in number.

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,708
It's but one
of the Three Great Mabeasts.

103
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,000
- Wait. The what?

104
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,875
- There's the White Whale,
the Black Serpent,

105
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,291
and the Great Rabbit.

106
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,041
They were created 400 years ago

107
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,333
by Daphne,
the Witch of Gluttony.

108
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,333
They're her legacies
of misfortune

109
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,833
that still wreak havoc
upon the world.

110
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,041
- You've gotta be kidding me.

111
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,125
I only recently managed
to take down the White Whale.

112
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,833
- There's more
to this unpleasant story.

113
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,166
In terms
of overall fighting strength,

114
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,666
the White Whale
is definitely stronger.

115
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,500
However, the Great Rabbit

116
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,541
is infinitely
more difficult to eliminate.

117
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,000
To its way of thinking,

118
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,500
other living things
serve only as food,

119
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:00,541
and its single desire is merely
to keep satisfying that hunger

120
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,541
until all that's left behind
is a deserted field.

121
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,291
- If that's what happens,
then...

122
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,041
everything that I saw was...

123
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,750
- What makes the Great Rabbit
so resilient is its viability.

124
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:16,500
A single one is capable
of multiplying indefinitely.

125
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,291
- Indefinitely?
What is it, an amoeba?!

126
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,375
- To truly eradicate
this creature,

127
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,000
you would have to kill
every one of them

128
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,041
at exactly the same time.

129
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,666
That would be
like trying to evaporate

130
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,708
each raindrop as they fall
from the sky
simultaneously.

131
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,875
- All we can do is run, then.

132
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,416
Hang on. That won't work,
'cause the barrier's there.

133
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,708
As long as it is, Emilia
and the others can't leave.

134
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,791
The Great Rabbit
in the Sanctuary,

135
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,666
the attack on the mansion...

136
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,125
I have to break the barrier

137
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,500
and free them
before any of that happens.

138
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,458
Then I'll gather everyone
at the mansion

139
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,958
to defeat Elsa
and the mabeasts. So I have...

140
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:52,916
ELSA:<i> Though,</i>
<i>since you came back</i>

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,041
<i>sooner than anyone expected,</i>

142
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,875
<i>this didn't play out exactly</i>
<i>as my directions specified.</i>

143
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,708
- Four days? Shit.

144
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,791
[gasps]

145
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,875
Echidna, do you know
if there's a way?

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,708
- The risk is so substantial

147
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,666
that I hesitate to suggest it.

148
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,041
But what if I told you
I could give you an opportunity

149
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,333
to spend time speaking

150
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,916
with Daphne,
the Witch of Gluttony?

151
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:20,625
- Huh? I thought you told me
all the other witches are
dead.

152
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,125
- You do realize you're
talking
to one right now, don't you?

153
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,791
In this castle of dreams,

154
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,125
the souls of the dead witches
reside within me.

155
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,625
In other words...

156
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,791
- You're saying
you can call her out here?

157
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,958
- I'd let her
temporarily inhabit my presence.

158
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,583
During that time, the two of us

159
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,458
would quite literally
trade places.

160
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,666
- [gasps]

161
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,500
- But I must tell you
I don't recommend it.

162
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,458
In the dimension we're in now,
there is no death,

163
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,708
but if your mind sustains
an injury causing it to break,

164
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,958
it will remain shattered even
after you return to your body.

165
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,750
- Do you mean I'd become
some kind of invalid?

166
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,500
That's a way bigger risk
than I'd be taking outside.

167
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,916
- Do you decline, then?

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,166
- [sighs]

169
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,750
Well, she did create
the Great Rabbit,

170
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,666
so if I wanna know
how to defeat it,

171
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,166
she'd be the best one to ask.

172
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,625
[inhales]

173
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,208
All right, do it.

174
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,708
- If you're sure
about this, fine,

175
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,541
but I just need to tell you
one thing first.

176
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,000
No matter what you do,

177
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,333
never release
Daphne's restraints.

178
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,583
- Her what?
- In addition to that,

179
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,291
you are not permitted
to touch her,

180
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,625
and if possible,
you should avoid eye contact.

181
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,666
- Great. If I follow
all of these rules of yours,

182
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,791
she's gonna end up
thinkin' I'm a total jerk!

183
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,625
- Very best of luck to you.

184
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,041
- [gasps]

185
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,041
- Ah! We meet at last!

186
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,166
- Huh?
- Hold on.

187
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,583
What do you mean by, "Huh"?

188
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,750
You should know that saying
such a thing is very rude!

189
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,708
Hmph!

190
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,208
- So, you're a--

191
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,041
I mean, I take it
you're also a witch, right?

192
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,750
- Chidna already told you,
didn't she?

193
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,958
And you're...

194
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's see here.

195
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:04,750
Baru! Yeah, that's it.

196
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,916
- Baru?

197
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,500
- Now tell me something.

198
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,875
Are you bad, Baru?

199
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,166
'Cause I've been wondering
about that this whole time.

200
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,666
- Am I bad?
- [grunts]

201
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,541
- Do you want me
to hold your hand?

202
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,791
Hang on a minute!

203
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,166
There's something
I wanted to ask you fi--

204
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,250
- [laughs]
- Okay, okay!

205
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,291
Fine!

206
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,500
- There is only one way
to pay for sins,

207
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,083
and that is through pain.

208
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,708
- Huh?
- Ah!

209
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,875
If you don't feel pain,

210
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,125
that means
you must not be a bad guy!

211
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,750
That's really great to know!

212
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,333
- [gasps]

213
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,750
[wailing]

214
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,583
- But it doesn't hurt, does it?
- You took my arm!

215
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,958
If you make too much noise here,

216
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,583
Chidna's gonna hate you,
for sure.

217
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,041
- You're a psycho!

218
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,791
G-Give it back!

219
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,708
- Sin is a dividing wedge
that nobody can escape.

220
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,541
- [grunting]

221
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,291
- You see yourself as a sinner,

222
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,541
even though you're really not
a bad guy at all. Is that it?

223
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,250
You have
such a good heart, Baru!

224
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,708
You poor thing.

225
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:07,958
Well, I guess that's really
all I came out here for.

226
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,583
And that would leave...

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,875
- First! To strike
all that defies reason!

228
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,583
Second!

229
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,708
Who cares about committing
every heinous evildoing?!

230
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,958
Third! Whether things
are ugly or beautiful,

231
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,125
if you're here
in this fleeting world...

232
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:29,541
don't ever expect
to make it back unscathed!

233
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,041
The strike of my fist
will restore the world!

234
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,583
My anger will follow behind
and cleanse it!

235
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,250
The fury of my two fists,
the frenzy of my rage,

236
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,375
they are the answers to it all!

237
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,125
- Why are you crying?

238
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,416
- I'm not crying!
I'm just angry!

239
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,833
That's right!
It's intense anger!

240
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,916
This is all Typhon's fault
for hurting you like that!

241
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,291
Stupid Typhon!

242
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,916
I hate this world
for making her do that,

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,666
- every bit of it!
- Uh...

244
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,166
I appreciate you saving me.

245
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,291
So who are you, anyway?

246
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,916
[sighs]
I'm the Witch of Wrath, Minerva!

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,250
But giving my name isn't
what's important right now.

248
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,833
- You just did, though!

249
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,291
- [groans] Listen up!

250
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,666
If you've learned your lesson,
then don't be careless!

251
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,250
Next time around,
I'll just heal everyone!

252
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,166
- Why'd you make it
sound like a threat?

253
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,125
[gasps]

254
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,375
What's going on here?

255
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,500
Typhon and Minerva?

256
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,166
This isn't what we agreed to--

257
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,875
[winces]

258
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,500
Oh, come on.

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,083
- Daphne has arrived.

260
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,958
What would you
like to ask me...

261
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,375
Subarun?

262
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,625
- [gasps]

263
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:55,166
- I'm here because
Chid-Chid asked me to come,

264
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,791
but I don't want to be
awake
any longer than I have
to.

265
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,833
so please don't drag this out
with dull conversation.

266
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,833
[sniffs]

267
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,291
Ah. Oh, no.

268
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,250
This scent might be
quite dangerous for me.

269
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,250
[bonds clanking]

270
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,666
- Wh-What the hell?

271
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,958
- My body is throbbing!

272
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,333
Oh, this is so hard to take!

273
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,916
You give off an odor
that I really, really love...

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,416
- [gasps]
- and it's making me

275
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,125
want to eat you.

276
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,416
[slurps]

277
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,916
- Gotcha.

278
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,125
Then why don't we
make this quick?

279
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:31,708
I wanna talk about the
Three
Great Mabeasts you made.

280
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,000
- Great Mabeasts, Subarun?

281
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,041
- Yeah, you know,

282
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:35,916
the White Whale,
the Great Rabbit,

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,166
and the Black Serpent
or whatever.

284
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,875
You did make them, didn't you?

285
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,625
- Oh, of course. I get it.

286
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,083
You mean the whale,
the bunny, and the snake.

287
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,125
- Now, why in the hell did you
make all those things, anyway?

288
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,250
- Huh? What was that again?

289
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,000
- You heard me! I wanna know why

290
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,541
you set those damn things loose
on the world!

291
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,333
Do you realize what they've--

292
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,541
Why did you do it?

293
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,833
What's the point in unleashing

294
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,958
monsters like that
in the first place?

295
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:04,791
- Ah, the White Whale.

296
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,333
It's very big, isn't it?

297
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,916
If people just ate it,
it would sate so many appetites,

298
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,125
- don't you think?
- Huh?

299
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,458
- And when it comes
to the Great Rabbit,

300
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,458
it can copy itself forever.

301
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,375
- [gasps]
- With those two around,

302
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,375
people could eat and eat.

303
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,375
No one would ever go hungry.

304
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,958
I'm saying
that your Great Rabbit

305
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,291
is the one eating everybody!

306
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,333
These mabeasts
are taking more people away

307
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,750
than they're feeding--
- Don't you think

308
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,000
it's a bit selfish
to try and eat another

309
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,833
without at least
considering the possibility

310
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,208
that the predator
might become the prey?

311
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,000
The same goes for you.

312
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,375
Now, wouldn't you agree

313
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,166
that everybody takes gluttony
much too lightly?

314
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,541
After all, the appetite
is the most important

315
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,166
of all the desires
that keep people alive.

316
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,541
Because even
if the heart is full

317
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,416
and the mind's
completely at ease,

318
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,000
people will die if they
don't eat something, right?

319
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,958
- Listen, I'll admit what
you're saying is partly true,

320
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,041
Even so...

321
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,833
- You'll understand,
too, sometime,

322
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,833
if you ever find yourself
starved to your very limit.

323
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,833
Then you'll see
just what sort of world

324
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,291
my bunny and I live in.

325
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,500
- If I told you I wanted
to get rid of your Great Rabbit,

326
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,875
would you give me
any tips on how to do it?

327
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,291
- The Great Rabbit
relies on its ability

328
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:20,125
to detect mana
to track down and find its prey.

329
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,791
- So you don't mind?

330
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,500
- We must all eat
to stay alive, correct?

331
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,416
Knowing that
is an absolute truth.

332
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,833
It wouldn't make any sense

333
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,708
to deny
that we must kill to survive.

334
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,625
The Great Rabbit
is naturally drawn

335
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,041
to places
that have a lot of mana,

336
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,000
so you could use a powerful
magic user as a lure,

337
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:41,083
then wipe them all out at once
when they gather there.

338
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,916
- But it can multiply
over and over,

339
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,833
so won't there be some
that separate from the group?

340
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,750
- There may be
quite a few of them,

341
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,041
but they all share
one consciousness.

342
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,375
They don't have the wisdom
to avoid being killed,

343
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,958
so it won't make a difference.

344
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,416
[yawns]

345
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,333
I'm getting really sleepy.

346
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,083
- Are you finished with me now?
- Yeah, sorry.

347
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,375
I still don't get
why you created those things,

348
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,958
but I've learned a lot.

349
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,083
Thank you for the help.

350
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,458
But just know...

351
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,750
I will destroy the Great Rabbit.

352
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,041
I already killed
the White Whale.

353
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:16,833
You'd better not come crying
to me like a grieving mother.

354
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,416
They've run wild
for over 400 years,

355
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,041
and that's
more than long enough.

356
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,166
I'll wipe them all out
without a trace.

357
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,375
- If you think a human...

358
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,000
[bonds clanking]

359
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:36,708
is capable of such an act,
then go ahead and try it.

360
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,125
- [gasps]

361
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,125
[gasps]

362
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,125
Man, seeing your face
is such a relief.

363
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,416
It's almost like being
back home with family.

364
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,125
- That's a rather confusing way
to describe it,

365
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,291
but honestly,
I was disconcerted, too,

366
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,500
when Typhon jumped in

367
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,458
the moment I tried
to give my body to Daphne.

368
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,208
- Oh, you were, huh?

369
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,958
- Yes, the Witch of Pride,
just a child, as you saw.

370
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,416
- She was so eager to meet you
that she jumped right out.

371
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,125
- [groans]
- And the one who saved you,

372
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,875
that was
the Witch of Wrath, Minerva.

373
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,291
- Uh...
- So, then,

374
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,000
did the time
you spent with Daphne

375
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,083
bring forth
any useful information?

376
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,333
- Sorta, yeah. First of all,

377
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,333
I learned that,
compared to those other witches,

378
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,375
you are definitely
the most normal one.

379
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,500
- Oh, please. Just stop.

380
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,666
That's quite enough.

381
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,458
I can tell
that you're only trying

382
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,041
to butter me up
with those pleasing words.

383
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,166
Don't go underestimating me
like that.

384
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,041
- Man, you don't have
a filter at all, do you?

385
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:42,916
Anyway, think I'll pass

386
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,250
on the bodily fluids
and cookies.

387
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,666
- It's not like I put
a hair in it or anything.

388
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,208
- You may be
the most normal witch,

389
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,333
but I still can't trust
a single thing you say.

390
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,125
[gasps]

391
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,375
What the...

392
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,416
- Well, it would appear
that it's almost time

393
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,166
for you to wake up now.

394
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,291
Perhaps there's something
outside rousing you faster.

395
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,541
[wind blowing]

396
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,125
[vocalizing]

397
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,291
- You're talking
about Emilia, aren't you?

398
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,750
Hang on a minute.
How could I have forgotten this?

399
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,541
Weren't you the one
passing yourself off

400
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,000
as the examiner for the trial?

401
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,708
So why are you here, then?

402
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,750
She ought to be going
through it right about now!

403
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,916
- Because frankly the end result
is already in sight.

404
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,666
- And what exactly
is that supposed to mean?

405
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,000
- It means
I have no interest at all

406
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,208
in the outcome of her challenge.

407
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,333
After three days
of trial and error,

408
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,541
I can't hold out hope that
she'll break out of her shell.

409
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,666
So maybe...

410
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,291
you could go through it instead?

411
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,125
Since you've decided to continue
repeating everything,

412
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,666
perhaps you would
consider giving wings

413
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,375
to the cowardly princess?

414
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,291
- I can't stand that I'm
letting you provoke me,

415
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,416
but I am not gonna let you
make Emilia cry any more.

416
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,208
- Oh, no. You're mistaken.
I'm not the one making her cry.

417
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,583
- Yeah, whatever.

418
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,375
I'm going through
that sadistic trial of yours.

419
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,083
That was my whole plan
from the beginning.

420
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,958
- I really don't think
it's necessary

421
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,416
to refer to my trial
as sadistic.

422
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
- Tell me. How can I
come back here again, Echidna?

423
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,375
- What?

424
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,750
- I know that I'm being selfish,

425
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,208
but you've helped me out a lot,

426
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,666
and there's a good chance
I'll need more of it.

427
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,333
You have so much information.
And besides...

428
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,666
- I know all about your
secret Return by Death power.

429
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,000
- That's right. Exactly.

430
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,375
- I have to admit it feels nice
to be depended on,

431
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,666
but I think that would be

432
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,250
a rather difficult request
for me to fulfill.

433
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,208
The conditions
to attend my tea party

434
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,625
grow stricter each time,
and as I'm sure you're aware,

435
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,500
you've already
been invited twice.

436
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,250
If you cry out,
"I want to know,"

437
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,458
from the bottom of your heart,

438
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,625
rest assured
your voice will reach me,

439
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,750
but it must be even louder
the third time

440
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,458
than the second one.

441
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,375
Think you can do that?

442
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,458
- [sighs]

443
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,666
- Then again,
if you undergo the trial,

444
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,791
as you've already
committed to doing,

445
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,791
that won't be the only way.

446
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,541
- [gasps] That's right!

447
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,208
I can see you
while I'm in the trial, too!

448
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,291
I doubt our conversation
will be over tea, though.

449
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,500
- Well, if you truly insist,
I can al--

450
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,458
- Nope! That's totally fine.

451
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,833
[gasps] Whoa. Holy crap.

452
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,166
I'm starting to feel
pretty lightheaded right now.

453
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,875
Oh, one more thing before I go.

454
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,000
- Hmm?
- The payment to make sure

455
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,666
I don't forget
what happened here,

456
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,291
you need that, don't you?

457
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,041
- Oh! Of course, the payment.

458
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,500
So this time,
you won't leave and forget.

459
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,958
Let me see.

460
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,666
I think I'll take that.

461
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,333
- Really? You sure?

462
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,833
I mean,
it's only a handkerchief.

463
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,416
Besides, I swore that I would--

464
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,666
- No need for you to worry.

465
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,666
This world exists
within the mind,

466
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,208
which means the physical one

467
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,583
won't be gone
when you're back outside.

468
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,166
- Right.

469
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,333
How does it serve
as your payment, anyway?

470
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,208
- The one
who gave you this token

471
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,333
did so out of heartfelt concern
for you, correct?

472
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,125
It would be wrong
to ridicule that sentiment.

473
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,416
This payment is recognition
of their existence

474
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,541
and perhaps
a bit of meddling as well.

Okay, thanks again.

480
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,666
See you in the trial, I guess.

481
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,666
- Subaru Natsuki...

482
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,875
if you do attend the witch's
tea party for a third time...

483
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,541
- Huh?
- remember this.

484
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,708
During our conversation,
there'll be

485
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,666
something in particular
I'd like to tell you.

486

- [coughing]

487
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,375
Do I always
have to go through this?

488
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,750
I remember.

489
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,291
I guess Echidna managed
to keep her promise, then. Good.

490
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,625
I swear, that so-called witch
is just a big fraud.

491
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,916
Thanks again.
I'll be counting on you.

492
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,958
Eh?

493
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,583
So Emilia wasn't the one
who was waking me up?

494
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,708
Hold on a second.

495
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,291
She didn't panic
and run outside, did she?!

Hey, Emilia!

Where are you?!

Please, answer me!

If you got some kind of problem,

530
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,458
then you better tell me now.

- Uh...

532
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,541
no, I don't have a problem. I--

I guess I just wasn't
expecting
you to save me. That's all.

what's goin' on here?

The important thing right now

is findin' a way to bite off
that damn thing's head,

are you doing here...

Witch of Envy?!

Think, damn it!

543
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,375
You have to come up with a way

544
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,958
to try and keep her
from destroying everything!

545

You have to beat her somehow!

- Hang on.
So that creepy-ass bitch

547

What?
She's gonna leave the barrier?

That must be it!

That witch isn't stopping

to Roswaal's mansion!

What terrible luck.

And here I am, not even knowing
the outcome of the trial.

If you wish
to walk through Hell,

then I will
gladly accompany you.

563
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,708
If instead,
you wish to live in Hell,

564
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,875
then I'll make certain
that is what I strive for.

565

One request.
