- Since everybody's taking
shelter in the graveyard now,

3
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:08,791
I guess that means
you finished the trial.

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,125
That's awesome.

5
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,291
Great job, Mili. [gasps]

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,916
- Is she--
- Subaru!

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,083
Focus your attention
here for now, I suppose!

8
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,791
Why are you
suddenly acting so strange?

9
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,666
- Oh, uh,
hearing you call me "Subaru"

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,291
is still kinda new to me,

11
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,208
so I was
just basking in it a little.

12
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,208
- Save that for later,
I suppose...

13
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,166
Subaru.

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,250
- Damn. You are just so cute!
- [grumbles]

15
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,333
- It looks like we're about to
go up against the Great Rabbit.

16
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,083
Are you ready for this?

17
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,333
- The contract
was only just signed,

18
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,291
and it's one
of the Three Great Mabeasts.

19
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,458
The contractor's quite a novice.

20
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,333
Plus it's been 400 years

21
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,291
since I was involved
in a battle, I suppose.

22
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,250
- And?

23
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,291
- I'd call this situation
the perfect handicap.

- Oh, no. There's not a chance.

28
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,166
Emilia's behind me,
and you're beside me.

29
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,541
This is the strongest I've
ever felt in my whole life!

30
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,541

So what should I do to help?!

35
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,083
- For starters,
just keep holding my hand,

36
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,541
and don't leave me alone,
I suppose.

37

Now close your eyes.

Begin imagining yourself

and shaping your power
into arrows,

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,791
crushing the enemy
in a single supreme attack.

41

- Done! Okay!
- Good!

These things keep coming!
What's the plan?

54
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,875
- What we need to do now
is gather all of them

55
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,541
in one place, right here.

56
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:19,166
- Huh?

57
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,333
- While they may be infinite,

58
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,833
they still have
an upper limit, I suppose,

59
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,583
so they can only multiply
up to a certain number,

60
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,708
which means...

61
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,541
- By stopping them
when they hit that number,

62
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,375
we should be able
to take 'em down!

63
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,416
- But the question
is how to do it.

64
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,833
- Think you might be forgetting.

65
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,708
It's not like the two of us
have
to solve this problem alone.

66
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,625
- Huh?

67
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,583

While I'm getting
everything ready,

act as a decoy, I suppose.

71
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,500
- Not a problem.

72
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,416
When it comes
to being bait for the enemy,

73

there's no one in Lugunica
who's
better at doing that than me!

I know I'm probably
asking too much of you,

85
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,541
and if you can't do it,

86
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,625
I'll try and come up
with something else.

want you to give it a shot!

who proved to be
"that person" for you?

in any way, shape, or form,

- Why?

143
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,583
- Because when I sincerely
asked him to take on that role,

144
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,500
he just started laughing.

145
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,625
Then he insisted
he could make me much happier

146
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,958
than some random stranger
I wouldn't even recognize

147
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,125
ever could, I suppose.

148

- Sounds like him.

149
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,958
That's quite an arrogant answer.

150
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,083
- But I don't really hate
how pushy he can be.

Even though you know you won't
ever be his first priority?

00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,416
You and I really haven't
spoken enough, have we?

165
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,666
Not in all the time
since we were both with Teacher.

166
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,166
- What do you mean by that?

167
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,666
[gasps] Are you<i> the</i> Roswaal?

168
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,208
- Well, of course.
Who else would I be?

169
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,083
- No! No!
That's not what I meant!

170
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,041
- I was only joking.

171
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,208
It's true.

172
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:48,958
I am that Roswaal, Beatrice.

173
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,750
- You mean
by soul transcription?

174
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,541
From Mother's attempts
to try and live forever?

175
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,083
But every one of them failed!

176
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,750
- The soul of another won't
take hold in an empty vessel,

177
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:02,333
so rather than use someone
else,
you need only prepare a vessel

178
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,833
that has high affinity
with the pursuer's soul.

179
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,541
- [gasps]

180
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,708
- Tell me, do you feel
I'm some kind of monster?

181
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,041
- [gasps]

182
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,875
Kneel down right there,
I suppose.

183
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,875
- Kneel down, you say?

184
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,916
- Now brace yourself.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,708
- [gasps]

186
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,500
[groans]

187
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,625
I presume that was your way

188
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,000
of showing contempt
for my dubious actions?

189
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,250
- Certainly not.
I neither know nor care

190
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,375
why it is
you want to be reprimanded.

191
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,083
That was obviously payback
for burning down

192
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,916
the forbidden library,
I suppose.

193
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,250
BEATRICE:<i> This childish</i>
<i>infatuation of yours</i>

194

BEATRICE: Roswaal...

201
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,500
- Yes?

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,625
- Welcome back.

203
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,083
- Yes. That's right.

204
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,500

EMILIA: They still
haven't come out of there.

209
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,875
- Yeah,
but I'm sure they're fine.

210
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,958
- [laughs]

211
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,416
Your trust in Beatrice
has grown quite a bit.

212
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,000
But you two were always
good friends, weren't you?

213
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,458
- Both now and then,

214
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,416
I don't know if you'd
exactly call us "friends."

215
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,708
- [energy chimes]
- Hey, is that Puck?

216
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,208
[chiming continues]

217
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,791
I'd like to thank him
for his help,

218
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,583
but he's still
pretty zonked out, isn't he?

219
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,250
- He's exhausted. I guess
with everything that happened,

220
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,666
he overdid it a little.

221
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,166
And even having
this stone to occupy

222
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,666
isn't enough to wake him up.

223
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,291
- But you'll definitely
call him back someday, though.

224
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:16,750
- Right?

225
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,208
- [gasps]

226
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,708
Of course.

227
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,291
- I've gotta say
you've changed, Mili.

228
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,500
You seem so much stronger.

229
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:32,041
- If I am, then it's only
thanks to you and everyone else,

230
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,416
since all I ever do
is take, anyway.

231
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,041
I need to get to a point where
I can give back to others soon.

232
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,541
- [chuckles] Well,
it's funny you should say that.

233
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,708
I feel like all I ever do
is take, too. [laughs]

234
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,875
- By the way, Subaru, I...

235
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,000
I wanted to...

236
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,000
- Huh? What's up?

237
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,083
Your face just turned beet red
all of a sudden. You okay?

238
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,458
Uh, I'm okay, totally fine.

239
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,916
Anyway, there's something
important I wanted to discuss.

240
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,083
- Eh, what is it?

241
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,791
You're acting
pretty weird right now.

242
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,583
- Well, just so I'm sure...

243
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,250
you said that you--
that you loved me, right?

244
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,291
- [gasps] Uh, yes, I did!

245
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,125
I do, so much!

246
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,541
- Good. Um...

247
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,333
that, uh, makes me
really, really happy.

248
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,708
That said, I, uh...

249
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,625
think we should have
an important conversation.

250
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,375
You see...

251
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,000
I wanted to talk about...

252
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,958
[whimpers]

253
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,000
the baby that's in my belly!

254
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,125
- Excuse me?

255
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:36,958
- I-I'm still not sure

256
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,583
if it's a boy or a girl
at this point,

257
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,583
and I know that it's
a big responsibility,

258
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,916
but I don't have a clue
about this kind of thing.

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,416
So I-I figured I had to talk
to the father about it.

260
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,041
- Whoa, whoa, wait a minute!

261
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,125
Mili, you've seriously
got to slow down here!

262
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,833
You just said that--
you said, "a baby," right?

263
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,375
- Y-Yes, exactly!
I know it won't be easy

264
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,958
with the royal selection
going on,

265
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,000
but that's not the baby's fault!

266
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,083
I just want to do my best
and make our child happy!

267
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,875
[light music playing]

268
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,291
- Listen.

269
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,458
Babies aren't delivered
to you by storks, you know.

270
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,958
And they aren't grown in
magical cabbage fields, either.

271
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,458
- Well, obviously!
I'm aware of that!

272
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,833
They're made when a boy and girl
kiss on the lips, right?

273
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,458
- Huh?

274
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,458

SUBARU: Okay, okay,
that's enough.

285
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,625
So now that we've gotten
all our scores settled,

286
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,958
I think it's time for us to
talk
about where we go from here.

287
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,083
I was sure you'd be
pretty pissed, though, Ram.

288
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,125
- Don't be silly.
Though I would never say

289
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,666
that Master Roswaal has nothing
whatsoever to apologize for,

290
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,416
I'm choosing to treat him
with kindness and respect

291
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,916
instead of brutality
after he's made ame--

292
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,125
- To say you have bizarre taste
is putting it mildly.

293
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,000
And with wounds like yours,
what would have happened

294
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,375
if I hadn't been here,
I suppose?

295
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,083
- I feel grateful for everything
you did to save me,

296
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,458
but I'd rather not be told
whom I should love.

297
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,000
- Forget it.
Ram ain't gonna change her mind.

298
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,041
But are you seriously tellin'
me
that this backstabbin' bastard

299
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,375
is somebody you think
should be one of us, Boss?

300
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,916
'Cause without you
and the others here,

301
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
the mansion and the village
would have been a disaster,

302
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,166
which was all
a part of his plan!

303
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,166
- Believe me, I understand.

304
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,125
But we're gonna need
Roswaal's strength.

305
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,666
GARFIEL: What do you mean?

306
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,791
- There's no way Emilia
could ever hope to compete

307
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,375
in the royal selection
without his full support.

308
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,333
It's natural that you'd want to
get even with him and then some,

309
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,833
but we can't just smack him
around and send him off.

310
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,000
- Yeah, well, I don't agree
with any of this crap.

311
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,541
- I, on the other hand, am
willing to forgive the Master.

312
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,500
- Come on!
This clown-faced son of a bitch

313
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,833
put you and the mansion in--

314
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:51,125
- Regardless of that,
I'm still alive and well, Garf,

315
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,000
'cause you were there to
stand your ground and save me.

316
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,541
- That ain't
nothin' but hindsight!

317
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,166
- I understand your hesitation,

318
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,250
but I've been in the Master's
care for more than ten years.

319
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,583
I accepted his aid
in achieving my own goals

320
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,750
while offering up my services
to him and his household.

321
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,000
If it wasn't
for his wisdom and guidance,

322
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,208
I wouldn't be the person
that I am today.

323
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,875
- Listen,
your debt and your life

324
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:13,416
are a lot different,
all right?!

325
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,458
He used you and Ram to--

326
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,083
- Sorry to interrupt
this debate,

327
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,000
but I have concerns as well.

328
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,583
It's natural that Garfiel
would be angry.

329
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,666
And I did technically take part

330
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,458
in the "purification ritual,"
too.

331
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,750
- "Technically" take part?
With that right hook of yours,

332
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,416
I'd say it was
a little more than that--

333
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,875
- Anyway, I want to know

334
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,500
exactly how much the margrave
intends to yield to us.

335
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,875
- I believe your concern
is when and where

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,625
I might suddenly choose
to become your enemy again.

337
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,583
Although, you needn't worry
about that scenario,

338
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,708
I can certainly assure you.

339
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,416
GARFIEL: Do you honestly
believe I'm gonna trust

340
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,333
a damn word you're sayin' to us?

341
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,250
- No, I suppose you wouldn't.

342
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,958
So instead,
I'll prove it to you

343
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,125
in a form that you
can actually see.

344
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:54,958
[energy pulsing]

345
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,250
[all gasp]

346
00:14:59,333 --> 00:14:59,958
- Looks like he has an oath

347
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,125
that's been sealed with a curse.

348
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,791
- And what does that mean?

349
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,958
BEATRICE: As is customary,
an agreement can take the form

350
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,958
of a contract,
an oath, or a covenant.

351
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,666
While a covenant applies
to all blood relatives,

352
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,708
an oath is used for binding
a particular individual.

353
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,416
- I was
soundly defeated in the battle.

354
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,208
Therefore, as per the agreement,

355
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,541
I cannot bring harm or
distress to any of you.

356
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,500
And if I were
to break this promise,

357
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,166
my soul will be
forever tarnished,

358
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,000
and my body will burn away
in the flames of hell.

359
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,166
Then I'll descend
into nothingness.

360
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,375
That is what this vow means.

361
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,583
SUBARU: Wh-Why would you ever go
along with something like that?

362
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,625
- Quite an odd thing to say,
coming from you,

363
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,000
since you were the one

364
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,000
who proposed the contest to me
in the first place.

365
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,208
That is the very reason
for this mark.

366
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,541
- And if I had been
the one who lost?

367
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,250
- It would have been
engraved on you,

368
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,583
and if you'd
broken our commitment,

369
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,333
only your ashes would remain.

370
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,291
- What?! But still...

371
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,166
this should prove that
Roswaal can't betray us now.

372
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,208
So what do you say, Garfiel?

373
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,750
- [growls]

374
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,333
- Young Gar.

375
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,208
What happened to Shima

376
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,791
was a choice
made of her own accord.

377
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,333
Regardless of Young Roz,
it was necessary

378
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,125
for one of us to act as the key

379
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,708
and to make certain
that the barrier was undone.

380
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,666
- [groans]

381
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,666
- Shima said she
never once felt lonely

382
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,625
over these past ten years,

383
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,375
because she had
you there by her side.

384
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,250
- Yeah, I know. I know.

385
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,333
Now quit lookin' like you're
about to cry, Grandma.

386
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,291
It's okay.

387
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,166
[inhales]

388
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,541
I want you to swear to me,
Roswaal,

389
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,000
no matter what happens,

390
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,708
you're never gonna do
the shit you've done again.

391
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,208
I need to hear you say it.

392
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,625
- I promise to never attempt
sacrificing anyone here

393
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,416
to achieve something else again,

394
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,750
under any circumstances
or under any influence.

395
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,791
I swear this...

396
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,375
upon the very soul
of my beloved teacher.

397
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,083
PETRA: They might forgive you,
but I can't.

398
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,500
'Cause you tried
to do something really awful

399
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,250
to the people
who live in the village!

400
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,750
They put all their trust and
faith in you, and you just--

401
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,541
Even me! I thought
you were a good person, too!

402
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,083
- Your words
cause me great pain.

403
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,166
- They should. Even so,

404
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,458
I don't want to be
thought of as the stubborn one

405
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,250
who only makes things harder
for everybody here,

406
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,041
so I'll agree to work with you,

407
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,291
but I'm never
going to forgive you,

408
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,375
not ever.

409
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,166
Not ever.

410
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,458
[sobbing]

411
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,500
- I'm very proud of you,
little one.

412
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,791
- I'm only gonna go along
with this for my sister,

413
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,625
the old hag,
and for the little girl.

414
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,666
You better remember that.

415
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,125
- Of course. Thank you.

416
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,625
- All right, anybody else

417
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,458
want to get something
off their chest?

418
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,625
- I do.

419
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,458
- Okay, Mili.
The floor's yours then.

420
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,500
Now's your chance
to say anything you want.

421
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,458
- In that case,
I'll take you up on that

422
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,791
and point out
one important thing.

423
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,458
- It's weird you all
haven't noticed this.

424
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,333
There's something
Roswaal hasn't done yet

425
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,791
that I think
is extremely necessary.

426
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,083
And as far as I'm concerned,

427
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,916
there's no way we can end
this discussion until he does.

428
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,208
- I'm not sure
where you're goin' with this.

429
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,666
- When you do something bad,

430
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,708
you should apologize
for it, right?

431
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,166
You've all been telling him
to "do this and say that"

432
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,708
to prove he honestly regrets
what he's done.

433
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,958
And while you've agreed
to each of their requests

434
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,541
and swore
on your teacher's soul,

435
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,833
isn't there something you
should add before that, Roswaal?

436
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,833
Did you say, "I'm sorry,"
even once?

437
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,875
Because if so,
I didn't hear it.

438
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,125
- You should apologize
for your actions.

439
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,416
If you plan on working
with us from this point forward,

440
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,416
I think you'd have to agree
that it's the right thing to do.

441
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,416
[Roswaal sighs]

442
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,375
I am truly sorry.

443
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,000
- [grunts]

444
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,666
That's enough for me.

00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,125
[chamber music playing]

446
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,416
[crowd murmuring]

447
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,458
SUBARU: Conferment
of knighthood?

448
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,541
They're really
going all out here, aren't they?

449
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,708
- Oh, come now.
I thought this was the moment

450
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,875
you'd spent
so much time waiting for.

451
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,208
- Sure it is,
but having these people host it

452
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,375
just seems like
a little much to me, you know?

453
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,625
- Well, the Miload family is
a branch of the Mathers
family,

454
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,500
and their leader, Annerose,

455
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,166
just happens to be
head over heels for Miss Emilia.

456
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,500
- I see. Now, what was it
you wanted to tell me?

457
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,000
- I have a goal, and that's
to reunite with my teacher.

458
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,791
- I'm not sure I understand.
She was there in the coffin,

459
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,375
wasn't she?
Haven't you already--

460
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,875
- It seems
you're a bit confused.

461
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,416
This reunion can only take place

462
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,958
when she lives and breathes,
when she houses a soul.

463
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,875
That is my desire and
dearest wish, Subaru.

464
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,583
- And is there a way to do that?

465
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,583
- I'm now
without the Tome of Wisdom,

466
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,875
and I'm bound by the mark
of the oath,

467
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,208
but having said that,

468
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,583
I've no intention
of ever giving up on her.

469
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,625
- All right,
but what good is that gonna do?

470
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,416
- It's simple, really.

471
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,125
I intend to keep my eye on you,
following your every move.

472
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,625
See, you made
the rather arrogant decision

473
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,458
that you would lose nothing and
simply pick up all the pieces.

474
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,166
By doing so,

475
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,958
you'll surely continue
to be hurt from now on.

476
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,958
You'll lose things repeatedly,

477
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,791
and each time that you
manage to get them back,

478
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,833
you'll gain
new, invisible wounds.

479
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,958
I know that if I lost anyone,

480
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,666
I wouldn't hesitate
to destroy everything.

481
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,250
I will not compromise.

482
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,583
Nothing can lead me back to
my teacher but you, understand,

483
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,458
and the path only you can take.

- She looks stunning.

00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,458
- What a lovely dress.
- Wow.

487
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,916
- So beautiful.

we'll begin the ceremony

00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,708
of the conferment of knighthood.

491
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,000
Subaru Natsuki, come forth.

492
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,541
- Congratulations, Subaru.

493
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,416
You've earned the praise
of the witch's disciple.

494
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,666
You've won a victory,

495
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,458
for today at least.

The world that will
accept and nurture you,

the vast realm into which
you will be sent forth,

the pride that has stood by you,

506
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:54,375
supported you,
protected and created you,

507
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,416
may you find a way to live
through the rest of your days

508

that will not shame
all who defend you,

Have you the will
to carry this out

513
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,708
as all things surrounding you
have done honorably,

514
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,083
to swear an oath that henceforth

515
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,916
you vow to protect
the one who stands before you?

on Father, on Mother,
I swear it.

519
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,500
I will fulfill my duty.

And by the way, you look
really sexy in that outfit.

Nothing new,
but I had to say it.

532
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,125
- Idiot.

00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,791
So this is where you've been.

538
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,958
- Oh, it's you, Mili!

539
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,458
Thought maybe an angel
had come to get me.

540
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,625
- Stop.
You're being weird again.

541
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,791
Tipsy? You have too much wine?

542
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,791
I told you before,
I don't drink.

543
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,500
I'm just feeling high on life.

544
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,166
this night, the atmosphere,
everything right now.

545
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,125
- Yep. You sound
pretty drunk to me.

546
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:51,125
So are you
getting along with Roswaal?

547
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,041
What were you two
talking about, anyway?

548
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:56,000
- [coughs]
- Eh, I knew it.

549
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:56,875
He was messing with you,
wasn't he?

550
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,833
Perceptive, Mili.

551
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:00,875
I feel like things
are gonna be even tougher

552
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:01,875
than they were before.

553
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:05,125
- Well, if you ask me,

554
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,791
I think he's just afraid

555
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,041
of forgetting
everything that he's done.

556
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:12,666
He only acts that way to try
and get everybody's attention.

557
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,750
Honestly,
he can be such a child.

558
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,125
- You really are amazing.
You know that?

559
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,583
- You think so?

560
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,250
[giggles] Well, thank you.

561
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,666
And in case
you were wondering,

562
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,083
I happen to feel
the same way about you, too.

563
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,041
You know, Subaru,

564
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,916
there's something I want to say
to my knight later,

565
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,541
maybe this evening
after all this is over.

566
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,041
- What a coincidence,
'cause there's actually

567
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,958
a lot that I was hoping
to say to you.

568
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:42,666
Oh?

569
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,833
- In that case, it's a promise.

570
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,541
- [sighs]

571
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,041
- When everything's
finished here,

572
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,666
the two of us can have a talk.

573
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,500
Should we meet in my room?

574
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,083
- Listen, Mili.
I'm a repeat offender

575
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,375
when it comes
to breaking promises,

576
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,250
but when you invite me
to your room at night,

577
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,625
just you and me,

578
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,166
I assure you that's
not an option, not one bit!

579
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,291
- Sorry, but I'm not really sure
what you mean by that.

580
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,291
- All I'm saying
is that I can't wait

581
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:15,208
to find out
what it is we'll talk about.

582
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,916
- One evening
might not be enough for this.

583
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,750
- Hey, if it's
something that important,

584
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,875
then I'll spend
as much time as it takes.

585
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:26,291
After all, I am
your official knight! Okay?

586
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,875
- O-Okay.

587
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:30,083
- [chuckles]

588
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,291
Eh?

589
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,125
Seriously,
don't worry about it.

590
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,583
Regardless
of what you tell me,

591
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,750
my feelings for you
won't change.

592
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,625
- [gasps] Subaru.

593
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,708
- What happens
in the beginning or the middle

594
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,083
isn't what really matters.

595
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,916
It's the end that counts.

596
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,250
And despite how things
actually started,

597
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,208
it's not like they're
the same now, right?

598
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,250
- But how could you
possibly know?

602
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,166
looking out over the hall
with those sweet eyes,

603
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,625
and then it became
so clear to me.

604
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,791
If bringing happiness
to other people

605
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,666
is one of the main reasons
you want to work so hard...

606
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:17,458
then let
your number one help you.

607
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:23,250
- That's okay?
You don't mind if I rely on you?

608
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,000
- Have you already forgotten

609
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,125
that promise I made to you
a few minutes ago?

610
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:30,583
I want you to depend on me
before anyone else.

611
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,166
Whatever you need,
I'll do all that I can.

612

If you ever feel lost,
I'll be right here to guide you.

619
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,333
your face
looks so sweet right now.

[Subaru chuckles]
Wonder why that is.

621
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,041
Could be that I'm just glad

622
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,708
to see all the things
that you're seeing,

623
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:00,458
and I think it's kinda nice.

624

EMILIA: Oh,
I can understand that.

625

It makes me really happy if
you
feel the same way about it.

- You know,
maybe that's not quite right.

I mean, it's okay if we
think differently sometimes.

But this night is really
something, isn't it, Mili?

630
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,291
- Yes.

631
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:27,916
In fact, to me, everything
is absolutely perfect.

632
