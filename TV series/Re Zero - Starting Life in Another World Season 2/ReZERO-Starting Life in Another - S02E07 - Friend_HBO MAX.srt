Damn it. Why the hell
are you trying to save me?

16
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,625
- Because you look so pathetic,

17
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,041
I just can't bear
the sight of you, I suppose.

18
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,708
- But why did you choose me?

19
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,375
If you really wanted
to help someone,

20
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,000
then why didn't you save them?!

21

You know
you could have done it!

22

should I have to do all that?

There isn't one reason
I can think of

00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,125
for me to leave this room

- Oh, really?

26
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,916
Then why did you
make an exception for me?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,125
Who asked you
to do that, anyway?!

Everything could be totally
ruined now because of you!

32
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,833
It'll all be rewritten,

33
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,583
and this awful present
will be set in stone forever!

34
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,083
You should have just killed me

I've no intention

- Just answer me.

52
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,250
And why are you
holding that book

53
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,583
like it's
something you care about?

54
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,166
That's not the same kind

55
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,291
the witch cultists had,
is it, Beako?

56
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,708
It only looks like one, right?

57
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,416
Say something.

58
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,791
Why aren't you
denying all of this?

59
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,375
- You can ask
as often as you like,

60
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,291
but I haven't been commanded
to answer those questions.

61
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,250
- [gasps] What sort of things
are written in that book?

62
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,750
What's it telling you to do?

63
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,416
- That question's not
in the book, either, I suppose.

64
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,375
- You can't do anything
that's not in there, is that it?

65
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,125
Which means when you gave me
cover earlier, you were--

66
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,458
- Seems that question
isn't here, either.

67
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:09,250
- Then why the hell are you
even talking to me right now?!

68
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,583
Why did you stop me from dying?!

69
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,625
- I don't know!

70
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,791
- Are you saying
you can't do anything

71
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,708
that isn't in the pages
of that book?!

72
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,750
- Yes, I suppose.

73
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,791
That's right.

74
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,833
Everything I do is in accordance

75
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,750
with the Gospel's guidance,
I suppose.

76
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,833
That is the sum
and meaning of my life.

77
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,166
That is the purpose
of my very existence!

78
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,041
- Does that mean
you tried to rescue me

79
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,291
because the book told you to?

80
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,750
And when you saved me
after I'd been cursed

81
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,208
and when you helped me when I
wasn't even able to stand up?!

82
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,458
And those times
when we goofed around,

83
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,833
yelled at each other,
and acted like--

84
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,333
- I told you!
- [gasps]

everything I've ever seen,

As if somebody like you

could have ever moved my heart
on your own, I suppose!

00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:17,666
- Yes, I do. Not that it's
necessarily a bad thing, but...

165
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,666
- Well, you're right.

166
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,125
Thanks to you,
I'm more confident these days.

167
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,625
- I appreciate that, Otto.
- Huh?

168
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:28,000
- This proves I can still
think rationally about things,

169
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,166
even after all
that's been goin' on lately.

170
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,000
- I understand
what you're trying to say,

171
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,750
but I think there's
a pretty huge difference

172
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,208
between appearing relaxed
and actually being able

173
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,916
to step back and think
about things sensibly

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,500
using reason and--

175
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,791
- This is Roswaal
we're talkin' about,

176
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,166
and I'm not gonna let him
dodge the subject this
time.

177
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,000
- Yo, got a minute?
- Hmm?

178
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,791
Garfiel?

179
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,166
You're not someone who falls
into patterns easily, are you?

180
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,416
- Huh?

181
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
- I mean,
last time this happened,

182
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,833
you would have gone straight
back if I hadn't stopped you.

183
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,916
I've got somethin' important
to do now, you know.

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,708
- Oh, yeah? You talkin' about

185
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,750
your shady scheme
with that bastard?

186
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,083
- Hey, there's
nothing shady about it!

187
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,041
So what do you want, anyway?
Is it about the Sanctuary?

188
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,583
- Well, of course it is!
What the hell else do you think

189
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,208
I'd wanna come out here
and talk to you about?!

190
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,750
- Hey, who knows?
You might want some info on Ram.

191
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,791
Though I'm pretty sure
she likes tall guys

192
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,375
who wear clown makeup and--

193
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,208
- Now cut the crap!

194
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,000
All right, that one
hurt a little, I gotta say.

195
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,000
- And on that note,
Garfiel and I

196
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,166
are gonna go chat
about our love lives.

197
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,541
- But, Mr. Natsuki, we were--

198
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,666
- Save it for tomorrow, okay?

199
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,625
You can do this, Otto.

200
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,125
- Eh, all right, fine.

201
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,083
Tomorrow, but just be ready,

202
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,958
'cause I'm gonna be counting on
you to deal with the margrave.

203
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,208
SUBARU: Hmm?

204
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,125
- Nah, this ain't the place.
Follow me.

205
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,333
- Now there's another
change
in the course of events.

206
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,875
Question for you.

207
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,875
How long's it been
since you last saw Frederica?

208
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,125
- Now, why in the hell should
I
tell you somethin' like that?

209
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,625
- Just thought it couldn't hurt
to ask, I guess.

210
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,791
- Hah! She already headed out
and left this place,

211
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,208
so she ain't my concern anymore.

212
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,708
- Whether that's true or not,

213
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,333
there's something
I don't understand.

214
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,875
I know
you're Frederica's brother,

215
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,208
which means she meets the
mixed-blood requirement, too,

216
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,958
so why isn't she here?

217
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,791
- Don't ask me.

218
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,666
The barrier won't open
unless someone passes the trial.

219
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,083
Nothing'll change that.

220
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,041
- Knowing why will give us
more options, though.

221
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,583
I'm the type who wants
to have all the information

222
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,625
before I start spending
a whole lot of time

223
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,250
rackin' my brain for answers.

224
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,750
- We're here.

225
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,458
- Huh?

226
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,666
Hold on. You're the one
who wanted to talk to me?

227
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,916
- You may interpret it
that way if you wish.

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,208
Young Gar is my attendant,
after all.

229
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,875
[wind blowing]

230
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,333
- Is this the place where you
come to relax or something?

231
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, if you're open enough
to share this with me,

232
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,833
I can only assume you'll be
sharing more secrets soon.

233
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,791
- My goodness,
what a smooth talker you are.

234
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,541
- So, anyway,
now that I've come out here,

235
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,208
are you gonna answer
my question for me?

236
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,666
- You're referring
to how Frederica left us, right?

237
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,958
What exactly do you intend to do
with this information?

238
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,833
- I'm gonna use it
to try and get

239
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,250
every single person
out of the Sanctuary,

240
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,375
and then, that way, nobody will
be forced to undergo the trial.

241
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,041
- Logically speaking,
yes, you're right,

242
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,041
but why avoid such a thing
so obstinately?

243
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,875
- Because I don't want Emilia
to have to go through it.

244
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,375
It's my own
purely selfish reason.

245
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,333
And while that may work
for the trial,

246
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,708
running away from hardships

247
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,833
is not the best way
to approach life.

248
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,041
- Look, it's not forever,
just for now.

249
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,208
At some point, Emilia will
still have to conquer her fears

250
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,958
and face her past.

251
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,333
- So, in other words,
you want to give her an escape,

252
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,000
but not from the things
that will hurt her the most?

253
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,958
- When the time comes,
she won't run away.

254
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,708
I have total faith the girl
I fell for can pull that off.

255
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,916
- [scoffs] All right!

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,833
Go on and tell him, old hag!

257
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,958
Tell him it's just like
a gadgy gwadzeadd

258
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,833
tryin' to hide away
in the mountains somewhere!

259
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,083
- I appreciate it,

260
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,791
but I definitely
have no idea what you said.

261
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,166
- What Young Gar is saying

262
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,916
is that there is
no convenient path

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,541
- by which to escape.
- Uh...

264
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,250
RYUZU: Frederica's exit
has been considered

265
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,916
something of a deviation.

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,083
She does not meet
all the conditions

267
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,708
for being held
within the barrier.

268
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,833
- I don't know
where you're going with this.

269
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,666
There's something else
besides being half?

270
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,083
RYUZU: No.
There are no exceptions.

271
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,250
Then...

272
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,666
- The barrier determines
one's mixed-blood status

273
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,375
by the amount
of each race in their blood.

274
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,375
If they possess
human and nonhuman blood

275
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,083
in equal amounts, they are
held within the barrier.

276
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,958
- However...
- If you're less than that,

277
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,250
like a quarter-blood
or something, it can't hold you?

278
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,291
That would mean...

279
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,958
We have different dads.

280
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,500
And even though I go
by the last name of Tinzel,

281
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,125
I'm pretty sure my half sister

282
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,208
uses a different surname
than mine.

283
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,333
-<i> My name is Frederica Baumann.</i>

284
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,875
- She was born to a human mother
and a mixed-blood father,

285
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,833
therefore she can enter
and leave the forest at will.

286
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,375
- Hah! "Enter and
leave at will", huh?

287
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,000
Come on. Give me a break.

288
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,125
That girl hasn't been back here
even one time in over ten years!

289
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,291
Frederica abandoned
this place and us!

290
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,250
- Young Gar.
- [scoffs]

291
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,833
- And now you know.

292
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,833
I do apologize
for making you listen so long

293
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,041
to learn so little.

294
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,000
- It's fine,
because the way I see it,

295
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,000
this is still a lot better
than being stuck here

296
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,083
with unusable options forever.

297
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,041
But I guess we still have
to pass the trial, then, huh.

298
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,958
Okay, you two, just hear me out.

299
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,375
Now I'd like to offer up
a suggestion, all right?

300
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,750
- What would that be, exactly?

301
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,250
- I'm meeting with Roswaal
and Emilia soon.

302
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,000
I hope to get them
onboard with this,

303
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,541
but it's really important,

304
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,375
so I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't tell anybody.

305
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,625
- Hmm?

306
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:11,916
- Very well, then.

307
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,250
No one will ever know of this.

308
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,166
You may now tell us
whatever you wish.

309
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,166
I want to take on the trial
and go in place of Emilia.

310
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,375
- Huh?!
- [gasps]

311
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,791
- When I ran into the graveyard
to help her,

312
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,416
I came back unharmed, right?

313
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,958
That's because I'm
qualified
to go through the trial.

314
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,875
On top of that, I've already
managed to pass one of them.

315
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,000
- You seriously
passed that thing?

316
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,125
- "This has gotten complicated."

317
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,208
That's what's you're thinking,
isn't it, Ryuzu?

318
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,500
- I cannot deny
that you took those very words

319
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,666
right out of my mouth,

320
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,166
but I now understand
your point as well.

321
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,916
Young Su, there is something
I must tell you also.

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
- Yeah, what is it?

323
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,208
- For the moment,
despite your plan,

324
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,583
I need you to keep quiet,
stay still, and behave yourself.

325
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,250
- Huh?

326

[gagging]

327
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,875
- I know you must be wondering
why this is happening,

328
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,416
but I will not ask
your forgiveness.

329
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,125
As promised, I will
tell no one what you said.

330
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:19,291
You now have my word,
on the name of Ryuzu Shima.

I'll untie you.

And just so you know, there

- You don't listen, do you?!

341
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,208
This is a part of the Sanctuary
no one knows about!

342

- [claws scrape]
- Ain't no need to save someone

when all they wanna do
is die, right?

344
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,958
- I don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about!

345
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,625
- All you guys are pretty famous

346
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,291
for being a bunch of
freakin' weirdoes, aren't you?!

347
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,041
- Wait! I seriously
don't get what--

348
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,500
- Now don't play dumb!
There's miasma oozin'

349
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,458
out of every pore
of your entire body!

350
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,666
- You're a witch cultist!
- [gags]

351
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,125
- And the smell's
been even stronger

352
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,125
since you came
out of the graveyard.

353
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,375
- [gasps]
- There ain't very many people

354
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,375
with this much miasma.

355
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,166
I would let you go if you
swore not to try anything,

356
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,625
but now you
wanna take on the trial

357
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,458
in the princess's place?

358
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,750
I don't think so.

359
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,708
- You can smell...

360
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,708
the witch's scent on me?

361
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,208
- Hah! That's a funny thing
to call it!

362
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,875
But it fits, though, don't it?

363
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,583
- "The witch's scent"!
- [yelps]

364
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,208
- What is it you wanna do
in that graveyard?!

365
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,041
I don't know
what you're plannin',

366
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,000
but it can't be anything good

367
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,000
if the witch's tomb
is a part of it.

368
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,666
- What's the point of trapping
and holding me in here, anyway?

369
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,458
- Why not just kill me instead?

370
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,500
- Hah! Let's say
it's because you have

371
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,750
this miraculous way
of winnin' people over!

372
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,791
There's no way
I'm gonna kill you

373
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,708
and then have everything
blow up in my face

374
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,041
like back
when the Tesla Fortress fell!

375
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,208
- And what are you
gonna do with me?

376
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,375
- For right now, all I'll say
is that it's up to Miss
Emilia.

No suicide, either!

As much as I hate to admit it,

I don't have a damn clue
what's in that head of yours.

383
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,666
But what pisses me off
more than anything else

384
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,750
is that damn attitude
you've got!

385
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,583
I can see the same look
in your eyes

386

as that bastard Roswaal!

387
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,166
Now don't try anything funny.

that freeing the Sanctuary
should be their first concern,

so that way,
it might be a little easier

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,416
And did Emilia
go along with that idea?

476
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,416
- She said the margrave gave her

477
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,875
some sort of declaration
and formal oath.

478
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,458
- [sighs]

479
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,500
- So Miss Emilia
desperately attempted

480
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,250
to take the trial yesterday
and then again today,

481
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,916
but it just seems
like she's getting

482
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,333
more and more discouraged

483
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,916
since each of her efforts
keep failing.

484
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,583
- Well, there's one thing that's
bothering me about all of this.

485
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,833
- What is it?
- It's just...

486
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,458
why are you
telling me about this

487
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,458
like you heard it secondhand?

488
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,500
- Oh, you actually
noticed that, huh?

489
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,750
It's honestly kinda hard
to say this, but...

490
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,708
you see, the truth is...

491
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,291
Garfiel's been keeping
a close eye on me, too,

492
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,791
so I've been
running around everywhere,

493
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,833
trying to stay away from him.

494
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,625
- Huh?

495
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,000
- I was there the last time

496
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,750
the two of you
saw each other, remember?

497
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,166
- [gasps]

498
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,875
- It's natural
that he'd suspect me.

499
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,375
In fact, he said,

500
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,666
just as long
as I didn't tell anybody

501
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,041
that you'd met with him,

502
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,583
he wouldn't do anything
to hurt me. Tempting.

503
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,291
And he showed me
what looked like

504
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,041
a glowing stone as collateral.

505
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,041
- Hang on!
You actually turned that down?!

506
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,708
[winces] Damn.

507
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,000
Let me get this straight.

508
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,541
You're saying
Garfiel's after you now?

509
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,625
- Yes. I've had to pick up
the info secondhand

510
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,166
and try
to piece it all together,

511
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,125
'cause I've been on the run
for a while.

512
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,000
Although, it's pretty funny
how long it got drawn out,

513
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,875
considering this option
was more fun.

514
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,708
- Glad you enjoyed it!
Are you completely insane?

515
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,000
Why the hell'd you do that?

516
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:04,916
- [gasps]

517
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,458
- Don't get me wrong.

518
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,041
I'm really grateful
you came to save me.

519
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,625
Frankly, until the second
I looked up and saw your face,

520
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,791
I was already starting to
believe I'd be better off dead.

521
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,750
Even so...

522
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:20,000
I still don't understand
why you decided to help me.

523
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,458
- Come on, now.
Don't you get it?

524
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:31,708
Is it really
such a strange decision for me

525
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,333
to try and help out
a friend in need?

526
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,791
- Huh? Uh...

527
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,083
- Hey, why are you
standing there

528
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,750
with that shocked look
on your face?

529
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:43,458
What is it?

530
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,333
- Well, you just brought up

531
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,416
someone I don't know
out of the blue.

532
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,875
Who exactly is your friend,
"Dineed"?

533
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,041
- How could you possibly get

534
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,833
every part
of what I said so wrong?!

535
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,208
I didn't say,
"My friend, Dineed"!

536
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,083
I said, "A friend in need"!
"A friend in need"!

537
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,041
- "A friend in need"?

538
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,750
So who is whose friend?

539
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,666
- Come on!
I'm talking about you!

540
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,208
Okay, look. I mean,
yes, I came here with you

541
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,875
'cause it served
my interests, too.

542
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,250
First there was the oil.

543
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,125
Then you saved me
from the Witch's Cult.

544
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,750
Then there was
the promise of getting me

545
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,125
an audience
with the margrave, but...

546
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,416
I'm not even counting
those favors.

547
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,125
Even if you take all that away,

548
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,791
I just think of you
as a friend, Mr. Natsuki,

549
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:27,125
although I'm not exactly fond of
the way you treat me sometimes.

550
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,583
But the way I see it,

551
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,750
that just shows
how close we are as friends.

552
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,166
- [snickers]

553
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,125
- What?

554
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,708
- [laughs]

555
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,041
F-Friends, really?!

556
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,375
Man, you're killing me!
[laughs] I can't take it!

557
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,750
Think I get it now!
After all this time,

558
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,791
- you just wanted to be friends?
- What?!

559
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:50,500
- [laughing]

560
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,583
Friends. Oh, man, damn it.

561
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,458
- [laughs] Otto, I swear!
- Ouch! Cut it out!

562
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,833
- You're killin' me!
- That hurts!

563
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:56,541
- [laughing]
- Hey!

564
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,208
What are you doing, anyway?!

565
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,750
Okay, fine!
I was stupid to even say it!

566
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,166
I don't know
what I was thinking!

567
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,250
I should have known
you'd just laugh at me!

568
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,625
- Well, how could I not laugh?

569
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,250
I mean, you aren't
the one who's crazy here.

570
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,250
I'm can't believe
how stupid I am.

571
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,833
I'm so exasperated with myself,
I have to laugh!

572
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,708
[laughing]

573
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,708
- Are you okay?

574
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:24,750
- [gasps]

575
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,958
[grunts]

576
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:27,916
Sorry about that.

577
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,083
Because you really
are my friend, Otto,

578
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,958
and I'm glad.

579
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,541
- [singing in Japanese]

580
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,791
- You came to save me,
so thank you.

581
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,708
- [singing in Japanese]

582
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,750
- We're in luck,
'cause Garfiel's

583
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,833
at the graveyard right now,

584
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:56,625
so this should
be our best chance

585
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,791
to get you out of the barrier.

586
00:25:58,875 --> 00:25:59,958
- The real question is

587
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,291
whether or not
that's even possible.

588
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:04,500
- I can assure you, there's
no need to worry about that.

589
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:05,875
I have a very reliable helper
lined up.

590
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,208
- You do?

591
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,375
[brush rustling]

592
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,958
- I was starting to wonder if
you'd arrive before I got old.

593
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:20,875
But then again, even as
an old lady, I'd still be cute.

594
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:21,958
[chuckles]

595
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,000
- [growling]
