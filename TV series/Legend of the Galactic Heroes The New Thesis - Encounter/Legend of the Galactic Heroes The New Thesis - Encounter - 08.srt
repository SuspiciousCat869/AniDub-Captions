00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,166
[NARRATOR]
Lord Oigen Castrop,

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,666
the ruler of the Castrop
Starzone in the Galactic Empire,

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,208
served as minister of finance

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,416
under Kaiser
Friedrich the Fourth.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
He held this
position for 15 years,

6
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,375
during which time he embezzled
vast amounts of riches.

7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,750
When his Lordship unexpectedly
perished in an accident,

8
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,541
the depths of his
fraudulent behavior

9
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,083
were quickly discovered.

10
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,708
The Empire's
Ministries of Finance

11
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,208
and Justice attempted to
collect the late Castrop's

12
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,291
unlawfully obtained wealth.

13
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,375
However...

14
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,541
[MARIENDORF grunts]

15
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,416
[NARRATOR] His son,
Maximillian, steadfastly refused

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,625
to comply with their demands.

17
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:51,625
And thus, the Castrop
Rebellion began.

18
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,041
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the
Empire's new fleet Admiral,

19
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,666
Reinhard von Lohengramm,

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,166
established the Fleet
Admiral's Mansion.

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,500
A compound in which he assembled

22
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:12,000
the Imperial Navy's top
up-and-coming commanders.

23
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,458
This collection
of talent received

24
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,875
an imperial order from Kaiser
Friedrich the Fourth.

25
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,166
[REINHARD]
Rear Admiral Ziegfried Kircheis.

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,375
[KIRCHEIS]
Yes.

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,708
Depart for the Castrop Starzone.

28
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,625
Put an end to this rebellion.

29
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:29,916
[KIRCHEIS]
Sir.

30
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,458
I humbly accept,
Your Excellency.

31
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,958
[WEITZ] Looking over Count
Lohengramm's appointments.

32
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,500
I can't help but notice
an element of bias.

33
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,000
[WEITZ] All of the officers he's
assembled are either commoners

34
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,708
or low-ranking nobles.

35
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,583
And this Rear Admiral Kircheis.

36
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,458
Is he really the man we want
handling the Castrop situation?

37
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,250
[WEITZ] Would the count himself
not be the wiser choice?

38
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,000
[LICHTENLADE] It was Count
Lohengramm who requested

39
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,250
the order be given to
Rear Admiral Kircheis

40
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,333
in the first place.
Is that so wrong?

41
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,083
[LICHTENLADE] Remember,
we're talking about the boy's

42
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,541
most trusted confidant here.

43
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,250
If he's successful with this
mission, then we'll reward him,

44
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,041
thus placing
him in our debt,

45
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,333
which will be to
our benefit later.

46
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,000
[LICHTENLADE]
And if it proves a disaster,

47
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,750
the responsibility
falls squarely on

48
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,166
Count Lohengramm for
recommending him.

49
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,041
[LICHTENLADE] Besides,
if his subordinate fails,

50
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,541
that golden-haired brat has
one less thing to gloat about.

51
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,000
[thump]

52
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,083
How did that upstart

53
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,250
get an imperial order over us?

54
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,166
Obviously the count
must have pulled some strings.

55
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,375
Who is this Siegfried Kircheis,

56
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,458
and what sort of man
will he prove to be?

57
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,000
It seems many
soldiers are asking

58
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,625
the exact same thing.

59
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,875
They have doubts whether
they can entrust their lives

60
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,208
to his command.

61
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,083
I'd like to know how a
man of the count's stature

62
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,416
became so close with a commoner.

63
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,916
[KEMPFF] Apparently,
the two of them have been

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,083
good friends since childhood.

65
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,416
Nepotism!

66
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,125
Looks like I was wrong
about the count all along.

67
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,208
And here I was thinking he'd
have great potential.

68
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,916
I wonder what
those other two are thinking

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,375
about all this.

70
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,583
I take it you're referring to

71
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,500
Vice Admirals Mittermeyer
and Reuenthal.

72
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,750
They've both fought alongside

73
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,375
Count Lohengramm
in past battles.

74
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,291
I assume they would
have a decent idea

75
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,375
of the Rear Admiral's character.

76
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,916
[PATRONS murmuring]

77
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,375
[MITTERMEYER]
Tell me.

78
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:59,083
How much have you heard about
this Castrop Rebellion business?

79
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,458
[REUENTHAL]
Only that it's still ongoing.

80
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,458
If he can stop it, Kircheis will
become a Vice Admiral.

81
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,416
[REUENTHAL] Which would then
make him equal in rank to us.

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,833
And as the count's favorite,
when I say equal,

83
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,583
I mean ahead.

84
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,750
[MITTERMEYER] Perhaps he
wants everybody in his Admiralty

85
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,958
and beyond to know, that
Kircheis is his right-hand man.

00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,000
[MITTERMEYER]
Think it'll work out for him?

[REUENTHAL]
Who knows?

88
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,500
But if the count thinks
this is the best way

No choice but to trust and obey.

It's only fair
that we keep ours.

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,833
I gave you the order to attack!

We outnumber the

Our allies have been ensnared.

If we fire, we'll destroy
our own forces

[MAXIMILIAN] How dare you
talk back to your master!

You're nothing but
a former commoner!

I am Lord Maximilian Castrop,
and you will show me respect!

for a retainer to give
his life for his master.

178

a master's job to sacrifice

his life for the
sake of his people.

[KIRCHEIS] Continue our
course for Planet Castrop.

Caution the men to handle
the prisoners with respect

and not to engage in looting
or other behavior that would

[BITTENFELD] He managed to quell
the rebellion in just ten days?

196
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,041
[LUTZ] No. Six days
were needed to travel to

197
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,958
the Castrop Starzone.

198
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,833
The actual battle only
lasted a mere two days.

199
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,500
Then the follow up
procedures took two more.

[EHRENBERG]
What did you say?

217
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,666
But Iserlohn was supposed to be
an impregnable stronghold.

218
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,708
[STEINHOF] Impossible!
Surely, the report is wrong!

Admiral Seeckt is dead,

and Stockhausen is now
a prisoner of the enemy.

shoulder the responsibility

for this abysmal defeat.

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,625
[MÜCKENBERGER]
Which means...

224
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,500
[LICHTENLADE] Imperial territory
must be kept completely

225
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,750
inviolable to outside invasion,
and until presently,

226
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,875
that has always been the case.

227
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,166
[LICHTENLADE] The incident
regarding the fall and capture

of Iserlohn Fortress which
troubles his Majesty's mind,

229
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,083
is entirely the result of my
shortcomings while serving

00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,291
as your Minister of State.

231
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,125
[LICHTENLADE] I am deeply
ashamed of my failure.

232
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,208
[REINHARD] The Minister's
line of thinking is off.

233
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,750
[KIRCHEIS]
How so?

234
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,708
[REINHARD] He said we aren't
supposed to give even an inch

235
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,000
of Imperial territory
to outside invaders.

236
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,583
Which insinuates the rebels have
become an outside force equal

237
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,833
to our own strength.

238
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,500
He fails to see reality
and thus utters contradictions.

Tell me, what's the name
of the man responsible

him from the Battle of Astarte.

Yang Wen-li.

[OBERSTEIN]
I can't travel anywhere now

254
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
without military
police accompaniment.

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,625
[REINHARD] You're Captain
Oberstein, if I recall?

256
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,666
What business might
you have with me?

257
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,875
[OBERSTEIN] First, I would
ask that you clear the room.

258
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,916
[REINHARD] There are
only three of us present.

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,500
[OBERSTEIN] Yes. I can, in
fact, see Vice Admiral Kircheis.

260
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,291
That is precisely why I'm asking
you to clear the room.

261
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,166
[REINHARD] Anything you have
to say to me you may say

262
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,791
in front of the Vice Admiral.
Surely this come as no surprise.

263
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,541
[OBERSTEIN]
No, it does not.

264
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,916
[REINHARD]
If you have something to tell me

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,166
that you don't want him to hear.

266
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,208
Know that I do plan to inform
him later, regardless.

267
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,125
[OBERSTEIN] Your Excellency
is free to do as he pleases.

268
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,166
That said, one is far more
likely to achieve supremacy

269
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,875
by having a variety of talented
people by their side.

270
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,416
[OBERSTEIN] You tell Person
A what A they needs to hear.

271
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,708
Give Person B
assignments suited for B.

272
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,041
So on and so forth.

273
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,875
[KIRCHEIS]
Forgive my saying so,

274
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,291
but perhaps it would be best
if I waited in the next room.

275
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,416
[REINHARD]
Very well.

276
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,083
[OBERSTEIN]
The truth, Your Excellency,

277
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,666
is that I find myself
in something of

278
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,875
a difficult position
at the moment.

279
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,125
I believe you are aware of this.

280
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,333
[REINHARD] You're the
deserter from Iserlohn.

281
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,541
It's only natural
you'd be condemned.

282
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,500
Especially when
Admiral Seeckt perished

283
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,666
heroically during battle.

284
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,833
[OBERSTEIN] I'm sure to a myriad
of commanding officers,

285
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:35,000
I appear as nothing more
than a deserter and a coward.

286
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,000
Nevertheless, I do have
my own side of the story.

287
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,791
I would like you to hear
my version of events.

288
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,458
[REINHARD]
This is absurd.

289
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,958
If you insist on defending
yourself, then do so

290
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,875
at tomorrow's court martial,
not here to me.

291
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,541
[OBERSTEIN] The trial is
theatrics and nothing more.

292
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,500
Both my guilt and the
requisite punishment

293
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,500
have already been decided.

294
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,166
[OBERSTEIN] Please look
at this, your Excellency.

295
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,791
[OBERSTEIN] As the
Vice Admiral has no doubt

296
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,750
already informed you.

297
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,250
Both my eyes are
artificial implants.

298
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,791
[OBERSTEIN] If I was born during
the reign of Emperor Rudolf,

299
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,958
I would have been executed
as an infant under

300
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,666
the Inferior Genes
Exclusion Act.

301
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,041
[OBERSTEIN]
I hope I'm being clear.

302
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,166
I despise every one of them.

303
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,000
Emperor Rudolf,
his descendants,

304
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,375
and everything they've
brought into being.

305
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,916
[OBERSTEIN] I despise the
Goldenbaum Dynasty itself.

306
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,291
[REINHARD]
That's a daring statement.

307
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,666
[OBERSTEIN] The Empire, by which
I mean the Goldenbaum Dynasty,

308
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,250
should be destroyed.

309
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,333
If it were possible,
I'd have already strangled it

310
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,208
with my own hands.

311
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,875
[OBERSTEIN] However. I lack
the acumen and power to do so.

312
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,083
What I am able to provide is
assistance in the establishment

313
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,583
of a new supreme ruler.
Which has brought me here.

314
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,208
[OBERSTEIN]
I'm referring to you,

315
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,416
Fleet Admiral Count
Reinhard von Lohengramm.

316
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,708
[REINHARD]
Kircheis.

317
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,041
[REINHARD] Hand the captain
over to the military police!

318
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,958
He has made treasonous
statements towards the Empire.

319
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,083
As an imperial officer,
I cannot overlook this.

320
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,833
[OBERSTEIN] In the end
I guess that's all there is to you.

321
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,500
Very well. Depend
on Vice Admiral Kircheis

322
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,208
as your only trusted advisor
and continue to walk down

323
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,750
your narrow path.

324
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,000
[OBERSTEIN]
I wonder, Vice Admiral.

325
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,666
Could you shoot me?

326
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,208
As you can see,
I'm completely unarmed.

327
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,583
Could you still do it?

328
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,875
[OBERSTEIN] You can't.
That's the kind of man you are.

329
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,125
[OBERSTEIN] While it's clear
you're deserving of respect,

330
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,500
that quality by itself isn't
enough to achieve

331
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:51,625
true dominance. There is
a shadow for every light.

332
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,041
[OBERSTEIN] But, perhaps
the young Count Lohengramm

333
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,666
doesn't understand
that reality yet.

334
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,916
[REINHARD] You're a man
who says whatever he pleases.

335
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,458
[OBERSTEIN]
Forgive me.

336
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,291
[REINHARD] Which no doubt
meant Seeckt detested you.

337
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,833
Am I wrong?

338
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,833
[OBERSTEIN] The late Admiral was
not exactly the sort of man

339
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:16,000
who inspired loyalty in his
subordinates, Your Excellency.

340
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,250
[LICHTENLADE] Military Chief
of Staff Ehrenberg,

341
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,791
Chief of Headquarters Steinhof,

342
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,083
and Space Fleet Commander
Mückenberger.

343
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,291
[LICHTENLADE] These three
chiefs of staff have submitted

344
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,291
their resignations,
as an act of penitence

345
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,875
for the loss of Iserlohn.

346
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,750
[FRIEDRICH]
Which position would you like?

347
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,958
[REINHARD] This commendation
is not based on achievement.

348
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,708
I haven't earned their titles
and so must decline.

349
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,625
[LICHTENLADE sighs]

350
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,875
[REINHARD] The loss of Iserlohn
was the result of errors

351
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:57,041
made by Admirals Seeckt
and Stockhausen.

352
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,500
[REINHARD]
In addition.

353
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,083
Admiral Seeckt atoned for
his oversight through death.

354
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,541
And the one who surrendered
is imprisoned by the enemy.

355
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,125
[REINHARD] I believe justice
has been administered.

356
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,333
No one else deserves blame.

357
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,666
Therefore, Your Majesty,
I humbly request,

358
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,791
that you do not find fault
with the three chiefs of staff.

359
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,333
[EHRENBERG] Never in a thousand
years would I have guessed

360
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,708
I'd be indebted to that child.

361
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,041
[STEINHOF]
From what I understand,

362
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,666
he requested immunity for
Captain Oberstein along

363
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,041
with his transfer to
the Fleet Admiral's

364
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,666
Mansion. [MÜCKENBERGER] It's out
of the question to accept

365
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,458
his Imperial Majesty's generous
favor while allowing

366
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,291
the one survivor under
Seeckt's atrocious command

367
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,750
to be severely punished.

368
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,958
[EHRENBERG] Bottom line
is he voluntarily gave up

369
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,541
a high ranking position.

370
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,916
That's a surprisingly
selfless act.

371
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,041
[MÜCKENBERGER]
Hmm...

372
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,541
[LICHTENLADE]
Your Imperial Majesty.

373
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,125
[FRIEDRICH]
What is it?

374
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,083
[LICHTENLADE] I know what I'm
about to say will displease you,

375
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,291
but I would be
remiss to stay silent.

376
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,291
[FRIEDRICH]
Is this about Lohengramm?

377
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,916
Perhaps you feel the
need to tell me I've given

378
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,208
too much prestige and
power to Annerose's brother.

379
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,916
[LICHTENLADE] Your Majesty seems
well aware of my reservations.

380
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,041
[FRIEDRICH]
Since the man is fearless,

381
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,375
he won't be satisfied as
a mere senior statesman.

382
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,875
He might even get overly
ambitious and plot

383
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,500
to usurp my position.

384
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,125
Am I wrong?

385
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,041
[LICHTENLADE] I was hesitant to
put such thoughts into words,

386
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,333
but that is indeed what I fear.

387
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,708
[FRIEDRICH]
I see no problem with that.

388
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,041
[LICHTENLADE]
Sir?

389
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,833
[FRIEDRICH] The Goldenbaum
Dynasty has not existed

390
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,708
alongside humanity
since the beginning.

391
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:38,666
Just as no man is immortal,
no country is eternal either.

392
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,750
[FRIEDRICH] There's no
reason the Galactic Empire

393
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,041
mustn't end during
my generation.

394
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,666
[LICHTENLADE gasps]

395
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,958
[FRIEDRICH]
If it's going to fall anyway,

396
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:53,000
then the least I can hope is for
its end to be a magnificent one.

397
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,458
[REINHARD] You look like you
want to say something.

398
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,875
[KIRCHEIS] Are you going
to pretend you don't know

399
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:04,875
what it is?

400
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,708
[REINHARD]
Don't be upset with me.

401
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,250
It's about Oberstein, right?
You suspect him.

402
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,625
You're worried he's a pawn
of some noble family.

403
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,000
I had my initial doubts, too.

404
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,750
[REINHARD]
No. He isn't the sort of man

405
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,833
the aristocrats can handle.

406
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:22,125
He's got a sharp mind,
but too many peculiarities.

407
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,541
[KIRCHEIS] And you feel that you
can handle him, Lord Reinhard?

408
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,208
[REINHARD]
A good question.

409
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,583
[REINHARD]
What I do know are the qualities

410
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,166
I don't expect from him.

411
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,083
Such as friendship or
any sense of true loyalty.

412
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,166
He's obviously using me
to achieve his own goals.

413
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,041
[REINHARD] So. I'll
use that intellect of his

414
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,875
to my advantage.

415
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,333
[REINHARD] His motives
are unimportant to me.

416
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,666
If I can't control one man,
how could I ever be worthy

417
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,083
of ruling over the
entire universe?

418
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,708
[REINHARD]
That's enough for today.

419
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:05,916
Leave me.

420
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,291
[KIRCHEIS]
Sir.

421
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,750
[REINHARD]
Oberstein will be useful.

422
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,166
He won't hesitate to take
any means necessary.

423
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,000
[REINHARD]
For better or for worse.
