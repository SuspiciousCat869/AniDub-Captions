[JULIAN]
Commodore Yang! It's morning!

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,666
If you don't wake up soon,
you'll be late!

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,208
[YANG groans] Who's going to
be late for what now?

4
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,000
[JULIAN]
I said rise and shine!

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,250
[YANG groans]

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,791
[JULIAN] What a way
to start your morning.

7
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,750
If I didn't wake you, you
probably would have missed

8
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,291
the memorial service.

9
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,791
You're right. Thanks, Julian.

10
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,875
[JULIAN groans]

11
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,625
[YANG] By the way, where did
you put those books from the box

12
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,125
I hadn't unpacked yet?

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,000
[JULIAN]
On the shelf, where they belong.

14
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,958
[YANG] And the Wanli porcelain
from the box next to it?

15
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,291
[JULIAN] I set it inside
the hutch for display.

16
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:53,875
[JULIAN]
See you tonight.

17
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,916
Listen. Julian.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,500
Yes?

19
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,875
Sorry for making you do so much.

20
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,250
I'll try to act more like a real
guardian when I get back.

21
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,375
See ya.

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,333
[gasps]

23
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,125
[YANG yawns]

24
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,208
[ALEX] Doesn't look like
you're quite awake yet.

25
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,666
Late night, Hero of Astarte?

26
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,125
And who would that be?

27
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,500
The person standing
right in front of me, of course.

28
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,125
That's what the press
has been calling you,

29
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,250
at least--no sense fighting it.

30
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,416
Not to dampen the mood,
but... we didn't win.

31
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,291
That's true,
the Alliance Navy did lose.

32
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,375
And that's exactly the reason
why we need a hero now.

33
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,625
We wouldn't have
any need for one

34
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,875
if we were on the winning side.

35
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,791
After a defeat, you have
to take the people's focus away

36
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,458
from what's going on.

37
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,208
It was probably the same
for El Facil, am I right?

38
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,250
By the way, why is your
uniform completely drenched?

39
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,666
Well... [chuckles]

40
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:47,875
[applause]

41
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,041
Brave citizens and soldiers.

42
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,833
I ask you, for what purpose
have we all assembled

43
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,583
here in this auditorium today?

44
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,583
To commemorate the lives of the
one and a half million heroes

45
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,708
who perished in the
battle of Astarte.

46
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,958
Those who nobly
laid down their lives.

47
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,833
Who defended the freedom
and peace of our homeland.

48
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,416
But also...

49
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,875
...to remind us.

50
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,958
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
the departed have a message

51
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,000
for those left behind.

52
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,458
There was something at stake
more valuable than their lives.

53
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,083
What is that something?

54
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,791
The preservation of our
homeland and our freedom!

55
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,791
Why did 1.5 million
soldiers die?

56
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,541
Because their leaders
failed to command them

57
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,416
effectively enough.

58
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,291
[TRUNICHT] Because our way
of life comes at a cost!

59
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,541
It demands sacrifice!

60
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,000
I would like to
make this abundantly clear.

61
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,958
Our freedom, our homeland,
more than anything else,

62
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,000
these are worthy of defending
with our very lives!

63
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,791
And pacifists
advocating for reconciliation

64
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,375
with the Empire--

65
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,833
Awaken from your delusions!

66
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:59,250
Peace is hard-earned,
not attained with ease!

67
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,875
[YANG]
I don't know.

68
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,750
Warmongering from behind a nice,
safe lectern looks pretty easy.

69
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,791
Those who oppose this
righteous war are in support

70
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,583
of the Galactic Empire's
autocratic totalitarianism!

71
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,041
They have forsaken our
founding principles!

72
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,375
I say do not
forget our grand history!

73
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,625
Our proud republic with
its illustrious legacy!

74
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,291
Our homeland and its freedoms!

75
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,791
I implore everyone to
stand with me in united defense,

76
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,958
of the one thing in life
truly worth defending!

77
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,916
Let us fight now,
for the homeland!

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,500
Long live the Alliance!

79
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,666
Long live the Republic!
Death to the Empire!

80
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,666
[CROWD]
Long live the Alliance!

81

Long live the Republic!

Get up. Why aren't you standing?

86
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,875
I'm just honoring
the theme of his speech.

87
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,500
This land is built upon freedom,

88
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,833
which means I that can
choose not to stand.

89
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,833
I am merely exercising
those liberties, Captain.

90
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,291
Then why is it
you're choosing not to stand?

91
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,041
I'm free to not
answer that question.

92
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,958
What, are you trying
to make the Navy look bad?

[TRUNICHT]

94
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,833
[CHRISTIAN]
Hmph.

95
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,916
Now, then.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,333
It is important
that we remember,

97
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,125
the greatest weapon
in our arsenal is unity.

98
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,666
[TRUNICHT] So long as
we live in a free country,

99
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,833
governed as a
democratic republic.

100

noble it may appear,

can be forced upon the people.

102
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,375
Chairman Trunicht, excuse me.

103
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,500
My name is Jessica Edwards.

104
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,833
Jessica?

105
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,750
[JESSICA]
I have something to say.

106
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,750
I'm the fiancée of
Jean Robert Lapp,

107
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,666
of the Sixth Fleet
who died in Astarte.

108

Correction. I was his fiancée.

109
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,750
[gasps] Well, that's
extremely regrettable.

110
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,708
A shame, truly.

111
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:25,458
I'm not here to
demand your condolences.

112
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,541
My Jean. He died a noble death.

113
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,833
He gave his life in defense of
the homeland that he loved.

114
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,708
Yes, of course.

115
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,875
Miss, you are a role model that
all women on the home front

116
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,750
should strive to emulate.

117
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,791
I have no doubt a brave
and generous spirit like yours

118
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,125
will be richly rewarded.

119
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,125
That's kind of you to say.

120
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,541
However, Chairman,

121
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,583
I did not come here today
to be commended,

122
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,208
but to ask a single question.

123
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:57,416
Yes? And what
question might that be, miss?

124
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,708
Where are you at this moment?

125
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,875
Um. Where am I?

126
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,166
My fiancée went
willingly to the battlefield

127
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,750
to protect everything
you claim to hold dear.

128
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,041
Because of that, he will
never come home to me.

129
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,166
Again, Chairman. Where are you?

130
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,125
Where do you stand
as you glorify death?

131
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,958
I gave you Jean!
That was my sacrifice!

132
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,833
You preach the
need for such sacrifices,

133
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,208
but where is your family?

134

There's no fault
in your speech,

00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,500
and I won't deny a single word.

But are you living by
the same standard?

was really horrible.

163
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,625
[YANG]
How so?

164
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,250
Most of the bereaved
families are enduring

165
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,083
their grief in silence,
but I had to make a big scene,

166
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:43,333
shout about what I was feeling.
I'm sure you're disgusted.

167
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,416
No. I'm not at all

168
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,708
[JESSICA] I heard about
everything you did

169
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,500
at Astarte, Yang.

170
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,750
Jean Robert was always so
impressed by your achievements.

171
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,291
"Yang's the pride of
the class" he'd say.

172
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,208
Outside of yourself,
the entire admiralty should be

173
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,083
ashamed of their incompetence.

174
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:05,250
Over 1,000,000 people died in
a single battle because of them.

175
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,083
It's a complete
ethical disgrace.

176
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,666
[YANG] I don't know if
I agree with you there.

177
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,708
[JESSICA]
Hmm?

178
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,375
The admirals
may have been foolish

179
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,750
by allowing that
many people to die.

180
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,458
But then, what if we'd been on
the winning side and killed over

181
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,625
a million of their soldiers?

182
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:25,041
Should we be praised
for taking that many lives?

183
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,291
[JESSICA gasps]

184
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,208
Whether you win or you lose,

185
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,416
there's no place
for ethics in war.

186
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,458
I'm glad to see you
haven't changed one bit.

187
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:39,333
Sorry. I didn't mean
to be argumentative.

188
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,333
I should be going,
but thank you

189
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,208
for keeping me company, Yang.

190
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,583
You take care.

191
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,583
Keep on climbing the ranks.

192
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,375
For Jean Robert, too.

193
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,833
[YANG]
Hmph.

194
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,750
[JULIAN]
Welcome home, Commodore.

195
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,458
Sorry to keep you waiting

196
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,833
[JULIAN] I was worried you
wouldn't be coming home tonight.

197
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,250
I'm glad you made it
back in time for dinner.

198
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,166
Afterall, I cooked up that
Irish stew you always enjoy.

199
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,916
Well, in that case,
I'm glad I showed up

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,166
with an appetite.

201
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,041
But what made you think
I wasn't coming home?

202
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,666
I heard you
ducked out of the ceremony

203
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,000
with a beautiful woman.

204
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,333
[gasps]

205
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,041
Well, at least that's
what Rear Admiral Caselnes

206
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,041
told me when he called
the house earlier.

207
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,625
[YANG sighs]
What a classy guy.

208
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,125
[YANG]
Your future?

209
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,916
You haven't even
finished school yet.

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,958
No, but there's a system
that allows students

211
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,625
to earn extra credits
and graduate early.

212
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,125
[YANG]
Hmm. I see.

213
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,125
So, are you planning on
becoming a soldier, then?

214
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,166
Yes. I am a
soldier's son after all.

215
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,041
There isn't any law
that says a child has

216
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,833
to inherit their
parent's career.

217
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,458
My father was an interstellar
trader and look at me now.

218
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,541
[JULIAN] The military's
paying for my upbringing.

219
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,125
If I don't enlist, those loans
will need to be paid back.

220
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,708
I'll pay for it.

221
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,083
[gasps]

222
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,416
You really shouldn't
underestimate

223
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,833
your legal guardian.

224
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,875
I've been putting
money aside for it.

225
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,125
And besides, why are you
so eager to graduate

226
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,666
ahead of schedule anyway?

227
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,791
How about you try having
a little fun instead?

228
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,041
There's no way
I could leave you with

229
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,458
that kind of burden!

230
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,375
Hey, you're still a kid
so don't talk back to me.

231
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,958
Haven't you heard?

232
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,125
Children are supposed to leech
off adults while they grow up.

233
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,083
Thank you very much, sir.

234
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,333
But still...

[beeping]

00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,166

They're the

00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,916
[YANG] Huh. I don't know any
circus troupe by that name.

241
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,208
[JULIAN] It's a radical
nationalist group.

242
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,291
They've become notorious
for harassing anyone

243
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:52,500
who criticizes the Republic.
Or opposes the war.

244
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:56,333
What I don't get, is what they
could be doing at our house.

We of the Patriotic
Knight Corps condemn you!

249
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,125
Drunk off arrogance
from your exploits,

250
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,416
you have disturbed
the unity of our navy

251
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,250
and compromised
its will to fight.

252
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,166
You know what you have done.

253
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,166
[VOICE]
You chose to disgrace

254
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,208
a sacred memorial service!

255
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,458
While everyone else in
attendance responded to

256
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,208
the Chairman's speech by
standing and swearing

257
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,708
to defeat the Empire.

258
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,291
You refused!

259
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,500
By remaining seated, you
assumed an attitude of ridicule

260
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,500
not only towards
the citizens present

261
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,250
but the entire republic!

262
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,750
If you have
anything to say

263
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,916
or choose to
refute these charges,

264
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,916
step outside and face us like
the soldier you claim to be!

265
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,541
Please tell me
what they're accusing you

266
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,666
of isn't true.

267
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,041
Well, kinda?

268
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,625
Why didn't you stand?

269
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,541
Even if you didn't agree with
what the Chairman was saying,

270
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,375
what harm would it have
done to get up and clap

271

with everybody else?

272
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,791
Then nobody would
have had to know

00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,666
what you were really thinking.

274

You sound more like
Rear Admiral Caselnes

than I'm comfortable with.

276

There's no reason to bring
the Rear Admiral into this!

00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,791
so you'd better get going.

320
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,000
I'll see you there later. 'Bye.

321
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,041
I'll probably be out
late, so don't wait up for me.

322
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,000
[JULIAN]
Yes, Commodore.

323
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,458
[YANG] I think we'll eventually
be able to laugh about

324
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,291
what happened here
tonight, but for now,

325
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,250
I have a feeling things
will be getting worse

326
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,750
before they get better.

327
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,458
It may be gradual,

328
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,916
but I'm afraid we're in
for some dark times ahead.

329
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,166
I understand.

330
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,583
And, sir, whatever I've
said, please never doubt

331
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,125
my trust in you.

332
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,625
I wouldn't ever want you to
start second guessing yourself.

333
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,583
Above all else,
I want you to walk the path

334
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,833
that you believe is right.

335
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,958
If there's anybody
who knows what's best,

336
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,833
well, that'd be you!

337
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,916
[YANG sighs]

338
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,458
[SITHOLE] I see you haven't
gotten any better at chess.

339
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,333
Sir, did you truly call me
out at this hour to assess

340
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,125
whether my chess skills
had improved recently?

341
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,750
Of course not.

342
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,625
You're here because I needed
to inform you of something.

343
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,125
The letter of
appointment won't formally

344
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,000
be issued until tomorrow,
but to cut to the chase,

345
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,125
I wanted to tell you that you're
being promoted to Rear Admiral.

346
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,375
This decision
is firm, not tentative.

347
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,125
You know why you're being
promoted, don't you?

348
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,958
Because I lost
at Astarte, right?

349
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,708
You really haven't
changed since the academy.

350
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,000
A sharp tongue that's concealed
behind a benign expression.

351
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,875
It was your signature even
back when you were a cadet.

352
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,041
That aside, my guess was
correct, wasn't it, Headmaster?

353
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,416
Chief. Uh, sorry about that.

354
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,583
[SITHOLE] And what led
you to that conclusion?

355
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,125
[YANG] There's ancient military
texts that say showering

356
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,583
someone with rewards is
proof you're in dire straits.

357
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,500
Apparently out of
the need to divert

358
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,375
people's attention from defeat.

359
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll admit that
in a sense, you are correct.

360
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,916
We have just suffered our
greatest loss in recent history.

361
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,250
Both our servicemen and our
citizens are badly shaken up.

362
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,291
The easiest way
to soothe their fears right now

363
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,166
is to give them a hero.

364
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,166
That hero would be you,
Rear Admiral Yang.

365
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,500
[YANG]
Hmph.

366
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,208
[SITHOLE] I suppose
you aren't keen on the idea

367
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,041
of becoming an artificial hero.

368
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,791
Why don't we change
the subject, then?

369
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,208
Before the start of combat in
Astarte you submitted

370
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,208
a battle-plan of yours
to Vice Admiral Paetta.

371
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,958
Do you believe we would
have won if that proposal

372
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,375
had been implemented
as you suggested?

373
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,250
Yes. I do.

374
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,250
Would it not be
possible to use this strategy

375
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,458
of yours against the Imperials
on another occasion?

376
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,000
And whenever that time comes,

377
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:54,000
perhaps we could have our
revenge on Count Lowengromm.

378
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,541
[YANG] If this victory
has made him arrogant,

379
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,500
and he can't resist the
temptation of taking on

380
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,666
a massive force with
a smaller one again,

381
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,750
I'd say the plan
could be revived.

382
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,625
However...

383
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,958
Go on.

384
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,625
[YANG]
Quite frankly, sir,

385
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,166
I don't think it's
likely to happen.

386
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,791
[YANG] While defeating a larger
force with a smaller one

387
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,041
certainly looks spectacular.

388
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,416
It strays from
common tactical practice.

389
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,083
It's really more
sleight of hand than

390
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,375
it is sound military strategy.

391
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,791
I'd find it hard to
believe that Count Lohengromm

392
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,375
doesn't know that.

393
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,833
He'll most likely attack with an
overwhelmingly large force next.

394
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,666
That's true,
you're probably right.

395
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,208
There was one more thing,

396
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,083
and this is a tentative
decision, not a firm one.

397
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,625
There will be some
changes happening to

398
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,333
the Alliance Navy's formation.

399
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,583
After much deliberation,

400
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,500
it's been decided
to reinforce the remnants

401
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,208
of the Fourth and Sixth Fleets,
with additional recruits

402
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,875
and then combine them to
create the Thirteenth Fleet.

403
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,250
You will most likely be
appointed as the first commander

404
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,833
of this new force.

405
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,541
I didn't think command of
a fleet was given to anyone

406
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,041
not ranked vice
admiral or higher, sir.

407
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,375
This new fleet will be
approximately half the size of

408
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,458
a normal one.

409
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,875
You should also know that the
first mission the Thirteenth

410
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,666
will be tasked with
is the capture of

411
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,375
the Imperials'
Iserlohn Fortress.

412
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,000
[YANG scoffs] You're telling me,
you mean to take Iserlohn

413
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,250
with only half a fleet?

414
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,500
[SITHOLE]
Correct.

415
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,125
I'm sorry,
but have you been listening

416
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,916
to anything I've said tonight?

417
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,166
Every word.

418
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,833
And honestly, it's only
convinced me further.

419
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,625
Then you actually
believe it's possible.

420
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,750
[SITHOLE] What I believe,
Rear Admiral Yang,

421
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,833
is that if you can't do it,
there is no one who can.

422
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,208
[SITHOLE]
Do you think you can do it?

423
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,750
[SITHOLE] If you were
to successfully lead this

424
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,500
new fleet in the capture
of Iserlohn Fortress,

425
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,666
it might solve some
problems for you.

426
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,000
Complete a mission like this,

427
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,375
and Chairman Trunicht
will have no choice.

428
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,750
He will be forced to recognize
your talents in the field

429
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,791
regardless of whatever
his personal feelings

430
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,875
are toward you.

431
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:00,833
[sighs]
I'll give it my best shot.

432
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,583
[ALEX] The chief has about
70 days left in his term.

433
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,916
Obviously, he's hoping
to win a second.

434
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,916
Which doesn't leave
you much time to capture

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,583
Iserlohn Fortress before
the election happens.

436
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,000
If the Thirteenth's
mission is successful,

437
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,208
then it means the
Chief's standing

438
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,750
with Chairman Trunicht
will be reinforced.

439
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,750
The man is cunning,
I'll give him that.

440
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,541
[ALEX] Come on, the chief
is practically a saint

441
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,041
compared to that bastard.

442
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,791
Speaking of which,
the Patriotic Knight Corps.

443
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,166
Their leader is...

444
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,833
None other than the
Chairman himself, am I right?

445
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,875
That much was apparent.

446
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,083
Heh.

447
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,833
[YANG groans]

448
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,333
Things're getting busy.

449
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,916
You'd better rest up.

450
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,541
Honestly. Why would anyone in
their right mind be a soldier?

451
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,666
You can complain
as much as you want,

452
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,125
but the navy will
never let go of you.

453
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,791
Be ready, Yang Wen-li.

454
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,458
Thank you for the lift, sir.

455
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,750
I guess I'm not going
to get to drink any of the tea

456
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,791
Julian makes for a while.
