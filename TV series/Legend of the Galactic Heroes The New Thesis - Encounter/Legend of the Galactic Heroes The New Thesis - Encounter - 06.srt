1
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,833
[ALEX]
You want 40 Imperial uniforms

2
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,875
and one of their cruisers?

3
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,458
Yeah.

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,208
Surely the Alliance has captured
ships laying around somewhere.

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,291
As for the uniforms,
find them however you can?

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,000
Sounds so easy.

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,458
I realize it's to prevent
intelligence leaks,

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,666
but you're making a lot of
demands without telling me

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,791
the first thing about this plan.

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,125
Tell you what. I'll treat
you to a glass of cognac after.

11
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:38,583
Not good enough.
I want no less than three.

12
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,291
[YANG sighs]
Consider it done.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,916
[YANG]
By the way,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,333
I've got one more
request I'd like to make.

15
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,750
[ALEX]
Name it.

16
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,875
Given what's happened
with the Patriotic Knight Corps,

17
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,833
I'm concerned about
leaving Julian by himself.

18
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,916
Would it be possible to
dispatch the MP to the area?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,458
That's the easiest thing
you've asked for today.

20
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,583
But have you considered
the possibility of leaving him

21
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,250
with somebody else?

22
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,000
[YANG] Hm. Oh, sure.
I considered it

23
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,958
for a brief moment.

24
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,875
I'll have to refuse.

25
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,416
This house would fall
into ruin without me!

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,458
I can see it now:
dust accumulating

27
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,291
to the point it's unlivable.

28
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,458
I'll be the house's
commanding officer

29
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,291
until you return
from your mission.

30
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,583
You can count on me!
I'll protect our home!

31
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,958
[YANG] I mean,
what could I say to that?

32
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:29,250
[ALEX]
That's one dependable kid!

33
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,208
It's handled.
We'll make sure he's safe.

34
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,500
[YANG]
I appreciate it.

35
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:38,208
Sure. Now then,
let's get to the topic at hand.

36
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:42,208
[YANG] The 13th Fleet
Personnel Distribution Plan.

37
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,875
[NARRATOR] Shortly thereafter,
the officers hand-picked by

38
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,000
Admirals Yang and Caselnes came
together under the banner

39
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,041
of the Thirteenth Fleet.

40
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,666
As vice commander,
they chose seasoned veteran

41
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,958
Commodore Fischer,
who fought bravely in

42
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,041
the Battle of Astarte.

43
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,833
For chief officer,
they selected the meticulous

44
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:36,166
and orderly Commodore Murai.

45
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,083
Captain Patrichev, better
known among his peers as

46
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:43,291
"The Fighter," was chosen
for deputy chief officer.

47
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,791
I humbly accept the position,

48
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,250
but may I ask why you chose me?

49
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,541
Your skillful fleet
management was a great asset

50
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,458
to us during the
Battle of Astarte.

51
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,000
Here's the situation.

52
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,333
The Thirteenth will be comprised
of survivors from the Fourth

53
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,583
and Sixth Fleets as
well as new recruits.

54
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,791
As you can see,
it will necessitate

55
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,125
highly elaborate coordination.

56
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,750
I understand.

57
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,500
Quite an undertaking.

58
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:12,000
[YANG]
Hm. It's good to see you again.

59
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,541
I'm glad you're
doing well, Rear Admiral.

60
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,333
That's up for debate.

61
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:20,375
Sadly, I haven't improved at
three-dimensional chess.

62
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,458
And we met on Econia.

63
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,791
I admit, I wouldn't have
expected you to appoint me

64
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,500
to this position.

65
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,000
Is it that surprising?

66
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,458
I've been waiting for an
opportunity to call on you.

67
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,250
He's become a fan of yours,

68
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,833
after you handled the
situation on Econia.

69
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,166
If I'm tasked with
commanding a fleet,

70
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,916
I need someone with
an attention to detail.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,041
I humbly request
your assistance.

72
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,750
You shall have it.

73
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,375
[ALEX] By the way, on the matter
of the adjutant position.

74
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,833
[YANG]
I take it you found someone?

75
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,333
[ALEX]
I did.

76
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,916
Graduated from cadet school
second-in-class out of 794.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,958
A far superior student to you.

78
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,916
They're assigned
to the Integrated Tactical

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,708
Operations Center,
with a reputation

80
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,375
for an extraordinary memory.

81
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,666
Things are busy
over there right now.

82
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,333
I'll arrange a meeting later.

83
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,500
[knocking]

84
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,541
[YANG sighs]
What to do...?

85
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,666
Sub-Lieutenant
Frederica Greenhill.

86
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,291
I've been assigned
to serve as adjutant

87
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,000
to Rear Admiral Yang Wen-li.

88
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,791
It's nice to meet you.

89
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,875
Rear Admiral
Caselnes ordered me

90
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,708
to report here.

91
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,875
Well, this is unexpected.

92
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,250
Sir? Unexpected, how?

93
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,833
It's nothing important.

94
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,541
I'm sorry, did you say that
your name was Greenhill?

95
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,750
Yes, my father is
Admiral Dwight Greenhill, sir.

96
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,375
Oh, yeah, you certainly
are far superior to me.

97
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,250
No, not at all.

98
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,625
I am young and inexperienced
so I hope to rely on

99
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,041
and mature through
your guidance.

100
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,458
I'm glad to have you here,
Sub-Lieutenant.

101
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,416
Did you happen to look
over my strategy outline?

102
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,666
I'd like to hear
your honest opinion.

103
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,416
It's going to work.

104
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,041
[YANG] Hm. I see. And what
makes you so confident?

105
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,333
El Facil.

106
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,125
It has been eight
years since you

107
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,583
successfully
evacuated the planet.

108
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,708
Don't you think
that's awfully flimsy grounds

109
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,583
for such conviction in me?

110
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,583
Perhaps, but it's
more than enough for me.

111
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,333
That single event planted
absolute trust in the heart

112
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,666
of one little girl,
and it never left.

113
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,958
[FREDERICA] I was at
that airport on El Facil

114
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,416
along with my mother.

115
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,041
[FREDERICA] I'm sure you've long
since forgotten me.

116
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,458
You were choking on a sandwich,

117
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,708
and I brought you
a cup of coffee to drink.

118
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,791
Your reply was memorable.

119
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,375
[YANG]
What did I say?

120
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,291
Well, Admiral,
you said "Good timing.

121
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,916
I mean, I prefer tea to coffee,
but I do appreciate it."

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,625
I can't believe I said
such a rude thing to you.

123
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,166
You did. Those exact words.

124
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,208
That's impressive.

125
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,875
I'm sorry, but
concerning that memory,

126
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,083
I feel there must be
more beneficial uses.

127
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,333
Wouldn't you agree?

128
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,458
[FREDERICA giggles]

129
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,583
Yes, thank you, sir.

130
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,541
You heard how
they're adding new soldiers

131
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,125
to the survivors from
Fourth and Sixth?

132
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,125
[SOLDIER 6B]
This Yang Wen-li is

133
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,541
an inexperienced
twenty-something.

134
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,375
They really expect someone that
green to bring down Iserlohn?

135
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,666
What was going through
the Chief's mind when

136
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,833
he made that dumb decision?

137
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,250
He's a retired soldier that left

138
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,250
the battlefield years ago.

139
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,708
Looks like dementia's
catching up with him.

140
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,125
[SOLDIERS laugh]

141
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,041
[BEWCOCK] I sincerely hope
you gentlemen don't end up

142
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,666
with egg on your face.

143
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,541
[SOLDIERS gasp]

144
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,125
Uh! Admiral Bewcock!

145
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,250
Don't let appearances
alone decide your opinion.

146
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,666
You may very well be looking
at a redwood sapling

147
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,875
and laughing
because it isn't tall.

148
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,750
It would seem as though
the Admiral's in your corner.

149
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,750
I would express my gratitude,

150
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,875
but I know he'd just
laugh in my face.

151
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,291
Still, though, it is reassuring.

152
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,791
[ALEX] That's right. I finally
read your strategy outline.

153
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:41,958
And what did you think?

154
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,500
It's the epitome
of recklessness.

155
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,041
You've outdone yourself.

156
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,041
It is, isn't it?

157
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,666
So. Who are you
going to find to star

158
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,291
in the leading role?

159
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:56,000
It'll take a real daredevil
to pull off a stunt like this.

160
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,291
I believe I've found the
perfect candidate for the job.

161
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,458
[FREDERICA]
The Rosen Ritter.

162
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,708
"Knights of the Rose."

163
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,125
A ground combat force comprised
of refugees from the Empire,

164
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,333
with tactical skills said
to be among the best

165
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,083
in all the Alliance.

166
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,666
[FREDERICA] Its 13th
regimental commander

167
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,208
is Captain Walter von Schönkopf.

168
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,750
[YANG] His Imperial language
won't be an issue?

169
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,375
[FREDERICA] No. But there
are unfavorable rumors.

170
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,708
Go on.

171
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,833
Of all their past captains,

172
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,000
a total of six defected
back to the Empire,

173
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,916
and there are concerns he
may become the seventh.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,583
Based on what?

175
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,958
[FREDERICA] He's the 13th
captain, and 13 is unlucky.

176
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,125
Got it.

177
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,333
So these concerns
are groundless, then.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,750
Do you wish to meet with him?

179
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,041
I can set up an
appointment right away.

180
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,500
[YANG]
No.

181
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,291
Thank you,
but I'll handle this myself.

182
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,250
I am the one asking him
for a favor, after all.

183
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,208
[MEN grunting]

184
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,416
[MEN panting]

185
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,833
[MAN 6E] You're out of luck.
This one's mine.

186
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,333
Please, that's what
you said the other day, too.

187
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,791
[MAN 6G] Hm. Looks like we got
a couple of fish out of water.

188
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,291
[FREDERICA]
This is Admiral Yang Wen-li,

189
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,291
and I am Sub-Lieutenant
Frederica Greenhill

190
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,291
of the Thirteenth Fleet.

191
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,833
We came here to speak with
Captain Walter von Schönkopf.

192
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,125
[MAN 6H] You wouldn't happen to
be Admiral Greenhill's daughter,

193
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,166
would you? I see the
rumors were true.

194
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,000
Every last one of them.

195
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,666
[MEN laugh]]

196
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,083
Talk about rude.

197
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,125
They didn't even
bother to salute.

198
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,583
Yeah, the sub-lieutenant
and I are actually here

199
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,625
on urgent business.

200
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:30,000
We'd like you to introduce us to
Captain Schönkopf immediately.

201
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,250
Well, since you asked so nicely.

202
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,458
I'd be happy to show
Sub-Lieutenant Greenhill

203
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,791
where she might find him.

204
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,833
[FREDERICA] Rudeness in front
of the admiral will only be

205
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,916
tolerated for so long.

206
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:46,833
[grosls]

207
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,541
[WALTER]
That'll do. Stand down.

208
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,125
How long are you going
to keep up that act?

209
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,791
[WALTER] Don't shame
yourselves any further.

210
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,000
[MEN gasp]

211
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,708
You are...?

212
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,500
Captain Walter von
Schönkopf at your service.

213
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,958
Seeing someone as
beautiful as you are, ma'am.

214
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,916
It makes men revert
back into little boys.

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,541
Same goes for me.
Please forgive us.

216
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,166
[FREDERICA gasps]

217
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,750
So, whatever could have
brought the hero of El Facil

218
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,458
to our humble barracks?

219
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,500
You've piqued
my curiosity already.

220
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,375
I'd like to chat with you.

221
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,208
[WALTER]
And I assume it's important?

222
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,875
Very much so.

223
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,625
[WALTER]
You're right.

224
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,333
That's likely the only
way to manage it.

225
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,375
Being stationed in
an invincible fortress

226
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,250
tends to make one cocky.

227
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,458
Now then.

228
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,625
You've know I'm
the unlucky 13th captain

229
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,958
of the Rosen Ritter.

230
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,500
There were six previous
who turned traitor.

231
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,250
What if I end up the seventh?

232
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,875
We're done.

233
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,708
[WALTER chuckles]
That'd certainly be the case,

234
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,166
but you've got a
backup plan, right?

235
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,500
Surely you've put some
countermeasure in place.

236
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,166
Nope. I couldn't
come up with anything.

237
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,041
If you decide to betray us,
then it'll be over.

238
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,000
End of story.

239
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,541
We only just
met and you're placing

240
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,000
your full confidence in me?

241
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,083
The truth is
I'm not very confident.

242
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,875
[WALTER]
Hmm?

243
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,166
However, if I don't
put my faith in you,

244
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,833
then the plan's over
before it even starts.

245
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,625
So I will trust you.

246
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,125
That's my number
one prerequisite.

247
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:05,958
I see. May I ask
you a question, Admiral?

248
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,416
[YANG]
Sure.

249
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,291
The orders you were
given are utterly impossible.

250
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,166
You have half a fleet.

251
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,083
Not only that, it's compromised
almost entirely

252
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,125
of undisciplined troops.

253
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,708
And you're going to bring
down Iserlohn Fortress?

254
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,833
I doubt anyone would
blame you for turning down

255
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,333
a suicide mission, so I would
like to know why you agreed

256
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,833
to it--was this plan something
you already had in mind?

257
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,166
Still, even if
that were the case,

258
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,875
your motivation remains
a mystery to me.

259
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,875
Do you crave honor or
perhaps a promotion?

260
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,500
I wouldn't say
it's about advancement.

261
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,166
It's enough I've already got
people addressing me as "sir"

262
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,916
before I'm 30.

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,166
Besides, if I make it
back from this mission alive,

264
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,416
my next course
of action is to get out.

265
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,250
What, you mean retire?

266
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,583
[YANG]
Yeah. Well, I get a pension.

267
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,625
And there's also retirement pay.

268
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,333
It'd be enough to
support myself plus another

269
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:06,000
and live comfortably.
A modest lifestyle.

270
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,125
You'd just walk away from

271
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,166
the current state of affairs?

272
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,875
[YANG sighs]
That's the thing.

273
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,208
It's because of the
state of affairs.

274
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,791
If our forces occupy Iserlohn,
it'd cut off what is really

275
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,833
the empire's only
route to invade us.

276
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,041
As long as we don't do
something stupid like attempting

277
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,208
to stage a reverse invasion,
neither force would be able

278
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,625
to clash even if they wanted.

279
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,666
That is, not on
a large scale at least.

280
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,958
The rest is up to the
Alliance's diplomatic skills,

281
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,958
but if we've secured a
militaristic advantage,

282
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,208
then there's a real chance a
peace treaty could be forged

283
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,875
with the Empire that would be
satisfactory to both parties.

284
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,291
As far as I'm concerned,
I could retire

285
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,166
with a clear conscience
under those conditions.

286
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,708
Seems you thought of everything,

287
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,166
but I wonder how long
that peace would last for.

288
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,166
Well, permanent peace has
never existed in human history.

289
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,875
We're not aiming for the
impossible here, Captain.

290
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,125
In truth, I don't think
it's too much to ask for

291
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,916
a few decades of
prosperity and calm.

292
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,375
If we're going to leave a legacy
behind for the next generation

293
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,916
to inherit, I'd want
it to be one thing.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,208
Just one. That's a
heritage of peace.

295
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,125
And maintaining
the tranquility passed on

296
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,125
from the previous generation.

297
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,375
That would become
their responsibility.

298
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,083
If each generation can
remember their responsibility

299
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,166
to future descendants,

300
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,250
I believe long-term peace
is a real possibility.

301
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,791
But, like I mentioned
to you before,

302
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,541
realistically, I'm hoping for
a few decades at the most.

303
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,958
But even that would be
10,000 times better

304
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,666
than another war that lasted
only a tenth that long.

305
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,416
Between us, I have
a 14 year-old kid I look after.

306
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,208
The last thing I want is
to watch him get dragged

307
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,833
into the battlefield.
That's the way I feel.

308
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,125
[WALTER]
Beg your pardon Admiral,

309
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,791
but you're either the
most honest man alive,

310
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,833
or worse, the biggest sophist
since Emperor Rudolf.

311
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,541
[FYODOR] This strategy
sounds like a real gamble.

312
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,125
[YANG]
I don't deny that.

313
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm at a loss for words.

314
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,625
[YANG]
Rightly so.

315
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,041
And if this plan should fail?

316
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,500
If things go bad,
we turn tail and run.

317
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,375
[MURAI]
You can't be serious.

318
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,083
I don't want you to worry.

319
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,625
It was an impossible
mission to begin with.

320
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,250
And the only two people who'll
be disgraced if we do fail

321
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,250
are myself and Chief Sithole.

322
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,625
The admiral and I
examined this plan yesterday,

323
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,291
and I believe he's right.

324
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,208
This is the only way we're
going to take Iserlohn.

325
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,708
You're positive?

326
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,583
It requires you playing
the most dangerous role.

327
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,208
[WALTER] Hmph. Well, What's the
worst that can happen to me?

328
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,041
If I'm taken prisoner, it just
means I get to go home.

329
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,791
[laughs]

330
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:01,583
Apologies. I guess
I took that joke too far.

331
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,750
[YANG] It may appear foolhardy
to you, but I assure you,

332
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,625
I've thought through this
as rationally as I could.

333
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:13,000
[YANG] By all means,
I won't ask anyone to trust me.

334
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,291
But I want you to
think about something.

335
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:19,208
Consider all the ways to take
Iserlohn with half a fleet.

336
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,166
There may be
a few possible methods,

337
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,791
but I think we'd arrive
at the same conclusion.

338
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,500
[MURAI]
Understood, Admiral.

339
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,083
The Thirteenth
will begin preparations

340
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,916
to dispatch at once.

341
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,583
[YANG]
Hmph.

342
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,875
[NARRATOR] A non-navigable
sector of space exists between

343
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,416
the Alliance and
Imperial territories.

344
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,708
Iserlohn Fortress
is located on the one

345
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,000
and only passable route through.

346
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,708
Stationed at this
formidable base

347
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,333
were two Imperial admirals.

348
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:30,375
One was the fortress's
commander, Admiral Stockhausen.

349
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,750
The other was the commander

350
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,083
of the fortress garrison,
Admiral Zeeckt.

351
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,791
[NARRATOR] Naturally, the
existence of two positions

352
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,083
with identical ranks created
a heated antagonism.

353
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,833
[NARRATOR]
The two men despised

354
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,083
and endlessly cursed
one another.

355
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,583
But whenever the Alliance
launched an attack,

356
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:53,458
they competed, refusing to let
the other have all the glory.

357
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,916
And thus, their rivalry
led to tremendous gains

358
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,458
on the battlefield.

359
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,375
[HANS] I've heard communications
in the vicinity of the fortress

360
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,208
have been disrupted
for the past two days.

361
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,791
What's going on?

362
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,125
[THOMA]
It's clear the enemy is present,

363
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,416
but we are unable to
locate their position.

364
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,833
We should deploy
our forces immediately.

365
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,291
I believe
I said we don't know

366
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,041
their current location.

367
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,541
Precisely why
we should move out.

368
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,208
To sniff out where they're
hiding before they mobilize.

369
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,750
Admiral, it appears
we're picking up a transmission.

370
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,333
It's weak. Very unstable,
fading in and out.

371
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,875
What does it say?

372
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,416
Sir.

373
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,166
"We are an Imperial cruiser
under secret orders to conduct

374
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,750
espionage within
Alliance territory.

375
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,041
During a mission,
the rebels detected us,

376
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,750
and we left the area.

377
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,125
Only to be pursued and
come under enemy fire

378
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,166
inside the corridor.

379
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,916
Requesting immediate
backup from Iserlohn."

380
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,125
End transmission.

381
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,458
[BOTH gasp]

382
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,000
It's not clear where
in the corridor they are.

383
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,000
We have no choice but to deploy.

384
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,625
Your Excellency, a moment?

385
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, Oberstein?

386
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,291
You have something you wish to
contribute?

387
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,208
[OBERSTEIN]
Yes, sir.

388
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,791
Very well. Let's hear it.

389
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,958
To be perfectly blunt.

390
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,083
I believe we're
walking into a trap.

391
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,208
A trap?

392
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,000
[OBERSTEIN] Yes,
one intended to draw

393
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,000
our fleet away from Iserlohn.

394
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,666
We mustn't go out.

395
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,291
We should observe
before making our move.

396
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,291
The enemy is waiting out there.

397
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,416
Are you saying that we'll lose
if we launch an attack?

398
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
We're soldiers,
and as such, our duty

399
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,041
in life is to fight.

400
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,666
Rather than idling in safety,
we should be proactive

401
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,666
in hunting down and
destroying the enemy.

402
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,208
Besides, how can we abandon

403
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,750
one of our distressed ships?

404
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,500
[THOMA]
I don't know, Admiral Seeckt.

405
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,583
Your staff officer
raises a valid objection.

406
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,958
We don't know the location
of the rebels or our ship.

407
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,916
Why don't we wait a little bit?

408
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,416
No!

409
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,666
The fleet will sortie as soon as
preparations are complete!

410
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,333
I wouldn't mind if he
returned bruised and bloodied.

411
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,000
[SOLDIER 6D]
Another incoming message!

412
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:39,500
"We will soon arrive in the
optical range of Iserlohn,

413
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,083
but the rebel forces
are still in pursuit.

414
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,666
Requesting backup."

415
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,000
Very well. Prepare to attack.

416
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,541
Sir.

417
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,791
Where the hell
did Seeckt disappear to?

418
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,541
[SOLDIER 6E]
Ships on screen!

419
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,708
[THOMA]
Enlarge.

420
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,458
Prepare to fire!

421
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,958
[THOMA]
Hmm?

422
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,458
[THOMA]
Very wise.

423
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,083
Looks like they know
how hopeless it is.

424
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,125
[SOLDIER 6D] Another
transmission from the ship!

425
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,500
[THOMA]
Put in on the monitor.

426
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,791
[LAEKEN] Lieutenant
Commander Laeken reporting.

427
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:26,333
I request an urgent audience
with your fortress commander.
