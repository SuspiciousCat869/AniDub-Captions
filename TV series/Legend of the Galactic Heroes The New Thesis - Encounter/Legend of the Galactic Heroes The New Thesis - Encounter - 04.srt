but here goes.

93
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:32,041
When I was a boy, every book
I read stated unequivocally

94
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,750
that Emperor Rudolf was
some heinous villain.

95
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,375
I thought, if that was true,
how'd he become emperor?

96
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,458
So I asked my father.

97
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,166
And what was his answer?

98
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,208
He said that people
wanted their lives to be easy.

99
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,083
Easy, like how?

100
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,208
Rather than choosing
to solve their problems

101
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,333
on their own, they were
waiting for some superhero

102
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,125
or saint to show up.

103
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,291
Someone who would take on all
responsibility single-handedly.

104
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,375
Rudolf took
advantage of that want.

105
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,625
In short, it is the people
who create the dictator

106
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,875
and they who ultimately bear
responsibility for his actions.

Even if they
don't support him outright,

them equally guilty.

00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:03,291
That's it, fixing
your eyes on past battles,

319
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,833
enables you to
predict future ones.

320
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,208
It's good to see you.

321
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,333
It takes me back to
our fleet academy days.

322
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,416
[YANG]
Me, too.

323
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,708
[YANG]
How's Jessica?

324
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,791
[LAPP]
I haven't seen her lately.

325
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,291
She's in Terneuzen.

326
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,083
I heard she's busy
teaching music these days.

327
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,625
Then go see her.

328
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,291
[ALEX]
Getting moved in, Cadet Yang?

329
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,416
Rear Admiral Caselnes, hi!

330
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,416
Yes, thank you for
arranging this for me!

331
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,708
I'm in your debt.

332
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,166
[ALEX] I've been
watching over you since

333
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,750
your Fleet Academy days.

334
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,875
I'm used to it.

335
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,708
To celebrate your promotion.

336
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,833
And to welcome you
to Silverbridge Street.

337
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,291
Thank you very much.

338
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:06,083
Since you and I are gonna
be neighbors now, fair warning.

339
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,541
You'd better brush up on
your chess skills a little.

340
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,708
[YANG chuckles]

341
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,375
[ALEX]
Talk about some fancy digs.

342
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,958
I've got two daughters
and a wife,

343
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,958
but my house is about the
same square footage as this.

344
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,500
[YANG]
It's too big for me.

345
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,208
I guess you have two choices.

346
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,416
You either get married or
you can adopt yourself a kid.

347
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,750
Me adopt?

348
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,791
I see you're still
as clueless as ever.

349
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,625
Just think about it.

350
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,750
The Free Planets Alliance
has been at war with

351
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,916
the Galactic Empire
for the last 150 years.

352
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,833
Naturally, there's going
to be a great number

353
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,375
of causalities and a lot of
war orphans as a result.

354
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,541
[ALEX] Thus, we have the Law for
Special Provisions Concerning

355
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,416
the Welfare of the
Children of Soldiers.

356
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,166
Which is also known
as Travers' Law

357
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,875
after the founder of the bill.

358
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,708
[ALEX]
Orphaned children can be raised

359
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,208
by other military families,
and the government offers

360
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,625
a loan to ease expenses.

361
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,708
When the child turns 15,

362
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,666
if they apply to
become a soldier,

363
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,583
or if they decide to attend a
military academy instead,

364
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,083
the original loan amount
will be entirely forgiven.

365
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,875
Effectively killing
two birds with one stone.

366
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,916
Saving orphaned kids
and also securing

367
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,125
future military personnel.

368
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,666
I see.

369
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,666
But, you know, as a bachelor
I don't think many people

370
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,291
would consider me a
"military family."

371
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,541
The law still
applies if you're single.

372
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,958
If it makes you feel better,

373
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,791
you can think of it as a
medieval style apprenticeship.

374
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,083
You're telling me I
should take on an apprentice?

375
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,166
[chuckles]

376
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,083
[ALEX]
Your laughing, but I mean it.

377
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:49,583
We all have things we can teach.
Even somebody like you.

378
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,333
Although, in your case,
I would imagine that you'd have

379
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,625
more to learn from your protégé
than the other way around.

380
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,250
[YANG]
Ah. Hm...

381
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,791
[LAPP] Looks like you
finally settled down.

382
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,333
I like the town
and it has a good library,

383
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,125
which is a plus.

384
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,083
You'll never change.

385
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,083
So, I just found out
I'm being deployed,

386
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,666
and, well...

387
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,875
[YANG]
What is it?

388
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,916
You see...

389
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,416
Jessica and I talked it over,
n' decided when I return,

390
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,125
we're gonna get engaged.

391
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,541
[gasps]

392
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,458
[violin plays]

393
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,041
[JESSICA]
What is it you're looking at?

394
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,375
[alarm rings]

395
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,375
[YANG sighs]
It's freezing.

396
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,166
[yawns]

397
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,250
[doorbell rings]

398
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:08,083
Yeah? Who's here
so early in the morning?

399
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,166
[YANG gasps]

400
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,791
[sighs

401
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,416
[doorbell rings]

402
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,166
[YANG]
I'm coming! Just one second!

403
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,708
