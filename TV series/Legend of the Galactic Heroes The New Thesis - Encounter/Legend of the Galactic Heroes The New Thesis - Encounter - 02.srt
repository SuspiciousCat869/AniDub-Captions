00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,958
[NARRATOR]
In the year UC 796,

2
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:15,166
also known to history as IC 487,

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,208
a Galactic Imperial Navy
fleet of 20,000 warships,

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:21,333
led by Reinhard von Lohengramm,
faced the Free Planets

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,416
Alliance Navy in
the Astarte Starzone.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,583
The Alliance, with
its superior numbers,

7
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,916
attempted to surround the
Imperial Navy on three sides.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,791
But the Imperials struck each of
their fleets individually,

9
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,625
leading to the loss of
the 4th and 6th fleets,

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,625
sealing the Alliance's defeat.

11
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:38,875
When suddenly,

12
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,166
a message was transmitted
from the Alliance.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,083
The voice said. "Have no fear.

14
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,750
Those of you who
wish to survive,

15
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,333
remain calm and do as I say."

16
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,458
Yang Wen-li. Reporting
to the bridge as ordered, sir!

17
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,375
I've finished reviewing
the battle plan you submitted.

18
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,958
It's quite an interesting
proposal, Commodore.

19
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,708
That said. In my opinion,
it's far too circumspect,

20
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,458
to the point of being passive.

21
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,375
You think so, sir?

22
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,291
If we heed your advice,
you're right, we won't lose.

23
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:26,500
But, not losing is insufficient.
We want a victory.

24
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,500
Given our clear
strategic advantage,

25
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,833
I see no benefit to altering
the current plan in favor

26
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,875
of your
overly-cautious proposal.

27
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,375
Not only do our forces have the
enemy surrounded on three sides,

28
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,791
but we outnumber
them two to one.

29
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,500
That's true, but as you know,

30
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,166
our encirclement is
not yet complete.

31
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,458
I've made my decision:
I'm rejecting this proposal.

32
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,375
Just so we're clear,
this is a tactical call

33
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,958
and not a personal one.

34
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,416
I understand, sir.

35
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,166
[LAO]
Commodore!

36
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,583
Yes, uh... Who are you?

37
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,750
My name's Lao, sir.

38
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,625
It's an honor to serve with
the hero of El Facil. Truly.

39
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,041
Please don't call me that.

40
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,041
A hero. Anyway, did
you need something from me?

41
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,083
It's regarding
your proposal, sir.

42
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,375
I might be mistaken,

43
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,750
but judging from
your expression,

44
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,625
I'd guess it was turned down.

45
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,000
It was, indeed.

46
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,458
I looked depressed
enough for you to tell

47
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,166
that at a glance, huh?

48
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,375
[LAO]
Hm.

49
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,916
I won't keep you, but
if you don't mind me asking,

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,250
what are your thoughts on
our current situation?

51
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,291
[YANG]
My thoughts?

52
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,458
We do have a clear advantage.

53
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,250
But if I were the enemy,
I wouldn't exactly

54
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,583
consider myself in dire peril.

55
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,416
[LAO]
Sir!

56
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,875
I have always had
the luck of the devil.

57
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,666
Back when my entire
fleet was destroyed,

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,416
I was one of three men who
made it out of there alive.

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,625
[YANG] Maybe some of
that luck will rub off on me.

60
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,458
As someone who's
been through worse.

61
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,791
I'm optimistic
about this mission.

62
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,666
Please, sir. Don't
feel discouraged.

63
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,000
[YANG]
Okay...?

64
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,291
[MAN 2A] Patrol craft 371
to flagship Patroklos.

65
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,166
The Imperial Navy fleet
could not be found

66
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,583
in the anticipated
sector. Repeat.

67
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,208
[MAN 2B] The Imperial Navy
fleet could not be found

68
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,250
in the anticipated sector.

69
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,000
They're not there?
But that's impossible!

70
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,666
It defies all reason!

71
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,958
Send an urgent transmission
to the 4th fleet commander!

72
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,208
[MAN 2A]
No response!

73
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,875
It appears the enemy has
jammed the radio waves!

74
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,916
It all turned
out just like you said. 

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,208
Not that I'm happy
about it, but yes.

76
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,750
[YANG] With our encirclement
still incomplete,

77
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,583
taking our fleets out
individually would

78
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,125
be the logical strategy.

79
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,375
[YANG] So, they're avoiding
the mistake they made

80
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,916
in the Slaughter at Dagon.

81
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,625
[PAETTA]
Commodore Yang!

82
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,875
Sir?

83
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,083
I would like your
analysis of the situation.

84
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,833
What do you think
they're planning?

85
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,416
It's clear the enemy
intends to take out our fleets

86
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,291
one at a time, and, given that
the fourth is the smallest

87
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,416
of the three, it would be
the obvious first choice

88
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,333
as a target.

89
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,625
With our forces scattered,

90
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,625
they can decide which
to confront first rather

91
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,250
than waiting until we've
encircled them completely.

92
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,416
[PAETTA]
Assuming you're right,

93
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,666
do you think the 4th
fleet can hold out?

94
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,500
[YANG]
The forces have clashed head-on.

95
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,583
Whoever has superior
numbers and strikes first

96
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,250
gets the advantage.

97
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,250
[PAETTA] Regardless, we need
to rush to the battlefield

98
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,541
and aide the 4th
before it's too late.

99
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,458
If luck's on our side, we'll be
able to hit the Imperial Navy

100
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,666
from the rear flank.

101
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,083
We'll have an instant
advantage over them.

102
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,250
I don't believe that's possible.

103
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,083
Why not, Commodore?

104
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,458
By the time we get there,

105
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,166
the battle will be over and
the 4th fleet destroyed.

106
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,250
The enemy
will be gone, too, sir.

107
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,000
They'll move to
continue their assault.

108
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,708
Most likely, they'll
strike the rear flank

109
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,000
of the 2nd or the 6th fleet.

110
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,958
We have lost the initiative.

111
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,750
In fact, they've taken it
from us at every turn.

112
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,916
In my opinion, we should
devise a new strategy

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,666
that doesn't play into
the enemy's hands.

114
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,958
And what exactly do you suggest?

115
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,375
[YANG]
A change of procedure.

116
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,458
Instead of rushing
to aid the 4th Fleet,

117
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,791
we merge with the 6th
fleet immediately.

118
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,333
Once we're united, we'll create
a new battlefield in that sector

119
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,041
and then challenge
the enemy there.

120
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,000
Combined, our two fleets
would total 28,000 ships.

121
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,458
As a result, our odds of success
would exceed 50%.

122
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,916
Are you actually
suggesting we leave

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,458
the brave people of
the 4th fleet to die?

124
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,541
Even if we left right now,

125
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,625
we still wouldn't
get there in time.

126
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,333
You don't know that.

127
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,708
The 4th fleet is strong.
They won't die so easily.

128
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,958
If they can just
hang on till we arrive!

129
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,250
Sir. I'm sorry to say
it, but the 4th fleet is lost.

130
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,500
Commodore Yang.

131
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,291
The reality of galactic
warfare does not rely

132
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,125
on your calculations alone!

133
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,375
The man leading the
enemy's expeditionary force

134
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,916
is Count Lohengromm.
He's young and inexperienced.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,625
With all due respect, sir.

136
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,083
While it may be true
he lacks experience.

137
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,791
--His strategic ideas--
--That is enough, Commodore!

138
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,333
The Vice Admiral Pastolle
is a veteran!

139
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,416
He won't go down
without a fight!

140
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,791
[alarm sounds]

141
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,125
Jean. Talk fast,
we've been ordered

142
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,666
to halt our communications.

143
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,291
The enemy isn't where
we expected they'd be, Yang.

144
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,375
[YANG]
Yeah, I know.

145
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,250
There's no hope
for the 4th fleet, then?

146
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,125
I'm afraid not.

147
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,208
The enemy will most likely
attack the 6th fleet next.

148
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,833
If that's true, then
they're about to increase

149
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,916
the interference on
our comm system.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,625
I'm afraid this might be the
last time the two of us speak.

151
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,541
If we don't do something
fast, we're done for.

152
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,875
I'll recommend to
Vice Admiral Moore

153
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,250
that we rendezvous
with the 2nd fleet.

154
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,583
I don't know that he'll listen,

155
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,083
but I'll try to talk some
sense into Paetta, too.

156
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,416
Yang.

yourself a military man?

Commodore Yang.

You are to assume control

you're the highest ranking

We're gonna need your tactical
skill now more than ever.

You think so, huh?

Message to all fleets!

209

Greetings. I'm
Commodore Yang Wen-li,

210
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,125
deputy officer to
Commander Paetta.

211
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,208
Our flagship,

212
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,791
and Commander Paetta
has been gravely injured.

213
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,291
Per the commander's orders,
I will be taking over command

214
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,708
of all fleets
effective immediately.

215
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,958
[YANG] Have no fear, follow my
orders and you will live.

216
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,916
Those of you who wish
to survive, remain calm,

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,416
and do as I say.

218
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,625
At the moment, our side
is losing, but the only thing

219
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,958
that matters is to be
winning at the last moment.

220
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,375
We will not lose.

221
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,125
[YANG] All ships, focus on
destroying individual crafts

222
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,791

[REINHARD "Follow my

Those are bold statements.

00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,833
I've certainly met some
braggarts in my day.

226
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,500
But never on this level.

227
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,208
He can say what he likes.

228
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,000
But he must realize there's
no chance he can win.

229
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,500
Well, no matter.

230
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,500
Let's find out what he's
made of, shall we, Kircheis?

00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,708
Yes, let's.

[LAO]
Commander.

233
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,250
The enemy is reforming
into a spindle formation.

234
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,708
[YANG] They must be planning
to break through our center.

235
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,708
What's our next move, sir?

236
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,250
I have a plan in mind.

237
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,250
A plan?

238
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,166
How will you give
the order, sir?

239
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,041
Comms are still down,
our system is entirely jammed,

240
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,916

isn't restored yet.

transmission immediately.

on their tactical intel system.

246
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,416
Yes, the enemy may
be monitoring everything

247
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,791
we send out, but if
that's all we transmit,

248
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,708
they won't understand.

he was doing all along.

I hoped this wouldn't be
necessary, but unfortunately...

you've been instructed.

Whoa.

[FISHER] It's a strategic plan
for countering a breakthrough

259

00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,250
And this is from Commodore Yang?

When did he prepare this plan?

00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,500
[FISHER] In accordance with
the Code C-4 strategic plan,

263
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,125
we will henceforth
move as a united fleet!

264
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,958
Do not rely on the data link!

Right away!

00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,791
So far, it looks
like it's working.

268
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,333
All right. The rest will depend
on our men following the plan.

269
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,500
Yeah. A single
misstep and the whole thing

270
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,916
will blow up in our faces.

271
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,083
If that happens,
what will you do, sir?

272

I'll pretend
I was clueless, I guess.

Is something the matter, sir?

What is it, Lord Reinhard?

I don't know.

Something's not right.
We're definitely winning.

278
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,166
There's no doubt.

279
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,458
And yet...

280
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,291
[gasps]
It can't be!

split up, Your Excellency!

They're advancing on us at
high speed from both sides!

283
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,916
We've been foiled.

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,833
They purposefully made it look
like they'd been broken up.

285
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,916
Then they split into two
forces to come around

286
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,791
and attack us from the rear!

287
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,708
Our strategy to
break through the centerline

288
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,625
has completely backfired!

289

We're taking fire?

Reverse course and
intercept the attack?

292

Don't be ridiculous.

293

If I attempted what you propose,
then I'd be as incompetent

294

as the commander of
the enemy's 4th fleet.

295
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,500
n that case, our
only option is to move forward.

296
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,208
Yes, precisely.

No, that's only half true.

I've read that back
when humanity inhabited

of formation appeared

start to pull back soon.

to press the attack, sir?

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,000
We've already done
all we're capable of.

314
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,625
[REINHARD] Kircheis.
What are your thoughts?

315
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,250
[KIRCHEIS] I think it's
perhaps time we end this.

316
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,583
If we continue down this path,

317
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,791
it'll mean mass casualties
for both sides.

318
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,750
There's no advantage
to pressing on.

319
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,708
I hope that
doesn't frustrate you, sir.

320
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,708
Not particularly.
Victory is still ours.

321
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,250
Although it's a shame
we couldn't apply

322
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,958
the finishing touches.

323
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,750
We were surrounded
by the enemy on three sides.

324
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,041
Outnumbered, and yet you still
destroyed two of their fleets.

325
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,833
And when they reversed course,
to attack from behind.

326
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,750
You stopped their advance.

327
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,125
You were steady and confident.

328
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,500
For the situation,
it was enough.

329
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,875
To hope for more
would be greedy, sir.

330
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,625
Yes, I know.

331
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,125
[REINHARD] The commander
of their 2nd Fleet.

332
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,291
The one who assumed
command during the fight.

333
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,000
What was his name again?

334
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,250
Commodore Yang Wen-li.

335
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,375
Ah, yes. That's it.

336
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,000
A clever man.

337
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,375
He just might be the sort of
adversary you spoke of earlier.

338
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,041
[REINHARD] Send a message
to Commodore Yang Wen-li

339
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,958
in my name.

340
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,208
[KIRCHEIS]
Of course, sir.

341
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,750
[REINHARD] Now I have something
interesting to look forward to.

342
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,791
Acting Commander, sir.

343
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,750
There's a message
from the enemy ship.

344
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,333
[YANG]
Well. What does it say?

345
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,541
"I would like to offer
you my compliments.

346
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,166
That was a battle
bravely fought.

347
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,333
Until our next encounter."

348
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,750
High Admiral Reinhard
von Lohengramm.

349
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,416
That is all.

350
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,166
Respect for my
bravery in battle, huh?

351
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,416
What a humbling message.

352
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,625
Well, sir? Shall we respond?

353
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,875
[YANG] No. I doubt
they're really expecting

354
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,916
something like that.

355
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,666
Never mind.
We'll just ignore it.

356
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,541
More importantly, there are
survivors who need our help.

357
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,666
I want to save as many
lives as we possibly can.

358
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,416
Yes, I understand.

359
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,416
Thanks to you I'm still alive.

360
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,000
I cheated death yet again.

361
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,333
It was probably
just your good luck.

362
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,875
[NARRATOR] And thus,
the great Battle of Astarte

363
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,916
came to an end.

364
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,833
In the conflict,
The Alliance suffered over

365
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,916
ten times the losses
of the Imperial Navy.

366
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,291
But their casualties
were not in vain.

367
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,916
They prevented
the Galactic Empire's

368
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,625
invasion of the
Astarte Starzone.

369
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,000
[OFFICIAL 2A] Presenting
the leader of all humanity.

370
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,125
Soverign of all the universe.

371
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,541
Defender of law and order
governing the heavenly realm.

372
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,583
Kaiser of the sacred
Galactic Empire.

373
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,416
[OFFICIAL 2A] His Imperial
Majesty, Friedrich the fourth!

374
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,625
[OFFICIAL 2A]
Count Reinhard von Lohengramm!

375
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,208
Come forth at once!

376
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,416
[NARRATOR] On that day,
the High Admiral of

377
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,500
the Galactic Imperial Navy,
Count Reinhard von Lohengramm,

378
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,916
was named Imperial
Fleet Admiral.

379
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,208
However, this was not the end
of the road for Reinhard.

380
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,625
This was but one small step
toward his true destination.
