1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:12,833
[NARRATOR] In the year CE 2081,
humanity relocated

2
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,416
its political center from Earth,
the third planet in

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,541
the solar system,
to Theoria, second planet

4
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,708
of the Aldebaran Star System.

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,166
Establishing the
Galactic Federation.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,916
It was then declared
the first year of

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,416
the Universal Calendar
and heralded as an era

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,416
of long-lasting growth.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,583
However, this prosperity
would not last forever.

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,083
And humanity found itself
eclipsed by the shadow

11
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,625
of uncertainty and stagnation.

12
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,041
Then, in UC 310,

13
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,166
Rudolf Goldenbaum
was elected President of

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,875
the Galactic Federation
by popular vote.

15
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:48,000
Soon after, he was appointed
Prime Minister by Parliament,

16
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,541
holding both offices
simultaneously.

17
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,291
In addition, he bestowed
upon himself the title

18
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,791
Emperor Rudolf the First
of the Galactic Empire.

19
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,958
At which point, the Galactic
Federation collapsed,

20
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:03,708
and the Goldenbaum Dynasty
was established in its place.

21
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:06,208
These events afforded
him the dual role of both

22
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,583
the first absolute
monarch of all humanity.

23
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,583
As well as its dictator.

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,750
[NARRATOR] Now a holy
and unchallengeable entity,

25
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:19,250
Rudolf shaped reality
to match his ideology.

26
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,666
The result was a world in which
the populace was ruled

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,125
by a subset of the nobility.

28
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,041
[NARRATOR] An outbreak
of widespread rioting

29
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,583
followed his death.

30
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,708
However, the empire's
foundation remained intact.

31
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,916
Then in the year IC 164,
a group of republicans

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,416
led by Arle Heinessen succeeded
in escaping the empire's rule.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,875
After a journey that
lasted half a century,

34
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:47,083
they reached a habitable planet
which they named Heinessen.

35
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,916
And declared the establishment
of the Free Planets Alliance.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,708
Operating under
the belief that they were

37
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,333
the true heirs of the
Galactic Federation,

38
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,750
the Alliance reinstated
the Universal Calendar.

39
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,708
The year was UC 527,
coinciding with

40
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,833
the year 218 of the
Imperial Calendar.

41
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,291
In UC 640,
the Galactic Empire

42
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,791
and the Free Planets Alliance
would first clash,

43
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,750
spending the next 150
years at war.

44
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,541
[FRIEDRICH] For your victory
in subjugating the rebel forces

45
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,875
in the Astarte Starzone,

46
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,083
Count Reinhard von Lohengramm,
I name you the

47
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,875
Imperial Fleet Admiral.

48
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,458
I also grant you the title
of Vice Commander of

49
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,583
the Imperial Space Fleet.

50
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,291
Your command is
hereby increased to include

51
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,833
half the armada's warships.

52
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,041
Thus decreed by the
Kaiser of the Galactic Empire,

53
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,958
in this, the 487th year of
the Imperial Calendar.

54
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:18,541
[trumpets blare]

55
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,958
[OVLESSER] Hmph. A
20 year-old fleet admiral.

56
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,666
Our once illustrious
Imperial Space Fleet,

57
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,708
now reduced to a child's
plaything, Your Excellency.

58
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,083
How tragic.

59
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,791
[GREGOR] So you say, milord,
but you can't deny that

60
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,375
the blonde brat
possesses tactical skill.

61
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,375
Despite being outnumbered,
he quelled the rebels.

62
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,125
His talent seems
to have astonished

63
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,333
even seasoned veterans.
It silenced Merkatz.

64
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,791
[OVLESSER] The man looks
like he's had his fangs pulled.

65
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,291
While the boy won,
in all probability,

66
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,291
it was an isolated event.

67
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,625
If you ask me, the only
reason we triumphed was

68
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,583
the enemy's utter incompetence.

69
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,375
[MAN 3A] Next, he'll go
from count to marquis.

70
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,125
[MAN 3B]
He's done remarkably well.

71
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,083
I'm sure it has nothing to
do with the Kaiser being

72
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,625
in love with his sister.
Nothing at all.

73
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,166
[MAN 3C]
And his ginger-haired stooge

74
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,916
is getting promoted two ranks.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,125
[ANSBACH]
Cease the gossip!

76
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,208
[gasping]

77
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,875
[MAN 3A]
Commodore Ansbach, sir!

78
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,500
Their deeds
and not their relations,

79
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,166
have made them worthy
of the ranks they hold.

80
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,541
So watch your tongues!

81
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,625
[MEN]
Yes, sir!

82
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,833
I imagine you'll be promoted.

83
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,958
How does "Commodore" sound?

84
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,958
[KIRCHEIS] Every time Reinhard
takes a step up the ladder,

85
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:03,750
I'm dragged right behind him.
And at such staggering speed.

86
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,125
[OBERSTEIN] Captain Siegfried
Kircheis, isn't it?

87
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,833
That's correct. And you are?

88
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,625
I am Captain Paul von Oberstein.

89
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,291
A pleasure to finally meet you.

90
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,833
Do you have business with me?

91
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,583
[OBERSTEIN sighs]
Forgive me.

92
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,083
My artificial eyes seem
to be acting up.

93
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,041
I apologize if I alarmed you.

94
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,500
There's no need.

95
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,583
In which battle did
you lose them?

96
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,583
[OBERSTEIN]
None. It was a congenital issue.

97
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:37,083
How fortunate I wasn't born
during the reign Emperor Rudolf.

98
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,041
Otherwise, I would
have been eliminated

99
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,083
under the Inferior Genes
Exclusion Act.

100
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,708
[OBERSTEIN] You're lucky, too,
blessed with a good superior.

101
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,291
There are precious few
in the Imperial Army.

102
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,083
Those who realize their
subordinate's abilities.

103
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,666
But Count Lohengramm
appears to be

104
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,291
in a separate class. His
ideology is beyond aristocrats

105
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,541
who only concern
themselves with lineage.

106
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,916
If you don't mind me asking,

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,708
which fleet do you serve?

108
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,250
Formerly headquarters,

109
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,333
intel processing division, but
I've recently been appointed

110
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:13,250
to the fleet at Iserlohn
Fortress as a staff officer.

111
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,625
Congratulations on your success.

112
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,708
You play your cards
close to the chest, don't you?

Salute the fleet admiral!

115
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,875
If I may extend
my congratulations.

116
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,750
Until we meet again, captain.

117
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,041
And you.

Please excuse me, sir.

119
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,416
And who might that be?

120
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,541
A walking enigma, I suspect.

[CROWD murmuring]

122
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,208

I see.

He had harsh criticism for
Emperor Rudolf, did he?

124
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,500
[REINHARD] It is always
best to remain guarded,

125
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,750
though with so many
enemies lurking,

126

it isn't the easiest of tasks.

Agreed.

I'm seeing Annerose,
you should come along.

Are you certain I should?

I invited you.
There's no point in resisting.

[KIRCHEIS] Back then,
the stars shimmering in the sky

reaching for them.

00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,750
[ANNEROSE]
Reinhard?

160
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,708
[REINHARD]
Over here!

161
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,250
You little scamp.
You disappeared on me.

162
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,791
There's someone
I want you to meet.

163
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:17,875
Come on!

164
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,458
[REINHARD] I'd like to introduce
you to Siegfried Kircheis.

165
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,541
Hello there. I'm Annerose.

166
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,416
So, Siegfried? May I
call you "Sieg" for short?

167
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,916
[KIRCHEIS]
A-Ah... Mm.

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,625
Well, Sieg.

169
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,208
I hope you'll be good
friends with my brother.

170
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,833
[KIRCHEIS]
M-Mm-hmm! Sure!

171
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,500
[ANNEROSE]
My. You're energetic!

172
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,500
[laughter]

173
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,166
[TEACHER 3A]
Welcome our new student.

174
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,083
This is Reinhard von Müsel.

175
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,208
[CLASSROOM murmuring]

176
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,083
It's von Müsel. Get it right.

177
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,416
[BOY 3C chuckles]

178
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,125
[BOY 3D] I hated that noble
kid the second I saw him.

179
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,208
He'll get the picture
as soon as he shows up.

180
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,625
[BOY 3F]
Should be any minute.

181
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,541
Let's bust him up
nice and quick.

182
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,625
[KIRCHEIS]
Did you see where Reinhard went?

183
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,000
[BOY 3G] Some of the older kids
were asking for him earlier.

184
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,083
[gasps]

185
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,208
[KIRCHEIS]
Reinhard!

186
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,166
[KIRCHEIS pants]

187
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,291
[KIRCHEIS gasps]

188
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,666
I bet that taught them a lesson.

189
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,916
[KIRCHEIS]
Hmm

190
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,666
[REINHARD]
My uniform, though.

191
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,125
If Annerose knew what I'd
done, she'd be very upset.

192
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,833
[sighs] I have an
idea how to avoid that.

193
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,875
Phoo. Phoo.

194
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,250
[ANNEROSE]
How is it?

195
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,791
Perfect!

196
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,458
[ANNEROSE]
Have you two warmed up a bit?

197
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,625
[REINHARD, KIRCHEIS]
Yes.

198
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,958
I can't believe
you fell into a fountain.

199
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,000
I guess you have
a little too much energy.

200
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,125
[BOTH]
Hmm.

201
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,625
[laughter]

202
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,958
[ANNEROSE] What? Sometimes,
you boys act so strangely.

203
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,416
Anyway, I made
a Kelsey plum cake.

204
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,375
Go get dressed
and help yourselves.

205
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,500
[REINHARD gasps]

206
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,000
[BOTH gasp]

207
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,708
[ANNEROSE]
Hey, what did I tell you?

208
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,625
Clothes first, then dessert.

209
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,000
[REINHARD, KIRCHEIS]
No, cake first!

210
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,833
[ANNEROSE giggles]

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,416
[REINHARD]
By the way, Kircheis!

212
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,208
My sister said she was
going to bake more

213
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,833
Kelsey plum cake today.

214
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,750
Really? I never
get tired of those.

215
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,916
Ah.

216
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,125
[KIRCHEIS] I know that crest.
Why are they at your house?

217
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,250
[REINHARD growls]

218
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,583
Wait, Reinhard!

219
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,041
[REINHARD]
What did you do?!

220
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,291
We didn't have any choice.

221
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:05,958
His Highness has demanded her.
You must realize, it's an honor.

222
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,250
You sold your own daughter!

223
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,750
Where is the honor in that?!

224
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,666
How could you put
a price on her life?!

225
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,250
[REINHARD'S FATHER] And I told
you we have no other choice!

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ugh.The decision's been made.

227
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,291
[gasps]

228
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,458
It's all right.

229
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,666
Everything's going
to be fine, Reinhard.

230
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,333
[REINHARD sobs]

231
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,083
This is how it worked out.

232
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,416
[REINHARD sobs]

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,916
[ANNEROSE]
Sieg.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,166
[KIRCHEIS gasps]

235
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,416
We didn't know
each other for very long,

236
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,250
but thank you.

237
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,916
A gift. I hope you enjoy it.

238
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,208
Take care of Reinhard for me.

239
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:15,500
He's going to need you.
Goodbye, Sieg.

240
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,041
[KIRCHEIS gasps]

241
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,541
[KIRCHEIS whimpers]

242
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,916
[gasps]

243
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,041
[REINHARD]
Kircheis.

244
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,291
Ah.

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,791
[KIRCHEIS]
Reinhard.

246
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,291
It's been a while.

247
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,000
Where have you been?

248
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,541
That uniform...

249
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,458
[REINHARD]
I joined a cadet school.

250
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,625
Why would you do that?

251
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,000
To join the military.

252
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,958
The fastest way to get
ahead in this world.

253
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,208
I came to ask you to
become a solider with me.

254
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,833
Be a soldier?

255
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,958
You and I. Together,
we will get my sister back.

256
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,875
[gasps]

257
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,541
Take care of Reinhard for me.

258
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,083
He's going to need you.

259
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,750
[BOY 3H]
So that's Countess Grünewald's

260
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,916
younger brother, is it?

261
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,791
[BOY 3I] Did you hear
about the red-headed kid?

262
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,291
He's a commoner!

263
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,750
[BOY 3J] What's a peasant
doing at our school?

264
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,458
[BOY 3K] He got in because
of the sister's influence, too.

265
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,208
[REINHARD]
Those two are sons of magnates.

266
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,625
They always have servants
in tow to do their bidding.

267
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,291
How long would
they last on the battlefield?

268
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,125
They will never go.

269
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,625
Even if they
get into the military,

270
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,791
most of them get stuck
in the rear service.

271
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,666
They have no intention
of risking their lives

272
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,250
by going out on the front lines.

273
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,208
That's how imperial nobles are.

274
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,041
Faster! Hustle! Hustle! Hustle!

275
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,333

276
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,791
[BOY 3N] Move it, horsey!
Go faster! Faster!

277
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,041
Goal!

278
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,333
[grunting, groaning]

279
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,958
It would appear
your steed has gone lame.

280
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,416
A truly pathetic display.

281
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,958
[BOY 3N]
On your feet, horse.

282
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,333
[BOY 3P]
You, too.

283
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,166
Those boys,
neither of them have done

284
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,583
a single thing to earn
their standing.

285
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,875
There's no reason why we
should have to be downwind

286
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,500
of their self-grandeur.

287
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,875
You're right.

288
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,708
[MAN 3G] Graduating
students representative,

289
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,333
Reinhard von Müsel!

290
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,458
[REINHARD]
Sir!

291
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,000
[MAN 3G] Salutatorian,
Siegfried Kircheis.

292
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,208
Sir!

293
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,750
[REINHARD] Kircheis, have you
ever thought about it this way?

294
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,500
Annerose!

295
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,125
I'm overjoyed you
decided to visit, Reinhard.

296
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,666
Sieg, too!

297
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,958
It brings me
pleasure to see you

298
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,083
doing so well, Annerose.

299
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,208
[ANNEROSE]
Mm. And I, you.

300
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,958
Though you certainly
took your time.

301
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,500
I've been awaiting
your arrival for days.

302
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,958
Follow me. I'll show
you both inside.

303
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:02,125
[KIRCHEIS]
She hasn't changed. Not one bit.

304
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,083
Not even the Kaiser
with all his power,

305
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,208
can do anything
to taint these two.

306
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,583
They're untouchable.

307
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,541
Lost in thought?

308
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,083
Come along now.

309
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,208
[KIRCHEIS]
Sorry.

310
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,750
[ANNEROSE]
Have some Kelsey plum cake.

311
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,041
I made it myself,

312
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,375
so I don't know if it
will suit your tastes.

313
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,791
I'll just have to
make my tastes suit it.

314
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,541
Goodness, you can be so mean!

315
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,541
It's as delicious as always.

316
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,333
You are too kind.

317
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,958
So tell me, Sieg.

318
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,000
Has my dear brother been getting
you into all sorts of trouble?

319
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,625
No, not at all.

320
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,583
Go on, you can
be honest with her.

321
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,875
[ANNEROSE]
Don't tease him, Reinhard!

322
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,041
[laughs]

323
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,416
Oh, that's right.

324
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,625
I have a wonderful vin rosé
I received as a gift.

325
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,750
I seem to be getting your hint.

326
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,375
I suppose you'd like me
to locate that bottle.

327
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,000
I won't be gone long.

328
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,500
[ANNEROSE] Thank you,
Reinhard. You're a gem.

329
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,291
[ANNEROSE giggles]

330
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,708
[ANNEROSE] You've done
so much for my brother.

331
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,333
Please, think nothing of it.

332
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,125
On the contrary,
he's done so much for me.

333
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,666
To be a captain at my age.
It's more than I deserve.

334
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,666
And soon you'll be rear admiral.

335
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,166
Or so I hear.

336
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,375
Congratulations.

337
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,208
[gasps] That's right,
thank you very much.

338
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,791
I've never heard
my brother say it aloud,

339
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,958
and I suppose it's possible
that he simply hasn't noticed.

340
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,625
But he truly relies
on you a great deal.

341
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,250
You flatter me.
I'm nothing special.

342
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,750
That's untrue.

343
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,125
I wish you'd learn to
appreciate your value more.

344
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,416
Reinhard does
possess talent, and yet,

345
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,208
he lacks your maturity, Sieg.

346
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,583
He's like a wild goat
that grows too proud

347
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,416
of its agility only to
fall from the cliff.

348
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,625
His situation is
just as perilous.

349
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,041
So please, Sieg. I'm asking you.

350
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,250
Watch over Reinhard
so he doesn't meet with

351
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,041
a similar fate--
slipping off the cliff.

352
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,458
And if he's headed in
that direction, please tell him.

353
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:11,833
He would listen. I know he'd
accept a warning from you.

354
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,666
You have my word
I'll do everything in my power.

355
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,166
Your brother has my loyalty,

356
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,458
and nothing in this universe
will ever change that.

357
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,000
I swear, as long as I breathe,

358
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,166
I will not disappoint you.

359
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,041
[ANNEROSE] Mm. I know you won't.
Thank you, Sieg.

360
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,458
I need to tell you...

361
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,541
[door creaks]

362
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,958
[REINHARD]
A success.

363
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,500
You should have put it
somewhere easier to find.

364
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,875
My apologies.

365
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,416
But soon you'll see it
was worth the effort.

366
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,416
I'll just go fetch us
some glasses.

367
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,500
[KIRCHEIS] So this is
where you disappeared to.

368
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:57,041
I've come so far,
since that one night.

369
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:01,916
Kircheis, have you
ever thought about it this way?

370
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,250
The Goldenbaum
Dynasty isn't timeless.

371
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,375
It hasn't existed since
humanity's dawn.

372
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,625
It all began
with one arrogant bastard.

373
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,125
[gasps]

374
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,625
[REINHARD] Rudolf started
out as nothing more

375
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,916
than an ambitious upstart.

376
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But his timing was right,
and he managed to become

377
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,291
a holy and inviolable emperor.

378
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,833
What do you think, Kircheis?

379
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,666
If Rudolf achieved such power,

380
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,250
do you think I'm capable
of doing the same?

381
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,958
[KIRCHEIS]
Reinhard.

382
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,458
You know the answer, so please.

383
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,500
Go make the universe your own.

384
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:12,583
[REINHARD] Let's go.
We return to the battlefield.

385
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,416
Yes, sir.

386
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,708
