1
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,500
[REMSCHEID]
That can't be.

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,000
You're telling me those
lowlifes are orchestrating

3
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:28,041
an all-out military offensive
against the Galactic Empire?

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,333
[RUBINSKY] It seems that after
capturing the Empire's pride

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,958
and joy Iserlohn, the
Alliance has acquired

6
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,750
a taste for conquest.

7
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,166
[REMSCHEID]
Hmm.

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,291
[REMSCHEID] While it's true
that by occupying the fortress,

9
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,791
the rebels now have a bridgehead
into imperial territory,

10
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,833
surely they wouldn't be so
reckless as to launch

11
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,625
an invasion
immediately afterwards.

12
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,125
[RUBINSKY] Be that as it may,
there is no debate--the Alliance

13
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,958
is now drawing up plans to
conduct a large-scale attack.

14
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,375
[REMSCHEID]
How large-scale?

15
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,458
[RUBINSKY]
Roughly 30,000,000 troops.

16
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,750
[gasps]

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,291
[DOMINIQUE] He didn't seem
to take the news too well.

18
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,208
[RUBINSKY] That information
was beyond a mere

19
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,083
high commissioner's capacity.

20
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,500
He'll have no choice but to
request instruction from Odin.

21
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,291
[DOMINIQUE]
How malicious of you.

22
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,333
When you received similar
information before,

23
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,791
you chose to keep
it to yourself

24
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,750
rather than passing
it along to him.

25
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,416
[RUBINSKY] When Iserlohn
was going to be attacked.

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,333
I was intrigued to see how their
strategy would play out.

27
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:43,375
Besides, I never expected their
campaign to be successful.

28
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,041
[RUBINSKY] However,
with the fall of Iserlohn,

29
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,875
things are different.

30
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,666
The balance in this war
now favors the Alliance,

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,250
therefore we need to adjust
it back to the Empire.

32
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,500
[DOMINIQUE]
You enjoy this.

33
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,333
[RUBINSKY]
Is that how it looks?

34
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,875
[DOMINIQUE]
Yes.

35
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,791
[RUBINSKY] There are many ways
entertain and enrich life--

36
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:07,666
wine, women--but nothing
compares to using the fates

37
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,291
of men and nations
as chips in games

38
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,625
of political and
military intrigue.

39
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,291
[RUBINSKY] Even Machiavellian
trickery, if refined,

40
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,625
can achieve the level of
an artistic masterpiece.

41
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,791
[DOMINIQUE] Unbelievable. You're
calling yourself an artist?

42
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,208
[RUBINSKY] Please. I'm not the
only one who holds this view.

43
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,916
Anyway, I'm almost certain
the one who will be sent

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,583
to intercept the Alliance
attack will be none other than

45
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,208
Count Reinhard von Lohengramm.

46
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,916
[RUBINSKY]
I need him to win,

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,083
but not by too wide of
a margin this time.

48
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,916
I need both sides to
keep fighting each other,

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,041
inflicting damage,
for as long as possible.

50
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:21,875
[LICHTENLADE]
We've received word

51
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,166
from Count Remscheid on Fezzan.

52
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,208
According to him, the rebels
are planning to invade

53
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,083
Imperial territory.

54
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,250
With approximately
30,000,000 men.

55
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,458
[GERLACH] Thirty million?
That sounds extremely serious.

56
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,791
[LICHTENLADE] It could be,
but at the same time,

57
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,250
it might prove to
be an opportunity.

58
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,750
[GERLACH]
How do you mean?

59
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,625
[LICHTENLADE] What we need
at the present time is to fight

60
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,958
a battle and to win.

61
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,833
I'm told by the
minister of the interior

62
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,333
that revolutionary sentiment is
growing among the commoners.

63
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,083
[LICHTENLADE] They're starting
to figure out Iserlohn

64
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,250
is no longer in our control.

65
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,583
We must defeat the rebels
and restore the dignity

66
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,083
of the Imperial household.

67
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,833
[GERLACH] I doubt anyone
wants the job more than

68
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,125
the golden brat,
so why not offer it to him?

69
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,458
[LICHTENLADE]
If he's successful,

70
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,166
his reputation would rise
to a whole new level,

71
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,291
which basically means
any room we had remaining

72
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,875
to oppose him would evaporate.

73
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,666
[LICHTENLADE] If he fails,
on the other hand,

74
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,166
we'll have to contend
with the rebels

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,291
under unfavorable conditions
at an extreme disadvantage.

76
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,541
[LICHTENLADE] Imagine a battle
in the middle of the Empire

77
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,666
against a horde of 30,000,000
troops high off victory.

78
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,875
[GERLACH]
The boy's not incompetent

79
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,041
and will surely
inflict causalities.

80
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,666
Even if the rebels
were to defeat him,

81
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,833
there's no way they'd emerge
from combat unscathed.

82
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,916
[GERLACH] We only need to be
strong enough to defend against

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,625
the enemy while they're
in a weakened state.

84
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,458
[LICHTENLADE]
I see.

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,875
That's all well and good
if the boy loses.

86
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,833
But, what if he wins instead?

87
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,208
[LICHTENLADE]
He'll earn the kaiser's favor

88
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,666
and receive credit
for another heroic feat,

89
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,375
growing beyond our control.

90
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,791
Imagine him becoming more
arrogant than he already is.

91
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,583
[GERLACH] Why not allow him
to continue his arrogance?

92
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,416
We can deal with a single
upstart anytime we please.

93
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,125
[LICHTENLADE]
Hmm.

94
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,125
[GERLACH] When the
rebels are finally gone,

95
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,458
that golden haired brat
will fall as well.

96
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,666
[GERLACH] But so long
as we're stuck with him.

97
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,500
I don't see why we shouldn't
make the best use of his talent.

98
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,541
[SITHOLE]
Let's begin.

99
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,916
First, there's the formation of
our expeditionary force.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,666
To provide us with
a full breakdown,

101
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,250
here's the chief of logistics,
Rear Admiral Caselnes

102
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,625
[ALEX] Sir. To start,
the supreme commander of

103
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,083
the expeditionary
force will be

104
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,208
the Space Fleet
Commander-in-Chief.

105
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,166
Admiral Lassalle Lobos.

106
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,125
[ALEX] The chief of staff will
be Admiral Dwight Greenhill.

107
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,208
Vice Admiral Konev will serve
as chief of operations.

108
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,500
The chief of intelligence will
be Rear Admiral Birolinen.

109
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,291
[ALEX] And the chief
of logistics is myself

110
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,291
with one staff officer.

111
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,750
Next, I'll introduce the eight
fleets which will be added

112
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,875
to the force as combat units.

113
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,500
[ALEX] Vice Admiral Lefebvre
will command the Third Fleet.

114
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,125
Vice Admiral Bewcock will
command the Fifth Fleet.

115
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,916
Vice Admiral Hawood will
command the Seventh Fleet.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,708
Vice Admiral Appleton will
command the Eighth Fleet.

117
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,458
[ALEX] Vice Admiral al-Salem
will command the Ninth Fleet.

118
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,250
Vice Admiral Ulanhu will
command the Tenth Fleet.

119
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,000
[ALEX] Vice Admiral Borodin will
command the Twelfth Fleet.

120
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,000
And finally, Vice Admiral
Yang will command

121
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,583
the Thirteenth Fleet.

122
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,208
[ALEX] These, plus independent
units brings the force's total

123
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:26,291
to 30,227,400 soldiers.

124
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,750
[overlapping chatter]

125
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,000
[YANG]
Thirty million.

126
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,041
That's about 60%
of our entire navy.

127
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,250
Good grief. It's overwhelming.

128
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,625
[YANG] Maybe the price we
paid for capturing Iserlohn

129
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,250
wasn't nearly high enough.

130
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,125
[JULIAN] Sorry, I couldn't
hear you, Admiral.

131
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,166
What was that?

132
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,500
[YANG]
Oh, nothing.

133
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,416
It's said a military victory has
an effect similar to a narcotic.

134
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,166
[YANG]
Both the press and the public,

135
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,333
they're openly calling for
an invasion of the Empire.

136
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,416
[JULIAN] I suppose
they don't want to break

137
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,916
the current momentum.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,666
[YANG]
But just think about it.

139
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,208
If the fall of Iserlohn
had cost a thousand--

140
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,291
Scratch that.

141
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,666
If it had cost
hundreds of thousands

142
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,166
of our soldiers' lives.

143
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,291
How do you think everyone
would feel about it then?

144
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,583
[JULIAN]
I'm guessing...

145
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,666
...they wouldn't have
an appetite for war.

146
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,791
[YANG] But that wasn't the
way that things worked out.

147
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,791
They got it in their heads
victories came easy

148
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,500
and without consequences.

149
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,041
Ow.

150
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,833
[YANG]
If I'd known this would happen,

151
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,916
I would have gone
about it a different way.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,958
[JULIAN] But the reason
Iserlohn's capture was such

153
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,708
a success was because you did
everything possible in order

154
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,708
to minimize the casualties.

155
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,291
[YANG] And the result of
that remarkable success

156
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,291
is this completely
unjustifiable expedition.

157
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,416
[JULIAN] What I don't understand
is why a plan as reckless

158
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,416
as this was even suggested
in the first place.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,750
[YANG]
Because elections are coming up.

160
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,208
[JULIAN]
Huh?

161
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,625
[YANG]
The Alliance has had a number

162
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,750
of political scandals recently.

163
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,625
So it's in the government's
best interest to divert

164
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,041
the public's
attention elsewhere.

165
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,500
[JULIAN]
That can't be right.

166
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,333
[YANG] Just for the sake
of staying in office

167
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,208
another four years, they're
sending 30,000,000 soldiers

168
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,875
to the battlefield.
It's beyond me.

169
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,708
I can't understand that
kind of thinking at all.

170
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,250
[SITHOLE]
Gentlemen.

171
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,833
The decision to lead our
forces into Imperial territory

172
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,583
has been approved
by the High Council.

173
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,375
[SITHOLE] But, no specific plan
of action has been established

174
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,000
at this point.

175
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,791
The purpose of today's
meeting is to decide on that.

176
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,666
I look forward to
a lively discussion.

177
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,416
[FALK]
If I may, Chief.

178
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,583
I am Commodore Falk,
an operations staff officer.

179
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,541
[FALK] I believe this expedition
is the most ambitious

180
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,458
undertaking in the entire
history of the Alliance.

181
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,458
For me to be able to participate
in this campaign is,

182
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,458
quite frankly, the greatest
honor I could imagine.

183
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,791
[YANG] He must be the one
the chief was talking about.

184
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,416
[ULANHU] May I ask what
motivated this decision, sir?

185
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,666
As soldiers, we are obligated
to follow whatever orders

186
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,625
or deployment is asked of us.

187
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,041
[ULANHU] If the mission's
purpose is to strike

188
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,000
the very heart of the
Goldenbaum Dynasty,

189
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,958
it goes without saying
that we will happily depart.

190
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,416
[ULANHU] But before
we endeavor to undertake

191
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,083
such a large-scale invasion.

192
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,750
I would like to hear
what the strategic goal

193
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,083
behind this expedition is.

194
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,666
[LOBOS] Operations Staff
Officer, if you would.

195
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,291
[FALK]
Yes. With our massive force,

196
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,666
we'll advance deep
into enemy territory.

197
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,791
Our mere presence should
be enough to strike terror

198
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,000
into the souls of
the Imperial soldiers.

199
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,791
[ULANHU] Are you saying we'll
retreat without even fighting?

200
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,875
[FALK] I believe that we should
maintain a high degree

201
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,791
of flexibility and adapt to
the situation as it unfolds.

202
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,791
[ULANHU] I find your answer
far too abstract, Commodore

203
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,666
[BEWCOCK] What you're saying
is we just bumble around

204
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,250
haphazardly and
hope for the best?

205
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,750
[FALK]
Hmm.

206
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,250
[LOBOS]
As Commodore Falk has stated,

207
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,500
the scale of this mission
is unprecedented.

208
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,916
There's no doubt an
ambitious operation like this

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,125
will give hope to Imperial
citizens and lead

210
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,333
to an overthrow of their
tyrannical government.

211
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,541
[FALK]
Thank you, Admiral.

212
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,375
Brilliantly spoken.

213
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,625
[YANG] I'd like to hear why
the invasion has been set

214
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,916
for this particular time.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,166
[FALK] For every battle there
is a moment of opportunity.

216
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,708
[YANG] So, in other words,
right now is the opportune time

217
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,500
for an offensive
against the Empire?

218
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,958
Is that what you're saying?

219
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,958
[FALK] No, Vice Admiral.
A grand offensive.

220
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,458
[FALK] The Imperial Navy
is in a state of confusion

221
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,125
and panic over the
loss of Iserlohn.

222
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,458
[FALK] With a gigantic
Alliance armada attacking in

223
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,541
a massive line under the banner
of freedom and justice.

224
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,458
There is no question
that this ends in anything

225
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,833
but victory for us.

226
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,791
[YANG] Problem is this
column formation takes us

227
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,750
too deep into enemy territory.

228
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,875
Advancing in a long line
will hinder communications

229
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,791
and supply distribution.

230
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,250
[YANG] Plus, the flanks
will be so thin that,

231
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,791
if the enemy attacks
us on the side,

232
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,125
they could easily
divide our forces.

233
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,708
[FALK] I fail to understand why
you only emphasize the risk

234
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,625
of us being divided.

235
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,500
An enemy brazen enough to enter
the middle of our formation

236
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,166
will be caught in a
pincer attack between

237
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,750
our front and rear forces.

238
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,916
[BEWCOCK]
Wait just a moment--

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,250
Vice Admiral Yang
brings up a valid point!

240
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,875
Do we want to repeat the mistake
at Astarte when we gave up

241
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,291
a chance at a concentrated
attack--and our fleets

242
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,208
were destroyed one-by-one?

243
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,708
[FALK] Such an idea could only
come from a noted tactician

244
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,000
like yourself, sir.

245
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,416
[BEWCOCK]
What do you mean by that?

246
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,333
[FALK] Strategically speaking,
if not tactically,

247
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,375
that battle wasn't
a defeat for the Alliance

248
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,375
because of what it accomplished.

249
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,250
[FALK] Ultimately our forces
drove away the Imperial Navy,

250
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,166
and thus prevented
a full-scale invasion

251
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,208
of the Astarte Starzone.

252
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,458
[BEWCOCK]
Oh, yes, quite the success.

253
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,291
[FALK] This operation has
a very different significance.

254
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,458
Instead of being on the defense,
we'll be taking the initiative,

255
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,791
leading an expedition
as a liberation force,

256
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,875
freeing people from oppression.

257
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,666
[ALEX]
If I may interject.

258
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,375
[SITHOLE]
Rear Admiral Caselnes.

259
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,875
[ALEX] As the logistics chief, I
have some misgivings with regard

260
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,916
to keeping our navy supplied
throughout this campaign.

261
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,333
[ALEX] Traveling in an extended
column formation on top

262
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,291
of managing the
territories we occupy as

263
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,041
a liberating force,
will quickly lead

264
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,166
to a shortage of provisions.

265
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,083
[LOBOS] Even if our
supplies are delayed a bit,

266
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,041
couldn't we simply have
the people of the territories

267
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,541
we are occupying
supply us as necessary?

268
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,875
[ALEX] Calculating unknown
variables and possibilities

269
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,250
is going to be difficult.

270
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,208
[LOBOS] Well, it's your job
so figure something out.

271
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,791
[YANG]
Excuse me.

272
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,083
The one commanding
the Imperial navy,

273
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,625
will likely be Count Lohengramm.

274
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,000
[YANG] Taking his
military skills into account,

275
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,125
when it comes to our strategy,
I think we should be formulating

276
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,791
a more cautious plan.

277
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,083
[GREENHILL]
Vice Admiral.

278
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,041
I understand you hold a
rather high opinion concerning

279
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,250
Count Lohengramm's abilities.

280
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,541
However, he is still young.
Even he must make mistakes.

281
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,875
[YANG] That may be true,
but in the end,

282
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,541
victory and defeat are
relative to one another.

283
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,750
[YANG] What I'm saying is, if we
were to make a bigger mistake

284
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,666
than he does,
it stands to reason

285
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,500
that he would win
and we would lose.

286
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,541
[FALK] That's nothing
more than speculation,

287
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,041
Vice Admiral.

288
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,875
To overestimate an enemy and
fear him more than necessary

289
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,708
is the greatest disgrace a
soldier could ever commit.

290
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,250
[FALK] It diminishes
your troops' morale

291
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,583
and negatively affects their
decision making skills

292
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,041
and battle performance,
which ultimately proves

293
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,375
beneficial to the enemy.

294
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,625
[BEWCOCK] The insinuation you
just made was disrespectful

295
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,416
and way out of line,
Commodore Falk!

296
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,625
[FALK]
I fail to see what you mean.

297
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,083
[BEWCOCK] Just because he didn't
agree with you and instead chose

298
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,708
to advise caution,
you have the gall to accuse him

299
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,541
of aiding and
abetting the enemy?

300
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,000
[FALK]
I was making a general statement

301
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,666
not directed at anyone.

302
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,583
I find it troublesome
you'd interpret my words

303
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,500
as slander against
an individual.

304
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,666
[FALK]
What we're doing is noble.

305
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,000
This expedition is about
rescuing and setting free

306
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,000
the 25,000,000,000 people
of the Galactic Empire,

307
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,666
who are suffering
under the oppression of

308
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,500
a tyrannical government.

309
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,666
[FALK] If we act as a
liberation force in the name

310
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,833
of the greater good,
the citizens of the Empire

311
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,916
will herald our
arrival with fanfare,

312
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,125
and cooperate with us willingly.

313
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,916
[YANG] What he's saying
is mere speculation.

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,750
It's a one-sided expectation.

315
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,958
What makes him think the
people of the Galactic Empire

316
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,250
desire the illusion of
freedom and equality

317
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,833
rather than genuine peace?

318
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,125
[YANG]
The idea of this expedition

319
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,500
was irresponsible enough,
but it's execution

320
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,500
is proving down right negligent.

321
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,625
[JULIAN] Then they shouldn't
go through with it.

322
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,000
[YANG]
Hmm?

323
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,791
[JULIAN] Even if it was
ordered by the High Council,

324
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,333
what they're proposing
is too reckless.

325
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,750
[YANG] That maybe true, but the
politicians in our government

326
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,666
were legitimately
elected to their offices

327
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,875
by 13,000,000,000 citizens.

328
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,333
No matter how reckless,
we can't refuse their decision

329
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,208
to go through with this mission.

330
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,750
[YANG] Not as long as we're
a free military in a country

331
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,666
that celebrates the
ideals of democracy.

332
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,833
[JULIAN]
Hmm.

333
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,250
[FALK] Any geographical
advantage or greater numbers

334
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,250
than ours, or even if they
have some new weapon

335
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:51,208
of unimaginable power, we cannot
let such things discourage us.

336
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,041
[SITHOLE]
I can't say I saw this coming.

337
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,250
I thought if we could
capture Iserlohn,

338
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,666
the flames of war would
subside, and yet here we are.

339
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,458
[SITHOLE] You could call
it just desserts as far as

340
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,791
I'm concerned, but I've made
a real mess for you, haven't I?

341
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,083
[SITHOLE]
I never thought I would say

342
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,291
something like this, but I'm
afraid that the best outcome

343
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,750
we can hope for is for
this expedition to fail

344
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,375
with minimal casualties.

345
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,333
An overwhelming defeat
would cause too much bloodshed,

346
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,583
but what happens
if we win instead?

347
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,833
The war hawks get
cocky and demand more.

348
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,750
Eventually ending up beyond
the control of the government

349
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,708
and the people.

350
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,541
[SITHOLE]
Soon after, riots break out,

351
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,083
and the country
hits rock bottom.

352
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,666
[SITHOLE] Search history
books and you'll find

353
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,333
countless civilizations
that have fallen into ruin

354
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,125
all because they won
a particular battle

355
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,750
they shouldn't have.

356
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,958
But I'm sure you
know all about that.

357
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,500
[YANG]
Yes.

358
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,000
[SITHOLE] Your knowledge of
the past has given you contempt

359
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,916
for authority and military
power, and I don't blame you.

360
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But no nation can exist
without the presence

361
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,541
of both those factors.

362
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,916
[SITHOLE]
And since that's the case,

363
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,166
that power should be placed
in the hands of honest

364
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,041
and competent individuals,
so the state can be reined in

365
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:15,833
by reason, and not ruled by
the whims of the corrupt.

366
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,750
[SITHOLE]
I myself am a mere soldier.

367
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,375
I won't speak of politics.

368
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,791
However, as far as the armed
forces are concerned.

369
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,791
[SITHOLE]
That man, Commodore Falk.

370
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,000
He's not to be trusted.

371
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,833
[YANG grunts]

372
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,291
[SITHOLE] He's pushing
this operation in hopes

373
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,750
it leads him to a promotion.

374
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,208
It wouldn't surprise
me if he wants to reach

375
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,791
the highest rank the
military has to offer.

376
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,166
But at present,
his rival is too strong.

377
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,666
So he's acting out
of desperation to make

378
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,125
a name for himself.

379
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,458
[YANG]
I see.

380
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,333
[SITHOLE] You can be
exceedingly dense at times.

381
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,625
[YANG]
Huh?

382
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,166
[SITHOLE] The rival
I was referring to is you,

383
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,333
Vice Admiral Yang.

384
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,708
[YANG] I'm sorry,
but I'm not really worth

385
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,458
being called anyone's "rival."

386
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,000
[SITHOLE] It doesn't have
anything to do with

387
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,083
how you may
evaluate yourself.

388
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,416
The issue is more of a matter
of what Commodore Falk

389
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,750
thinks of you.

390
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,958
[SITHOLE]
You must have grasped something

391
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,166
of the man's
personality from today.

392
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,208
He'd rather display his
talent through eloquence

393
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,416
than actual accomplishments
and won't think twice

394
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,583
about belittling others to
make himself look better.

395
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,583
[SITHOLE] However, he
doesn't have as much talent

396
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,166
as he thinks he does.

397
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,208
I believe it's much too
dangerous to entrust the lives

398
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,291
of 30,000,000 men to him.

399
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,666
[SITHOLE]
I think you understand by now

400
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,541
why I rejected your resignation.

401
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,291
[SITHOLE]
It's not like I foresaw

402
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,875
our present circumstances,
but as a result of them,

403
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,750
your presence in
the military has become

404
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,666
even more important than before.

405
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,041
[YANG]
So what you're saying

406
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,708
is you want me to do what I can
to oppose Commodore Falk?

407
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,541
[SITHOLE]
Falk isn't the only one.

408
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,500
When you reach the highest
position in the service,

409
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,750
you'll be able to restrict
or remove people like him

410
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:51,041
altogether without having to
explain yourself to others.

411
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,458
That is the trajectory I'm
hoping your career takes.

412
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,416
[YANG]
First Iserlohn and now this.

413
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,833
I'm beginning to think
you enjoy giving me

414
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,958
impossible tasks, Chief.

415
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,833
[SITHOLE]
No one but you can do it.

416
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,875
[YANG] I'll always consider
myself a man of discretion.

417
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,333
I don't seek out
opportunities for heroics.

418
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,416
[YANG ] While I want to do a job
within the range of my ability.

419
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,833
Is still want to live
an easy life.

420
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,791
I don't think you could call
that a lazy way of thinking.

421
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,416
[SITHOLE]
I would. Incredibly lazy.

422
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,333
[SITHOLE]
Hmph.

423
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,375
[YANG gasps]

424
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,875
[SITHOLE]
It's not much fun working hard

425
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,583
and seeing other
people live easy.

426
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,958
[SITHOLE] If I'm going
to trust you with this,

427
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,958
then I'll need you
to experience difficulty

428
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,958
in proportion to your talent.

429
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,666
To do otherwise would
be unfair to the both of us.

430
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,958
[YANG]
Unfair, huh? I'll say.

431
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,666
[SITHOLE] Sorry for keeping
you so late. Let's go.

432
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,500
[REINHARD] As I'm sure
you're all aware,

433
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,125
the insurgents of the frontier,
who call themselves

434
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,375
the Free Planets Alliance,
have hijacked and occupied

435
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,500
the Imperial frontline
base of Iserlohn.

436
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,375
[REINHARD] What you don't
know is that we have reports

437
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,083
the enemy is amassing
an enormous force there.

438
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:22,708
By our estimates, 200,000 ships,
and 30,000,000 troops.

439
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,958
[gasping]

440
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,375
[REINHARD] The rebels plan
to advance towards

441
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,125
the center of the Empire.

442
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,458
Once there, they will
launch an all-out attack.

443
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,458
[REINHARD] Obviously,
this is a troubling development.

444
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,583
I have been given the task of
intercepting them.

445
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,916
[REINHARD] I anticipate
the order at any time.

446
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I expect you all
to fight bravely.

447
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,083
[REINHARD]
As for the other fleets.

448
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,750
They are mere puppets,
ornaments of the palace.

449
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,583
They can't be depended
upon for this fight.

450
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,083
[REINHARD] This is an
opportunity for you all

451
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,541
to move up in the ranks.

452
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,166
[MEN]
Hmph.

453
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,458
[REINHARD] Now, I'd like
to hear your opinions.

454
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,125
Tell me what you think
is the best method

455
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,041
for intercepting the rebels.

456
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,458
Hold nothing back.

457
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,416
[BITTENFELD] The moment
they exit the Iserlohn Corridor,

458
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,750
we strike them down.

459
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,833
It's the quickest and
most efficient method.

460
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,208
[MITTERMEYER]
I agree.

461
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,083
We can determine where
the enemy will emerge from

462
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,458
and then we either
strike them head-on

463
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,791
or form a half-encirclement
instead.

464
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,500
The insurgents
will turn tail and run

465
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,708
before they even get an inch
inside Imperial territory.

466
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,958
I commend your spirit, men.

467
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,791
However, they will be expecting
us to intercept them as soon

468
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,500
as they leave the corridor.

469
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,291
It's likely they'll
position their best men

470
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,875
on the front line.

471
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:39,291
And if we defeat them, the rest
may never exit that corridor.

472
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,333
Meaning we can't
launch an offensive.

473
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,000
[gasping]

474
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,791
An offensive?

475
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,541
You mean, you're not
satisfied simply forcing

476
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,250
the insurgents into a retreat?

477
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,833
Obviously.

478
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,958
Their foolhardiness should
be rewarded with bloodshed

479
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,208
in equal proportions.

480
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,333
What exactly are you proposing?

481
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,500
We will draw
the enemy in deeper.

482
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,458
[gasping]

483
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,166
Pardon, Your Excellency,

484
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,916
but we're to allow rebels
to enter our territory?

485
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,500
Correct.

486
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,375
Once their combat and
supply lines are stretched

487
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,791
to the limit, we hit them
with everything we have.

488
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:21,125
They'll be sending
60% of their forces.

489
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:25,166
We'll destroy all of them,
crippling their military might,

490
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,958
and the will of the rebellion.

491
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,000
[gasping]

492
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,000
[REINHARD]
Oberstein.

493
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,500
[OBERSTEIN]
Yes, sir.

494
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,375
[OBERSTEIN] Allow me
to summarize our current

495
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,291
combat strategy for you.

496
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,291
[NARRATOR]
Three months had passed since

497
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,958
the fall of Iserlohn Fortress.

498
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:53,041
And once again, the Galactic
Empire and the Free Planets

499
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,375
Alliance were preparing
their forces to meet

500
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,333
each other on
the field of battle.

501
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:05,666
[NARRATOR] On August 22,
of the year UC 796,

502
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,833
the Free Planets Alliance
expeditionary force established

503
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:12,833
its command headquarters
within Iserlohn Fortress.

504
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,458
Thirty million Alliance soldiers

505
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,208
from the capital of Heinessen
and surrounding star systems

506
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,916
assembled columns
of warships and set out

507
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,125
towards Imperial territory.

508
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,666
