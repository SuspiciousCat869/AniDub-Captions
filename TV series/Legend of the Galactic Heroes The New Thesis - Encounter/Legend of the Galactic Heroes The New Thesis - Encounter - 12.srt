1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,125
[YANG] What a tragedy
this turned out to be.

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,750
[FREDERICA] There's no way
we can build mutual trust

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:17,000
with the people. Not now.

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:20,333
[YANG] Even if I knew it
would guarantee us victory.

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,958
I could never bring myself
to be this thorough.

6
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:28,083
[YANG] Well done indeed,
Count Lohengramm.

7
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,125
[REINHARD] Our navy will take
back the captured territory.

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,208
Furthermore, our supply
corps will provide food

9
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,541
to the civilians.

10
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,958
[REINHARD] As for those
arrogant insurgents.

11
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,875
Let none escape death.

12
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,958
[REINHARD] I expect
the best from all of you.

13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,875
[REINHARD]
Let's toast, Prosit!

14
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,500
[MITTERMEYER]
We toast, Prosit!

15
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,291
[BITTENFELD]
We toast, Prosit!

16
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,166
[SOLDIER 12A]
Enemy cargo fleet located.

17
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,833
They're moving along the
standard Imperial route

18
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,416
within possible warp range.

19
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,416
[SCOTT]
That's checkmate.

20
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,750
[speaker buzzes]

21
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,875
[NIKOLSKY] Sir, report to
the bridge immediately.

22
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,083
[SCOTT]
Hmm?

23
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,666
[SCOTT] What is it?
Did something happen

24
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,250
on the front line?

25
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,833
[NIKOLSKY] Hate to break it to
you, but we are the front line!

26
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,416
Just take a look at
what's headed our way!

27
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,750
[SOLDIER 12B]
Ships approaching!

28
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,250
Looks like an Imperial fleet!

29
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:20,375
There's eight--No, ten.
Wait, 15. Over 20,000 ships!

30
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,875
[SCOTT]
Impossible!

31
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,875
[SCOTT] They sent such
a huge force against

32
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,875
a mere supply convoy?

33
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,458
[SCOTT]
That doesn't make sense.

34
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,625
[SOLDIER 12C]
Message from Admiral Kircheis.

35
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,500
The enemy's supply
convoy is destroyed.

36
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,125
[SOLDIER 12C] The only
damage sustained on our side

37
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,750
was a single ship.

38
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,000
[CREW murmuring]

39
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,666
[OBERSTEIN]
We have succeed in cutting off

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,041
the enemy's supply line,
Your Excellency.

41
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,250
[REINHARD]
Connect me with my admirals.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,333
[REINHARD] We are moving forward
with the rest of our plan.

43
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,375
Strike the rebels
with full force.

44
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,583
[MEN]
Sir!

45
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,166
[CHEN] We've been unable
to contact to the patrol ship

46
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,583
since it notified us that the
enemy fleet was located.

47
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,791
[ULANHU]
They're coming.

48
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,375
I want you to send a
message to headquarters

49
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,625
and all fleet
admirals immediately.

50
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,000
Tell them we have
encountered Imperial forces.

51
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,583
[CHEN]
Sir!

52
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,875
[ULANHU] If only we had made up
our minds to withdraw sooner,

53
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,250
we wouldn't be in this mess.

54
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,916
[ULANHU]
Send word to every ship!

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,833
Prepare for fleet action!

56
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,708
[BITTENFELD]
Heh.

57
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,250
[CHEN]
The enemy has begun firing.

58
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,083
Most likely from a blind spot
behind the planet.

59
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,375
[ULANHU] Unity trumps
geographical advantage.

60
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,250
--[CHEN] Hmm.
--[explosions]

61
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,875
[ULANHU] The Thirteenth
will be here soon enough

62
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,416
to bail us out of this mess.

63
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,291
We're talking about
Miracle Yang.

64
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,583
Victory is guaranteed.

65
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,875
[NARRATOR] At that same time,
the Imperial Navy was attacking

66
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,833
each fleet of the Alliance's
expeditionary force separately.

67
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,333
[AL-SALEM] Go full
defensive and retreat, now!

68
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,708
[MORTON]
Sir!

69
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,625
[BEWCOCK] Did we miss
our window for a withdrawal?

70
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,000
With our line
stretched out so far,

71
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,125
there's not a chance
we can keep it supplied.

72
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,833
At this rate, we won't be able
to hold out much longer.

73
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,291
[FREDERICA]
Message from Admiral Ulanhu.

74
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,833
"At 1607 standard
Alliance time,

75
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,541
my fleet will engage with
the Imperial forces."

76
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,083
[YANG]
So it's finally started.

77
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,250
[MURAI] The Thirteenth's
withdrawal from

78
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,416
the occupied territory
is complete.

79
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,291
Shall we move
out of the area, sir?

80
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,250
[YANG] We're going to
stay right where we are.

81
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,500
[gasping]

82
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,041
[YANG] Due to the heavy
gases in this starzone,

83
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,083
the range for optical weapons
is going to be diminished.

84
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,000
We'll confuse the enemy with
close combat and watch for

85
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,208
our chance to break out.

86
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,750
[sighing]

87
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,791
[YANG] Have the Spartanians
on stand by, ready to launch.

88
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,083
[MURAI]
Yes sir.

89
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,458
[POPLIN] This is our first
battle since joining

90
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,125
the Thirteenth, so let's
put on a good show for 'em.

91
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,708
[HUGHES] I was wondering
if we'd get to do anything

92
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,333
before shipping back home.

93
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,000
[SHAKELY]
I could use the workout.

94
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,833
I was starting to
feel outta shape.

95
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,125
[KONEV]
Hmph.

96
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,541
[POPLIN] Well, fellas, ready to
show everyone what the guys from

97
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,666
the 88 Independent
Air Combat unit can do?

98
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,791
[POPLIN]
Let's get this over with fast.

99
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,916
Keep the champagne
on ice for us.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,500
[SOLDIER 12D]
You know we don't have any.

101
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,083
You'll be lucky to get
water at this point.

102
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,666
[POPLIN]
Heh. Man, what a buzzkill.

103
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,041
[SOLDIER 12D]
Permission to launch.

104
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,250
[POPLIN]
Roger. We're out.

105
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,791
[POPLIN]
You're mine!

106
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,125
[POPLIN]
I missed? I never miss!

107
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,208
[HUGHES]
Why isn't the output increasing?

108
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,375
Damn it!

109
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,583
[HUGHES grunting]

110
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,333
[POPLIN]
Hughes!

111
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,666
Margin of error is seven,
no, eight degrees?

112
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,291
[HUGHES gasps]

113
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,458
[POPLIN gasps]

114
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,416
[SHAKELY]
No, the airframe is...

115
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,541
[KONEV]
Shakely, don't push it.

116
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,041
Return to base at once.

117
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,541
[SHAKELY]
They've locked on to me!

118
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,083
[POPLIN growls]

119
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,583
[POPLIN growls]

120
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,625
[POPLIN] My firing line was
off nine to 12 degrees,

121
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,583
you bastard!

122
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,875
Lasers don't work out there,
so with my machine gun useless,

123
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,500
I might as well have
been fighting unarmed!

124
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,041
[TODA]
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,416
You'll have to forgive me if
the maintenance was faulty,

126
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,250
but ever since our supplies
were cut off, us mechanics

127
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,041
haven't had anything
to eat or drink.

128
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,333
[TODA] Unlike you and the
rest of the Spartanians.

129
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,500
[gasps]

130
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,416
[POPLIN] Fair enough.
I apologize for being rude.

131
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,166
I need my machine gun
adjusted right away.

132
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,250
Can you do that for me?

133
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,416
[KONEV] Both Hughes and
Shakely were killed.

134
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,791
It's going to be
a vicious battle.

135
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,791
We'll be counting on all of you!

136
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,833
[POPLIN] As soon as maintenance
is done, we're going back out

137
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,625
[CREW]
Sir!

138
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,583
[TODA] I'll calibrate
it right this time.

139
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,958
[POPLIN gasps]

140
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,916
[TODA] So please, Lieutenant,
win this one for us.

141
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,166
[POPLIN]
Sure.

142
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,958
We're gonna show those
Imperials we're a force

143
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,083
to be reckoned with,
don't you worry.

144
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,541
After all, we're the Thirteenth
Fleet Air Combat Unit.

145
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,041
[SOLDIER 12E]
The enemy has fired

146
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,208
a high-output energy blast!
Impact Imminent!

147
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,583
[SOLDIER 12F] Destruction
of enemy ship confirmed.

148
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,625
Long-range attack successful.

149
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,416
[LUTZ] Eighty percent of their
ships are already immobilized.

150
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,416
[LUTZ]
Hmm...

151
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,666
[SOLDIERS yell]

152
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:16,916
[BORODIN sighs]

153
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,458
[BEWCOCK] I want all of
our ships to move forward

154
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,708
to the front and
go full defensive!

155
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,791
Deploy all cruisers taking
refuge at the rear

156
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,375
to both flanks and fire!
Hit them from all directions!

157
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,208
[BEWCOCK]
Hold formation and don't panic!

158
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,541
We have to keep
our escape route open!

159
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,208
[BEWCOCK] This opponent
doesn't look like one

160
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,916
who'll give up victory easily.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
[REUENTHAL] Well,
at least they're providing

162
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,833
a challenge for me.

163
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,458
[SOLDIER 12I] Imperial fleet
approaching, starboard side!

164
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,708
The enemy is within
physical firing range!

165
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,125
[MORTON]
They're what?

166
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,291
How's it possible their datalink
is functioning already?

167
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,666
It's too soon!

168
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,250
[AL-SALEM] It couldn't
be. Is that you, Gale Wolf?

169
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,666
[MITTERMEYER] Don't be impatient
and get too close to them.

170
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,375
They might counter when
we're least expecting it.

171
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,666
[MITTERMEYER] But then again,
that's assuming the rebels

172
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
have someone in charge
whose fleet management

173
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,583
is actually worth a damn.

174
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,541
[SOLDIER 12L] The enemy fleet
is leaving the theater!

175
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,291
[SOLDIER 12K]
We've lost 90% of our men.

176
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,666
Organized battle is no longer
a possibility, Admiral.

177
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,708
[HAWOOD] We were a flagship,
and yet we were discarded

178
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,000
without being so
much as a threat.

179
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,458
[EUGEN] We have taken control
of this sector of space.

180
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,416
Dominion is entirely ours.

181
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,125
[BITTENFELD] So tell me,
Captain, what's preventing us

182
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,333
from annihilating
them altogether?

183
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,666
[BITTENFELD]
Close in.

184
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,708
[EUGEN gasps]

185
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,000
[BITTENFELD]
Be thorough about it.

186
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,208
[EUGEN]
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,291
[CHEN] We only have about
a thousand ships left

188
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,833
that can fight and
that's including this one.

189
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,583
We can't continue this battle
any longer, Admiral.

190
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,500
[CHEN] The only choices we have
are surrendering and fleeing.

191
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,833
[ULANHU] That's certainly
a disgraceful pair of options.

192
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:51,000
Right? Surrendering isn't
my style, so we'll flee.

193
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,750
[ULANHU] Tell me, are there
any fleet commodores among

194
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,666
the remaining ships who
haven't been killed yet?

195
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,958
[CHEN] Commodore Attenborough
is still alive.

196
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,458
[ULANHU] I'm going to open up an
escape route for us, Commodore.

197
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,500
You will lead any ships that can
no longer fight in a retreat,

198
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,875
do you understand?

199
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,958
[ATTENBOROUGH]
Admiral Ulanhu, sir.

200
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,416
[ULANHU] No arguments.
I'm counting on you.

201
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,666
[SOLDIER 12L]
Bearing: 2 o' clock.

202
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,000
All ships, maximum battle speed!

203
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,791
[ULANHU]
Follow us, and stay close!

204
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,166
[BITTENFELD]
What?

205
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,500
[CHEN] Brilliant! The
escape route, it's opened up!

206
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,583
[grunting]

207
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,416
[ULANHU]
What's the status of our allies?

208
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,041
[CHEN] About half of
our remaining ships

209
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,458
got through safely.

210
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,916
[ULANHU]
I see.

211
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,916
[NARRATOR]
After a fierce offensive from

212
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,416
the Imperial Navy, what was left
of the Alliance expeditionary

213
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,875
force found itself at an
overwhelming disadvantage.

214
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,250
However...

215
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,000
[POPLIN growls]

216
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,250
[NARRATOR]
Amidst the destruction,

217
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,833
there was one exception.

218
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,583
Yang's Thirteenth Fleet.

219
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,791
[LUBITSCH] The enemy air
combat unit's torpedo attack

220
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,083
did immense damage.

221
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,875
We won't be able
to hold formation.

222
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,041
[KEMPFF grunts] Are you
saying we should give in

223
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,416
to the rebel forces'
insolent tactics?

224
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,166
[LUBITSCH] I'm saying we
should deal with the situation

225
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,958
before it ends in disgrace.

226
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,958
[KEMPFF] Obviously we
should pull back and regroup

227
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,500
so we can attack further!

228
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,375
[KEMPFF] Prepare for the
enemy's pursuit and withdraw

229
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,083
all our ships immediately!

230
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,958
[SOLDIER 12M]
The enemy fleet is retreating!

231
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,000
[PATRICHEV] Will we take this
opportunity to pursue them?

232
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,250
[YANG]
We won't.

233
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,291
Even if we were to push
ourselves and win here,

234
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,625
it wouldn't stop the enemy from
having the overall advantage.

235
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,416
There's only one course of
action we can take right now.

236
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,666
[YANG]
All ships, retreat.

237
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,083
[FREDERICA]
Sir!

238
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,500
[NARRATOR] Having escaped
Admiral Kempff's Imperial fleet,

239
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,458
Yang Wen-Li's Thirteenth
continued their retreat,

240
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,291
setting a course to
return to headquarters

241
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,208
at Iserlohn Fortress.

242
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,625
[FREDERICA] Report from
the lead patrol ship.

243
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,333
Multiple vessels have
been sighted ahead

244
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,125
with no call signs detected.

245
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,958
[PATRICHEV] It's probably
Vice Admiral Hawood and

246
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,041
the Seventh Fleet being
that they're assigned

247
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,625
to that sector.

248
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,041
[FREDERICA] There are too many
ships for it to be the Seventh.

249
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,583
[YANG]
How big of a force?

250
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,125
[FREDERICA] Roughly three
times the size of our fleet.

251
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,625
[YANG]
That's the enemy.

252
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,583
[MURAI] We have to assume
Admiral Hawood and the rest

253
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,083
of the Seventh have
already been defeated.

254
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,333
[SOLDIER 12N]
Report, sir!

255
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,416
We've lost communication
with the patrol ship!

256
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,583
[WALTER] Sounds to me
like it was captured.

257
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,583
[YANG sighs]

258
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,958
[SOLDIER 12O]
Rebel fleet located.

259
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,208
They number approximately
ten thousand!

260
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,791
[VOLKER] Comparing it
to the report submitted

261
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,750
by Admiral Kempff, they match.
It's most likely the Thirteenth.

262
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,416
[BERGENGRÜN]
Under Yang Wen-li?

263
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,875
[REINHARD]
A clever man.

264
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,291
He just might be the sort of
adversary you spoke of earlier.

265
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,750
[VOLKER] There's no way
we can miss the opportunity

266
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,333
to attack him.
All ships, maximum battle speed.

267
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,916
[SOLDIER 12O]
Command to all ships.

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,833
Maximum battle speed.

269
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,333
[MURAI] We have no choice now
except to engage with them.

270
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,333
[YANG] Looks like it's time to
put our plan into motion.

271
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,458
[GREENHILL] Since we received
word that they had encountered

272
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,583
the Imperials, none of
the information gathered

273
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,125
makes any sense.

274
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,958
[GREENHILL] The Third, Seventh,
Tenth and Twelfth Fleets

275
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,958
have so far been unable
to communicate with us.

276
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,916
[GREENHILL] The Fifth, Eighth,
Ninth, and Thirteenth Fleets

277
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,250
all still appear to be alive
and well, but we're unable

278
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,375
to get detailed reports
from any of them yet.

279
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,458
[LOBOS]
Hmm...

280
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,875
[LOBOS] The High Council has
been clear with their desires.

281
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,125
This expedition cannot
simply end with a loss

282
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,666
for the Alliance forces.

283
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,458
[GREENHILL]
What are you suggesting?

284
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,541
[LOBOS] We'll reorganize what's
left of the scattered fleets

285
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,666
and meet the enemy's attack
with our own offensive.

286
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,041
Relay the message
to the entire navy.

287
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,041
[GREENHILL gasps]

288
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,625
[LOBOS]
Is something wrong?

289
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,000
[GREENHILL] Well I was just
wondering if we have enough

290
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,208
forces left at the front line
for that kind of maneuver.

291
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,791
[GREENHILL]
Even if we did reorganize,

292
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,166
the enemy still outnumbers us.

293
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,833
So, rather than
improve the situation,

294
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,500
we would suffer even
greater losses.

295
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,791
[LOBOS] Tell the navy
to rendezvous at

296
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,500
the Amritsar Starzone
and prepare for battle.

297
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,833
[GREENHILL]
You're joking!

298
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,125
[LOBOS]
That was an order.

299
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,416
[GREENHILL growls]

300
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,125
[MURAI] The enemy is pushing us
back with mainstay equipment

301
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,875
in superior numbers, all while
supplying their forces

302
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,416
from the rear and
hitting our ships

303
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
with uninterrupted firepower.

304
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,583
[YANG sighs]

305
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:29,375
[YANG] We should use
a cautious strategy. Afterall...

306
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,750
I hear Count Lohengramm has
himself a brilliant subordinate.

307
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,541
[FREDERICA] An urgent coded
message from headquarters.

308
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,000
[YANG]
Read it to me.

309
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,666
[FREDERICA]
"Concentrate forces at point A

310
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,291
in the Amritsar Starzone on
the 14th of the current month.

311
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,708
"You are to cease combat
at once and change course"

312
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,500
[BEWCOCK]
Little late for that!

313
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,625
If retreat were that easy, then
we would have done it by now.

314
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,750
[YANG]
He says that like it's simple.

315
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,750
[MURAI]
What will you do, Admiral?

316
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,291
[YANG] Reorganize the fleet
into line-ahead formation,

317
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,208
deploy a group of dreadnought
battleships at the rear,

318
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,750
and create a diversion while we
find a way to leave the front.

319
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,416
[YANG] Our goal now is
to turn the fleet around

320
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,458
and proceed towards
Amritsar to regroup.

321
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,875
I want you to view
leaving the front as

322
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,041
the only tactical objective
we need to accomplish.

323
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,625
[YANG]
Given our limited options,

324
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,541
the enemy has probably already
guessed what we're going to do.

325
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,708
[WALTER]
If this doesn't work,

326
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,791
I doubt that anything
else we try will.

327
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,958
[MURAI] There's no denying
it's the best option available

328
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,416
to us at the moment.

329
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,791
[PATRICHEV]
Yes, I agree.

330
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,791
[YANG] The enemy has
three times our numbers,

331
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,583
we'll almost certainly
suffer damages ourselves,

332
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,375
but I want us to minimize
them as best we can.

333
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,500
[YANG] I'm going to be
counting on all of you.

334
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,625
[GROUP]
Hmm.

335
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:16,458
[inaudible]

336
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,041
[MURAI] We're sustaining
heavy causalities,

337
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,875
the likes of which
we've never seen.

338
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,750
[PATRICHEV] But we're
almost out of the weeds.

339
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,625
[alarm sounds]

340
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,416
[SOLDIER 12P] Multiple
incoming ships detected.

341
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,583
--[MURAI] More ships?
--[PATRICHEV] What.

342
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,625
You mean the enemy had
a detached force?

343
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,041
[SOLDIER 12N]
We've ID'd their call sign!

344
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,208
[YANG]
Hmm.

345
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,541
[SOLDIER 12N] It's Admiral
Hawood and the Seventh Fleet!

346
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,625
[BERGENGRÜN]
Look.

347
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,500
[HAWOOD] We'll provide
backup for the Thirteenth Fleet

348
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,958
as they withdraw!

349
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,625
Don't worry about how much
energy we've got left!

350
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,875
[HAWOOD] Hit 'em
with everything we've got!

351
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,333
[SOLDIERS yelling]

352
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:44,583
[HAWOOD] Don't you make the
wrong choice, Yang Wen-li.

353
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,916
[PATRICHEV] This is our
chance to launch an attack!

354
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,291
[YANG]
Continue with the retreat.

355
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,958
[PATRICHEV]
They'll be killed!

356
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,666
[WALTER] There's no denying
it's a tough decision to make,

357
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,666
but it is the right one.

358
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,458
[OBERSTEIN] Though the enemy
is continuing to retreat,

359
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,583
they're doing so in
an orderly fashion.

360
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,083
It would appear
their destination is

361
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,083
the Amritsar Starzone.

362
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,333
[REINHARD]
Which is close to the entrance

363
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,291
for the Iserlohn Corridor.

364
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,875
However... I doubt they're
merely fleeing there.

365
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,541
What do you think their plan is?

366
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,291
[OBERSTEIN] I suspect they're
gathering their strength

367
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,666
so they can launch an offensive.

368
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,500
Knowing that, Your
Excellency, now what?

369
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:42,541
[REINHARD] Obviously, our navy
will gather at Amritsar as well.

370
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:46,375
Tell me, why should we deny
the rebels their final wish?

371
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,625
If they've chosen Amritsar as
their graveyard, so be it.

372
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,875
[NARRATOR] On October
14th, in the 487th year

373
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:01,375
of the Imperial calendar,
otherwise known as UC 796,

374
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,583
the Galactic Imperial
Navy set a course

375
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,000
for the Amritsar Starzone.

376
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,250
The location selected by
the Free Planets Alliance

377
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,916
for a decisive battle.

378
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,250
[NARRATOR] Yang Wen-li and
Reinhard von Lohengramm.

379
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,916
Both heroes' paths
will cross again,

380
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,041
when they encounter
each other next.

381
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,958
at the Battle of Amritsar.

382
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,208
