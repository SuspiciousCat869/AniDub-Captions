[MAN 11A grunts]

2
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,583
[SOLDIER 11A]
All of the nobles have fled.

3
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,791
Only the civilians remain
on the planets, Admiral.

4
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,333
[APPLETON] It looks like the
Empire is being extra cautious.

5
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,250
Losing Iserlohn
taught them well.

6
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,208
[SOLDIER 11B] We're part of a
liberation force.

7
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,041
You don't have to suffer
under the oppression

8
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,875
of tyranny any longer.

9
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,541
The Free Planets Alliance
happily welcomes

10
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,541
every one of you.

11
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,000
[CONNALLY] Word is that the
citizens are accepting us.

12
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,916
There aren't any
signs of resistance.

13
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,875
[BORODIN] I never thought the
occupation would be this easy.

14
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,916
Is it the same way
for the other fleets?

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,458
[CONNALLY]
It appears so.

16
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,333
But, well...

17
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,000
[SOLDIER 11C] You'll have
complete political authority

18
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,750
over yourselves as you
begin new lives as citizens

19
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,750
of a democratic society
free from tyranny.

20
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,500
[OLD MAN 11A] Excuse me,
but before you give us

21
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,416
this "political authority,"

22
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,958
could you please provide
some bread and milk for us?

23
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,250
[SOLDIER 11C] Oh. Of course
we'll provide food.

24
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,166
We'll arrange it right away.

25
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,000
[MAN 11B] There's nothing
here for us to eat.

26
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,916
Not even milk for my baby.

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,458
[MAN 11A] Just give us
anything! We're starving!

28
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,541
[gasps]

29
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,208
[OLD MAN 11A]
What're you waiting for?

30
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,458
[YANG sighs]

31
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,458
[FREDERICA]
Admiral.

32
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,000
[YANG]
Hmm?

33
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,375
[FREDERICA] We've received a
message from the ground force.

34
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,791
[YANG]
What does it say?

35
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,500
[FREDERICA] They're requesting
we send food reserves

36
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,833
to distribute among the
liberated citizens immediately.

37
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,625
[YANG] All right, then.
We'll arrange for it right away.

38
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,791
[FREDERICA]
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,375
[ALEX] Could you read that
report for me one more time?

40
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,041
[ADJUTANT 11A] "To permanently
rescue the locals from

41
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,166
starvation requires
the following.

42
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,750
One hundred eighty days'
worth of food

43
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,291
for 50,000,000 people,
40 artificial protein

44
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,875
production factories,
and 60 hydroponics plants.

45
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,875
[ADJUTANT 11A] These numbers
are expected to rise--

46
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,666
as the liberated territory
continues to gradually expand."

47
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,666
[ALEX] That's 10,000,000 tons
of grain alone,

48
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,833
which would take 50 cargo ships
in the 200,000 class.

49
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,583
I'd like to meet someone
who could come up with a

50
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,541
supply plan to feed twice as
many people as our whole navy.

51
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,083
[ADJUTANT 11A] Maybe if we
were to empty every warehouse

52
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,666
--in Iserlohn we could--
--[ALEX] It wouldn't be enough.

53
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,666
We'd run out in
the blink of an eye.

54
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,250
[ALEX]
Sorry to interrupt.

55
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,625
[LOBOS]
Ah, you're here.

56
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,041
I heard there's a matter you
wished to discuss with me.

57
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,875
Keep it short, if you could.

58
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,458
[ALEX] Very well.
I'll be extremely brief.

59
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,875
You see, our navy is
on the verge of facing

60
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,541
a very serious crisis.

61
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,833
[LOBOS]
What crisis do you mean?

62
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,333
What is this about?

63
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,875
[ALEX]
The request from the front line.

64
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,041
I assume that
you're aware of it.

65
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,375
[LOBOS]
Of course I am.

66
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,416
While it is certainly
an excessive demand,

67
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,208
our occupation policy
leaves us without

68
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,083
any other option on the table.

69
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,958
[ALEX] Iserlohn doesn't have the
quantities they're requesting.

70
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,875
[LOBOS] So just forward the
damn thing back to Heinessen.

71
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,666
No doubt the bureaucrats
will squabble,

72
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,916
but there isn't any chance our
politicians would deny us food.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,083
[ALEX] Yes, sir. I'm positive
they'll send what we ask for,

74
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,416
however, I'm unsure how
long they could keep it up.

75
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,750
[ALEX]
The enemy wants this.

76
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,000
They're putting strain on
our capacity to resupply

77
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,500
the front line.

78
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,750
Which means without question,
they're going to launch--

79
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,833
[FALK]
Without question.

80
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,875
The Empire will
attack our transport,

81
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,166
in an effort to prevent supplies
from reaching our troops.

82
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,208
[FALK] I mean, that is what you
were about to say, am I correct?

83
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,625
[ALEX]
Right on the nose.

84
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,083
[FALK] There are 500
light years between Iserlohn

85
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,291
and the front line.

86
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,500
And we're in control
of that entire region.

87
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,083
I don't think there's any
reason for us to worry.

88
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,291
[FALK] Rear Admiral,
we are fighting this war

89
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,166
in the name of the greater good.

90
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,166
Did you really expect us
to achieve victory

91
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,708
without taking any risks?

92
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,958
[ALEX] That is not what
I came here to discuss!

93
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,125
[LOBOS] Enough. I don't
have the time to listen

94
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,583
to you wax on
about your cowardice.

95
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,916
You're dismissed.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,291
[ALEX sighs] I've said
everything I need to say

97
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,958
to you anyway.

98
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,291
Good day, sir.

99
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,708
[ALEX]
Yang, please come back alive.

100
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,416
This battle is
too idiotic to die for.

101
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,291
[NARRATOR] After receiving the
massive request for supplies

102
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,375
from the front line,
the High Council

103
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,750
was thrown into turmoil.

104
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,625
[NARRATOR] Those who
favored continuing the war,

105
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,708
represented by
Councilwoman Windsor,

106
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,291
were locked in
a fierce verbal battle

107
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,916
with Finance Chairman Lebello,
who wished to withdraw troops.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,375
However...

109
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,750
[SANFORD] I will now announce
the results of the vote.

110
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:49,625
Four in favor, five opposed
with two abstaining.

111
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,125
[SANFORD]
With a majority opposed,

112
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,250
the motion to withdraw
from the current operation

113
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,541
is hearby rejected.

114
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,958
[NARRATOR] As a result,
it was decided the invasion

115
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,625
into the Empire's territory
would continue.

116
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,125
With the High Council's
decision made,

117
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,166
supply ships departed
planet Heinessen,

118
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,541
heading towards Iserlohn.

119
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,208
Unfortunately, by
then, it was already too late.

120
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,125
Supplies at the front line
were nearing depletion.

121
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,458
So a new strategy
was implemented.

122
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,750
[ULANHU]
Ridiculous!

123
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,916
You expect us to acquire
supplies locally?

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,750
Do you know what you're asking?

125
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,500
[APPLETON] You want my
troops to start plundering

126
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,541
from the citizenry, is that it?

127
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,000
[BORODIN] You're telling us
to procure something

128
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,791
that was never there
to begin with!

129
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,458
[BEWCOCK]
A failed supply plan.

130
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,125
The first step toward defeat.

131
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,083
What happened to the Supreme
Commander's talk about

132
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,416
how flawless this operation was?

133
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,708
[WALTER]
They all seem rather irate.

134
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,333
[MURAI]
Of course they are.

135
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,791
Our fleet is running low on food
like everyone else, however,

136
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,208
we can't just let the
people starve to death.

137
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,208
[WALTER] If the Imperial Navy
were to suddenly show up

138
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,375
with food, everyone in the
Empire would instantly

139
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,875
forget us and bow down
to sing the kaiser's praises.

140
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,125
[PATRICHEV] I don't see why we
should be the ones to starve

141
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,916
while those people get to eat!

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,375
[MURAI]
Patrichev.

143
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,208
[YANG]
So we don't become like Rudolf.

144
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,625
That's the reason. Lieutenant.

145
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,083
Call Vice Admiral Ulanhu
at once, please.

146
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,041
[FREDERICA]
Yes, sir! Right away!

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,916
[ULANHU]
Well, Admiral Yang Wen-li.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,541
How unexpected.

149
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,125
[YANG]
Vice Admiral Ulanhu.

150
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,166
I'm glad to see
you're looking so well.

151
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,833
[ULANHU]
That depends on your definition.

152
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,416
I'm not sure "well" properly
conveys our problems.

153
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,875
[YANG]
Speaking of.

154
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,791
I was just wondering how your
food reserves were holding out?

155
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,333
[ULANHU] We should have enough
to last us for another week.

156
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,291
If we don't receive
more before then,

157
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,875
we'll have no choice
but to requisition.

158
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,291
[ULANHU] Scratch that. There's
no point in mincing words.

159
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,916
We'll have to loot supplies
from the occupied territory.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,833
[ULANHU] Real great "liberating
army" we turned out to be, huh?

161
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,000
[YANG] I've given
it some thought,

162
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,208
and I have an idea
concerning the matter.

163
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,875
[ULANHU] Retreat? Before we
even exchange the first fire?

164
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,958
[YANG] While we still have
reserves, yes.

165
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,541
The enemy is biding their time,
waiting for us to completely

166
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,125
drain our supplies
and starve as a result.

167
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,166
[ULANHU] In other words, they're
waiting for the right moment

168
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,375
before they shift
to the offensive.

169
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,583
[YANG] And they'll
most likely hit us

170
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,166
with everything they've got.

171
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,958
They have the home
field advantage,

172
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,458
plus their supply
lines will be shorter.

173
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,625
We're in the heart of
enemy territory here.

174
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,958
[ULANHU] True, however,
if all the fleets withdrew

175
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,208
in a chaotic manner,
we would just end up inviting

176
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,791
the enemy to attack us.

177
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,291
Which would make
matters a whole lot worse

178
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,125
than they currently are.

179
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,791
[YANG] We would have to be fully
prepared to counterattack.

180
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,916
That is absolutely essential.

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,333
Right now, we can
still put up a fight,

182
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,083
but it'll be too late once
our troops are starving.

183
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,666
The best option is to retreat in
an orderly fashion while we can.

184
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,333
[ULANHU]
You have my attention.

185
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,416
[YANG] If the enemy interprets
our withdrawal as a total rout,

186
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,333
and then decides to
come charging after us,

187
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,541
that could work in our favor.

188
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,333
[YANG] We'll have several
possible ways to fight back

189
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,958
if they pursue us.

190
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,666
On the other hand, if they think
it's too early for a retreat

191
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,583
or that it's a trap,
that's fine, too.

192
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,125
[YANG] We may be able
to withdraw unscathed.

193
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,916
The odds are not high as it is,

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
but each passing day we
wait here, they only get lower.

195
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,083
[YANG]
From where I'm standing,

196
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,125
this is the best
possible option.

197
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,083
We need to retreat from here
as quickly as possible.

198
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,166
[ULANHU] I understand,
and I trust that

199
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,000
your intuition is correct.

200
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,916
We'll begin preparations
for withdrawal immediately.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,166
[YANG]
I'm glad.

202
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,833
[ULANHU] But, have you
considered the best way

203
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,208
of informing command
and the rest of the fleets?

204
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,750
[YANG] I intend to put a call in
to Admiral Bewcock after this.

205
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,458
I'll try to convince him to
contact Iserlohn since I have

206
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,291
a feeling his word would
carry more weight than if

207
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,208
I went to the top with the idea.

208
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,166
[ULANHU]
Very well.

209
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,125
Let's work together to make this
happen as fast as we can.

210
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,458
[PATRICHEV] I wholly agree
with your proposal.

211
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,666
[MURAI] I have no
objections to it either.

212
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,041
[WALTER]
An excellent decision, as usual.

213
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,375
[YANG] Gentlemen.
Flattery will get you nowhere.

214
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,416
[FREDERICA giggles]

215
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,791
[SOLDIER 11D]
Urgent report!

216
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,041
A revolt has broken out
in the territory occupied

217
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,583
by the Eighth Fleet!
It's a massive uprising!

218
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,916
[CROWD yelling]

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,750
[MAN 11C]
Hey! There's food over there!

220
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,583
[MAN 11D]
Do you know how to use a gun?

221
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,666
[MAN 11E]
Yeah!

222
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,000
[SOLDIER 11E]
Put the firearm down!

223
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,333
Refuse and I will shoot!

224
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,791
[MAN 11F]
That one's next!

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,625
[SOLDIER 11E] How did
things go downhill so fast?

226
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,041
[gun clicks]

227
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,458
[BOY 11A whimpers]

228
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,458
[SOLDIER 11E gasps]

229
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,416
[YANG] What a tragedy
this turned out to be.

230
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,083
[FREDERICA] There's no way
we can build mutual trust

231
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,041
with the people. Not now.

232
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,875
[YANG] Yeah. The enemy
got between us

233
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,958
and the Empire's people.
A smart but brutal strategy.

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,875
[YANG] Even if I knew it
would guarantee us victory,

235
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,208
I could never bring myself
to be this thorough.

236
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,208
[YANG] Well done indeed,
Count Lohengramm.

237
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,583
[YANG] Put me through to
Admiral Bewcock's vessel.

238
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,083
[FREDERICA]
Yes, sir.

239
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,875
[NARRATOR] Bewcock accepted
Yang's proposal to withdraw,

240
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,583
saying he would push for
a retreat to Iserlohn.

241
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,875
In order to do so,
he requested correspondence

242
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,166
with Supreme Commander Lobos.

243
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,333
[BEWCOCK] What's taking
him so long to respond?

244
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,666
[FALK]
Admiral Bewcock.

245
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,583
What is it that
I can help you with?

246
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,916
[BEWCOCK]
I asked for an appointment

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,541
with the Supreme Commander.

248
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,666
Don't stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

249
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,583
[FALK] All communications
with the Fleet Admiral

250
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,125
will be conducted through me.

251
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,291
What is the nature
of your request?

252
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,541
[BEWCOCK] I have no interest
in speaking with you.

253
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,375
[FALK] Well, then I'm afraid
I cannot connect you with him.

254
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,541
[BEWCOCK]
And why is that?

255
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,083
[FALK]
No matter how high your rank,

256
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,708
you are still required
to comply with regulations.

257
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,041
So, shall I end
this transmission?

258
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:20,041
[BEWCOCK] All the fleet
commanders on the front line

259
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,958
want to withdraw immediately.

260
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,208
I wish to obtain the
consent of Admiral Lobos

261
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,166
in respect to this matter.

262
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,791
[FALK]
You mean retreat?

263
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,750
I'd expect this
from Admiral Yang,

264
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,208
but not from the
brave Admiral Bewcock.

265
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,583
You would withdraw before
the fighting even starts?

266
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,375
Surely not.

267
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,416
[BEWCOCK]
Spare me your snide remarks.

268
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,625
We wouldn't be in this mess if
you people hadn't come up with

269
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,791
such a careless deployment
strategy in the first place.

270
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,666
Why don't you try assuming
a little responsibility?

271
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,166
[FALK] If I were in your shoes,
I would never retreat.

272
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,333
This is our chance to
slaughter the Imperial Navy

273
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,708
in one fell swoop.

274
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,458
Unless, that is, you're
afraid of something?

275
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,791
[BEWCOCK]
All right.

276
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,583
Then I'll trade places with you.

277
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,250
Expect my arrival
at Iserlohn shortly,

278
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,041
and you can take my place
here on the front line.

279
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,833
[FALK] Please don't ask for
what you know is impossible.

280
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,166
[BEWCOCK]
Quite the opposite.

281
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,583
You're the one proposing
the impossible. Meanwhile,

282
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,333
you don't budge from the
safe haven you're hiding in.

283
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,291
[FALK]
I don't understand.

284
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,750
Are you trying to
insult me, admiral?

285
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,666
[BEWCOCK] I've just grown
tired of your lofty speeches

286
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,541
on courage. If you want to
demonstrate your talents,

287
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,000
then do it by actually
achieving something.

288
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,541
Instead of relying
merely on cheap talk.

289
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,291
[BEWCOCK] Why not come here
and find out for yourself?

290
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,875
See whether you have what
it takes to command.

291
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,416
Unless you're the one who's
afraid, Commodore Falk!

292
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500

Hey! We've got trouble!

295
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,916
[SOLDIER 11G]
Commodore! Commodore Falk!

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,291
[BEWCOCK]
What the hell was that?

297
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,500
Is he dead?

298
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,541
[GREENHILL]
Vice Admiral Bewcock.

299
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,041
[BEWCOCK]
Chief of Staff Greenhill.

300
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,208
Finally someone sensible.

301
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,500
[GREENHILL]
I'm sorry you had to see such

302
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,333
an unsightly display like that.

303
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,333
[BEWCOCK] What exactly
happened to the Commodore?

304
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,458
[GREENHILL]
Well, you see,

305
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,541
according to our
medical officer,

306
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,375
whenever he experiences feelings
of frustration or failure,

307
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,375
they cause him
to have a seizure.

308
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,958
[GREENHILL] Unfortunately,
since it's brought on

309
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,416
by a psychological condition,
if the cause is not eliminated,

310
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,250
he's likely to have
more episodes like this

311
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,000
in the future.

312
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,083
[BEWCOCK] Wonderful. What do
you recommend we do about it?

313
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,458
[GREENHILL]
Do not defy him,

314
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,333
avoid making him
feel frustrated,

315
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,958
and, according
to the physician,

316
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,000
make sure that
everything goes his way.

317
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,958
[BEWCOCK] Please tell me
you're not being serious.

318
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,875
[GREENHILL] As far as
treating him is concerned,

319
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,625
I can only see one
natural course of action.

320
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,791
[BEWCOCK]
You got that right!

321
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,291
He should be forced to resign.

322
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,458
[BEWCOCK] Thirty million
Alliance soldiers have to stand

323
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:53,166
in the jaws of death in order to
cure one man-child's hysteria?

324
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,875
If the Empire ever
found out about this,

325
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,500
they'd have a field day.

326
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,666
[BEWCOCK] So, what do say
about this withdraw proposal?

327
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,333
I'll tell you right now,
the troops on the front line

328
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,625
are in no condition to fight,
mentally or physically.

329
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,625
[GREENHILL]
I must ask you to wait a bit.

330
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,666
We need the approval of
the Supreme Commander

331
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,083
before we can act.

332
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,250
Please understand, I can't
provide you with an answer

333
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,833
at this moment.

334
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,041
[BEWCOCK] You realize
this is an urgent matter?

335
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,791
I'm not trying to be rude,
but if what we need here

336
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,333
is the Commander's approval,
isn't the next logical step

337
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,083
to get him on the line?

338
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,791
[GREENHILL] I'm afraid
that he's unavailable.

339
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,250
The Commander
is currently resting.

340
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,625
[BEWCOCK] Huh? I'm sorry
but could you repeat that?

341
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,500
[GREENHILL]
Admiral Lobos is taking a nap.

342
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,250
He's given us strict orders
not to wake him.

343
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,750
There's only one exception--

344
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,166
If the enemy were
to begin attacking.

345
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,000
[GREENHILL] I will relay your
request as soon as he wakes up.

346
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,583
Until then, I'm asking
you to please be patient.

347
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:55,166
[growls] Very well.
I understand perfectly.

348
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,083
[BEWCOCK] Then as my duty
serving as frontline commander,

349
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:02,291
I have no choice but to fulfill
my obligation to my soldiers.

350
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,375
[BEWCOCK]
Sorry for taking up your time.

351
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,958
Whenever he wakes up, would you
pass along the following message

352
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,583
to the Supreme Commander?

353
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:12,291
Tell him that Admiral Bewcock
hopes he had pleasant dreams.

354
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,291
[BEWCOCK]
Signing off.

355
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,666
[GREENHILL]
Wait, Admiral--

356
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
[REINHARD] A fleet of supply
ships will be dispatched

357
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,500
to the front line from Iserlohn.
That's the enemy's lifeline.

358
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,250
I want you to take all the
troops that I've given to you

359
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,625
and obliterate it.

360
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,666
[REINHARD] I'll leave the
details to your own discretion.

361
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,708
[KIRCHEIS]
Yes, Your Excellency.

362
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,166
I'll be going.

363
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,500
[REINHARD]
Kircheis.

364
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,750
[REINHARD] You don't seem to
be pleased with my strategy.

365
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,416
[KIRCHEIS]
No, that's not true at all.

366
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,750
By now you
should know I can tell

367
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,333
what you're thinking,
so speak freely.

368
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,416
[KIRCHEIS] While I am aware
this plan has been devised

369
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,583
to guarantee our
victory. I feel...

370
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,958
[REINHARD] You don't agree
with an approach that puts

371
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,583
a burden on the people.

372
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,375
[REINHARD]
Just remember, this is to win.

373
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,708
[KIRCHEIS]
Yes. I remember.

374
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,125
[OBERSTEIN] While Admiral
Kircheis's fleet focuses on

375
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,083
wiping out the rebel's
incoming supply ships,

376
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,041
our navy will shift
to a major offensive.

377
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,708
[OBERSTEIN] In accordance
with our existing plan,

378
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,125
the objective is to swiftly
eliminate the entirety

379
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,625
of the rebel invasion force.
That concludes my briefing.

380
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,666
[REINHARD] Our navy will take
back the captured territory.

381
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,458
Furthermore, our supply
corps will provide

382
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,500
food to the civilians.

383
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,291
[REINHARD] Even if it
was necessary to counter

384
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,041
the rebels' invasion, it was
never my wish to force

385
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,458
our people to the
point of starvation.

386
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,833
[REINHARD] We must claim victory
in this battle and demonstrate

387
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,958
to every resident
of the frontier why

388
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,791
the Galactic Empire alone is
worthy of ruling over them.

389
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,541
[REINHARD] As for those
arrogant insurgents...

390
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,250
Let none escape death.
