[NARRATOR] If the events
depecited here bear

8
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,291
a resemblance to any

9
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,541
or the people appearing here
bear a likeness to others

10
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:02,083
who have lived and fought,
it is but a fluke of history.

11
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,208
The inevitable repetition
of human conflict.

12
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,583
The terrible familiarity of war.

13
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,916
[NARRATOR]
In the year SE 796,

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,541
three opposing powers vied
for control of the Milky Way.

15
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,250
The Goldenbaum Dynasty

16
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,458
of the Galactic Empire...

17
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,166
[NARRATOR]
...the Free Planets Alliance...

18
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,250
[NARRATOR]
...and the Dominion of Fezzan.

19
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,250
The Empire and the
Alliance were embroiled in

20
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,541
a seemingly endless war,
and The Dominion of Fezzan

21
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,666
upheld its neutral stance
as a mere formality.

22
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,166
The three powers
were deadlocked in

23
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,166
an ongoing struggle
for glactic supremacy.

24
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,791
[KIRCHEIS] Are you stargazing,
Your Excellency? 

25
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,500
Yes. I love the stars.

26
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,500
You've gotten taller
again, haven't you?

27
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,041
I'm the same height
as I was two months ago.

28
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,166
One-ninety. I doubt
I'll grow any taller.

29
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,541
Seven centimeters
taller than me, then,

30
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,208
which is certainly plenty.

31
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:01,708
So... what brings you here?
Was there something you needed?

32
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,875
[KIRCHEIS] It's about the
rebel forces' formation.

33
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,541
We have received
reports from three

34
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,708
of our patrol craft.
It's as we expected.

35
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,625
They're approaching
from three directions.

36
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,916
As you can see,
the enemy's fourth fleet

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,833
is directly in front of us.

38
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,916
We've logged their numbers at
around 12,000 ships.

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,708
Distance is approximately
2,200 light-seconds.

40
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:31,083
Maintaining our current speed,
we'll make contact in six hours.

41
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:36,166
Their navy has 40,000 ships.
That's twice what we have.

42
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,666
[KIRCHEIS]
Indeed, sir.

43
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,875
Not to mention they're
trying to surround us.

44
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,250
What color are
the old generals' faces now?

45
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,833
Bright red or sickly pale?

46
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,583
[MERKATZ] Your Excellency,
on behalf of us all,

47
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,750
allow me to thank you for this
chance to voice our concerns.

48
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,625
You can save yourself
the trouble, Admirals.

49
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,875
I believe I know what
you're going to say.

50
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,000
"Our navy's at a disadvantage."

51
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,625
I'm afraid that's correct.

52
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,583
You've seen how
they're deployed.

53
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,416
The enemy is surrounding
us on three sides, sir.

54
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,125
They have a strategic
edge we lack,

55
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,541
not to mention a force
twice our size.

56
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,458
So we're going to lose.
That's what you think.

57
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,666
That's not what
I intended to imply,

58
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,541
but the fact remains that we
are at a distinct disadvantage.

59
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,875
If you would please
just take a look at this.

60
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,333
[STADEN] We've been in a
similar predicament before,

61
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,958
Your Excellency.

62
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,500
Many years ago, our mighty
Imperial Fleet suffered

63
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,416
a bitter defeat at the hands of
the Rebels' so-called

64
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,708
"Free Planets Alliance."

65
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,458
[REINHARD]
The slaughter at Dagon.

66
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,291
[STADEN] Yes, that defeat
was truly regrettable.

67
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,666
We must be smart this time.

68
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,500
We cannot make the same
mistakes we made before.

69
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,041
His Imperial Majesty,
the Kaiser,

70
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,291
would scorn us
for such a failure.

71
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,541
And so, let us act with reason.

72
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,541
Instead of rushing into a fight
with a questionable outcome,

73
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,708
let us honorably retreat.

74
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,750
An eloquent speech,
Vice Admiral.

75
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,166
That said, I cannot
agree with your assessment.

76
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,250
To withdraw at this point
would be unthinkable.

77
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,583
And why is that?

78
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:48,125
Sir, I'm afraid
I don't undersand.

79
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,375
Why would we want
to retreat when we have

80
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,791
a significant advantage
over the enemy?

81
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,916
An advantage?

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,500
--How's that?
--But we don't.

83
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,500
It's a matter of
numbers and placement.

84
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,041
Consider the battlefield.

85
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,791
[REINHARD] Their fleet is
split into three forces.

86
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,833
In total, they have more ships.

87
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,291
But our fleet is bigger than
each of the three units,

88
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,458
which means we can overpower
them and take them out

89
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,916
one group at a time.

90
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,083
If this is not
a path to victory,

91
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,250
then I don't know what is.

92
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,041
[gasping]

93
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,833
We're not in danger
of being surrounded,

94
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,208
as we'll defeat the enemy's
forces one by one.

95
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,791
You spoke of
an honorable retreat.

96
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,875
But if we withdraw without
fulfilling the kaiser's orders,

97
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,875
where is the honor in that?

98
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,166
With all due respect,
Your Excellency, this plan

99
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,333
is based upon your
instinct and not rooted in

100
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,375
sound tactical practices.

101
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,166
Can you point to even
one example where

102
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,000
this strategy worked?

103
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,250
By tomorrow, you will
have your example.

104
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,958
I've no doubt that
the plan will succeed.

105
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,000
You will see it
with your own eyes.

106
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,500
That isn't possible!

107
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:58,083
[REINHARD]
Yes. It is.

108
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,416
Victory will be ours,
but only if you all act

109
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
in accordance with my plan.

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,125
What an impertinent little brat.

111
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,125
His sister's relationship
with the Kaiser

112
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,625
has inflated the man's
ego beyond belief.

113
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,250
A reckless strategy
like that stands

114
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,958
no chance of working.

115
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,583
Are you so sure?

116
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,708
[ERLACHE]
Hmm.

117
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,708
He is certainly a clever man,

118
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,541
and I believe that plan
of his is equally clever

119
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,416
Don't tell me you've been
charmed by the little prig!

120
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,041
You're still young yourself.

121
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,708
Give it time.
You'll see things differently.

122
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,375
I beg your pardon.

123
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,750
Was that wise, sir?

124
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,375
Probably not.

125
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,916
But what harm can
they really do me?

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,250
Don't worry.

127
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,083
They may be complaining now,

128
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,333
but their attitudes
will change soon.

129
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:54,333
Staden wants his example, and
that's exactly what he'll get.

130
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,458
Though I don't know
how pleased he'll be.

131
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,458
Let's pour ourselves
a well-deserved drink.

132
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,375
I have a bottle of fine wine.

133
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,916
It's rare, aged 410 years.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,708
I would like that, sir.

135
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,125
[REINHARD]
Let's go, then.

136
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,000
[REINHARD]
Oh, and Kircheis?

137
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,125
Yes, Excellency?

138
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,708
Dispense with the titles.

139
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,625
There's nobody around except us.
We can speak as we always have.

140
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,083
I've told you that before.

141
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,625
Yes, more than once, in fact.

142
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,416
Well, then don't make
me tell you again.

143
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,125
Besides, once this battle is
over and we return to Odin

144
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,541
with victory, you'll receive
a title of your own.

145
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,583
[gasps]

146
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,208
I imagine you'll be promoted.

147
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,041
How does "Commodore" sound?

148
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,250
I'd be truly honored.

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,750
[PASTOLLE] How credible
is the patrol craft's report?

150
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,625
[MAN 1C] Level A. We have
high confidence, sir!

151
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,208
This makes no sense.

152
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,625
What are those fools thinking?
They know our position by now.

153
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,541
We have them
surrounded on three sides,

154
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,833
but instead of attempting
a retreat, they're making

155
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:18,416
a move and advancing
in our direction!

156
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,125
Their commander
has no grasp of tactics.

157
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,250
This goes beyond
mere recklessness.

158
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,916
[REINHARD]

their divided forces,

On the topic of division,

163
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,916
have we jammed
the enemy's data link?

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,375
Yes. They weren't
expecting us

and stage an advance.

It should prove
quite effective, sir.

Not at all, sir.

You've always
been more tight-lipped

[MERKATZ]
Huh?

We've only finished one-third
of the mission at hand.

Leave the surviving
forces where they are.

We should save our strength

and focus our efforts
on the battle to come.

That is all for now.

[MERKATZ]
Yes, Your Excellency. Of course.

Well, his attitude has improved.

Don't you think?

00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,958
Indeed. I suppose
it would have to.

233
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,958
[REINHARD]
Hmph. By the way.

234
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,125
For our next advance,
we can either attack the left

235
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,375
or the right fleet.
Your thoughts?

236
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,625
It's possible to get around
to the rear flank of either.

237
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,750
But I believe
you've already chosen.

238
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,041
I have.

239
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,500
[KIRCHEIS] The one
on the right, the 6th fleet.

240
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,333
Their numbers are
significantly smaller.

241
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,166
[REINHARD]
Precisely.

242
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,833
There's only one thing
that concerns me.

243
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,416
What if the enemy has
caught on to your plan?

244
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,958
If they knew,

245
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,166
then we would know,
because they'd be scrambling

246
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,083
to combine their fleets.

247
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,333
It would be their
wisest course of action.

248
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,916
If they did that,
they would have

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,958
a significant advantage over us.

250
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,125
But they've made no move,

251
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,333
which means they're
still in the dark.

252
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,083
We will go around to
the right rear flank of

253
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:16,166
the 6th Fleet and attack.
How long until we reach them?

254
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,250
Four hours, sir.

255
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,625
Impressive. You had
worked it out in advance.

Get your facts straight!

The enemy is fighting the fourth

We are currently en
route to provide them aide.

268
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,916
The second fleet should
be getting into position

269
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
to support the fourth, as well.

270
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,916
And once we're in place,
we'll attack the enemy

from both sides.

Have you considered the enemy
may have moved the battle?

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,250
And abandoned their
attack on the fourth fleet?

278

[LAPP] It pains me to say this,
sir, but I believe the enemy

has eliminated the 4th fleet
and turned their sights on us!

and a unpleasant guess

00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,500
Those bereft of skill
are never victorious.

319
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,916
They always fall.

320
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,250
Report from
our patrol craft, sir.

321
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,791
The enemy's 2nd Fleet has
left the battle sector.

322
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,083
They appear to be on their
way to aid the 4th Fleet.

323
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,125
With your permission,

324
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,583
we would like to
continue our advance

325
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,041
and finish the job, sir.

326
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,791
Very well. Let's finish it.

327
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,500
We'll hit the second fleet
with everything we have.

328
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,833
[MAN 1J] The target
is directly in front of us, sir!

329
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,291
Fire now!

330
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,291
Fire!

331
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,750
Fire away!

332
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,833
[MAN 1J]
Multiple direct hits, sir!

333
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,500
I do hope we'll be
able to annihilate them all.

334
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,791
You really are
a worrywart, aren't you?

335
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,333
Is it so hard for
you to trust me?

336
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,541
I've never doubted you,

337
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,791
and I'm not going
to start today.

338
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,416
But that doesn't mean that I'm
immune to feeling nervous.

339
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm afraid that one day, the
enemy will have someone

340
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,333
like you on their side.

341
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,583
[REINHARD] Hmph. I'm constantly
entertained by the way

342
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,666
your mind works.

343
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,125
Honestly, if someone like that
were to make themselves known.

344
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,500
I'd enjoy testing their mettle.

345
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,000
And were it possible,

346
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,625
I would want to meet
them face to face.

347
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,375
No doubt we'd
have much to discuss.

348
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,875
[MAN 1J]
There's a transmission, sir.

349
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,916
The enemy has
directed it to all fleets!

350
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,916
Play it, then.

351
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,458
[YANG] Greetings. I'm
Commodore Yang Wen-li,

352
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,125
deputy officer to
Commander Paetta.

353
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,500
Our flagship,
<i>Patoroklos</i> , has been hit,

354
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,958
and Commander Paetta
has been gravely injured.

355
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,541
Per the commander's orders,
I will be taking over command

356
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,916
of all fleets effective
immediately.

357
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,375
[YANG]
Have no fear.

358
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,833
Follow my orders
and you will live.

359
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,833
Those of you who wish
to survive, remain calm

360
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,833
and do as I say.

361
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,541
At the moment,
our side is losing,

362
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,208
but the only thing that
matters is to be winning

363
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:26,291
at the last moment.
We will not lose.

364
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,958
All ships, focus on
destroying individual crafts

365
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,250
until I give further
orders. That is all.

366
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,083
[REINHARD]
"We will not lose."

367
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,041
"Follow my orders
and you will live"--

368
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,375
Those are bold statements.

369
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,541
I never suspected the
rebel forces had such

370
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,083
a braggart among their ranks.

371
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,541
How can he possibly
expect to turn his disadvantage

372
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,625
around at this stage?

373
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,041
Well. No matter.

374
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:56,041
Let's find out what he's made
of, shall we, Kircheis?

375
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,791
Yes, let's.

376
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,708
Reorganize battle lines.

377
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,916
Do it quickly.

378
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,541
Move all fleets into
a spindle formation.

379
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,916
Do you understand why?

380
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,250
You intend to break
through their center, sir.

381
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,541
That's right.
You're quite astute.

382
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,625
[MAN 1J] Compiling data
from patrol crafts.

383
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,041
Operating in real time.

384
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,083
Well, it appears we've won.

385
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,250
Indeed.

386
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,166
Is something the matter, sir?

387
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,583
What is it, Lord Reinhard?

388
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't know.
Something's not right.

389
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,541
We're definitely winning.
There's no doubt.

390
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:08,958
And yet...

391
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,000
[gasps]
It can't be!

392
