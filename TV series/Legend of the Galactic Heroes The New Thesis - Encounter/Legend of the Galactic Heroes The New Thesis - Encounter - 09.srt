1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,125
[GIRL 9A]
It can't be true.

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,750
Are you really quitting,
Miss Edwards?

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,458
[GIRL 9B]
Can we change your mind?

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,333
--[GIRL 9B sobs]
--[GIRL 9C] Don't leave...

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,041
[GIRL 9A]
We're going to miss you...

6
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:25,333
[GIRL 9D]
Miss Edwards... [sobs] Please...

7
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,375
[sobbing]

8
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,458
[doorbell rings]

9
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,708
[JULIAN] Yes? Are you
looking for someone?

10
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,333
[JESSICA]
I'm sorry. Who are you?

11
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,583
[LEBELLO] There is no
delicate way to put this.

12
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,041
For many years, the Galactic
Empire and our Alliance

13
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,875
have fought this war
only to the extent

14
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,875
that it was
financially feasible.

15
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,708
[LEBELLO]
The times have changed.

16
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,000
Pensions for the families
of soldiers lost during

17
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:54,458
the Battle of Astarte require us
to spend ten billion annually.

18
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,000
[LEBELLO] In addition, feeding
the 500,000 prisoners

19
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,000
from Iserlohn demands
an enormous budget increase.

20
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,583
We have a debt
crisis on our hands.

21
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,500
[MAN 9A]
Are you saying our national hero

22
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,708
has led us to
financial distress?

23
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,083
[LEBELLO]
To alleviate the strain,

24
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,666
we've traditionally had two
options at our disposal:

25
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,500
either issuing more bonds
or increasing taxes.

26
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,958
[MAN 9B]
Raise taxes?

27
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,416
What did you promise
our constituents

28
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,833
in the last election?

29
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,208
[LEBELLO]
I know!

30
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,166
But if we continue to expand
this war any further,

31
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,750
it's going to bring about
our economic destruction!

32
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,208
[MAN 9C] If we're
not committed to winning,

33
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,625
then the Alliance has no future.

34
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,041
[LEBELLO] Perhaps the solution
is to simply stop fighting.

35
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,208
[MAN 9A growls]

36
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,958
[LEBELLO]
Admiral Yang's resourcefulness

37
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,458
awarded us Iserlohn Fortress.

38
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,750
The Imperial Navy
has lost its forward base

39
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,208
for invading Alliance territory.

40
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,750
[LEBELLO] Is this not
the ideal time to negotiate

41
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,833
a favorable peace treaty?

42
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,375
[MAN 9D] Have you
forgotten that we are at war

43
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,583
with an unjust and
tyrannical government?

44
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,916
[MAN 9C] Exactly.
How wise is it to give up

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
simply because it doesn't
suit us economically?

46
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,208
[LEBELLO growls]

47
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,208
[YANG]
Julian! I'm headed out.

48
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,625
[JULIAN]
Take care, Admiral.

49
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,500
[YANG]
Oh, yeah. I was just thinking.

50
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,000
Why don't we go out to
a restaurant tonight?

51
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,333
Go ahead and meet me at the
headquarters after school

52
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,583
lets out for the day.

53
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,416
[JULIAN]
Tonight? That's sudden.

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,291
[YANG] Yeah. I know,
but there's something

55
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,583
I need to talk to you about.

56
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,583
[gasps]

57
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,916
[YANG]
Well, see you later.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,291
[JULIAN]
Hmm.

59
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,708
[SITHOLE] You want
to resign from the navy?

60
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,375
But you're still young,
only 30 years old.

61
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,333
[YANG]
Twenty-nine, actually.

62
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,708
[SITHOLE] Regardless,
don't you think it's

63
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,250
a little early to leave
your life behind?

64
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,458
[YANG] I feel as though I'm
doing the exact opposite.

65
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,208
My life took a prolonged detour,

66
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,291
and now it's getting
back on track.

67
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,833
I'm finally returning to the
life I intended to live.

68
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,083
[SITHOLE]
Surviving off a pension

69
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,083
and studying history all day?

70
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,000
[YANG grunts]

71
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,291
[SITHOLE] Unfortunately,
what the Free Planets Alliance

72
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,208
requires is not your
knowledge as a historian

73
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,791
but rather your skill
as a tactician.

74
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,916
It's a gift.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,041
And we need it desperately.

76
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,750
[SITHOLE] It sounds as
though you're saying capturing

77
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,750
Iserlohn Fortress was
more than enough for you.

78
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,666
[YANG]
I wouldn't put it that way.

79
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,166
[SITHOLE]
Look. You should know

80
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,333
the High Council
is meeting today.

81
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,458
They're considering dispatching
troops to the Empire.

82
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,541
[SITHOLE] There's a new
strategy in the works.

83
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,833
The plan is to use Iserlohn as
a bridgehead for an invasion.

84
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,500
[YANG]
That's not what we intended.

85
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,416
It's the opposite, in fact!

86
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,833
[SITHOLE]
Hmm?

87
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,625
[YANG] It was the Defense
Committee Chairman's idea,

88
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,125
wasn't it?

89
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,208
[SITHOLE] No, the proposal
came from within the military.

90
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,083
A young officer from
the planning division

91
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,333
had brought it directly to the
National Defense Committee.

92
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,250
[gasps]

93
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,250
[SITHOLE] I have faith that
the High Council will reach

94
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,250
an intelligent decision
on the matter.

95
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,833
[YANG]
You have more faith than I do.

96
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,291
Well, whatever decision
they arrive at,

97
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,083
I'm glad to report that
it won't be involving me.

98
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:25,125
[SITHOLE] And what's to become
of the Thirteenth?

99
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,541
That's your fleet to command,

100
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,791
and it's only recently
been formed.

101
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,500
Once you're retired,
what happens to them?

102
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,000
[LOUIS] Human resources
that should be devoted to

103
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,333
social development are instead
being diverted to the military.

104
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,125
I, for one, find
this disconcerting.

105
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,583
[LOUIS]
Our investments in education

106
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,875
and vocational training have
been continually reduced.

107
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,833
Skill levels among our
labor force are dwindling,

108
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:53,041
as evidenced by the tripling of
workplace accidents last term.

109
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,125
[LOUIS]
Which brings me to my proposal.

110
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,625
I would like for 4,000,000
technicians as well as

111
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,833
transportation and
communications personnel

112
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,833
currently serving in the
military to be returned

113
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,916
to the private sector.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,166
[LOUIS] That number
is the absolute minimum.

115
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,708
[TRUNICHT] You're asking
for the impossible.

116
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,250
Imagine if we removed that many
people from the rear services.

117
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,000
Our military would
collapse on itself.

118
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,125
[LOUIS] So the Defense
Committee chairman says,

119
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,583
but at the rate we're going,
our economy and society

120
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,958
will implode long before
the military ever does.

121
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,208
[LEBELLO]
In short, now is the time

122
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,208
to let our citizens rebuild.

123
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,208
To force the people to sacrifice
any more would be a violation

124
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,333
of our democratic principles.

125
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:38,083
They cannot shoulder
the burden any longer.

126
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,208
[WINDSOR] There's no reason
to pander to the selfishness

127
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,666
of citizens who don't understand
our great and noble purpose.

128
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,333
Name a time in history when
anything of significance

129
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,958
was achieved without sacrifice.

130
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,583
[LEBELLO] It would seem
a great number of people

131
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,625
have begun questioning if
they've already given too much,

132
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,958
Councilwoman.

133
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,375
[WINDSOR]
Some things must be done,

134
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,041
no matter how great the cost.

135
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,583
[LEBELLO]
That's not a political argument!

136
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,625
[WINDSOR] Our duty is to
defeat the Galactic Empire.

137
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,875
To rescue all of humanity
and spare future generations

138
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,666
from the threat of tyranny
and oppression.

139
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,041
[WINDSOR] I wonder how we can
claim to be walking the path

140
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,833
of righteousness if we forget
our greater purpose

141
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:19,125
altogether in exchange for
some cheap humanitarianism?

142
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,375
[LEBELLO] Your heroics at
the expense of our citizens

143
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,583
is the only thing I
find to be cheap!

144
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,333
[LOUIS]
Settle down.

145
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,125
[LEBELLO]
How can--

146
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,083
[SANFORD] It appears we need
another break before continuing,

147
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,125
but if I could have
your attention first,

148
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,000
there's something
I'd like you to see.

149
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,000
[SANFORD] This is the public's
approval rating for the council.

150
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,208
It may not come as a surprise.

151
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,666
[SANFORD]
We're at 31.9%.

152
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,000
That's certainly
not a good number.

153
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,000
And now, let's take a look
at our disapproval rating.

154
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,083
[LOUIS]
Fifty-six point two percent.

155
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,416
[whispering]

156
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,791
[SANFORD]
If nothing changes,

157
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,583
it's highly unlikely we'll
be re-elected next year.

158
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,166
I can see us being caught
between the pacifist faction

159
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,708
and hardliners and
losing our majority.

160
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,875
[SANFORD]
But it's not hopeless.

161
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,750
I've had the computer
run some numbers,

162
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,625
and if we can secure a decisive
victory against the Empire

163
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,416
within the next 100 days,
the data indicates

164
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,333
that our approval
ratings should increase by

165
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,291
a staggering 15 percentage
points as a direct result.

166
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,166
[LEBELLO]
I can't be hearing this right.

167
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,375
You want to escalate the war
so you all can be re-elected?

168
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,791
[WINDSOR]
Chairman.

169
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,541
Let's put the military's
proposal up for a vote.

170
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,708
[COUNCILMEN]
Agreed.

171
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,875
[LEBELLO]
Wait a minute!

172
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,916
We don't have
the right to do this!

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,916
The authority to dispatch troops
isn't a tool for this Council

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,125
to throw around,
just for the purpose

175
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,750
of maintaining political power!

176
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,958
[WINDSOR] My, that's quite
a righteous statement.

177
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,541
[SANFORD]
Eight in favor. Three opposed.

178
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,250
With a majority in favor,
it is hereby confirmed

179
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,416
that our forces will invade
the Galactic Empire.

180
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,125
[MAN 9A]
Well. I didn't see that coming.

181
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,583
The Defense Committee
Chairman himself

182
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,041
voted against the measure.

183
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,166
[TRUNICHT]
Above all, I'm a patriot,

184
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,958
but that certainly
doesn't mean I'll advocate

185
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,291
for the use of force
in every situation.

186
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,458
I would like the record to
state that I was opposed

187
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,916
to this mobilization
of our forces.

188
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,541
[sighs]

189
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,375
[WALTER]
Well, hello, Admiral.

190
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,541
[YANG]
Captain.

191
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,458
[WALTER] You wouldn't
happen to be here tendering

192
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,375
your resignation now, would you?

193
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,791
[YANG]
Guilty.

194
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,916
But that's not to say I expected
Chief Sithole to accept

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,375
my retirement letter with one
hand and willingly give me

196
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,416
my severance pay with the other.

197
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,333
[WALTER] You do realize
the military's never going

198
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,041
to let you go, right?

199
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,291
[YANG]
Hmm.

200
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,791
[WALTER]
But seriously.

201
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,291
I would prefer to see a man of
your caliber stay in the navy

202
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,958
rather than become a civilian.

203
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,333
[WALTER] You excel at
appraising situations and on top

204
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,208
of that, you're lucky.

205
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,458
I may not be hailed for
distinguished service under

206
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,833
your leadership, but I do have
a good chance of surviving.

207
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,041
[WALTER] You see, I've already
made up my mind to close

208
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,083
the curtains on this life
by dying of old age.

209
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,416
[WALTER] I plan on living
to be about 150 years,

210
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,708
lying on my death bed
while listening to my grandkids

211
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,000
and great-grandkids crying
for joy at the thought

212
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,333
of finally being rid of me.

213
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,833
[WALTER] The whole
dying-a-heroic-death-in-

214
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,333
the-midst-of-battle
thing isn't my style.

215
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,083
D'you think you could
find it in your heart

216
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,458
to help me live that
long, Admiral?

217
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,833
[WAITER 9A]
I apologize, gentlemen.

218
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,333
We're completely booked.

219
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,708
[YANG]
I'm sorry, Julian.

220
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,000
I guess we should
have made a reservation.

221
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,708
Let's keep looking.

222
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,041
[FREDERICA]
Admiral.

223
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,125
[YANG gasps]

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,375
[YANG]
Lieutenant?

225
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,250
[FREDERICA] I do own more
outfits besides my uniform.

226
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,250
My father has invited
you to sit at our table

227
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,166
if you'd care to join us.

228
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,250
[YANG]
Admiral Greenhill is here?

229
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,666
Oh, we couldn't.

230
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,708
[FREDERICA]
What do you say?

231
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,416
You must be hungry,
right, Julian?

232
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,666
Yes.

233
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,416
Vice Admiral Yang.

234
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,041
It's, uh, rear admiral, sir.

235
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,250
You'll make vice admiral

236
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,333
by next week at the latest.

237
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,208
So you might as well go ahead
and get used to people

238
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,041
addressing you by your new
title, don't you think?

239
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,458
[JULIAN]
That's amazing!

240
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,375
Is that what you wanted to
talk to me about tonight?

241
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,458
[YANG]
Uhh...

242
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,541
[GREENHILL] And this
young man must be Julian,

243
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,000
the honor student I've
heard so much about.

244
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,916
[JULIAN]
Sir. Nice to meet you.

245
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,458
[GREENHILL]
Have a seat. Please.

246
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,416
And if I'm not mistaken, didn't
you also win the gold medal

247
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,125
this year for most
points scored in

248
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,083
the junior division of flyball?

249
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,375
A master of
academics and sports.

250
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,333
[YANG]
Is all of that true, Julian?

251
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,333
[JULIAN]
Yes.

252
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,958
[FREDERICA] You live
under the same roof as him

253
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,250
and you're still the
last one to know.

254
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,583
Julian here is something
of a local celebrity.

255
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,916
[YANG sighs]

256
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,041
[GREENHILL]
Your recent achievements have

257
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,916
had consequences no one
could have anticipated.

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,541
[GREENHILL] The capture
of Iserlohn has divided

259
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,416
the population into pro
and anti-war factions,

260
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,958
and the disputes between
them have grown

261
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,041
quite intense as of late.

262
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,583
[YANG] I hope it
doesn't escalate beyond

263
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,083
the debate stage.

264
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,250
[GREENHILL]
Unfortunately, some have taken

265
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,250
a rather violent approach
when dealing with those

266
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,291
who are opposed to the war.

267
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,333
[YANG] Such as the Patriotic
Knight Corps, let's say?

268
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,708
[GREENHILL]
Those idiots?

269
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,000
They're hardly a threat,
and I refuse to waste breath

270
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,000
acknowledging their existence.

271
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,500
This gelatin salad
is to die for.

272
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,708
[YANG]
Yes, I agree.

273
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,666
[BOLTIK] Also, regarding
the Santa Cruz Line,

274
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,833
one of the largest interstellar
transport companies

275
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,708
operated by the Alliance.

276
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:17,208
Our shares have reached 41.9%.

277
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,458
[BOLTIK] Ownership is
divided among 20 people,

278
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,791
so they haven't realized
what's happening.

279
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,541
As such, we've surpassed
the largest shareholder,

280
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,833
a state-owned
investment company.

281
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,375
[RUBINSKY]
Excellent.

282
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,583
But we shouldn't rest until
we've acquired more than 50%.

283
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,000
[BOLTIK]
Yes.

284
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,833
[RUBINSKY]
What about the Empire?

285
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,708
[BOLTIK] We've made the
decision to invest heavily

286
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:40,666
in the agricultural development
of the 7th frontier starzone.

287
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,916
[RUBINSKY] What percentage
are we contributing?

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,750
[BOLTIK] Three of our
government-owned shell companies

289
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,166
control 84% in total.

290
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,375
A monopoly, essentially.

291
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,833
[RUBINSKY]
Well done.

292
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:55,166
[BOLTIK] So, you won't be
returning to your residence?

293
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,625
[RUBINSKY groans]
No. I will.

294
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,833
[BOLTIK]
Very good, sir.

295
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,500
I'll see you when you arrive.

296
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,208
[DOMINIQUE]
Sounds like it's going well.

297
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,375
[RUBINSKY]
Hmm...

298
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,875
[RUBINSKY]
There's a shared mindset in both

299
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,041
the Alliance and the Empire.

300
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,291
That war is nothing
more than two fleets

301
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,125
shooting at one
another in space.

302
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,666
[RUBINSKY]
But that's not true.

303
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,208
Only one thing
rules the universe.

304
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,666
[DOMINIQUE]
Money.

305
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,750
[RUBINSKY] The Dominion
of Fezzan owns nearly half

306
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,666
the war bonds
issued by both sides.

307
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,166
[RUBINSKY]
Soon, we'll financially control

308
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,833
the entire universe.

309
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,083
We own a piece of every corner
where humans have set foot.

310
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,625
[DOMINIQUE]
Oh, without a doubt.

311
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,166
Just as long as another
Rudolf doesn't come along

312
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,125
and decide to create
a new Galactic Empire.

313
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,916
[RUBINSKY]
A new Galactic Empire?

314
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,333
Not bad. You have
some interesting ideas.

315
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,708
[RUBINSKY] Going back
to work now, Dominique?

316

[DOMINIQUE]
Please enjoy your stay.

317
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,375
[RUBINSKY] I don't understand
why you continue to perform

318
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,458
even though you aren't
in need of money.

319
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,208
[DOMINIQUE] I don't
remember selling my freedom.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,250
[RUBINSKY]
A new Galactic Empire, huh?

321
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,500
[YANG] Thank you
for letting us join you

322
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,666
for dinner tonight, sir.

[GREENHILL]
It's been a delightful evening.

324
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,041
By the way, Vice Admiral.

325
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,833
Have you given any
thought to getting married

326

--and setting down?
--[FREDERICA gasps]

327
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,375
[YANG]
Not right now.

328
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,958
I'll think about it more
when peace arrives.

329
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,583
I had a friend
who died in battle

330
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,250
and left behind his fiancée.

331
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,875
[GREENHILL]
I'm so sorry.

332
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,041
[NEWS ANCHOR 9A] And now,
more on the representative

333
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,250
who won this past week's
election on Terneuzen.

334
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,583
Jessica Edwards
will be delivering

335
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,666
her inaugural speech
later today.

336
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,791
Edwards
is said to be the vanguard

337
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,208
of the anti-war movement.

338
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,291
[YANG]
Jessica?

339
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,666
[JULIAN]
Wait. I've seen her before!

340
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,958
That's the woman
who came to the house

341
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,666
while you were away
about a month ago!

342
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,750
[JULIAN] She said she
was an old friend of yours.

343
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,958
[NEWS ANCHOR 9A]
Edwards' nomination

344
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,458
only further emboldens
the movement.

345
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,791
[JULIAN]
Is there some kind of emergency?

346
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,750
[YANG]
I have no clue.

347
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,416
Wait inside the car.

348
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,416
[OFFICER 9A] I don't believe it.
You're Rear Admiral Yang Wen-li!

349
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,291
I never imagined I'd would get
to meet our national hero.

350
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,875
[YANG] That aside,
what's going on here?

351
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,250
[OFFICER 9A] I'm sorry. It
seems the Urban Traffic Control

352
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,375
Center's computer system
has malfunctioned.

353
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,125
[YANG]
How come?

354
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,125
[OFFICER 9A] I don't have
all the details myself,

355
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,375
but I hear it was human
error involving data input.

356
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,208
Anyway, just about every
workplace is short

357
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,791
on experienced
people these days.

358
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,208
[OFFICER 9A] I suppose
it shouldn't come as

359
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,750
a complete surprise.

360
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,875
[YANG] The war's affecting us in
ways we never even imagined.

361
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,208
[OFFICER 9A]
They're working on a fix,

362
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,916
but traffic systems in
this district will be down

363
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
for some time. I'd say
the next four hours, sir.

364
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,625
[YANG]
At the minimum?

365
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,916
[OFFICER 9A]
Yes. I know it's inconvenient.

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,041
[JULIAN] What do you think
we should do, Admiral?

367
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,041
[YANG]
Nothing we can do but walk.

368
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,458
[JULIAN]
Right!

369
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,125
[YANG] It's good exercise.
We'll be back in an hour.

370
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,458
[OFFICER 9A]
Wait a minute!

371
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,125
I can't allow the hero of
Iserlohn to walk home.

372
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,416
I'll send an aircar
to pick you up!

373
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,125
[YANG]
No need to be dramatic.

374
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,875
I can't be the only one who
receives special treatment.

375
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,166
[OFFICER 9A]
But, sir!

376
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,666
[YANG]
Let's go, Julian.

377
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,041
[JULIAN]
Aye-aye, sir!

00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,291
[OFFICER 9A gasps]

379
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,916
[YANG]
So, Jessica.

380
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,250
She didn't leave
any message for me?

381
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:05,458
[JULIAN] No. But she did seem
a little anxious when we spoke.

382
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,833
I kind of got the impression
there was something on her mind

383
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,125
she wanted to discuss
with you in private.

384
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,916
[JESSICA]
I see. Really.

385
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,208
So Yang adopted...

386
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,500
I'm sorry. I dropped
by without notice.

387
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,750
[JULIAN]
You're fine.

388
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:25,125
So, is there a message
you wanted me to relay?

389
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,583
[JESSICA]
No need, but thank you.

390
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,875
It wasn't anything
too important.

391
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,125
I'll be on my way.

392
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,416
[JULIAN] Oh. Well then,
please take an umbrella

393
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,041
[JESSICA]
Tell me something.

394
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,708
Do you want to become
a soldier when you grow up?

395
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,916
[JULIAN]
I do.

396
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,875
[JESSICA]
Right.

397
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,625
[JULIAN]
But it may not happen.

398
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,291
The admiral keeps telling
me that we'll have peace

399
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,208
by the time I'm an adult.

400
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,500
[JESSICA gasps]

401
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,541
[JULIAN] Could I at least get
your name to pass on to him?

402
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,041
[JESSICA] You can just tell him
that an old friend stopped by.

403
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,166
[JULIAN] In the end,
she just smiled and said,

404
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,125
"Please take care
of the admiral."

405
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,250
[YANG] It looks like you made up
your mind.

406
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,791
[JULIAN]
Admiral.

407
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,375
[YANG]
What is it?

408
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,333
[JULIAN] For a second, we were
both looking at the same star.

409
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,666
There. That big blue one.

410
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,958
[YANG]
Hmph.

411
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,916
[JULIAN]
Do you know what it's called?

412
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,333
[YANG] Its name is right
on the tip of my tongue.

413
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,583
Let's see...

414
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,833
[YANG] Julian, you know
you don't have to look

415
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,583
at the same star as me.

416
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,291
[JULIAN]
Huh?

417
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,625
[YANG]
Hmm.

418
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,041
[YANG] I believe every
person should take hold

419
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,083
of their own star,

420
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,625
no matter how unlucky
it may prove to be.

421
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,291
[JESSICA]
I have made my...

422
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,208
[JESSICA]
I have made my decision.

423
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:20,000
I will never again pretend that
I didn't see and didn't hear.

424
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,458
I'm finished being silent.

425
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,250
[JESSICA] That's the reason
I'm standing here today.

426
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,833
That's my purpose.

427
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,833
[JESSICA] It wasn't an easy
choice, becoming a politician.

428
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,291
As a simple teacher, I had my
doubts whether I was qualified

429
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,291
to run for office.

430
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:41,333
[JESSICA] But my mind is set,
and I have made a promise.

431
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:45,041
A promise to my late fiancé,
who sadly perished

432
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,250
in the Battle of Astarte.

433
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,541
[JESSICA] I used to think that
"history" was just "the past."

434
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,208
The only thing that
separated the two

435
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,291
was an extra coating of dust.

436
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,458
But I was mistaken.

437
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,958
[JESSICA]
The truth is...

438
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,458
...history is something we
create as we live our lives

439
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,041
in the present.

440
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:07,166
It doesn't belong only to the
names printed in history books.

441
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,625
[JESSICA] It's something each
and every one of us alive today

442
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:14,875
must strive to create.
Because every step we take--

443
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,375
pushes us further
into the future!

444
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:22,000
[applause]

445
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:25,125
[JESSICA] Our shared history up
to this point has been dominated

446
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,458
by the specter of war.

447
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,583
[JESSICA]
Where we go...

448
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,750
Whether we allow
this to continue...

449
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,291
That's a decision each of us
has to make on our own.

450
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,458
[JESSICA] Yes, there are
people who are adamant,

451
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,000
claiming we're
fighting a just war,

452
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,875
and that throwing these
lives away in the name

453
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,291
of justice is a noble act.

454
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,541
[JESSICA]
I ask you. What is justice?

455
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,666
And what's the meaning
of a noble act?

456
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,041
[JESSICA]
It's up to us.

457
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,208
We must decide on our own.

458
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:55,500
You who watch family members
leave for the battlefield.

459
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,708
You and I who've lost loved
ones on that battlefield.

460
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,166
[JESSICA] What I want,
is for those who hide away

461
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,500
somewhere safe and never
lose anything or feel pain,

462
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,625
to never again make
those important decisions

463
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,166
for the rest of us!

464
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,458
[JESSICA] Above all, I
want to keep asking those

465
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,708
in positions of
authority this question:

466
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,166
"Where are you
at this very moment,

467
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,666
while you send soldiers
to their deaths?

468
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,083
Where are you right now?

469
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,166
And what are you doing to help?"

470
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,583

Legend of the Galactic Heroes:
