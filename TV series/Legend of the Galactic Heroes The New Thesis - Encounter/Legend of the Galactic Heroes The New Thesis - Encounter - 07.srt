1
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,375
[FREDERICA]
The Rosen Ritter.

2
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,208
Its thirteenth
regimental commander

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,666
is Captain Walter von Schönkopf.

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,041
[YANG]
Go on.

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,416
[FREDERICA]
Of all their past captains,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,583
a total of six defected
back to the Empire,

7
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,166
and there are concerns he
may become the seventh.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,750
[WALTER]
You know I'm the unlucky 13th

9
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,541
captain of the Rosen Ritter.

10
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,083
There were six previous
who turned traitor.

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,958
What if I end up the seventh?

12
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,208
[SOLDIER 7A] Sending hull
number and crew ID codes.

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,000
Awaiting permission to dock.

14
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,500
[SOLDIER 7A] Request received,
permission granted.

15
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,791
Do either of you men
have any memories

16
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,916
of life in the Empire?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,291
I don't, I'm a
second-generation refugee.

18
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,166
My grandfather
came under suspicion

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,875
and was executed.

20
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,791
I see. It must
have been difficult for you.

21
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:10,458
I grew up under Imperial
rule until I was six.

22
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,333
I spent most of my time
with my grandfather.

23
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,041
[FREDERICA]
It's been ten minutes since

24
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,833
the task force entered port.

25
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,708
There has been no request
for rescue as projected

26
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,291
in the event of failure.

27
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,083
[FYODOR] Given the
lack of transmissions,

28
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,500
it would seem they were
successful in docking.

29
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,333
The good news is
we've cleared the first hurdle.

30
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,458
That's true.

31
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,208
All we need to do is clear
the rest with the same level

32
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,250
of success and we'll
be in perfect shape.

33
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,916
I am Lieutenant
Commander Laeken.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,875
Lieutenant Mann,
security captain.

35
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,625
Tell me what happened out there?

36
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,083
We were carrying out orders

37
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,791
assigned by
Admiral Mückenberger,

38
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,208
an espionage mission deep
within Alliance territory.

39
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,541
But unfortunately,

40
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,625
we were discovered,
and my unit was annihilated.

41
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,916
Amid the chaos,
I managed to obtain this.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,666
We were the only ones to escape.

43
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,666
This attaché contains
blueprints from the Alliance.

44
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,541
[LAEKEN] It appears
the rebels have come up

45
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,250
with an unbelievable plan.

46
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,041
A manner in which to
pass through the corridor

47
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,125
and neutralize
Iserlohn Fortress.

48
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,250
How is that remotely possible?

49
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,708
Unfortunately,
it doesn't stop at Iserlohn.

50
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,708
It could very well mean the
life or death of the Empire.

51
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,541
You must take me to the
fortress commander at once.

52
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,000
He's claiming the
Alliance intends to overtake

53
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,625
this fortress and
infiltrate the Empire?

54
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,291
Sir, if what
he is saying is the truth,

55
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,166
then the very purpose of
Iserlohn Fortress will be lost.

56
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,958
You think I don't
know the implications?

57
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,375
Have you made contact
with the garrison?

58
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,083
[ADJUTANT 7A] Our communications
remain hindered

59
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,125
by jamming signals.

60
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,166
Times like this
are precisely the reason

61
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,916
why we require a garrison, but
that fool Seeckt had to deploy!

62
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,291
Ready Thor's Hammer

63
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,541
and all additional
cannons for battle.

64
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,916
[ADJUTANT 7A]
Understood!

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,250
Before you do anything else,

66
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,875
I want you to bring me
the captain of that ship!

67
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,208
[ADJUTANT 7A]
Yes, sir!

68
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,833
[WALTER] So, once we've
made it into enemy territory,

69
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,666
what's the plan then?

70
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,583
[YANG] Our strategy
has a single objective.

71
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,708
Occupying the control room
inside Iserlohn Fortress.

72
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,583
If that weren't
already difficult enough,

73
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,583
the Alliance's map of the
fortress is incomplete.

74
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,166
So we're unable to pinpoint the
central control room's location.

75
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,208
There are five possibilities.

76
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,166
[WALTER]
Ah. And in order to find

77
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,666
which is the correct position,

78
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,000
we let the enemy
guide us to all of them.

79
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,333
[YANG]
Yes. Exactly right.

80
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,333
And if we can
accomplish that task,

81
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,416
we can take down any fortress,
no matter how fortified it is.

82
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,583
The same could be said
about winning a woman's heart.

83
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,500
It's all very easy
to talk about,

84
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,458
but difficult in execution.

85
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,541
[FREDERICA]
The nearest possible location is

86
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,666
7,300 meters from the port.

87
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,458
The furthest is 21,600 meters.

88
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,958
[FREDERICA] You'll have to cover
a vast distance in the fortress

89
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,583
while surrounded by enemies.

90
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,375
This is the second hurdle.

91
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,625
[WALTER] It requires
some acting skill, then.

92
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,708
[YANG]
Yeah.

93
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,916
[WALTER'S GRANDFATHER]
Walter.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Tell me, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

95
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,208
[WALTER]
What do you mean?

96
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,291
I'm a noble, Grandpa!

97
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,000
That is true.

98
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,250
You're a noble,
but does that mean

99
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,375
you can't be something
else, as well?

100
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,500
[MANN]
What's that on your wrist?

101
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,416
It appears to be a tattoo.

102
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,208
[MANN]
Tattoos on Imperial soldiers

103
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,708
are forbidden by military law.

104
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,916
[RAINER]
Well. This is...

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,625
[WALTER (LAEKEN)] Necessary
for the espionage mission.

106
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,875
It was required to gain the
trust of the Alliance soldiers,

107
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,750
which allowed us
to gather intel.

108
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,208
[WALTER (LAEKEN)]
Of course.

109
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,625
Now that the mission is over,
it will be removed.

110
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,125
[MANN]
I see. Forgive my indiscretion.

111
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,750
It's fine.

112
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,666
Lieutenant Commander Remler,

113
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,375
control room guard captain.

114
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:25,000
If you'll follow me, I'll take
you to the commander from here.

115
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:28,250
Firearms are prohibited
in the control room, understand?

116
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,875
Remove any weapons
in your possession

117
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,708
and place them in the dock.

118
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,125
Afterwards, you'll be examined
by the full-body scanner

119
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,916
in the next room.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,583
No exceptions,
even if you're operating

121
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,458
under the Space Chief Commander.

122
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,291
[FREDERICA] The third hurdle
will be the body scan.

123
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,333
You can't carry any weapons
into the central control room.

124
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:50,333
You'll be subject to thorough
checks to ensure you're unarmed.

125
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,583
[WALTER] Hmph. So,
what do you have in mind?

126
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,666
[REMLER]
Hold it!

127
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,291
Pardon me, sir.

128
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,250
[REMLER]
Hmm.

129
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,125
[WALTER (LAEKEN)]
It belonged to my grandfather.

130
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,083
I keep on my person at
all times for good luck.

131
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,541
It protects me.

132
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,000
[WALTER (LAEKEN)]
Is that all right?

133
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,541
[WALTER (LAEKEN)]
Thank you.

134
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,958
Lastly. I will need
to see your identifications.

135
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,750
I believe we sent those to you
when we entered port.

136
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,916
These are the rules,
no exceptions.

137
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,166
[REMLER]
Verification failure. 

138
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,000
I cannot allow you to
enter the control room.

139
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,500
How peculiar.

140
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,458
Might there be a problem
with the machine?

141
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,541
I can get
confirmation from Odin,

142
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,500
though the process
could take a while.

143
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,958
You would waste that much time?

144
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,500
We don't know when the
transmissions will even work!

145
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,166
Very well.

146
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,833
I'd be satisfied waiting
a month or two.

147
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,791
What is taking you so long?

148
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,958
His Excellency demands haste!

149
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,125
Yes, but, sir--

150
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,875
[ADJUTANT 7A]
That's enough! Bring them!

151
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,416
[REMLER]
Hmm? Understood.

152
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,625
[THOMA growls]

153
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,083
Where are they?

154
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,791
You took your time.

155
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,708
Explain what's going on!

156
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,916
[YANG] In order to take
the commander hostage,

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you'll need to acquire a weapon
inside the control room.

158
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,333
Admiral Stockhausen
should be able

159
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,416
to provide you with one.

160
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,291
In other words,
at this stage of the plan,

161
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,958
you'll have only your
own strength to rely on.

162
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,416
I hate to ask this of you,
but I have no choice.

163
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,083
Can you do it?

164
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,375
[WALTER]
Hmm...

165
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,458
You know...

166
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,666
...I'm sure I can
figure something out.

167
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,916
I knew you were a rebel!

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,125
[REMLER]
You scum!

169
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,416
Ahh!

170
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,916
[WALTER (LAEKEN) grunts]

171

[THOMA groans]

172
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,958
Apologies, Your Excellency,

173
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,041
but I'm afraid you
are now our hostage.

174
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:41,708
Commander!

175
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,958
[RAINER grunts]

176
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,833
Just who the
hell are you people?

177
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,875
I am Captain Schönkopf.

178
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,208
Leader of the Rosen Ritter
of the Free Planets Alliance.

179
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,333
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

180
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,125
[LINZ grunts]

181
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,958
[REMLER]
Did you say the Rosen Ritter?

182
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,041
I'm well aware of your regiment.

183
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,000
You're a pack of traitors
who abandoned the Empire!

184
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,083
I'm happy to know that

185
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,250
our reputation precedes us.

186
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,208
You bastards aren't on
the same level as Imperials.

187
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,375
Our commander fears dishonor
more than death at your hands.

188
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,833
[THOMA whimpers]

189
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,125
He doesn't seem to appreciate

190
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,125
your estimation of
his character.

191
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,875
[REMLER grunts]
What did you just do?

192
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,125
[FREDERICA] The final hurdle
will be how thoroughly

193
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,333
you can occupy the control room.

194
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,166
Even if I've secured
the fortress commander

195
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,583
as my hostage,

196
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,041
I doubt it will be enough
to fully take over.

197
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,250
Agreed.

198
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,208
All right, then
what should we do?

199
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,125
[WALTER]
Karl Seffle is a practitioner

200
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,041
of applied chemistry.

201
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,375
He invented a chemical for use
in mining and civil engineering

202
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,750
on a planetary scale.

203
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,958
It's something
like a gas that reacts to

204
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,375
a certain amount
of heat or energy,

205
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,958
setting off an explosion
with a controlled range.

206
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,833
Seffle particles?

207
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,458
That's right. Seffle Particles.

208
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,416
I can get those into the room.

209
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,625
[FREDERICA]
Captain.

210
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,916
Normal close range
combat is one thing,

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,333
but using it in a raid may
produce unexpected

212
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,583
and potentially
dangerous results.

213
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,916
The slightest misstep and all
of you could be caught in

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,250
the explosion and wind up dead.

215
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,875
If you have
any other suggestions,

216
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,250
I would love to hear them.

217
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,125
However, I suspect
you've known all along

218
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,333
this would be the only way.

219
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,458
Honestly. I kinda
wanted to continue

220
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:29,791
brainstorming safer alternatives
until the last possible minute.

221
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,500
[WALTER chuckles] A trusting
heart you've got there.

222
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,625
I only hope it doesn't claim
your life one of these days.

223
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,375
[WALTER (LAEKEN)] If you fire
now, the particles will ignite

224
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:44,083
and everyone who's in here will
be blown into space dust.

225
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,333
Seffle particles.

226
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,208
Don't do something foolish.

227
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,875
Doesn't the blood of the empire
flow through your veins as well?

228
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,208
If you choose to surrender,
we're prepared to make you

229
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,250
a generous offer in return.

230
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,625
Oh? You have my attention.

231
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,250
[OPERATOR 7A] Ninety minutes
have passed since infiltration.

232
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,541
[MURAI] That's far longer than
we had anticipated this taking.

233
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,833
I hate to be the one
who brings it up,

234
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,291
but do you think
Captain Schönkopf

235
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,250
became the seventh traitor?

236
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,875
[YANG] If that were the case,
the Empire would have already

237
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,791
located our fleet by now.

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,500
[YANG]
Captain Schönkopf accepted

239
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,083
the most dangerous role.

240
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,416
Don't forget.

241
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,541
I will continue to honor
my word and trust the man.

242
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,458
I'll admit, that's quite
an attractive offer,

243
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,916
but sadly, I must
refuse at this time.

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,500
I need to honor
my word to the man

245
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,500
who has placed his
full confidence in me.

246
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,041
Besides,
how can you expect me

247
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,041
to leave the Alliance when
there are still so many women

248
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,166
I haven't seduced yet?

249
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,083
[REMLER] Then you'll meet
your end with the rest of us.

250
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,541
If that's the way you want it.

251
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,208
[REMLER growls]

252
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,708
[THOMA]
Remler! Stop! Drop your weapon.

253
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,958
[REMLER]
But Excellency...

254
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,083
This is a formal surrender.

255
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,125
The fortress is
under your command.

256
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,875
Well, you heard the man.

257
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,000
[REMLER growls]
Damn it!

258
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,541
[WALTER (LAEKEN)] Hmph. A truly
wise decision, commander.

259
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,625
[WALTER'S GRANDFATHER]
There's nothing to be done.

260
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,875
It's pointless to discuss it.

261
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,375
A noble wasn't satisfied
with his own lineage

262
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,958
and grew power hungry.

263
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,166
So he decided to steal
our family's fortune.

264
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,500
On top of that,
he arranged a warrant

265
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,875
for my arrest on the
charges of thought crimes

266
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,125
against the emperor.

267
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,541
What's the next
course of action, sir?

268
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,500
[WALTER'S GRANDFATHER] Now, now,
there's no need to worry.

269
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,458
I've arranged for us
to seek asylum with

270
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,500
the Free Planets Alliance.

271
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,916
But aren't they
our enemy, Grandpa?

272
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,958
[RAINER] Captain? I cleaned
the blood off, but...

273
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,666
Thank you, but it'll be fine.

274
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,041
That pen was
a family heirloom, right?

275
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,458
[WALTER]
Hey, come on.

276
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,625
Every falsehood needs
at least one element of truth

277
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,750
present in order to sell it.

278
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:10,250
Men are one thing, but women
will always catch you otherwise.

279
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,625
[computers beeping]

280
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,583
[MURAI]
I owe you an apology.

281
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,000
I was concerned that
you might betray us.

282
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,208
It was wrong of me
to be doubt your loyalty.

283
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,500
That's good.

284
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,500
Having people suspect me
is just part of my job.

285
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,000
It doesn't bother me.

286
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,166
[WALTER]
Admiral.

287
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,166
Outstanding work, Captain.

288
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,291
As you instructed,
we've released sleeping gas

289
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:46,166
throughout the entire fortress
via the air conditioning system.

290
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,500
When they wake up, we'll have
500,000 prisoners.

291
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,375
Looks like everything
worked out fine.

292
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,333
Without a hitch, Admiral.

293
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,333
[SEECKT]
What?

294
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,541
There's been a mutiny
inside the fortress?

295
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,083
[SOLDIER 7B] Yes, a group
of soldiers has revolted!

296
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,541
Immediate aid has
been requested!

297
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,291
The man can't even keep
his subordinates under control?

298
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,375
Stockhausen,
you blundering fool!

299
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,083
[SEECKT] We must first stamp
out the fire at our feet.

300
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,625
All ships return to
Iserlohn at once.

301
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,583
[OBERSTEIN]
Please wait.

302
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,333
[SEECKT] Hmm. I don't recall
asking for your opinion,

303
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,291
Captain Oberstein!

304
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,000
While I am aware of that,

305
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,666
I wish to express
my views nevertheless.

306
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,833
This is clearly a trap.

307
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm starting to think
those artificial eyes of yours

308
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,833
see everything as an ambush.

309
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,125
Excellency. Listen to me.

310
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,125
Enough! All fleets turn around!

311
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,458
Head to Iserlohn Fortress
at combat speed two!

312
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,750
Those space moles will be
indebted to us after this!

313
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,916
[OBERSTEIN] Communications
have been disrupted for so long,

314
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,458
and he isn't even curious why
they're suddenly working again.

315
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,750
There's no point
talking to such

316
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,791
a small-minded bastard.

317
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,875
Full of anger and no reason.

318
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,000
[SOLDIER 7C] The enemy fleet
has entered firing range.

319
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,708
[SOLDIER 7D] Energy charge
to the fortress's main cannon

320
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,166
is complete.

321
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,250
[SOLDIER 7E]
Aim is set.

322
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,166
Ready to fire at any time.

323
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,916
Change the main cannon's angle.

324
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,666
Set it to seven degrees.

325
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,250
[FREDERICA gasps]

326
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,875
[MURAI] Forgive me, but at
that angle, the shot will only

327
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,166
succeed in grazing
the armada's left flank.

328
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,500
[YANG] They'll get the
message loud and clear.

329
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,208
Fire it.

330
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,208
[SOLDIER 7F]
They attacked their allies?

331
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,625
[SOLDIER 7G]
No. It must be the rebels!

332
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,833
[SOLDIER 7H] What do we do?
We can't fire back!

333
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,166
How do we escape Thor's Hammer?

334
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,833
[SEECKT]
Have they gone mad? Return fire!

335
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,375
Hit the fortress with
everything we have!

336
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,708
[YANG]
Change the main cannon's angle.

337
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,416
Target the fleet's right flank.

338
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,875
[YANG]
Fire again.

339
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,500
[WALTER] I think you'd be
hard-pressed to find anyone

340
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,583
who would call this combat.

341
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,250
"Massacre" is a word
that comes to mind.

342
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,541
[YANG]
You're right. It's one-sided.

343
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,458
We may have their base, but we
won't act like the Empire.

344
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,958
[YANG] Allow them the
opportunity to surrender.

345
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,750
If they refuse to do so,
advise them to flee

346
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,375
and we will not pursue.

347
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,875
[SOLDIER 7B]
Transmission from the fortress!

348
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,583
"Iserlohn has been
occupied by the Alliance."

349
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,958
But how?

350
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,166
[SOLDIER 7B "Further bloodshed
will benefit no one.

351
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,500
Surrender."

352
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,125
[SEECKT]
They must be joking!

353
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,166
[SOLDIER 7B] Also. "If you
refuse surrender, then flee.

354
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,125
We will not pursue. Alliance
Navy Rear Admiral Yang Wen-li."

355
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,541
[SEECKT gasps]

356
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,875
[SOLDIER 7B]
Your Excellency!

357
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,083
We've confirmed
an Alliance fleet behind us!

358
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,083
We'll be caught in
a pincer attack!

359
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,791
[SEECKT]
We're surrounded?

360
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,166
[SOLDIER 7B]
What shall we do?

361
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,333
We won't surrender
or run from Alliance scum!

362
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,875
To face the Kaiser after
losing the fortress and half

363
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:50,625
of our ships, that's a fate
worse than a thousand deaths!

364
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,083
[SOLDIER 7I] "You fail to
understand the heart

365
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,083
of a warrior. We know the
path of dying to preserve

366
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,083
our honor, but to live
in disgrace, we know not.

367
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,958
All of our ships
will henceforth charge

368
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,500
into an honorable death.

369
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,666
The only way to repay the
Kaiser's favor towards us."

370
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,208
You call that a warrior's heart?

371
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,958
[SOLDIER 7C]
All enemy ships are charging!

372
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,000
Can you identify
the garrison's flagship?

373
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,083
[SOLDIER 7J]
Yes, sir.

374
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,000
Then concentrate
all fire power on it.

375
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,958
This is the final barrage.

376
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,250
If they lose the lead ship,
the remainder will retreat.

377
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,541
Fire.

378
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,541
[gasps]

379
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,791
[SOLDIER 7C]
Enemy flagship destroyed.

380
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,416
All other ships are retreating
and leaving the front.

381
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,625
[SOLDIERS cheering]

382
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,208
Sub-lieutenant Greenhill.

383
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,458
[FREDERICA]
Yes?

384
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,583
Would you send a
transmission to the Alliance?

385
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,083
Tell them "It's over, we won and
if you ask me to do it again.

386
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,000
I can't." Take care of the rest.

387
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,625
I'm gonna go get some sleep

388
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,166
Understood, sir.

389
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,833
The heart of a warrior, indeed.

390
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,916
As long as men like him exist,
this war can't end,

391
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,250
and I've reached
my limit of dealing

392
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,208
with those types of soldiers.

393
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,791
[OBERSTEIN]
I suppose some will see me as

394
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,416
a coward and a runaway.

395
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,833
I'll certainly be the ideal
scapegoat for anyone looking

396
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,791
to preserve their reputation
after this debacle.

397
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,375
[OBERSTEIN]
Now, then.

398
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,666
[ADRIAN]
Oh?

399
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,833
So Iserlohn has fallen
into the Alliance's hands?

400
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,208
[BOLTIK] That is what's being
reported, Landesherr.

401
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:00,375
Who would have ever
predicted they'd be successful?

402
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:05,291
Yang Wen-li. I'm beginning to
find the man quite intriguing.

403
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,375
[ADRIAN] Contact Heinessen
and collect information on him.

404
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,708
Sir.

405
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,666
It would be
prudent of us to ascertain

406
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,958
what kind of man he is.

407
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,166
[JULIAN] "Iserlohn Fortress,
which we've sacrificed countless

408
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,000
lives and resources
attempting to overthrow,

409
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,500
was recently brought down
in a daring raid resulting

410
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,916
in zero causalities
to our side.

411
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,583
The brilliant strategy
that resulted in

412
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,208
the base's capture has truly
earned its architect the

413
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,875
titles 'The Unbeatable Magician'
and 'Miracle Yang.'"

414
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,416
Hear that?

415
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,958
[YANG]
Magic and miracles.

416
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,875
Those people have no
idea what I went through.

417
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,416
Still, this means I've done as
asked, and my work is complete.

418
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,291
[YANG]
Now I can request retirement

419
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,708
with a clear conscience.

420
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,750
[JULIAN]
Retirement plans aside.

421
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,458
I think you've earned the
praise everyone's giving you.

422
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,041
[YANG]
Uh-- Ah...

423
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,500
So why don't you
just let yourself enjoy it?

424
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,416
You're only praised for
as long as you continue to win.

425
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,125
But if I were
to keep on fighting,

426
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,500
I'd eventually lose.

427
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,333
Watching people's
attitudes shift would

428
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,666
be interesting, but only
if it was happening

429
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,541
to someone other than me.

430
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,291
[YANG]
By the way, Julian.

431
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,625
Yes, can I do something for you?

432
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:52,375
Well, for starters,
you can give me back

433
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:53,916
that bottle of brandy.
