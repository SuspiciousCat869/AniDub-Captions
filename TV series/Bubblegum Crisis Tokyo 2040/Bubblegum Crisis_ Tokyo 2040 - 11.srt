1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,958
- ( people chattering )

4
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,833
- HEY, MISTER.
WANT A DATE?

5
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,000
- SO I WAS
TELLING MY BOSS--

6
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,208
- ( screaming )

7
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,500
- All: HUH?
- ( screams )

8
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,416
- ( woman screams )
- ( crowd gasps )

9
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,875
- LOOK AT THAT!

10
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,208
- IT'S SOME KIND
OF A BOOMER!

11
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,750
- ( screaming )

12
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,708
- DAMN!  THAT RECREATIONAL
BOOMER'S GONE ROGUE.

13
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,625
- ( crowd screaming )

14
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,416
- DIE!  KILL IT!

15
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,083
( screams )

16
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,666
- OH, COME ON.

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,583
I'M NOT GOING TO
MAKE IT IN TIME.

18
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,250
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT THEY MADE ME

19
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,666
PULL DOUBLE OVERTIME
AT THE OFFICE AGAIN.

20
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,041
SYLIA, I'LL BE THERE
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

21
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,875
TWO MINUTES, I SWEAR!

22
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,833
- Sylia: I'm sorry, Linna.
I just sent Priss and Nene

23
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,708
out by themselves.
- OHH!

24
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,791
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY LEFT
WITHOUT ME AGAIN.

25
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,083
HUH?  OH, NO.

26
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,750
NOT NOW.  WHY ME?!

27
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,125
( groans )

28
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,458
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

29
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,458
WHY CAN'T I GET
JUST ONE BREAK?

30
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,541
HUH?

31
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,500
( sighs )

32
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,125
- ( groans )

33
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,458
- AND HOW WAS THAT?

34
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,791
- NOT TOO BAD.

35
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,125
- ( giggles )

36
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,875
- ALL RIGHT.  WHOO!
- ( cheering )

37
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,250
- HUH?
- ( applause )

38
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,125
- ALL RIGHT!
THANK YOU!

39
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,000
REALLY, YOU'RE TOO KIND.
BUT DON'T STOP.

40
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,791
- ( panting )

41
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,750
I'M FINALLY HERE.
( gasps )

42
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,166
- YOU SEE, PRISS?

43
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,625
I CAN DO THIS JOB JUST AS WELL
AS YOU AND LINNA CAN.

44
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,125
- ( sirens wailing )

45
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,791
- Priss: ARE YOU GONNA KEEP
PLAYING TO THE CROWD ALL NIGHT?

46
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,083
I'M LEAVING.

47
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,500
- WAIT FOR ME.

48
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,041
- WHOA!
- ( gasping )

49
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,458
- I GUESS I PUT
TOO MUCH STRESS ON IT.

50
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,500
HEY, WAIT.

51
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,750
THIS PART'S MANUFACTURED
BY GENOM.

52
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,083
- A PART IS A PART,

53
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,250
NO MATTER WHO
MANUFACTURES IT.

54
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,875
- YOU DON'T LIKE USING
A PART MADE BY GENOM, DO YOU?

55
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,500
- WELL, IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
I GUESS.

56
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,291
- ACTUALLY, GENOM PARTS
TEND TO BE

57
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,958
A LITTLE BETTER MADE
FOR THE MONEY.

58
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,708
- MACKY,
TORQUE WRENCH, PLEASE.

59
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,166
- OH, RIGHT, NIGEL.

60
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,541
HERE YOU GO.

61
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,500
- UH, HI THERE.

62
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,625
NENE'S BETTER THAN
SHE USED TO BE.

63
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,916
- Priss: IS SHE?

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,541
- YEAH.  A LOT BETTER.

65
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,625
AND THE TWO OF YOU HAVE
A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE

66
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,291
WORKING TOGETHER
AS A TEAM.

67
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,583
IT JUST FEELS LIKE
I'M BEING LEFT BEHIND.

68
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,916
- YOU NEED TO GIVE UP
THAT DEAD-END JOB.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,916
- WOW.
- WHAT?

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,083
- THAT ALMOST SOUNDED
LIKE YOU LIKE ME.

71
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,375
- ( sighs )

72
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,250
- BUT SERIOUSLY,

73
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,916
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE
TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS.

74
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,916
- AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,250
- MY PARENTS' PLACE.

76
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,875
MY MOM SAYS THERE'S
SOME BUSINESS

77
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,916
THAT SHE AND DAD HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT WITH ME.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,458
COULD YOU TELL SYLIA I'LL BE
OUT OF TOUCH FOR A BIT?

79
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,833
- I SUPPOSE I COULD.

80
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,458
- Quincy:
WATCHING MY BOOMERS WORK

81
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,166
GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE,
MASON.

82
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,791
- ON THE SUBJECT OF
THE SHOWEN PROJECT, SIR,

83
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,083
THE UMBRELLA WILL BE
COMPLETED ON SCHEDULE.

84
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,166
HOWEVER,
THERE IS A PROBLEM.

85
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,625
- A PROBLEM WITH
THE DRAGON?

86
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,958
- Mason: YES, SIR.

87
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,166
THE DRAGON IS NECESSARY
TO STORE THE ENERGY

88
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,625
SENT DOWN FROM
THE UMBRELLA. 

89
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,625
BUT CONSTRUCTION OF
THE UNDERGROUND CHANNELS

90
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,583
AND RESERVOIRS IS
RUNNING BEHIND SCHEDULE.

91
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,666
- I THOUGHT WE HAD TAKEN
THE EARTHQUAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

92
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,875
- IT APPEARS THAT THE SHIFTAGE
WAS MORE THAN EXPECTED.

93
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,000
IN ADDITION, THE NUMBER OF
BOOMERS AVAILABLE

94
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,000
TO WORK ON THE PROJECT
HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED.

95
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,291
- I SEE.

96
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,916
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS PROJECT
IS IMPORTANT?

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
- IT'S OUR SOLUTION
TO THE PROBLEM OF EARTH'S

98
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,666
DWINDLING ENERGY RESOURCES.

99
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,375
BY CONTROLLING A SOURCE
OF CHEAP, UNLIMITED POWER,

100
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,250
GENOM WILL BE ABLE TO
MANIPULATE THE WORLD'S ECONOMY

101
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,916
THROUGH OUR ENERGY
MANAGEMENT.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,333
- HMM.

103
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,041
DO YOU KNOW HOW I'VE
STAYED ALIVE LIKE THIS, MASON?

104
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,708
THE ANSWER IS MACHINES.

105
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,708
THERE IS NOTHING
THE BODY CAN DO 

106
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,250
THAT A MACHINE
CANNOT DO BETTER,

107
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,791
PROVIDED THAT THE MACHINE
IS NOT RESTRICTED

108
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,541
BY A LACK OF ENERGY.

109
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,583
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, MASON?

110
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,458
ONCE I BELIEVED THAT 
BOOMERS WOULD FREE US

111
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,458
FROM THESE ORGANIC PRISONS
WE'RE BORN IN.

112
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,375
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT,
I WAS WRONG.

113
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,916
BOOMERS WILL SERVE MAN
MANY WAYS,

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,458
BUT NOT AS THE PATH
TO IMMORTALITY.

115
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,750
THE UMBRELLA MY BOOMERS
ARE BUILDING

116
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,375
IS ALMOST COMPLETE.

117
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,083
THE SHOWEN PROJECT 
WILL GENERATE POWER

118
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,750
THE LIKE OF WHICH
HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN.

119
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,416
AND WITH THAT POWER,

120
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,750
I WILL CONTROL MORE THAN 
JUST THE WORLD'S ECONOMY.

121
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,500
THE NATURAL ORDER ITSELF

122
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,625
WILL BE BENT
INTO SUBMISSION.

123
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,416
WITH MY BOOMERS
AND THE LIGHTNING OF HEAVEN,

124
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
I SHALL BRING ABOUT
A NEW ORDER

125
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,291
TO WHICH ALL LIVING THINGS
ON THIS PLANET WILL BE SUBJECT,

126
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,750
OR THEY SHALL 
FEEL MY WRATH.

127
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,500
- MAMA?

128
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:58,833
MAMA?

129
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,291
- DREAM ON,
YOU SENILE OLD FOOL.

130
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,541
GET THE KNIGHT SABERS
FOR ME.

131
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,791
- ( chuckles )
WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR VIGILANTES

132
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,125
POACHED, FRIED,
OR SERVED ON A HALF-SHELL?

133
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,291
( clears throat )

134
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,458
UH, I'VE HEARD THAT
CHAIRMAN IS LOSING INTEREST

135
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,875
IN THE KNIGHT SABERS.

136
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,416
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET
THE AD POLICE HANDLE IT?

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,833
- I DON'T THINK
I ASKED FOR YOUR OPINION.

138
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,333
- I DELAYED CONSTRUCTION
OF THE DRAGON LIKE YOU WANTED.

139
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,875
I'LL GET THEM FOR YOU.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,833
( sighs )

141
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,583
- I DIDN'T THINK 
THE EXPRESS WOULD

142
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,916
GET ME HERE SO FAST.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,541
I'M TWO HOURS EARLY.

144
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,708
I SUPPOSE I COULD CALL.

145
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,625
BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY BUSY.

146
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,541
- A GEO-BATTERY?

147
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,750
SO ALL THIS DIGGING
HAS BEEN TO BUILD

148
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,541
A STORAGE VESSEL FOR THE POWER
THE UMBRELLA WILL GENERATE?

149
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,500
CHAIRMAN ROSENKREUTZ HAS
DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR.

150
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,750
- Yes.  However,
they've recently begun

151
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,500
slowing down construction
on the dragon project.

152
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,041
I believe you're
already acquainted

153
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,166
with the person in charge
of the operation.

154
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,583
- BRIAN J. MASON.

155
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,375
- I'M SORRY,
BUT DR. STINGRAY

156
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,291
IS IN THE MIDDLE 
OF AN EXPERIMENT.

157
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,666
YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD GIRL,
DON'T YOU?

158
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,208
AND A GOOD GIRL DOESN'T
BOTHER HER FATHER AT WORK,

159
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,583
DOES SHE?

160
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,083
GOOD GIRL.

161
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,000
- THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING MORE TO THIS

162
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,916
IF HE'S INVOLVED.
BUT WHAT?

163
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,250
- ( yawns )

164
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,458
- ( distant chattering )
- HUH?

165
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,958
- ( laughing )

166
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,083
- HELLO?

167
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,666
- ( laughing,
chatter continues )

168
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,916
- ( breathes deep )

169
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,875
I'M HOME.

170
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,500
- IS THAT HER?
- YEAH.

171
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:14,250
- AH, THE PRODIGAL RETURNS.

172
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,458
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S BACK, MAN. 

173
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,500
- LINNA, WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL SOMEONE

174
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,166
TO PICK YOU UP AT THE STATION?

175
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,833
- I'M SORRY, MOM.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE LATE.

176
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,000
- WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE
LIKE A KNOT ON A LOG, GIRL.

177
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,833
MAKE A PROPER GREETING
TO OUR GUESTS.

178
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,333
- ( groans )

179
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,041
PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES
FOR BEING LATE.

180
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,875
- I'VE HEARD YOU'RE
A CAREER WOMAN IN TOKYO NOW.

181
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,875
- SO, HAVE YOU FOUND
A BOYFRIEND YET?

182
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,208
- ( laughs ) GOD KNOWS
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ONE HERE.

183
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,958
- ( all laughing )

184
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,875
- I'LL TAKE BOOMERS
OVER MY RELATIVES ANY DAY.

185
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,791
- ( sighs )

186
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,125
- OH, I'M SORRY, MOM.

187
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,125
I WAS GOING TO HELP YOU
FINISH CLEANING UP, BUT--

188
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,250
- BUT YOU NEEDED A FEW
SECONDS TO YOURSELF.

189
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,000
I KNOW.

190
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,666
- I'VE JUST STARTED GETTING USED
TO BEING ON MY OWN IN TOKYO.

191
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,583
AND TO SUDDENLY COME BACK TO THE
MIDDLE OF ALL THIS IS WELL...

192
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,875
OVERWHELMING.

193
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,250
BUT I HAVE MISSED YOU
A LOT.

194
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,916
- AND HOW ARE THINGS
IN TOKYO?

195
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,458
ARE YOU EATING PROPERLY?

196
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,875
- I'M FINE.

197
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,875
- YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER
IS VERY HAPPY THAT YOU'RE BACK.

198
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,583
- AH?  HE DIDN'T SOUND
LIKE HE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME.

199
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,583
- WELL, HE'S NOT
THE KIND TO SHOW IT.

200
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,958
- NO KIDDING.

201
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,875
- ( chuckles )

202
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,041
THAT'S GOOD.

203
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,375
HOW LONG CAN YOU STAY?

204
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,708
- UNTIL TOMORROW.

205
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,041
NEW EMPLOYEES DON'T
GET VACATION TIME. 

206
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,833
I HAVE TO BE AT WORK
MONDAY MORNING.

207
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,958
- I REALLY WISH YOU COULD
STAY ONE EXTRA DAY.

208
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,041
YOUR FATHER AND I ALREADY HAVE
SOMETHING PLANNED FOR TOMORROW.

209
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,125
- I KNEW IT.

210
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,833
THIS IS ANOTHER 
OF DAD'S SCHEMES

211
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,833
TO FIX ME UP WITH
A NICE YOUNG MAN, RIGHT?

212
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,916
- WELL, ONE OF YOUR
FATHER'S CUSTOMERS 

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,916
HAS THIS SON--
- BUT I'M...

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,583
- HMM.

215
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,083
IS THERE SOMEONE 
SPECIAL IN TOKYO?

216
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,958
I KNOW YOU ALWAYS
USED TO SAY

217
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,750
THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS
THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR,

218
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,958
BUT THAT YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT IT
WAS WHEN YOU FINALLY FOUND IT. 

219
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,041
- AND I DID.
- HUH?

220
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,916
- I FOUND SOMETHING.

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,416
BUT NOW THAT I'VE FOUND IT,
I THINK I'M AFRAID OF

222
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,000
MAKING THE COMMITMENT TO IT.

223
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,625
- COMMITMENT IS
A SCARY THING. 

224
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,333
- YES, IT IS.

225
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,291
- Mason:
THE OLD FOOL WAS RIGHT.

226
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,166
THESE POWERED SUITS
ARE EXTRAORDINARY. 

227
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,333
MAYBE I'VE BEEN
MISSING SOMETHING.

228
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,250
DISPLAY DR. STINGRAY'S STAFF.

229
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,000
ELIMINATE ALL
CONFIRMED DECEASED.

230
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,458
HMM.

231
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,083
NIGEL KIRKLAND.

232
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,583
BOOMER ENGINEERING SECTION.

233
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,791
DO YOU KNOW HOW AND WHY
YOUR PROTOTYPE

234
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,375
WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED?

235
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,833
- NO, SIR.
I DON'T KNOW.

236
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,041
- THE TRUTH IS,
STINGRAY DIDN'T INTEND

237
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,208
TO CREATE AN
ORDINARY ANDROID.

238
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,708
- "MET"?

239
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,583
IT MEANS "DEATH" IN HEBREW.

240
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,791
- CORRECT.
BUT WATCH WHAT HAPPENS

241
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:35,041
WHEN I CHANGE THE PATTERN
THE WAY STINGRAY DID.

242
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,333
- "EMET."

243
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,000
SO "DEATH" IS CHANGED
INTO "TRUTH"?

244
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,708
- THE CREATORS OF
THIS TOWER OF BABEL

245
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,041
HAVE LABORED ON,

246
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,666
BUT THEY ARE MISSING
ONE KEY BIT OF INFORMATION.

247
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,416
THEY BELIEVE THAT
THE WORSHIP OF SOULLESS GOLEMS

248
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,750
IS THEIR PATH TO BECOMING
A LIVING GOD.

249
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,416
BUT I WILL FIND 
THAT MISSING KEY

250
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,583
AND WAKE IT.

251
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,083
FINDING THAT BOOMER
IS THE PURPOSE AND REASON

252
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,833
FOR WHICH I WAS BORN.

253
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,750
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

254
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,500
- NO, I DON'T.

255
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,208
- HOW COULD YOU?
YOU'RE A GOLEM. 

256
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,708
AN EMPTY SHELL.

257
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,833
FOR SO LONG I BELIEVED
THAT ROSENKREUTZ

258
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,083
WAS BOTH THE BIGGEST
OBSTACLE IN MY PATH 

259
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,208
AND MY GREATEST
POTENTIAL ALLY.

260
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,750
BUT PERHAPS I WAS WRONG.

261
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,916
- WHY COULDN'T YOU WEAR
THAT NICE KIMONO WE BOUGHT YOU?

262
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,791
- BECAUSE MY HAIR'S
NOT RIGHT FOR IT.

263
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,416
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, DEAR.

264
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,458
IT'S JUST A SIMPLE
INTRODUCTION.

265
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,208
- YOU'RE WRONG, MOM.

266
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,458
I WENT AHEAD AND CAME
TO SPARE YOU ANY EMBARRASSMENT,

267
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,083
BUT PLEASE DON'T PUSH ME
ANY FURTHER, OKAY?

268
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,750
MOVING TO TOKYO
WAS THE FIRST TIME

269
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,416
I EVER DID SOMETHING THAT
YOU AND DAD DIDN'T APPROVE OF.

270
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,250
I'VE GOT MORE THINGS
TO DO WITH MY LIFE

271
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,458
THAN MARRY SOME FARM BOY
AND START PUMPING OUT

272
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,791
GRANDCHILDREN ON COMMAND.

273
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,083
- NOW NOW, LINNA,

274
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,583
ALL YOUR FATHER AND I DID

275
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,291
WAS NOTICE A NICE YOUNG BOY--

276
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,416
- AND SET ME UP.

277
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,458
- EXCUSE ME.

278
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,708
YOUR GUESTS HAVE ARRIVED.

279
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,625
- I'M SORRY WE
KEPT YOU WAITING.

280
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,625
- NOT AT ALL.

281
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,541
- HMM.

282
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,291
- ( chuckles )

283
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,083
- OH?

284
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,000
( sighs )

285
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,708
SO YOUR NAME IS MASAKI?

286
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:48,958
- THAT'S RIGHT.

287
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,458
- I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.

288
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,625
I MEAN, BEING STUCK
WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME.

289
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,958
I CAN'T BELIEVE OUR PARENTS
WOULD TRY TO SET US UP

290
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,500
LIKE THIS.

291
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,708
- ( chuckles ) I'M NOT VERY
HAPPY WITH MY PARENTS EITHER.

292
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,041
- I KNOW.  I MEAN,
WHAT DO THEY THINK WE ARE?

293
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,416
- SINGLE.

294
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,041
BUT I MUST SAY, YOU'RE A
LOT NICER THAN I IMAGINED.

295
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,000
MY MOTHER WAS SAYING THAT YOU
WORK FOR A COMPANY IN TOKYO. 

296
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,875
- UM, YES.
I JUST STARTED.

297
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,333
- THAT'S GREAT.
I WENT TO COLLEGE THERE.

298
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,000
YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY.

299
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,833
- YEAH.  I GUESS I AM.

300
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,875
- I WAS THERE
RIGHT AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE.

301
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,833
THE PLACE WAS FULL OF BOOMERS
AND CONSTRUCTION EVERYWHERE. 

302
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,500
BUT MY FATHER NEEDED HELP
MANAGING HIS BUSINESS,

303
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,750
SO I CAME BACK HOME AS SOON 
AS I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE.

304
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,583
ON THE OTHER HAND, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU WENT TO TOKYO

305
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,750
TO GET AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY,
DIDN'T YOU?

306
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,666
- WELL, KINDA SORTA,
I GUESS.

307
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,041
- WAS IT REALLY
SO BAD HERE?

308
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,708
- BAD?

309
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,375
WELL, YEAH.

310
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,375
IT WAS LIKE TEENAGE HELL.

311
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,875
IN 20 YEARS I NEVER ONCE LIVED
UP TO ANYONE'S EXPECTATIONS.

312
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:55,083
THE ORIGINAL ROUND PEG
IN A SQUARE HOLE, THAT'S ME.

313
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,208
- I COULDN'T WAIT TO LEAVE.

314
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,791
BUT THE FUNNY THING IS,
NOW THAT I MAY HAVE FOUND

315
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,000
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,

316
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,708
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO NOW.

317
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,875
TO BE HONEST, I'M KIND OF
ENVIOUS OF YOU, MASAKI.

318
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,375
BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

319
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,041
I KEEP WONDERING IF I'M
GOING TO SCREW EVERYTHING UP.

320
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,125
- OR EVEN WORSE,

321
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,500
FIND OUT THAT THE THING
YOU WANTED ISN'T THERE ANYMORE.

322
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,458
- HUH?

323
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,791
- ( gasps )

324
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,416
I GUESS I GOT A LITTLE
TOO PERSONAL THERE.

325
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,750
- UM, YEAH.

326
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,416
CONSIDERING THAT
WE JUST MET.

327
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,375
- IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

328
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,583
MAYBE OUR PARENTS
AREN'T SO DUMB.

329
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,750
- ( sighs )

330
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,791
- HA HA!

331
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,750
YEAH, I'M OUT OF HERE.

332
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:47,958
COME ON, WEASEL.

333
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,583
- MORNING, NENE.

334
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,625
- MORNING.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

335
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,625
( humming )

336
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,625
( grunts )

337
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,291
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
I'M GOING HOME.

338
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,458
- SORRY.
YOU'RE NOT FINISHED YET.

339
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,791
- YOU WANT TO BET?

340
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,083
- YOU'RE OUR TOP VIDEO EXPERT,
AREN'T YOU?

341
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,750
- YOU KNOW I AM.

342
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,791
- IN WHICH CASE,
WE HAVE A PIECE OF VIDEO

343
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,500
THAT WE'D LIKE YOU
TO TAKE A LOOK AT.

344
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,708
- WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
THAT I HAVE TO WORK LATE?

345
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,166
- CLANDESTINE VIDEO
OF THE KNIGHT SABERS.

346
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,458
- SOMEBODY SENT IT
IN ANONYMOUSLY

347
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,875
AND WE'D LIKE TO 
HAVE IT ANALYZED.

348
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,125
- ( sighs )

349
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,666
OF ALL THE PEOPLE HERE,

350
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,666
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO 
KEEP PICKING ON ME?

351
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,791
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
- NEVER MIND.

352
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,791
BUT I GUESS I'LL DO IT
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU, LEON PEON.

353
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,791
- HEY, WAIT. DID YOU JUST
CALL ME "LEON THE PEON"?

354
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,958
- I REALLY WANTED
TO GO HOME.

355
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,208
- FUNNY SOUNDS ARE ONE THING,

356
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,500
BUT I DON'T LIKE
THE IMPLICATIONS OF

357
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,541
LEON THE PEON.

358
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,791
- BUT I DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE, DO I?

359
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,541
- ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
- DOWN, BIG FELLA.

360
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,000
SHE'S DOING YOU A FAVOR.
JUST LET IT GO.

361
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,708
- I THOUGHT
"LEON NOODLE" WAS BAD,

362
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,000
BUT THIS IS JUST TOO MUCH.

363
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,500
- I'M LEAVING NOW.

364
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,333
- HEY, WAIT.
I NEED YOUR SUPPORT HERE.

365
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,500
- OH, WOW.

366
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,708
WHOEVER TOOK THIS
IS A GREAT PHOTOGRAPHER.

367
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,000
( chuckles )

368
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,500
OH, AWESOME.

369
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,166
I REALLY AM GETTING GOOD.

370
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,875
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

371
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,166
THIS TAPE IS
A LITTLE TOO GOOD

372
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,916
TO BE THE WORK
OF AN AMATEUR.

373
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,458
WHOEVER IT WAS
WHO TOOK IT

374
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,041
MUST HAVE BEEN 
WAITING FOR US.

375
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,250
- ( siren blares )

376
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,375
- Man: MAY I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION PLEASE.

377
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,208
WE HAVE A CLASS EIGHT SITUATION.
- HUH?

378
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,875
- ALL DISPATCHERS REPORT
TO THE COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

379
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,750
- ( crowd screaming )

380
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,875
- I CAN'T LEAVE.
I'M ON DUTY.

381
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,208
- Priss:
WHAT'S THE TARGET?

382
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,375
- IT APPEARS TO BE
SOME KIND OF MILITARY BOOMER.

383
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,625
ALL WE KNOW RIGHT NOW

384
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,375
IS THAT IT'S DESTROYING
EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.

385
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,541
- THEN I GUESS WE'LL BOTH
BE PUTTING IN SOME OVERTIME.

386
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,541
- ( chuckles )
OH, WOW.

387
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,541
IS IT REALLY
LIKE THAT IN TOKYO?

388
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,791
- SURE IT IS.

389
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,125
- AFTER HEARING
A STORY LIKE THAT,

390
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,083
I'M WONDERING IF
I SHOULD HAVE LEFT.

391
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,416
- ( giggles )

392
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,875
- ( phone beeping )

393
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,041
- OH, EXCUSE ME.

394
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,250
- Nene:
LINNA, WHERE ARE YOU?

395
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,750
- WHAT?
HASN'T PRISS TOLD YOU YET?

396
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,166
- Nene:
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

397
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,583
LOOK, I'M STUCK ON DUTY
AND WE'VE GOT BIG TROUBLE.

398
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,333
PRISS IS ON HER WAY,
BUT THERE'S NO WAY

399
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,458
SHE CAN HANDLE THIS
ONE BY HERSELF.

400
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,750
- BUT I CAN'T COME.

401
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,916
I...

402
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,750
- ( theme music playing )

403
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

404
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,541
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS: TOKYO 2040",

405
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,041
THE BOOMER CONTINUES
ITS RAMPAGE,

406
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,041
DESTROYING HUGE
SECTIONS OF THE CITY

407
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,541
AS THE ARMY AND AD POLICE
PROVE UNABLE TO STOP IT. 

408
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,875
ALONE AND RUNNING
OUT OF POWER,

409
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,000
PRISS TRIES FRANTICALLY
TO DESTROY THE MONSTER.

410
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,583
NENE RACES AGAINST TIME,

411
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,541
TRYING TO UNLOCK THE SECRET
BEHIND THE BOOMER'S ARMOR,

412
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,041
BUT PRISS HAS ONLY
MINUTES LEFT TO LIVE.

413
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,000
NEXT EPISODE...
