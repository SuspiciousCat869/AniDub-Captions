WE'VE PLAYED AROUND,
BUT I LIKE THIS CLUB.

that makes Sekiria different

00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,041
from other bands?

10
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,000
- IS IT DIFFERENT
FROM OTHER BANDS?

11
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,750
- Mmm... So what's the
inspiration for your songs?

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,875
- I DON'T KNOW.
RIDING MY BIKE, I GUESS.

ONE EVEN IF WE DID.

LIKE YOU, PRISS.

00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,708
AND I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU
THAT I MISS IT SOMETIMES.

BUT WHY WOULD YOU
HATE US LIKE THAT?

00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,791
- YOU JUST SAID IT.
IT'S THE "WE."

82

83

AND APART FROM THE REST OF US?

IT THAT WAY.

85
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,750
- AND THE MOST PATHETIC PART
IS THAT YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE

YOU'RE WEARING TODAY.

THE HARDSUIT UPGRADES
ARE ALL FINISHED,

105
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,250
SO WHAT'S HE UP TO?

106
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,083
- WELL, ACTUALLY, HE'S
MAKING A MOTORCYCLE.

107
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,208
- A MOTORCYCLE?
HM, HOW INTERESTING.

108
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,958
- OF COURSE, IT'S NOT 
AN ORDINARY MOTORCYCLE.

109
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,166
HE'S PUTTING IT TOGETHER
A PIECE AT A TIME,

110
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,166
AND HE MACHINED
THE ENGINE PARTS HIMSELF.

111
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,916
IT'S UNBELIEVABLY POWERFUL!

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,250
BUT IT'S ALSO
INCREDIBLY RESPONSIVE.

113
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,375
OF COURSE, THAT'S GOING TO
MAKE IT WAY TOO TRICKY

114
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,041
FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON
TO OPERATE.

115
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,250
THAT'S WHY I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT HE'S MAKING IT FOR PRISS.

116
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,166
- FOR PRISS?

117
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,875
- YEAH, SHE HANGS AROUND A LOT.

118
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,166
AND I THINK SHE AND NIGEL
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON, YOU KNOW?

119
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,625
- ( gasps )

120
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,166
- WELL, NEITHER OF THEM
TALK VERY MUCH.

121
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,708
THEY BOTH LOVE MACHINES.

122
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,791
Macky: SOMETIMES, I THINK THEY
COMMUNICATE TELEPATHICALLY.

123
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,958
- ( groans )

124
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,958
MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF WE ATE IN SILENCE.

125
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,875
- OH, I'M SORRY, SYLIA.

126
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,791
- ( sighs )

127
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,125
- Macky:
SYLIA?

128
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,833
- I WASN'T LIKE THIS.
I WASN'T THIS WAY BEFORE.

129
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,875
- SYLIA, I STILL LOVE YOU.

130
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,375
- WHAT?

131
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,583
- I LOVE YOU, THAT HASN'T
CHANGED SINCE THE DAYS BEFORE.

132
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:47,625
BUT SYLIA, I THOUGHT THAT IF I
CAME HERE IT COULD BE THE SAME.

133
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,083
- THAT'S RIGHT, NOTHING
HAS CHANGED.

134
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,083
- BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE IT WAS BEFORE.

135
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,625
AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WAS
DIFFERENT, SOMEHOW.

136
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,000
BUT IT'S NOT ME, IT'S YOU.

138

- Linna: I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE STILL EATING.

158
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,166

I LOVE THESE THINGS!

159
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,541
( phone ringing )

160
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,708
- HUH?

161
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,000
WELL I'LL BE,
IT'S A MESSAGE FROM PRISS.

162
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,083
- OH? WHAT DOES SHE SAY?

163
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,458
- THAT IF WE WANT TO SEE HER,

164
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,333
SHE'S SINGING AT
HOT LEGS TONIGHT.

165
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,500
BUT WE'D HAVE TO PAY
THE COVER CHARGE TO GET IN.

166
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,083
SEE, I SAID SHE WOULDN'T COME.
SHE NEVER DOES.

167
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,333
I'VE TRIED BEFORE,
BUT SHE'S JUST WEIRD.

168
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,625
- WELL I GUESS I UNDERSTAND.

169
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,333
SOMETIMES YOU
JUST DON'T FIT IN.

170
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,291
( laughing ) BUT I'LL BET
SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND.

171
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,583
- A BOYFRIEND?!
( laughing )

172
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,291
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT PRISS?

173
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,208
- ( gasps ) ARE YOU SAYING
SHE SWINGS THAT WAY?

174
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,166
- HUH?  SWINGS WHAT WAY?

175
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,583
- I MEAN, DOES SHE LIKE... 
GIRLS?

176
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,708
- ( laughing )

177

YOU'RE WEIRD, LINNA!

178
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,666
- Nene: I DON'T REALLY KNOW
THAT MUCH ABOUT HER,

179
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,875
BUT I KNOW SHE USED TO BE
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE.

180
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,708
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED.

181
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:24,708

WHAT?

182
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,291

I THINK HE DIED.

183
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,208
- Linna:
 OH, HOW DID HE DIE?

184
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,041
- Nene: I DON'T KNOW, BUT I
HEARD THAT THAT'S THE REASON

185
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,916
 SHE SINGS WITH THAT BAND.

186
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,125
HEY! YOU WOULDN'T TELL PRISS
THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS,

187
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,041
WOULD YOU, LINNA?

188
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,916

about the world we live in?

190

Mhmm, okay. If you weren't
a singer, what would you do?

191
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,208
- I THINK I'D JOIN THE KNIGHT
SABERS-- BLOW THINGS UP.

192
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,166
- Reporter: I see, and what
does singing mean to you?

193
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,250
- SINGING? IT MEANS
THAT I'M ALIVE.

194
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:09,458
THAT I'M NOT DEAD AND BURIED,
THAT'S ALL.

that's fused with a racer

- ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US?!

212
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,166
- I'M SORRY, BUT THIS BOOMER
IS MOVING INCREDIBLY FAST

213
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,000
AND I HAVE TO FLOOR IT
JUST TO CATCH UP WITH IT.

215
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,375

ABOUT IT.

I THINK THE TWO OF YOU
CAN HANDLE THIS.

MAYBE WE CAN KEEP IT OUT

- Macky: DON'T WORRY, PRISS
SHOULD BE HERE ANY SECOND.

( screams )

250
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,000
- Macky: WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO ROAD TEST IT YET,

251
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,791
SO DON'T OPEN
THE THROTTLE COMPLETELY.

252
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,166
EVEN SO, YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE
TO CATCH UP TO THAT BOOMER

253
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,958
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
IT UNDER CONTROL.

254
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,083

THANKS, KID.

00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,500
CONTAINED ON THE BELTWAY.

00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,541
SO WE'LL CUT ACROSS TOWN

260
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,041

- Macky: OKAY, PRISS.
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.

266
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,875
CHECK YOUR READOUTS.
YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU'VE GOT

267
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,458
A MOTOSLAVE FEEDBACK MODE
SHOWING IN YOUR VISOR.

268
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,291
- FEEDBACK?

269
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,750
- Macky:
 THAT'S RIGHT.

270
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,416

GUIDANCE SYSTEM INTERFACES

272
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,708
THAT WILL ALLOW YOU

273

TO RECONFIGURE THE SLAVE'S
AIRFRAME ON THE FLY.

274
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,625

ABOUT HALF THAT,

275
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,291
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

DID SHE SAY "RAM?"

282

IS GOING TO RAM IT!

283

GOING IN TOO FAST!
