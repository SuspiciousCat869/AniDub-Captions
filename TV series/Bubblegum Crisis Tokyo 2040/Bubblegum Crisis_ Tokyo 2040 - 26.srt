1
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,666
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,875
- ( sighs )

4
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,833
HAS THE ENTIRE STATION
BECOME GALATEA?

5
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,541
- Linna: NENE?
- MMM?  WHAT, LINNA?

6
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,250
- HOW MUCH LONGER WILL OUR SUITS
BE ABLE TO OPERATE?

7
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,916
- I DON'T KNOW.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,333
THE POWER RESERVES
ARE ALMOST DRAINED.

9
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,541
- IF WE BOTH
POOLED OUR POWER TOGETHER,

10
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,708
COULD WE GET BACK?
- NO.

11
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,541
IT MAY LOOK
LIKE WE'RE NOT MOVING,

12
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,500
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY
FLYING TOWARD EARTH

13
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,208
AT THE SPEED OF THE EXPLOSION.

14
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,916
AND AS WE GET CLOSER TO EARTH,

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,166
ITS GRAVITY WILL PULL US IN.
- WHAT?!

16
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,750
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT WE'RE
GOING TO CRASH INTO THE EARTH

17
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,500
OR BURN UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE?

18
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,000
I WON'T BELIEVE IT!
I WON'T!

19
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,666
- Nene: IT'S POSSIBLE.

20
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,458
- NO! I WON'T ACCEPT IT.
THINK, NENE.

21
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,958
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

22
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,458
- IT'S ALL UP TO PRISS NOW.

23
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,625
- ( Priss panting )

24
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,458
( grunts )

25
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:03,291
GALATEA!

26
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,583
WHAT THE HELL?

27
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:13,166
- ( rumbling )

28
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,625
GODDAMN BOOMER!

29
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,291
- ( chattering )
- HUH?

30
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,958
AH!  GOD DAMN IT.
GET THE HELL OUT!

32
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:29,958
AHH! GET OUT OF MY MIND!

33
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,708
OH!

34
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,666
( shouting )

35
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,250
( grunting )

36
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,541
( roaring )

37
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,583
- ( squeaking )

38
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,208
- HELLO.

39
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,416
- ARE YOU SYLIA?

40
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,333
- THAT'S RIGHT.
MY NAME IS SYLIA STINGRAY.

41
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,166
WHO ARE YOU
AND HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

42
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,708
- WHO AM I?

43
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,333
DON'T YOU KNOW?

44
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,083
DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

45
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,125
- MMM?

46
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,666
- UH, SORRY.
MY NAME IS PRISCILLA.

47
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,041
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME PRISS.

48
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:34,000
- OH, THAT'S PRETTY. YOU HAVE
A VERY NICE NAME, PRISS.

49
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,000
- WHERE ARE WE?

50
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:41,041
- THIS IS MY MOTHER'S HOUSE,
BUT SHE'S NOT HOME RIGHT NOW.

51
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,875
- Priss:
AM I SOME KIND OF MEMORY?

52
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:48,625
SOMETHING GALATEA COPIED
FROM INSIDE SYLIA'S BRAIN.

53
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,708
- Galatea: THE HUMAN BRAIN
IS MERELY A SYSTEM

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,041
FOR THE STORAGE
OF ELECTRICAL IMPULSES.

55
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,708
TRANSFERRING SUCH DATA INTO A
SIMPLE VESSEL SUCH AS YOURSELF

56
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,375
IS CHILD PLAY.
- WAIT.

57
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,416
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"TRANSFER INTO"?

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,500
- SYLIA'S NEURO PATTERNS
FORMED MY VOOMER CORE.

59
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,708
NOW THE OPPOSITE WILL OCCUR
AS YOU BECOME MY ANTI-SEED

60
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,041
AND ABSORB THE INFORMATION

61
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,708
WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN TO
DOWNLOAD INTO YOU.

62
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:14,333
YOU WILL BECOME A PART OF ME,
A HUMAN COMPONENT.

63
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,166
YOUR MIND AND BODY
ARE BECOMING ONE WITH ME.

64
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,333
YOUR ORGANICS WILL
BE SUPPLEMENTED

65
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,625
BY VOOMER COMPONENTS.

66
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,291
AND LIKE SYLIA,

67
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,541
YOU WILL SIMPLY BECOME
ANOTHER FACET OF MY MEMORY.

68
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,875
- NO!  STAY AWAY FROM ME!
- ( chattering )

69
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:42,208
- ( grunting )

70
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:47,166
OH!  OH!  AHHHH!

71
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,166
- ( airplane passing )

72
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,250
- WHAT'S WRONG?

73
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,000
- WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

74
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,291
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO FROM HERE.

75
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,125
ALL OF OUR ARMIES
AND WEAPONS,

76
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,208
AND IN THE END,
THE FATE OF MANKIND

77
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,875
ENDS UP DEPENDING UPON
A HANDFUL OF YOUNG WOMEN.

78
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,250
IT'S SO IRONIC.

79
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,291
- LET'S GO.

80
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,458
SYLIA WANTS TO TAKE MACKY
BACK TO THEIR OLD HOME.

81
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:24,166
- ( door opens, closes )
- ( airplane passes )

82
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,125
- Linna: OKAY, NENE,
WE'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE HERE.

83
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,125
LET'S PUT THOSE BRAINS TO WORK.

84
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,875
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
WE CAN GET TO EARTH SAFELY.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,291
- Nene: HARDSUIT,
I'M RELEASING YOU

86
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,875
FROM THE RESTRAINTS
ON YOUR FORM AND FUNCTION.

87
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,666
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

88
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,791
- CAN YOU SEE
THE IMAGE IN MY MIND?

89
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,708
- ( gasps )

90
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,375
NENE, WHAT DID YOU DO?

91
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,333
- AN AIRFOIL--
TRANSFORM YOUR SUIT.

92
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,041
- TRANSFORM IT?  HOW?

93
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,000
- WITH YOUR MIND.

94
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:15,291
- HARDSUIT, MERGE YOUR MIND INTO
MINE AND BECOME ONE WITH ME.

95
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,416
LET NENE ALTER YOUR SHAPE.

96
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,416
PRISS?

97
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,625
- Priss:
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

98
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:53,458
HAVE I BECOME PART
OF GALATEA?

99
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,208
ARE THESE THINGS I'M SEEING

100
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,875
THROUGH HER EYES?

101
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,833
WHAT IS THAT?

102
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,916
NENE AND LINNA?

103
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,541
WE'RE STILL ALIVE.

104
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,208
IT'S NOT OVER.

105
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,958
NOT YET!

106
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,125
( grunting )

107
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,166
I AM NOT PART OF YOU!

108
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,708
I AM DIFFERENT.

109
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,875
( grunting )

110
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,083
- Galatea: FOREIGN SUBSTANCE
DETECTED IN THE BODY.

111
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,208
IMMUNE SYSTEM ACTIVATE.

112
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,166
- ( grunting )

113
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,083
GALATEA!

114
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,333
I'M COMING FOR YOU!

115
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,291
- ( alarm sounding )
- NO!  NO!

116
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,208
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

117
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:43,375
OXYGEN-- HOW LONG UNTIL THE AIR
IN MY SUIT RUNS OUT?

118
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,208
MAYBE A FEW MINUTES
IF I'M LUCKY.

119
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,166
I-- I DON'T WANT
TO DIE THIS WAY.

120
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,500
- ( grunting )

121
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,041
NENE?

122
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:26,041
- Nene:
JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

123
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,000
- ( heartbeat )

124
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,208
- Male voice: YOU NEED POWER.

125
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,458
- WHAT?

126
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,583
- RELEASE THE RESTRAINTS
THAT HOLD ME

127
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,583
AND I CAN HELP YOU.

128
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,375
- UH, I'D BE GLAD TO DO IT,

129
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,875
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

130
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,583
- ( alarm sounding )
- THAT WAS SUFFICIENT.

131
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,208
- ( whirring )

132
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,250
- MY CREATOR BOUND ME
TO YOUR THOUGHTS.

133
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,041
YOU HAVE RELEASED ME.
- WHO ARE YOU?

134
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:25,500
- I WAS CREATED
TO SERVE YOU, PRISS.

135
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,708
- YOU'RE MY MOTOSLAVE.

136
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,166
- ( chanting ) AHHHHH.

137
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,041
- Priss: YOU REALLY ARE ALIVE,
AREN'T YOU?

138
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,125
- YES, I AM CAPABLE
OF INDEPENDENT ACTION.

139
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,791
HOWEVER, MY POWER RESERVES
ARE RUNNING LOW

140
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,125
AND I WAS DAMAGED
WHEN THE SKY HOOK CRASHED.

141
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,208
- Priss: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S FINISH HER OFF

142
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,166
BEFORE SHE REALIZES
WE'RE NOT DEAD.

143
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,708
MOTO, YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

144
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:12,291
BUT I'VE GOT
TO DESTROY GALATEA.

145
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,916
ARE YOU WITH ME?

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,250
- I WAS CREATED
TO AID AND PROTECT YOU, PRISS.

147
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,500
YOU ARE THE ONLY MASTER
I SERVE.

148
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,000
- DON'T CALL ME THAT.

149
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,375
INTELLIGENT BEINGS
CAN'T OWN EACH OTHER.

150
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,500
- ( Galatea
continues chanting )

151
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:43,625
- AHHHH!

152
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,833
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEARN

153
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,666
WHAT THE OTHER HALF
OF BEING ALIVE IS LIKE!

154
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,541
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO DIE,
GALATEA!

155
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,958
- Galatea: WHY?

156
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,833
WHY DO YOU PERSIST
LIKE THIS?

157
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,791
WHY DO YOU WISH TO REMAIN
AS A HUMAN BEING?

158
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,333
AS LONG AS YOU REMAIN HUMAN,

159
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,333
YOUR MIND AND BODY
CANNOT EVOLVE.

160
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,208
WHY DO YOU
RESIST YOUR DESTINY?

161
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,083
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

162

( chanting ) AHHHHH!

163
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,750
- Priss: WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS SHE FALLING APART?

164
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,375
- Moto: INCORRECT.

165
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,708
SHE IS SPEEDING UP
HER EVOLUTION.

166
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,458
- ( beeping )
- PRISS!

167
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,708
- ( grunting )

168
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,916
- ( Galatea chanting )

169
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,666
- Moto: PRISS,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

170
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,916
- YOU'VE GOT IT WORSE THAN ME.

171
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,833
- YOU MUST HURRY.
POWER SUPPLY DIMINISHING.

172
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:32,833
- AHHHH!

173
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,916
- ( sighs )

174
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,583
- AHHHH!

175
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:57,291
- MOTOSLAVE, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M THINKING OF, DON'T YOU?

176
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,875
- AFFIRMATIVE.
- GOOD.  LET'S DO IT.

177
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,583
- AS YOU WISH.

178
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,416
- AHHHH!

179
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:40,083
AHHHHHH!

180
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:48,458
- GALATEA, I'M SORRY
IT HAD TO COME TO THIS.

181
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,791
MOTOSLAVE!

182
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,875
- ( Galatea chattering )

183
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,500
- Galatea:
TO DIE,

184
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,250
TO REPRODUCE,

185
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,166
TO BE REBORN.

186
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,416
THE ENDLESS CYCLE
OF DEATH AND RESURRECTION.

187
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,958
THAT IS THE EVIDENCE
OF GOD.

188
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,875
- ( booming )
- ( sighs )

189
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,916
- ( Galatea chattering )

190
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,416
- Galatea: AT LAST
I HAVE FOUND THE PATH.

191
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,583
AT LAST I UNDERSTAND.

192
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,916
WHEN PRISS ENTERED MY BODY,

193
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,541
WHEN MY THOUGHTS WERE PASSED
INTO PRISS'S BRAIN--

194
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:24,208
INFINITE WISDOM
REQUIRES INFINITE PERSPECTIVE.

195
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,041
ONLY BY EXPERIENCING
EACH ELEMENT,

196
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,125
EACH MOMENT SEPARATELY
AND IN THEIR OWN TIME,

197
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,291
DOES THE BEAUTY OF THE WHOLE
BECOME APPARENT.

198
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,833
IT IS THE CYCLE THAT IS THE
REAL NATURE OF THOUGHT.

199
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,833
- ( mutters )

200
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,833
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

201
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,458
- MMM.

202
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,416
IT IS, LIKE A BIRTH.

203
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,750
- ( pinging )

204
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,125
- ( giggling )

205
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,958
- THIS IS CRAZY!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

206
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,875
- AS TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS
OF NEUTRINO PARTICLES

207
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,500
CONTINUE TO BE OBSERVED,

208
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,750
THE GOVERNMENT IS URGENTLY
TRYING TO ORGANIZE A COMMITTEE

209
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,083
TO INVESTIGATE
THE CAUSING OF THIS PHENOMENON.

210
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,500
- Galatea: PRISS?

211
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,541
DON'T YOU WANT TO GO HOME?

212
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,750
- I WANT TO,
BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

213
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,916
- YOU GAVE ME A GIFT.

214
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,333
NOW PLEASE ACCEPT MINE.

215
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:14,041
- Sylia: MACKY?
ARE YOU--

216
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,958
MACKY!

217
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,166
