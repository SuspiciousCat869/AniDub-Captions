1
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:43,125
- ( Boomers
banging into glass )

4
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,333
( banging continues )

5
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,458
- PRISS, LINNA, NENE,
COME ON.

6
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,416
- Linna: RIGHT.

7
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,208
- ( banging )

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,166
- ( screeches )

9
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,333
- WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHY SHE'S SENDING THEM

10
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,416
TO ATTACK US NOW.

11
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,083
- BECAUSE WE'RE HERE.

12
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,625
NOBODY ELSE IS.

13
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:05,041
- THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME
WE GET TO CHANGE IN THIS ROOM.

14
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,458
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HAVE
BEEN PRETTY CRAZY, HAVEN'T THEY?

15
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,458
- THEY SURE HAVE.
- ( banging on glass )

16
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,916
- ( both gasp )

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,375
- OH, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

18
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,833
GO AWAY!

19
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,625
- THEY'RE JUST BOOMERS.
WHO THE HELL CARES?

20
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,416
- ( banging )

21
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,875
- Linna: WE'RE NOT ALL
EXHIBITIONISTS, PRISS!

22
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,375
- HURRY UP! IF THEY BREAK THAT
WINDOW AND FLOOD THE ROOM,

23
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,833
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO SUIT UP.

24
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,375
- RIGHT.
PRISS AND I WILL SUIT UP FIRST.

25
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,291
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

26
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,625
- YEAH.

27
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,625
- SO HERE WE GO
INTO BATTLE,

28
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,541
BUTT-FRIGGIN' NAKED.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?

29
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,541
- ( grunts )

30
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,041
- KEEP YOUR MIND OPEN.

31
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,000
I KNOW THAT YOUR CUTS
AREN'T HEALED YET,

32
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,708
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT RECEPTIVE
TO THE SUIT,

33
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,833
THE INNER METAL WON'T BE ABLE
TO SET PROPERLY.

34
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,375
- I UNDERSTAND.

35
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,208
( grunting )

36
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,541
- ( banging continues )

37
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,208
- ( cracking )

38
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,125
- OOH!

39
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,458
- ( rumbling stops )

40
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,458
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE THEY DOING OUT THERE?

41
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,583
- Sylia:
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

42
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,416
- IT WON'T HOLD MUCH LONGER.

43
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,500
CAN EVERYONE HERE SWIM?

44
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,125
- AHEM.

45
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,541
- Nene: I CAN DOG PADDLE.

46
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,291
- Linna: LOOK AT THE GLASS.
- HUH?

47
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,333
- ( glass smashing ) 
- IT'S GOING TO GO!

48
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,250
- THAT ONE'S GOING TO GO TOO!

49
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,041
- Priss: WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?! COME ON!

50
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,958
- ( gasps )

51
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,666
- ( grunts )

52
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,625
- COME ON, MACKY!

53
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,291
- Linna: SYLIA!

54
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,666
- LET'S GO.

55
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,333
- ( inhaling )

56
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,041
- GO AHEAD.

57
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,541
- Nene: YOU TOO, MACKY.

58
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,333
- ( grunting )

59
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,708
- OH, CRAP!
- NENE!

60
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,916
I THOUGHT
YOU COULD DOG PADDLE?

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,583
- NOT VERY WELL.

62
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,166
- HERE WE GO NOW.
READY? UP!

63
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,291
- ( panting )

64
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,041
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

65
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,541
- FOR MY AGE,
I'M DOING REMARKABLY WELL.

66
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,625
- LET'S GO.
- OH!

67
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,458
- HUH?

68
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,541
- Leon:
MY GOD, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

69
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,208
- ( fighting sounds continue )

70
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,500
- IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?

71
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,333
- Leon:
WELL, WE'RE ALL ALIVE.

72
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,833
- WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?

73
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,750
- Nene: SOMETHING DISGUSTING!

74
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,708
- Sylia: IT'S NOT JUST THIS
BUILDING. LOOK DOWN THERE!

75
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,958
- ( gasps )

76
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,916
LOOK AT THE CITY.

77
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,875
IS THIS REALLY TOKYO?

78
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,583
- Linna: IT'S AS IF A
COMPLETELY NEW ECOSYSTEM

79
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,291
SPRUNG UP OVERNIGHT.

80
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,750
- Nigel: IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

81
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,958
- GALATEA DIDN'T TARGET US.

82
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,958
SHE ABSORBED THE WHOLE CITY.

83
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,250
- ( rumbling ) 
- ( all screaming )

84
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,208
- NOW WHAT?

85
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,166
- Linna: ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE?

86
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,375
- NO, WORSE!

87
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,166
WE'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW!

88
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,041
- YOU NEED A LIFT?

89
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,291
- HOLD ON.

90
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,583
- ( grunts )

91
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,416
- ( rumbling )

92
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,541
- Nene:
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS!

93
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,375
- Linna: JUST AS I THOUGHT.

94
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,875
- Nigel: GALATEA
MUST HAVE EXTENDED

95
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,250
A BRANCH OF A DRAGON LINE

96
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,666
BENEATH THE BUILDING.

97
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,166
- ( Brian shuddering )

98
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,750
OH, YES.

99
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,291
AT LAST.

100
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,041
SO LOVELY, SO EMPTY.

101
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,208
EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

102
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,708
AH, THIS IS WHAT I WANTED,

103
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:44,208
WHAT I'VE DREAMED OF
FOR SO LONG.

104
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,833
AH.

105
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,708
( laughing )

106
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,625
- ( beeping )

107
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,500
- ( children playing )

108
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,416
- Boy: GIVE ME THE BALL!

109
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,458
- HEY! 
- GO, GO!

110
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,291
- ( whimpering )

111
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,083
- ( suit whirring )

112
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,791
- Sylia: PLEASE TELL ME
I DIDN'T SEE THAT.

113
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,708
- Priss: YOU DID.

114
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,625
- Leon: NO MATTER WHERE WE GO,
IT'S ALL THE SAME.

115
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,291
- Priss: SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

116
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,541
- Sylia: THERE'S ONE PLACE
THAT MIGHT STILL BE SAFE.

117
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,375
- HA!

118
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,958
MAN, I'M STIFF.

119
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,083
- MMM, AT LAST.

120
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,875
- LOOKS LIKE
IT HASN'T GOT THIS FAR YET.

121
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,041
- Sylia: THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE
I COULD THINK OF

122
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,541
THAT MIGHT NOT BE AFFECTED.

123
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,375
THE GROUND WATER LEVEL
IS SO HIGH

124
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,541
THAT THE DRAGON LINE
COULDN'T BE EXTENDED HERE.

125
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,833
AND YOU DON'T NEED BOOMERS
IN A PARK.

126
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,500
- HOLD ON.

127
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,125
SHOULDN'T THERE
AT LEAST HAVE BEEN

128
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,041
SOME CLEANING OR
MAINTENANCE BOOMERS?

129
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,750
- THEY WERE PROBABLY SET
TO RETURN TO A GARAGE AT NIGHT.

130
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,000
SO IF THERE WERE ANY HERE,
THEY'RE GONE NOW.

131
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,666
- IF YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT,

132
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,958
THEN WE OUGHT TO BE SAFE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

133
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,333
- THAT'S GOOD.

134
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,750
AT LEAST
WE COULD GET SOME REST.

135
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,958
- ( both chuckle )

136
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,833
- ( twigs breaking )
- WHAT'S THAT?

137
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,625
- ( shuddering )

138
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,750
- MAN, YOU SCARED THE HECK
OUT OF US.

139
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,875
- Sylia: I CAN'T BELIEVE
THERE'S ANYONE

140
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,333
STILL IN THIS CITY
BESIDES US.

141
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,458
- ( shuddering )

142
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,458
BOOMERS!
- BOOMERS?

143
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,041
I THINK WE MAY
HAVE A PROBLEM HERE.

144
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,500
- LOOK.
- LET'S GET 'EM.

145
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,833
- WHEN THE EVACUATION ORDERS
CAME,

146
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,916
WE DIDN'T BELIEVE
THAT THEY WERE REAL.

147
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,583
AND WHEN WE SAW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

148
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,125
IT WAS TOO LATE TO GET OUT.

149
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,375
THE BOOMERS WERE EVERYWHERE.

150
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,333
- ( panting )

151
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,583
- WE TRIED WALKING,

152
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,500
BUT THE ROADS WERE ALL BLOCKED
OFF BY BOOMERS.

153
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,791
AND WHEN THE BUILDINGS
ALL STARTED TO TURN AS WELL,

154
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,625
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PLACE
LEFT TO HIDE.

155
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,625
- ( panting )

156
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,333
- AS NEAR AS WE CAN TELL,
THIS PARK IS THE ONLY PLACE LEFT

157
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:52,333
IN THE ENTIRE CITY
THAT IS FREE OF BOOMERS.

158
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,041
FAR TOO MANY OF US
DIDN'T MAKE IT HERE IN TIME.

159
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,791
HMM?

160
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:02,208
- TA-DA!
HOW DO I LOOK?

161
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,166
( laughs )

162
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,625
- JUST FINE.  HUH?

163
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,250
- ( both chuckling )

164
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,041
- Leon: I SEE.

165
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,541
SO EVERYONE WHO COULDN'T GET OUT
DURING THE EVACUATION

166
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,666
HEADED FOR THIS PARK?
- YES.

167
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,125
WE'RE PROBABLY
THE LAST 50 PEOPLE IN TOKYO.

168
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,125
- THAT MANY OF YOU?
- YES.

169
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,375
BUT IT'S NOT SO MANY
WHEN YOU CONSIDER

170
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,041
HOW MANY OF US DIDN'T MAKE IT.

171
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,416
MORE TEA?

172
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,041
- YOU'RE A STRONG MAN.

173
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,666
- ACTUALLY, I USED TO BE
A REAL JERK.

174
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,708
I REMEMBER MY MOTHER
ALWAYS USED TO SAY

175
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,750
THAT GOD HELPS THOSE
WHO HELP EACH OTHER.

176
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,750
AND HE DID LEAD US
TO THIS PARK.

177
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.

178
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,958
BUT COMING HERE WAS MY IDEA,
YOU KNOW.

179
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,500
- BECAUSE YOU SLEPT HERE
WHEN YOUR WIFE KICKED YOU OUT.

180
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,750
- AH!
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO ADD THAT!

181
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,666
- ( men all laughing )

182
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,083
- I HOPE YOU LADIES
CAN FORGIVE US

183
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,416
AFTER MISTAKING YOU
FOR BOOMERS.

184
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,125
- WELL, I REALLY CAN'T BLAME YOU
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

185
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:19,125
- YEAH, AND IT'S NOT AS IF WE'VE
KEPT A HIGH PROFILE, IS IT?

186
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,375
- BY THE WAY,
THANKS FOR THE FOOD AND COFFEE.

187
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,375
YOU'RE AWFULLY KIND TO BE
SHARING THEM WITH US LIKE THIS.

188
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,583
- DON'T WORRY.

189
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,333
YOU CAN GO HUNTING WITH US
TO PAY IT BACK.

190
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,875
- HUNTING?

191
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,250
- Man: YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT WE CALL IT.

192
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,208
- ( bottles rattling )

193
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,208
- THIS ISN'T HUNTING,
THIS IS LOOTING.

194
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE MAKING ME DO THIS.

195
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,000
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
A POLICE OFFICER, DAMN IT.

196
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,708
- SHH.  THE BOOMERIZATION LINE
IS RIGHT DOWN THE STREET.

197
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,375
YOU CAN COMPLAIN LATER.

198
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,208
- I KNOW,
IT JUST BURNS MY ASS.

199
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,083
- ( humming )

200
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,875
( gasps ) THE BOOMERS!
THE BOOMERS ARE COMING!

201
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,166
AAH!

202
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,500
- TIME TO GO.

203
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,041
- ( grunts )

204
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,708
- RUN!

205
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,416
- ( men laughing )

206
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,708
- HEY, THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

207
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,666
- YEAH, THAT'S MY SPECIAL BLEND
OF SIX DIFFERENT KINDS OF CURRY.

208
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,458
I ADDED A SQUIRREL
FOR SOME FLAVOR.

209
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,541
- YEAH, I'M IN
THE CLOTHING BUSINESS TOO.

210
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,916
- LIAR! I KNOW FOR A FACT

211
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,916
YOU WORK AT YOUR UNCLE'S RUBBER
GALOSHES FACTORY.

212
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,541
- ( Sylia chuckling )

213
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,583
- HERE YOU GO.

214
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,666
- THIS STUFF IS GREAT.

215
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,750
YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR BOOZE,
MISTER.

216
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,291
- OH, I'VE HAD A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE.

217
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,250
- ( men laughing )

218
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,250
- ( sighs )
- HMM!

219
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,708
- WELL, YOU'RE REALLY
PUTTING THAT STUFF AWAY.

220
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,375
BUT DON'T WORRY,
WE'VE GOT LOTS MORE.

221
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,291
SO YOU HELP YOURSELF
TO ALL YOU WANT.

222
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:18,041
- ( men chattering )

223
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,500
- YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE THE KIND
WHO GIVES UP EASILY.

224
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,458
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS NOW?

225
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,625
- I'M NOT SURE YET.

226
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,208
I'M STILL TRYING TO COME UP
WITH A PLAN OF ACTION.

227
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,458
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

228
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,500
- Nigel: TOKYO'S ALMOST
COMPLETELY TAKEN OVER NOW.

229
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,916
IT WON'T BE POSSIBLE
TO GO HUNTING ANYMORE.

230
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,083
YOU'D BETTER LEAVE
WHILE YOU CAN.

231
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,791
- IF WE CAN LEAVE.

232
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,333
- ( chattering )

233
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,875
- ( silent )

234
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,541
- ( men laughing )

235
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,333
- ( gulping )

236
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,791
( sighs )

237
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,541
AND THEN THAT-- THAT PERVERT
PUT HIS HAND ON MY THIGH.

238
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,416
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?!

239
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,583
- SOUNDS LIKE A REAL JERK
TO ME.

240
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,916
- THAT'S RIGHT!

241
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,416
MEN ARE SUCH PIGS.
- UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH, YEAH.

242
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,166
- ( moans, laughs ) PRESENT
COMPANY EXCEPTED, OF COURSE!

243
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,750
- JEEZ, HOW MANY OF THOSE THINGS
HAS SHE HAD ALREADY?

244
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,958
- ( chattering continues )

245
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:29,166
- ( laughing )

246
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,166
- ( beeping )

247
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,125
- SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING.

248
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,000
I THOUGHT YOU FINISHED
YOUR BACKUPS.

249
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,250
- ( beeping )

250
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,250
- HMM?

251
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:20,625
- THAT'S SYLIA'S
CLASSIFIED FILE, RIGHT?

252
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,458
- ( laughing )

253
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,958
- WHAT'S WRONG, MACKY?

254
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,833
- ( evil chuckling continues )

255
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,458
- Nene: MACKY!

256
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,250
- ( theme music playing )

257
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

258
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:06,250
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040,"

259
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:10,208
LIKE A MULTI-HEADED SERPENT,
THE BRANCHES OF THE DRAGON LINE

260
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,791
BECOME THE ARMS
WITH WHICH GALATEA SEEKS 

261
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,875
TO CRUSH THE LAST
VESTIGES OF RESISTANCE

262
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,125
REMAINING IN THE CITY.

263
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,000
ONLY THE KNIGHT SABERS REMAIN,

264
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:21,125
MANKIND'S LAST DEFENSE
AGAINST THE NIGHTMARISH SPAWN

265
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,791
OF MAN AND MACHINE.

266
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,458
BUT CAN EVEN THE SABERS DEFEAT
A BEAST WITH A MILLION EYES

267
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,458
AND THE MIND
OF AN INSANE CHILD?

268
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,916
NEXT EPISODE...
