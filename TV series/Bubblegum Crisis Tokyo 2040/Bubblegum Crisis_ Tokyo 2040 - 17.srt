( grunting )

7
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,250
- ( grunting )

8
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:06,916
OUT!

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,916
- ( panting )

10
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,000
- ( all shout )
- HUH?

11
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,916
- All: OH...

12
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,958
- AH?

13
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,916
( gasps )

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,791
THE UNDERGROUND POWER SYSTEM
HAS BEEN SHUT OFF!

15
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,625
- ( Boomers approaching )

- ( people chattering )

19
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,958
- TV Announcer:
AND FOR ONLY 29.8, YOU CAN...

20
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,791
- SO, WHAT ARE YOU
 DOING NEXT MONTH?

21
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,291
- ( both slurping )

22
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,750
- I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON
WHAT THE UNION WORKS OUT.

23
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,458
- OH, DON'T BE SO NAIVE.

24
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,625
THERE'S NO WAY THE POLITICIANS
ARE GOING TO ACCEPT OUR DEMANDS

25
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,541
IF THE FINANCING'S
NOT ALREADY THERE.

26
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,333
SO WHAT WILL YOU DO
WHEN WE'RE ALL MERGED

27
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,708
BACK INTO THE NORMAL
POLICE DEPARTMENT?

28
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,708
- MM.

29
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,500
- HMM.

30
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,125
I MIGHT GO BACK HOME
AND HELP MY FOLKS RUN THE FARM.

31
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,000
- SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN
TO BE COPS.

32
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,500
THEY WON'T EVER BE HAPPY
DOING ANYTHING ELSE, I GUESS.

33
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,625
- HMM?

34
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,583
- OH, THINKING OUT LOUD.

35
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,958
AHH.

36
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,833
- THE THING THAT REALLY GETS ME
IS THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE

37
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,500
THAT THIS IS JUST A PREFACE
TO SOMETHING EVEN BIGGER,

38
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,166
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

39
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,333
- WELL, I DON'T THINK WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO WAIT MUCH LONGER.

40
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,791
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

41
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,625
- WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IT SEEMS
LIKE WAY TOO MANY THINGS

42
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,916
ARE ALL HAPPENING
WAY TOO CLOSELY TOGETHER

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,750
FOR IT TO JUST BE
A COINCIDENCE.

44
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,125
WHY WOULD GENOM CUT
OUR FUNDING NOW?

45
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,875
ROGUE BOOMER INCIDENTS ARE
GOING UP, NOT DOWN.

46
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,291
IT JUST STINKS.

47
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,375
- MAYBE THEY JUST DECIDED THAT
THE KNIGHT SABERS ARE

48
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,875
DOING A BETTER JOB
THAN THE A.D. POLICE WERE.

49
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,500
HEY, MAYBE THE KNIGHT SABERS
HAVE REALLY BEEN CONTROLLED

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,708
BY GENOM ALL ALONG.

51
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,041
- NO, THE KNIGHT SABERS ARE
ON OUR SIDE.

52
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,750
- HUH?
- UH, I THINK.

53
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,708
IT'S JUST A FEELING
THAT I HAVE.

54
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,500
GENOM'S THE ONE 
BEHIND ALL THIS.

55
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,291
- ( device beeping )
- HUH?

56
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,541
LEON HERE.

57
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,541
OH, HI, MARIA.
- WHAT?

58
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,375
NICK ROLAND'S DAUGHTER?

59
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,708
- UH, I HATE TO BOTHER YOU,

60
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,041
BUT I WAS HOPING THAT YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO TELL ME

61
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,541
WHERE MY FATHER IS.

62
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,041
I'VE BEEN PAGING HIM
FOR THREE HOURS.

63
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,333
- THAT'S STRANGE.

64
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,875
HE SHOULD STILL BE
AT THE OFFICE.

65
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,583
AT LEAST UNTIL
THE NEXT SHIFT CHANGE.

66
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,916
- MM, YEAH, COVERING FOR
EVERYONE WHO'S OUT ON STRIKE.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,250
- Maria: WELL, I WAS WATCHING
THE NEWS AND THEY SAID

68
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,916
THAT THE A.D. POLICE
HEADQUARTERS HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,250
AND EVERYONE HAD LEFT.

70
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,416
I TRIED CALLING THERE,
BUT NO ONE EVER PICKED UP.

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,625
- Leon: THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

72
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,166
NICK NEVER IGNORES THE PHONE.

73
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,583
- I KNOW, AND HIS
SATELLITE PHONE KEEPS GIVING ME

74
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,791
A "NOT IN TRANSMISSION"
RANGE CODE.

75
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,458
WELL, IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

76
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,708
IT'S JUST NOT LIKE HIM.
WELL, THANKS.  BYE.

77
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,166
- HMM.

78
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,333
- News Reporter:
AND IN TODAY'S NEWS,

79
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,958
TOKYO'S A.D. POLICE
WENT ON STRIKE.

80
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,750
WHEN POLICE UNION 
AND CITY OFFICIALS

81
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,666
PROVED UNABLE TO AGREE
ON A NEW REVISED...

82
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,041
- Leon: I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

83
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,041
- News Reporter:
...THE NORMAL POLICE...

84
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,958
- ( rumbling )
- ( growling )

00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,958
- ( Nick groaning )

86
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,625
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO IF
THERE ARE EVEN MORE BOOMERS

87
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,791
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR?

88
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,916
- Nene: I'VE LOCKED ALL
THE FIRE DOORS

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,916
THROUGHOUT THE FIFTH FLOOR,

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,166
SO YOU'LL BE OKAY FOR NOW.

91
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,916
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG THEY'LL HOLD.

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,541
- AREN'T YOU FINISHED YET,
ROLAND?

93
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,500
- ( groaning )
IT'S...

94
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,083
IT'S OPEN!

95
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,750
OH, AHH.

96
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,958
- ( all yell )

97
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,000
- ( screaming )

98
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,000
AAH, THEY'RE COMING UP
THE ELEVATOR SHAFT!

99
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,541
- ( growling )

100
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,541
- AAH!

101
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,208
- COME ON.

102
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,000
( groaning )

103
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,958
- THIS SUCKS!

104
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,916
- Nick: MOVE IT, YANO!
- HUH?

105
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,000
AAH!

106
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,166
- ( men grunting )

107
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,166
- I CAN'T...

108
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,000
- Nene: MR. ROLAND,
YOU'VE GOT TO HURRY!

109
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,666
THAT WALL WON'T HOLD UP
MUCH LONGER.

110
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,666
AND THERE ARE ALREADY 
BOOMERS ON YOUR FLOOR.

111
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,291
- AHH, IT'S HOPELESS.

112
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,375
LET'S GET BACK UPSTAIRS
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

113
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,250
GOD, YANO, WILL IT KILL YOU
TO HAVE A SALAD...?

114
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,041
OKAY, WE'RE IN THE EAST WING.
HOW MANY MORE BOOMERS ARE THERE?

115
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,041
- I'VE COUNTED APPROXIMATELY
230 BOOMERS ALREADY.

116
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,166
AND THEY'VE OCCUPIED UP THROUGH
THE THIRD FLOOR.

117
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,500
BUT THEY'RE STILL ADVANCING,

118
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,833
AND THE RESTRAINING WALLS
AREN'T STOPPING THEM.

119
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,041
YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE QUICKLY!

120
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,708
NO, WAIT A SECOND!
DON'T GO THAT WAY, SIR.

121
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,125
- ( roars )

122
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,125
- AAH!

126
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,041
DAMN.  WAIT, HOLD IT.

127
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,250
I SUCKED.
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

128
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,333
- DO YOU WANNA TAKE A BREAK?

129
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,958
- NO, I'M COOL.

130
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,583
- WELL, OKAY,
ONE MORE TIME THEN.

131
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,833
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

132
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,833

- ( Boomers growling, moaning )

134
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,625
- THE FACT THEY CAN
READ OUR MINDS--

135
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,208
WHAT THE HELL ARE
THESE THINGS?!

136
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,583
- TROUBLE.
AND THEY'VE GOT US SURROUNDED.

137
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,333
( grunting )
EAT THIS!

138
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,291
AAH AAH AAH.

00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,291
AAH!

140
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,458
- UH.  OH.

141
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,833
MY CLIP'S JAMMED!

142
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,166
AAH.

143
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,166
( grunts, yelps )

144
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,041
- ( grunts )
- YANO!

145
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,083
- OH.
( yelps )

146
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,416
AAH!

147
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,041
- ( grunts )

148
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,208
- Nene: DIRECTOR YANO!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

149
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,708
- YEAH, FINE.
I'M JUST SCARED TO DEATH!

150
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,958

- ( metal clanking )

152
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,125
- OKAY, THE PUBLIC RELATIONS
SECTION IS DOWN THE HALL.

153
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,833
I'LL OPEN THE PASS-THROUGH AND
THEN YOU CAN TAKE THE STAIRS UP.

154
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,875
- RIGHT, BUT WE'RE GETTING
SOME BIGGER GUNS FIRST.

155
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,041
DAMN, JUST AMMO.

156
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,875
IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET
THE PHONES WORKING AGAIN?

157
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,541
OR MAYBE THE RADIOS?
- I'M AFRAID NOT.

158
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,375
AS LONG AS THE FIREWALL'S UP,
WE'RE COMPLETELY CUT OFF.

159
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,208
- SO IS THERE SOME WAY
TO LIFT IT?

160
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,875
- UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

161
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,708
NOT AS LONG AS THOSE BOOMERS ARE
STILL RUNNING AROUND, ANYWAY.

162
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,291
THE FIREWALL WILL STAY UP
AS LONG AS THE SENSORS

163
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,541
DETECT UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL
IN THE BUILDING.

164
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,041
- AHH, THAT'S JUST GREAT!

165
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,458
- WAIT A SECOND!
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

166
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,750
ARE YOU SAYING THAT OUR
SECURITY SYSTEM IS DESIGNED

167
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,125
TO TRAP US IN HERE LIKE RATS?

168
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,083
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- SAY WHAT?!

169
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,916
- THE IDEA WAS THAT IF THE
BUILDING WAS ATTACKED

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,250
BY TERRORISTS,

171
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,083
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY
WERE CONTAINED IN HERE

172
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,041
UNTIL WE COULD DEAL
WITH THEM PROPERLY.

173
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,041
NOBODY EVER ANTICIPATED
A SITUATION

174
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,041
WHERE THERE WOULDN'T BE A FULL
STAFF INSIDE THE BUILDING.

175
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,625
- OKAY, I CAN SEE THAT.

176
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,625
BUT WHY DID YOU LOCK OFF
THE COMMUNICATIONS?

177
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,208
- BECAUSE WE'RE HARDWIRED INTO
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE,

178
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,416
THAT'S WHY.

179
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,000
- GENOM DESIGNED THIS SYSTEM,
DIDN'T THEY?

180
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,458
- AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
( grunts )

181
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:21,041
- CAN'T YOU SEE? WHAT IT MEANS
IS THAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,

182
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,666
THAT WE'VE BEEN WRITTEN OFF
AS EXPENDABLE.

183
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,000
WHICH COULD BE
QUITE CONVENIENT FOR GENOM.

184
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,583
- Nene:
EXCUSE ME, DIRECTOR HARUMA?

185
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,916
- YES, WHAT?

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,458
- IF I CAN HACK INTO
THE ETERNAL SENSOR NETWORK,

187
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,541
THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO SHUT OFF
THE FIREWALL, WON'T IT, SIR?

188
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,250
- NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. ALL
OF THE SENSORS COVER EACH OTHER,

189
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,666
SO YOU CAN'T DEACTIVATE ONE

190
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,083
WITHOUT REACTIVATING
ALL OF THE OTHERS.

191
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,083
THERE'S NO WAY TO BRING THEM
ALL DOWN AT ONCE.

192
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,083
- HA!  I'M AFRAID 
YOU'RE WRONG, SIR.

193
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,500
I'M IN SENSOR-NET NOW.

194
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,000
- WHAT?!
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

195
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,458
ALL OF OUR PROGRAMMERS SAID
THAT IT COULDN'T BE DONE.

196
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,916
- ( chuckles )
WHY AM I SUDDENLY REALIZING

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,750
HOW LEON AND DALEY ACCESSED
ALL THAT RESTRICTED DATA?

198
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,583
- OKAY, I'M GOING TO CUT
THE SENSORS OFF ALL AT ONCE,

199
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,583
RELEASE THE FIREWALL AND SEND AN
EMERGENCY CALL TO THE OUTSIDE.

200
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,875
I'LL HAVE TO BRING
THE FIREWALL BACK UP AFTER THAT,

201
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,958
BECAUSE I CAN'T MONITOR THE
BOOMERS WITHOUT THE SENSOR-NET.

202
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:07,958
- GO FOR IT.

203
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,958
- OKAY, SENSORS OFF.

204
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,083
- ( trilling )

205
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,875
- FIREWALL RELEASED.

206
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,625
EMERGENCY BEACON ACTIVATED.

207
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,958
( exhales deeply )

208
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,958
- ( alarm wailing )
- ( gasps )

209
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,000
OH, COME ON!
NO WAY!

210
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,000
HOW COULD IT JUST 
GO DEAD LIKE THAT?

211
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,458
THERE'S NO WAY THE MAIN FRAME
POWER BACKUPS COULD BE DEAD. 

212
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,541
HUH?

213
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,000
WHAT THE...?

214
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,291
- ( roars )

215
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,250
- ( screams )

216
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,333
( murmurs )

217
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,625
IT CAN'T BE.

218
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,583
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
UP THERE?

219
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,208
ROMANOVA, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

220
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,041
- ( growling through device )

221
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,208
- AAH!

222
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,666
- AAH, WHAT HAPPENED?!

223
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,166
- I'D SAY THEY JUST TOOK OVER
THE INFORMATION CENTER.

224
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,500
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT POOR GIRL.

225
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,583
- IT'LL HAPPEN TO US TOO.
WHAT DO WE DO, ROLAND?

226
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,416
- LIKE I SAID BEFORE, WE'VE GOT
TO GET SOME BIGGER GUNS.

227
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,791
- MM-MM.

228
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,625
THE ARMORY'S DOWN
IN THE SUB-BASEMENT.

229
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,125
THERE'S NO WAY.
- YEAH, BUT THERE'S A LOCKER

230
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,666
ON THE NINTH FLOOR.

231
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,083
IT'S OUR EMERGENCY STASH.

232
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,750
- I HOPE YOU GOT A TANK.

233
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,083
- OH, DAMN!
I JUST REMEMBERED.

234
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,083
- HMM?

235
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,583
- MY KID.

236
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,083
I FORGOT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO CALL HER ABOUT

237
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,958
WHAT WE WERE DOING
FOR DINNER.

238
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,541
- ( electric guitar riff plays )

239
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,208
- ( device ringing )

240
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,791
- GREAT STUFF!
( grunts )

241
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,791
- ( yawns )

242
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,083
- CRAP.

243
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,833
YEAH, PRISS HERE.

244
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,375
- Linna: IT'S ABOUT TIME
 YOU ANSWERED THE PHONE!

245
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,958
PRISS, NENE'S IN BIG TROUBLE.

246
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:20,958
- HUH?

247
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,916
- Mason:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,625
- I AM GATHERING DATA.
THAT IS MY FUNCTION.

249
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,625
- HMM...

250
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,125
BUT GATHERING IT FOR WHO,
I WONDER.

251
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,291
- SIR, AS YOU KNOW,

252
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,125
THIS MODEL HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED
TO BE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING

253
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,291
WHICH MAY CAUSE HARM
TO ITS REGISTERED OWNER.

254
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,791
- THEN WHAT IS THIS?

255
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,916
- A DATA SEARCH.

256
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,500
AS ORDERED BY A PROGRAM
THAT PROCEEDS YOUR REGISTRATION.

257
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,458
- HMM. AND HERE I THOUGHT
I'D OBTAINED A CLEAN UNIT.

258
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,375
- ( gun cocks )

259
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,041
- ALL RIGHT,
TELL ME WHO ORDERED THIS.

260
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,125
- A PREVIOUS ORDER 
PREVENTS THAT, SIR.

261
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,875
- I'LL ASK YOU ONCE MORE.

262
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,041
WHO AUTHORIZED
THIS DATA SEARCH?

263
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,833
- I AM UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
WHICH MAY CAUSE HARM

264
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,916
TO MY REGISTERED OWNER.

265
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,000
( distorted )
I AM SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED

266
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,833
FROM DOING ANYTHING 
WHICH MAY CAUSE HARM

267
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:38,958
TO MY REGISTERED OWNER.

268
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:52,041
- SO THE OLD ZOMBIE INSTALLED
A SECURITY OVERRIDE.

269
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,500
( chuckles softly )

270
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,333
BUT YOUR PUPPETS CAN'T
PROTECT YOU NOW, PUPPET MASTER.

271
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,791
IT'S TOO LATE.

272
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,416
- INCREDIBLE.

273
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,250
HE ACTUALLY DARED
TO BRING IT HERE.

274
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,750
THE MAN MUST BE MAD.

275
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,625
BUT YOU FORGOT ONE THING,
MASON.

276
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,791
IN THIS TOWER,
I AM A GOD.

277
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,041
AND ANY MAN WHO GOES
AGAINST A GOD

278
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,708
IS DOOMED TO
ETERNAL DAMNATION.

279
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,125
- HMM?

280
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,125
MASON!
( giggles )

281
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,333
MASON!

282
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,500
- YOU'RE GLAD TO SEE ME
AREN'T YOU, GALATEA?

283
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,333
- I GOT BORED WITH THIS BOOK.

284
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,333
I WANNA READ
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

285
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,583
- OF COURSE.

286
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,541
I'LL BRING YOU A NEW ONE
NEXT TIME I VISIT.

287
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,708
MASON'S VERY IMPRESSED YOU'VE
LEARNED TO READ SO QUICKLY.

288
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,958
- MY FRIEND SHOWED ME HOW.
- HMM?

289
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,583
- MY FRIEND--
HE HELPED ME LEARN HOW.

290
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,750
- EXACTLY WHO IS THIS FRIEND?

291
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,375
- MACKY.

292
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,791
- WHAT?

293
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,708
- 'BOUT TIME.

294
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,583
- OKAY, WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

295
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,083
- NENE'S TRAPPED INSIDE
THE A.D.P. TOWER.

296
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,916
ALL OF THE ROGUE BOOMERS
THAT THE A.D.P. HAD IN STORAGE

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,583
HAVE BEEN REVIVED BY GALATEA.

298
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,750
- YOU MEAN THAT LITTLE GIRL?

299
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,291
- SHE'S MORE THAN JUST A GIRL.

300
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,125
PROFESSOR MASON IS LETTING HER
TEST HER POWERS.

301
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,125
- MASON--
THAT JERK FROM GENOM.

302
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,291
OKAY, HOW DO WE CONTACT NENE?

303
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,416
- WE CAN'T, PRISS.

304
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
NONE OF THE PHONE LINES
ARE WORKING.

305
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,000
- IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE SOME
KIND OF ELECTRONIC FIREWALL.

306
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,875
WHICH MEANS THEY'VE
BEEN COMPLETELY CUT OFF

307
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:37,916
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,583
- THEN WHY ARE YOU
SITTING HERE?!

309
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,250
WHY AREN'T YOU TRYING
TO RESCUE HER?!

310
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,750
- HOW?  WE DON'T HAVE
OUR HARDSUITS, REMEMBER?

311
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,916
- SCREW YOUR GODDAMNED
HARDSUITS!

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,916
NO WAY IN HELL!

313
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,416
- OH, YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE

314
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,916
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS OR SISTERS,
IS IT?

315
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,750
- IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WEEK.

316
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,416
I COULD BUILD JUST ONE SUIT,

317
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,250
BUT THAT WOULD STILL
TAKE FOUR DAYS.

318
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,083
- FOUR DAYS?

319
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,833
- BEST CASE SCENARIO.

320
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,666
AND THAT'S ASSUMING
YOU LET ME GET BACK TO WORK

321
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,666
RIGHT NOW.

322
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,000
- Priss: NIGEL, WAIT!

323
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,500
THE MOTOSLAVE.

324
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,375
WHY CAN'T WE USE
MY MOTOSLAVE?

325
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,541
- WAIT, YOU NEED YOUR SUIT
TO OPERATE IT.

326
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,125
- IT'S A MOTORCYCLE.

327
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,875
THERE MUST BE SOMEWAY TO RIG IT
TO WORK WITHOUT A SUIT, RIGHT? 

328
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,708
- YEAH, I DESIGNED IT
TO WORK BOTH WAYS.

329
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,875
- HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE
TO RIG IT UP?

330
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,458
- 30 MINUTES,
GIVE OR TAKE.

331
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,083
- I'LL TAKE.
DO IT, NIGEL.

332
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,291
- NO WAY!

333
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,541
I DON'T CARE
HOW GOOD YOU ARE!

334
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,250
ONE LITTLE MISTAKE
AND THE SERVER MECHANISMS

335
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,208
WILL TEAR YOU APART
LIKE TISSUE PAPER! 

336
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,208
- Nigel:
COME ON, MACKY.

337
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,250
- HUH?

338
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,583
UH, RIGHT.

339
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,458
- OH, RIGHT,
MAYBE A STEPSISTER.

340
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,250
- ( pounding )
- ( gasps )

341
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,875
- ( pounding continues )

342
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,083
- ( pounding ceases )

343
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,375
- AAH!

344
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,333
- ( growling )

345
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,125
- ( yelping )

346
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,291
- ( moaning )

347
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,083
- ( shrieks )

348
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,625
( exhales, pants )

349
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,833
( gasps sharply )

350
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,500
( chuckles nervously )

351
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,666
( shouts )

352
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,250
( whistles )

353
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,458
HEH.

354
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,833
THAT'LL TEACH YOU.

355
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,916
YOU PICKED ON
THE WRONG TEENAGER, BUSTER.

356
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,250
- ( gunfire )
- Yano: AAH, LOOK OUT!

357
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,541
- Haruma:
YANO, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

358
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,541
- Nick: DAMMIT, WHERE ARE
THEY ALL COMING FROM?!

359
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,875
- ( exhales )

360
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,416
I'M SCREWED.
( sighs )

361
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,541
- ALL THE DOORS ARE LOCKED,

362
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,458
AND THE COMMUNICATION'S
FIREWALL IS IN PLACE.

363
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,625
WELL, SOMETHING BAD'S
GOING DOWN.

364
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,291
- SO, ARE WE THE ONLY ONES
WHO HEARD THE EMERGENCY BEACON?

365
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,333
- ( vehicles approaching )

366
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,125
- LEON, DALEY.

367
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,833
- HOW'S IT GOING, PETERS?

368
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,208
- HUH, WELL,

369
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,208
AT LEAST WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES
BREAKING THE STRIKE.

370
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,416
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

371
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
WE THOUGHT WE PICKED UP
AN EMERGENCY BEACON,

372
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,958
BUT THEN IT JUST CUT OFF.

373
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,166
- I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
BREAK IN TO FIND OUT.

374
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,625
- ( whirring )
- HUH?

375
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:16,875
IS THAT--?

376
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,875
- LEON, I NEED YOUR HELP.

377
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,250
- OUR HELP?

378
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,625
- ( end theme playing )

379
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

380
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,416
- Woman:
IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF

381
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,958
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS:
TOKYO 2040"...

382
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,666
AS WAVES OF BOOMERS PREPARE
FOR THE FINAL ATTACK

383
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,250
ON THE A.D.P. TOWER,

384
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:14,666
PRISS, SYLIA AND LINNA LAUNCH
A DARING ASSAULT AND RESCUE. 

385
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,000
AS MASON UNVEILS HIS MAD SCHEME,

386
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,166
THE KNIGHT SABERS JOIN
WITH THE A.D.P.,

387
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,000
AND THE BATTLE FOR
THE CITY OF TOKYO BEGINS.

388
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:26,458
HOWEVER, CAN ANYTHING STOP 
AN ARMY OF LIVING MACHINES?

389
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:27,750
NEXT EPISODE...
