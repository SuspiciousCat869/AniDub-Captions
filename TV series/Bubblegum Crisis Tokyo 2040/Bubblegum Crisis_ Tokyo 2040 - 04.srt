1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,541
- ( snarling )

4
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,708
- ( grunting )

5
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,125
- DON'T WORRY, MISS.
I GOT IT.

6
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,791
- DAMN!
THEY'RE HERE ALREADY?

7
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,500
- PRISS, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

8
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,541
- NEVER MIND.
WHO'S IN THAT SUIT?

9
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,416
- CUT THE CHATTER, DAMN IT.
THE AD POLICE ARE LISTENING.

10
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:17,291
- MY GOD, HOW DO I FIGHT
THIS THING?

11
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,375
- THAT'S A BRAND-NEW
KNIGHT SABER,

12
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,583
AND I THINK IT'S IN TROUBLE.

13
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,458
- GET DOWN WHILE I COVER YOU.

14
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,875
HERE GOES NOTHING.

15
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,625
- WAIT, MISS.

16
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,333
JUST GET BACK.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.  HUH?

17
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,041
HAVE WE MET BEFORE?

18
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,666
WE HAVE, HAVEN'T WE?

19
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,333
I NEVER FORGET A FACE,
YOU KNOW?

20
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,791
WHO THE HELL WAS THAT?

21
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,083
- OH, MY HEAD.

22
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,458
- NENE.  ALL RIGHT!
- WHAT?

23
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,375
- ( screams )

24
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,541
I CAN DO THIS.
I KNOW I CAN.

25
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,375
I CAN DO THIS!

26
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,333
- SHE'S BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.
HMM.

27
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,208
LINNA, YOU'VE GOT
TO SMASH ITS CORE.

28
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,291
UNTIL YOU DESTROY IT,
THE BOOMER WON'T DIE.

29
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,541
- THE CORE.  I GOT IT.

30
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,500
SYLIA, LINNA'S BATTERY
IS STARTING TO REDLINE.

31
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,500
- OH!

32
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,583
- ( screaming )

33
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,708
NO, MY SUIT.  IT STOPPED.

34
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,541
SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH MY SUIT.

35
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:10,250
- LINNA!
- LINNA, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

36
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,166
- SYLIA, OPEN THE DOOR NOW,
DAMN IT!

37
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,041
- SYLIA,

38
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,333
I CAN'T MOVE AT ALL.

39
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,000
WHAT'S WRONG?

40
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,625
FOR GOD'S SAKE, HELP ME!

41
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,083
( screams )
- LINNA.

42
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,708
- WHEN THERE'S NO POWER LEFT

43
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,958
IN THE BATTERY,
WHAT HAPPENS?

44
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,916
- Sylia: THE RESERVE BATTERY
WILL UNSEAL THE SUIT.

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,333
- BUT, SYLIA, IF HER SUIT OPENS
RIGHT NOW, SHE'LL BE CRUSHED.

46
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,250
- SYLIA.

47
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,083
- LOOKS LIKE THE KNIGHT SABERS
FINALLY SCREWED UP

48
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,875
- LADY LUCK DOES SEEM TO BE
SMILING ON US AT THE MOMENT.

49
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:06,666
- YEAH, WE'RE GONNA BAG A BOOMER
AND THE KNIGHT SABERS.

50
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,416
- THEY'RE SHOOTING AT ME.

51
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,333
WHY ARE THEY SHOOTING AT ME
AND NOT THE BOOMER?

52
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,958
- LINNA!
- HOLD ON!

53
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,916
- HUH?
- UH-OH.

54
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,041
- ( screaming )

55
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,166
- I GOT YOU!

56
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,000
- PRISS.

57
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,666
- KNIGHT SABERS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

58
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,291
- ( laughing )

59
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,791
- DON'T MOVE!

60
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,333
- WE FOUND THE BOOMER.
RESCUE THOSE SURVIVORS.

61
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,541
- STOP, YOU IDIOT.
IT'S OVER ALREADY.

62
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,250
- YOU'RE DOING MORE DAMAGE
THAN THE BOOMER.

63
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,250
- OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS
TO DESTROY THAT BOOMER.

64
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,041
DON'T GET IN OUR WAY
OR I'LL ARREST YOU.

65
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,375
- ARREST ME?

66
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,708
- Sylia: COME ON.

67
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,833
COME ON, WHERE'S THE PATTERN?

68
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,500
- ( panting )

69
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,541
- HERE, LINNA.

70
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,666
- THANKS, NENE.

71
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,333
I THINK I'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW.

72
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,333
I GUESS I WASHED OUT.

73
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,958
I REALLY SCREWED UP.

74
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,833
- LINNA, YOU DID VERY WELL
TODAY.

75
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,666
- YEAH, YOU REALLY IMPRESSED
THE HECK OUT OF ME.

76
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,291
- I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER.

77
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,083
- Priss: YOU'RE ALL IDIOTS.
- HMM?

78
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,458
- WHAT IN THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING,

79
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,666
SENDING HER INTO COMBAT
LIKE THAT

80
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,041
WITH A MALFUNCTIONING SUIT
AND NO TRAINING?

81
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,708
- WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE,
YOU KNOW?

82
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,958
- AND EVERYTHING CAME OUT
OKAY, DIDN'T IT?

83
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,916
- Linna: PRISS.

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,375
THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

85
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,916
- PRISS!
- FORGET IT.

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,916
I DON'T WORK WITH AMATEURS.

87
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,208
- HI.

88
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,291
- DO YOU WANT ONE?

89
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,583
- I GUESS I'LL EAT.

90
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,416
WHAT'S ON THIS EXACTLY?

91
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,416
- HORSERADISH AND MUSTARD.

92
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,875
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

93
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,875
- WHY AM I HERE?

94
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,666
I GUESS TO SAY YOU WERE RIGHT.

95
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,041
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE
LAST NIGHT,

96
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,708
BUT I WAS SO EXCITED
OVER GETTING MY SUIT THAT I--

97
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,083
WELL, I WAS STUPID.

98
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,666
I WANTED TO BE A KNIGHT SABER
SO BADLY, I DIDN'T THINK.

99
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,500
I JUST WANT TO HELP PEOPLE.

100
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,916
YOU KNOW.

101
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,541
- LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT.

102
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,416
NO MATTER WHAT LINE OF CRAP
SYLIA MAY HAVE HANDED YOU,

103
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,833
I'M NOT IN THIS BUSINESS
TO PLAY SUPERHERO.

104
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,833
THERE ARE NO WINGS ON MY BACK.
- THEN WHY, PRISS?

105
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,833
WHY RISK YOUR LIFE
IF YOU DON'T CARE?

106
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,291
I WOULD'VE--

107
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,458
I MEAN, HAVING DONE IT ONCE,
I CAN SEE THAT IT'S EVEN HARDER

108
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,458
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
SO YOU MUST HAVE SOME REASON.

109
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,916
OTHERWISE, WHY ELSE WOULD ANYONE
BE WILLING TO GAMBLE

110
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,625
WITH THEIR LIFE THIS WAY?

111
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,458
- SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE RISKS.

112
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,833
AND THEN THERE'S THE MONEY,
OF COURSE.

113
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,208
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

114
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,291
NOBLE CAUSES ARE ALL VERY NICE,
BUT FRANKLY,

115
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,416
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A REAL GOAL,
YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER JANE

116
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,041
OR MARY,
JUST ANOTHER SUCKER.

117
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,791
- BUT I HAVE A GOAL.

118
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:40,041
MY GOAL IS TO REPLACE YOU
AS THE TOP DOG ON THIS TEAM.

119
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,666
- ( clears throat )

120
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,708
- YES, WHAT IS IT?

121
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,291
- I WAS WONDERING HOW LONG--

122
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,625
HOW LONG YOU WERE
GOING TO KEEP THIS UP.

123
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,166
- YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT ME SO MUCH.

124
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,208
- THE GIRLS AND I ARE CAPABLE
OF TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES.

125
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,125
- I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL,
MILADY--

126
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,500
- NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME
AT ALL, I'M AFRAID.

127
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,666
I DIDN'T FORM THE KNIGHT SABERS
AS PART OF SOME INSANE PLAN

128
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,208
TO AVENGE MY FATHER'S DEATH.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

129
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,625
TRUST ME.

130
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,958
- SHOULD I TRUST YOU
LIKE SHE DID?

131
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,166
- THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

132
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,750
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN
TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM SECURITY

133
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,666
FOR THE CURRENT GIRLS.

134
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,166
I'M NOT A LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE,
HENDERSON.

135
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,416
I'VE MATURED.
I'VE GROWN INTO AN ADULT FEMALE

136
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,375
AND I DON'T MAKE THAT KIND
OF MISTAKE ANYMORE,

137
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,416
NOT ANYMORE.

138
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,416
HENDERSON,

139
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,541
IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE,

140
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,875
I'LL UNDERSTAND.

141
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,000
- YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOU, MILADY.

142
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,791
I WON'T LEAVE.

143
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,666
EXCUSE ME.

144
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,250
- ( crying )

145
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,041
- ( beeping )

146
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,500
- HI, SYLIA.
IT'S A NENE-GRAM.

147
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,000
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT I JUST FOUND

148
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,458
WHILE CRACKING INTO GENOM'S
SERVERS A FEW MINUTES AGO.

149
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,458
IT SEEMS THERE'S A WHOLE
DEPARTMENT THAT DOES NOTHING

150
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,875
BUT TRACK THE SERIAL NUMBERS
AND HISTORY OF ALL THE BOOMERS

151
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,958
WHICH HAVE EVER GONE ROGUE.

152
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,750
THIS IS WHERE THE REALLY
INTERESTING PART COMES IN.

153
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,166
IT SEEMS THIS DEPARTMENT IS ALSO
TRACKING THE SERIAL NUMBERS

154
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,333
OF A NUMBER OF BOOMERS
THAT HAVEN'T GONE ROGUE YET.

155
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,291
I'LL TRY AND CONTACT YOU LATER
IF I FIND OUT ANYTHING MORE.

156
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,250
BYE-BYE.

157
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,625
- THERE'S NO WAY THEY COULD
POSSIBLY TELL WHICH BOOMERS

158
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,666
WERE GOING TO GO ROGUE
IN ADVANCE, IS THERE?

159
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,250
THEY CAN'T.
THEY COULDN'T.

160
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,500
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

161
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,958
NO MATTER HOW THE VERSION
IS UPGRADED,

162
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,208
THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN BE
TAMPERING WITH THE CORE.

163
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,541
MY FATHER WOULD HAVE NEVER
USED AN ALGORITHM

164
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,083
THEY COULD TAP INTO.
HE WOULDN'T HAVE.

165
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,416
BUT WHY?

166
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,666
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY?

167
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,041
WHY?

168
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,916
- DO I SEE THE GREAT DETECTIVE
MCNICHOLS BURIED IN THOUGHT?

169
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,625
HOW STRANGE.
- GO AWAY, WONG.

170
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,500
- A WOMAN, HUH?  WHY IS IT
THAT YOU MACHO TYPES

171
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,333
ALWAYS TURN INTO
HIGH SCHOOL BOYS

172
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,708
WHENEVER SOME PRETTY YOUNG THING
BATS THEIR EYES AT YOU.

173
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,708
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

174
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,125
- WELL, THERE WAS SANDRA
AT THE LONE STAR.

175
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,583
SHEORI AT LONELY VEIL.
GLADYS AT THE CAT'S EYE.

176
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,916
- THEY WEREN'T GIRLFRIENDS,
WONG.  THEY WERE WAITRESSES.

177
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,750
- DIDN'T YOU GIVE GLADYS A RING?
- IT WAS A FRIENDSHIP RING.

178
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,416
I'M SHY.
- ( laughs )

179
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,083
OH, YEAH, THAT'S FOR SURE.
WHO ELSE HAS TO GIVE A WOMAN

180
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,125
A PRESENT BEFORE HE CAN ORDER
A BEER FROM HER?

181
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,958
- I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THAT
KIND OF WOMAN ANYMORE, OKAY?

182
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,458
- UNTIL THE NEXT BIMBO
COMES ALONG THAT IS.

183
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,125
- THANKS FOR THE COMPASSION.

184
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,583
( sighs )

185
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,500
I KNOW I'VE SEEN HER BEFORE,

186
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,958
BUT WHERE THE HELL WAS IT?

187
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,833
THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT...

188
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,500
HER EYES.

189
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,250
HMM.

190
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,666

- YOU'VE GOT A BIG MOUTH,
LINNA.

215
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,750
TWO WHOLE YEARS SITTING
ON MY BUTT.

216
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,458
- ( crowd cheering )

217
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,750
- THERE. THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST
I CAN DO FOR YOU, I'M AFRAID.

218
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,000
FOR ANYTHING MORE COMPLICATED,
WE'LL HAVE TO SEND YOU BACK

219
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,666
TO THE GENOM SERVICE CENTER
AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

220
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,291
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.

221
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,041
I CAN FEEL THAT MY PERFORMANCE

222
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,500
WILL BE MUCH BETTER
THAN BEFORE.

223
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,166
- MAYBE, BUT I WISH WE HAD
MORE MONEY

224
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,000
FOR PROPER MAINTENANCE.

225
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,041
- IT'S FINE, SIR.  I'VE BEEN
TREATED VERY WELL HERE.

226
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,333
- WELL, I'M GONNA
GO HIT THE SACK.

227
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,125
- GOOD NIGHT, SIR.

228
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,458
EXCUSE ME.
THIS SECTION IS OFF-LIMITS.

229
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,083
IT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND--

230
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,250
AND-- ( powers down )

231
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,875
- TODAY'S AUDIENCE SEEMED KIND
OF UNRESPONSIVE, DIDN'T THEY?

232
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,458
- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
OUR TRAINED GORILLA

233
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,125
WASN'T KEEPING PROPER RHYTHM.
- SAY WHAT?

234
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,083
- HEY, CUT IT OUT.

235
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,708
- Priss: SEE YA.

236
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,041
- HEY, PRISS, ARE YOU HAVING
SOME PERSONAL PROBLEMS?

237
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,041
- HUH?

238
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,666
- IT SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE
KIND OF DISTRACTED

239
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,416
DURING THE SHOW TODAY.

240
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,916
MAYBE I'M WRONG.
FORGET I SAID THAT.

241
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,958
- THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE
THE OTHER DAY.

242
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,916
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY.

243
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,125
- UGH.

244
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,208
- HEY, IS THIS ANY WAY
TO TREAT SOMEBODY

245
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,333
WHO PROBABLY SAVED
YOUR LIFE?

248
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,416
IN THE INDUSTRIAL QUARTER.
- COME ON, SAY SOMETHING.

249
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500

- I'M SORRY TO RUIN YOUR
DAY OFF, LOVER BOY,

256
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,041
BUT WE'VE GOT ANOTHER
MAD BOOMER.

257
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,833

"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040,"

261

AN INDUSTRIAL DRONE GOES BERSERK
IN A BOOMER FACTORY

262
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:11,458
AND THE MAD MACHINE BEGINS
TO ABSORB THE FACTORY'S POWER

263
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:14,750
AND SPARE PARTS, AGAINST
AN AMAZING COLOSSAL BOOMER

264
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,666
THAT CAN ABSORB
ANYTHING MECHANICAL.

265
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,791
DO EVEN THE KNIGHT SABERS
STAND A CHANCE?

266
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,666
THEY'VE GOT NO CHOICE
BUT TO TRY,

267
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,958
AND THIS ASSIGNMENT COULD
BE THEIR LAST.
