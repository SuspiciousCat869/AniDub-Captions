1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,541
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:51,958
- ( laughs )

4
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,500
- Woman: LINNA, COME ON.

5
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,375
- ( yawns )

6
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,833
AT LAST, TOKYO!

7
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,041
- Woman: LINNA!
- READY OR NOT, HERE I COME.

8
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,416
- Woman: THE ACTING SUPERVISOR
WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE

9
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,750
IF YOU'RE LATE, SO IT MIGHT BE
A GOOD IDEA TO SNEAK IN.

10
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,083
OTHERWISE, THEY'LL HAVE YOU
MAKING AND TAKING TEA

11
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,458
TO EVERY SALESPERSON
IN THE BUILDING.

12
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,916
AND THEY'LL DO IT WHETHER
THERE'S ANYBODY SITTING

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,916
AT THEIR WORKSTATIONS OR NOT.

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,583
- I'VE SEEN THE CITY A MILLION
TIMES ON TV, BUT IT'S SO MUCH

15
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,625
MORE INCREDIBLE IN PERSON.

16
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,625
IT'S ONLY BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE
THOSE HORRIBLE EARTHQUAKES,

17
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,250
BUT EVERYTHING'S EVEN BIGGER
AND BETTER THAN BEFORE.

18
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,250
IT'S SO INCREDIBLE.

19
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,416
EXCUSE ME.

20
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,083
- APOLOGY UNNECESSARY.

21
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,416
IT WAS MY FAULT
FOR BLOCKING THE PATH.

22
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,291
- OH, WELL, I'M SORRY.

23
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:11,083
- YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY SORRY
TO A BOOMER, COUNTRY GIRL,

24
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,291
EVEN IF YOU ARE A NEW EMPLOYEE.
- OH!

25
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,291
- ( whirring )

26
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,750
- BUT WASN'T IT THE BOOMERS
WHICH MADE ALL THIS

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,250
RECONSTRUCTION POSSIBLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

28
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,458
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE
UP CLOSE LIKE THAT BEFORE.

29
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,750
- DARN, WE'RE LATE,

30
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,833
AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN BOUGHT
OUR LUNCHES YET.

31
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,166
- HEY, WAIT!
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT

32
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,458
WITHOUT LOOKING
AT YOUR WATCH?

33
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,125
- BY THE SHADOW.

34
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,041
- HUH?  THE WHAT?

35
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,208
- Woman:
UNDER THE BENEVOLENT AUSPICES

36
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,666
OF THE GENOM CORPORATION,
THE ORBITAL CONSTRUCTION

37
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,583
OF THE SHOWHAM PROJECT
HAS CONTINUED

38
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,000
TO PROGRESS
AT A RELENTLESS PACE.

39
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,000
EXPECTED TO SOLVE MANY
OF THE ENERGY PROBLEMS

40
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,750
NOW FACING MANKIND
AROUND THE GLOBE,

41
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,791
THE SHOWHAM PROJECT
WILL DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE

42
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,208
FROM THE CONTINUED DEPENDENCE
UPON LIMITED

43
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,375
AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
NATURAL RESOURCES.

44
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,666
IT IS THE HOPE
OF THE GENOM CORPORATION

45
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,875
THAT THIS IMPORTANT ENDEAVOR
BE COMPLETED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

46
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,208
SO THAT IT CAN HELP CHART
THE COURSE

47
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,583
OF MANKIND'S ULTIMATE DESTINY.

48
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,333
- SOON.

49
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,250
- ( rock music playing )

50
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,958
- MISAE, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THEM IN ACTION?

51
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,875
- WHO'S THEM EXACTLY?
- THE KNIGHT SABERS, OF COURSE.

52
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,125
THEY'RE AWESOME.
- EXCUSE ME.

53
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,750
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT
THEY'RE SOME KIND OF VIGILANTE

54
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,416
GROUP PROWLING THE STREETS
OF TOKYO, DO YOU?

55
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,750
THEY'RE JUST AN URBAN LEGEND.

56
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,833
- WHAT?  THEY CAN'T BE.

57
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,750
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THEM
ON THE NET FOR MONTHS NOW.

58
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,041
HMM.

59
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,500
- LOOK, IF THEY REALLY EXISTED,

60
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,208
THERE'D BE PICTURES OF THEM ON
THE NEWS, RIGHT?

61
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,250
THERE WOULD AND I'VE NEVER
SEEN A SINGLE PICTURE.

62
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,166
- NO PICTURES, NOT EVER?

63
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,166
- I AM SORRY THAT YOU HAD
TO WAIT SO LONG.

64
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,416
- THANK YOU.
- COME ON, LINNA.

65
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,958
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATRONAGE.
- THANK YOU.

66
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,458
- I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I JUST
DON'T LIKE THESE NEW BOOMERS.

67
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,750
I MEAN, WHY DO THEY HAVE TO MAKE
THEM LOOK SO MUCH LIKE PEOPLE?

68
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,041
IF THEY LOOKED MORE LIKE ROBOTS,

69
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,500
THEY WOULDN'T BE SO CREEPY.

70
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,583
- I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE THEM LESS INTIMIDATING.

71
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,166
HUH?

72
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,791
OH!

73
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,833
- ( sighs )
WELL, THAT WAS SPECTACULAR.

74
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:22,875
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

75
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
ARE YOU OKAY, LINNA?

76
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,416
- GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE!

77
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,625
- I-I THINK SHE HEARD YOU.

78
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,625
- DAMN RIGHT SHE DID!

79
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,833
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT MY LUNCH?

80
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,791
- LINNA, CUT IT OUT.

81
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,333
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE ACTUALLY
HIT YOU OR ANYTHING.

82
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,708
- ARE YOU BLIND OR STUPID?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING

83
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,208
DRIVING LIKE A LUNATIC?

84
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,583
- OH, NO.

85
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,541
- YOU OWE ME LUNCH.

86
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,625
HUH?  MY FACE?

87
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,166
OH!

88
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,500
- WHAT IN THE HELL ARE DOING
MESSING WITH SOMEBODY LIKE THAT?

89
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,875
THIS IS TOKYO, NOT SOME
BACKWATER HICK TOWN.

90
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,333
- SHE'S TOAST!
- HELP.  LINNA!

91
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,791
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR WORK.

92
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,333
- STUPID FRIGGIN' HIGH HEELS!

93
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,458
JUST BECAUSE I'M NEW IN TOWN
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO

94
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,666
TAKE YOUR CRAP.

95
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,250
GOING SOMEWHERE?

96
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,125
( screams )

97
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,416
- YOU'RE LATE.
YOUR MAKEUP IS SMEARED.

98
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,666
YOUR HAIR IS UNKEMPT
AND YOUR CLOTHING DISHEVELED.

99
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,833
AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR OTHER SHOE?

100
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,291
YOU CAN'T COME TO WORK LOOKING
LIKE THIS, MISS YAMAZAKI.

101
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,583
OUR CORPORATE IMAGE DEPENDS
UPON THE IMAGE YOU PROJECT.

102
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,416
AND YOU CANNOT SEE CUSTOMERS
LOOKING LIKE THAT.

103
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
- I THINK I'M STARTING
TO DISLIKE BOOMERS.

104
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,208
- I'M A BOOMER THAT HAS BEEN
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

105
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,083
TO EDUCATE, SUPERVISE
AND DISCIPLINE NEW EMPLOYEES.

106
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,125
NEGATIVE COMMENTS INDICATE
A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE

107
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,000
AND WILL BE NOTED
ON YOUR PERMANENT RECORD.

108
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,458
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
- YES, MA'AM.

109
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,875
- ARE YOU NOW SUFFICIENTLY
REPRIMANDED?

110
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,083
- YES, I AM.

111
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,458
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
WHEN DID THOSE THINGS LEARN HOW

112
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,125
TO UNDERSTAND SARCASM?
WHY ME?!  OH!

113
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,750
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M BEING
ORDERED AROUND BY A BOOMER.

114
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,166
- HI, THERE.
YOU'RE THE NEW EMPLOYEE

115
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,125
IN THE SECOND SALES SECTION,
AREN'T YOU?

116
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,666
- HUH?

117
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,041
YES,
I'M LINNA YAMAZAKI.

118
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,041
- AND IF THE GRAPEVINE'S
CORRECT, YOU'RE NEW IN TOWN.

119
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,291
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
I THOUGHT I KNEW ALL ABOUT TOKYO

120
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,458
FROM WATCHING TV,
BUT IT'S REALLY NOTHING AT ALL

121
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,750
LIKE WHAT I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE LIKE.

122
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,708
- I'D BE GLAD TO SHOW YOU
AROUND SOME TIME.

123
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,708
- WELL, THAT WOULD BE NICE.
- ALL RIGHTY THEN.

124
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,375
LET'S MEET AFTER WORK AND I'LL
SHOW YOU WHERE THE ACTION IS.

125
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,416
- Man: THIS IS BRAVO TANGO.
WE'VE MADE A CLEAN SWEEP

126
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,666
AND EVERYTHING LOOKS QUIET.
- Woman: ROGER, BRAVO TANGO.

127
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,916
YOU ARE CLEAR TO RETURN
TO THE TOWER.

128
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,833
TALK ABOUT DULLSVILLE.

129
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,541
( sighs ) WAKE ME IF
SOMETHING HAPPENS, OKAY?

130
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,791
- I THOUGHT NO BOOMER NEWS
WAS GOOD NEWS.

131
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,875
- WELL, I'M NOT SAYING I WANT
THE BOOMERS TO GO BALLISTIC,

132
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,083
BUT IF THINGS DON'T
PICK UP SOON,

133
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,208
WE'LL BE UNEMPLOYED.

134
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,958
- YEAH, BUT WOULD THAT REALLY BE
SO BAD, NENE?

135
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,916
- UH-HUH, 'CAUSE THEN
I'D NEED ANOTHER JOB.

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,458
- OH, YEAH?
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

137
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,583
- HOW ABOUT

138
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,125
THE KNIGHT SABERS?

139
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,125
CAN'T YOU SEE IT?

140
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,458
- OH, LIKE THEY'D TAKE YOU.
- OH!

141
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,041
- Man: Hey, totem pole,
are you there?

142
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,625
- THIS IS THE AD POLICE
INTELLIGENCE MANAGEMENT CENTER,

143
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,625
NOT TOTEM POLE, AND THE NEXT
TIME YOU CALL ME THAT,

144
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,500
I WON'T ANSWER YOU, LEON-POO.

145
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,500
- Man:
DID SHE JUST CALL YOU LEON-POO?

146
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,750
OH, I LIKE THAT.
- SHUT UP, WONG.

147
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,833
THE LAST THING I NEED IS FOR YOU
TO ENCOURAGE THAT 18-YEAR-OLD

148
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,916
JINX TO KEEP CALLING ME
LEON-POO.

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,791
THIS IS MCNICHOLS.  NO UNUSUAL
BOOMER ACTIVITY IN SOTO WARD.

150
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,750
- Nene: So what else is new?

151
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,750
I guess I'm going home.
- HUH?

152
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,750
THEY CUT OUR HOURS AGAIN?

153
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,708
HOW THE HELL ARE THE AD POLICE
SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE STREETS

154
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,375
CLEAN OF ROGUE BOOMERS
WITHOUT A FULL STAFF?

155
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,458
- MAYBE THEY NOTICED THE STREETS
HAVE BEEN KEPT JUST AS CLEAN

156
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,833
BY YOU KNOW WHO?  HMM?

157
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,458
- DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON THOSE AMATEUR VIGILANTES.

158
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,625
DAMN THOSE KNIGHT SABERS
TO HELL.

159
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,208
I NEED SOME COFFEE.

160
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:40,041
- Man: AFTER THIS AREA SANK AND
FLOODED DURING THE EARTHQUAKE,

161
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,500
THE CITY HAD NO INTENTION OF
SPENDING ANY OF THE RELIEF FUNDS

162
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:46,041
TO REBUILD SOTO WARD.
YET, AMAZINGLY ENOUGH,

163
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,958
THIS WAS THE FIRST AREA
TO COMPLETELY RECOVER.

164
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,375
- THAT REALLY IS AMAZING.

165
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,458
- MONEY TALKS AND SODOM IS
A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GET

166
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,958
ANYTHING YOU WANT.
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR DESIRE

167
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,416
OR TWISTED FANTASY IS,
CHANCES ARE THERE'S SOMEONE HERE

168
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,666
WHO CAN FULFILL IT.
- GEE, THAT'S KIND OF SCARY.

169
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,416
- BUT, SIR, WHAT ABOUT--

170
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,291
- HEY, ARE WE STILL
IN THE OFFICE?

171
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,916
CALL ME KAIN.
- OKAY, IF YOU INSIST.

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,541
SO DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THE SECRET CHAMPIONS OF JUSTICE

173
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,541
WHO FIGHT BOOMERS
THAT'VE GONE OUT OF CONTROL?

174
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,083
- OH, YEAH, THOSE KNIGHT THINGS.

175
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,583
THEY'RE A BIG PAIN
IN THE POSTERIOR

176
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,833
AND A MAJOR PR DEBACLE
JUST WAITING TO HAPPEN.

177
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,333
SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE
TO GET RID OF THEM ASAP.

178
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,333
OUR COMPANY IS
IN THE BOOMER INDUSTRY

179
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,000
AND THE IDEA THAT A BOOMER
COULD GO OUT OF CONTROL

180
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,541
IS INCREDIBLY DAMAGING.
IT'S ALL JUST A SACK OF LIES

181
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,750
BEING DISTRIBUTED BY A GROUP
OF WANNABE VIGILANTES.

182
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,750
DON'T TELL ME YOU BELIEVE
THAT CRAP.

183
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,458
- ACTUALLY--

184
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,375
IT'S HER.
- HEY, WHY DON'T WE STOP TALKING

185
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,166
ABOUT WORK AND HAVE
A LITTLE FUN, HUH?

186
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,791
I KNOW THIS PLACE.
- UH-HUH.

187
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,250
- Man: MISTRESS SYLIA,
PLEASE COME TO THE PIT.

188
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,625
WE'VE DETECTED ANOTHER REACTION.

189
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,291
- OH.

190
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,416
- SO, HEY,
HOW DID YOU HURT YOURSELF?

191
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,458
- I SORT OF FELL.
- YOU OUGHTA BE MORE CAREFUL

192
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,458
WITH A PRETTY FACE LIKE THAT.

193
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,916
- OKAY, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?

194
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,833
I FORGOT MY WATCH AND I CAN'T
SEE THE SHADOW OF THE SKYHOOK,

195
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,833
BUT IT'S GETTING LATE.
- YOU DON'T LIVE

196
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,000
WITH YOUR PARENTS ANYMORE.
WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT TIME

197
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,916
IT IS AS LONG AS WE'RE STILL
HAVING A GOOD TIME?

198
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,166
- SORRY.

199
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,541
WHY AM I APOLOGIZING TO HIM?

200
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,208
- ( phone beeping )

201
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,333
- OH, MAN, WHY DOES THIS
ALWAYS HAPPEN

202
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,500
WHEN I'M IN THE SHOWER?
COME ON, COME ON.

203
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,375
I'M FREEZING MY ASS OFF.

204
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,916
( sighs )
ALL RIGHT!

205
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,166
- MMM!
- ( growls )

206
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,625
ALL RIGHT, I'M LEAVING NOW.

207
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,458
- HEY, CHILL, YOU CAN'T BLAME
A GUY FOR TRYING, RIGHT?

208
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,583
AND BESIDES--
- BESIDES?  BESIDES WHAT?

209
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,000
- IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW,

210
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,583
I'M THE ONE IN CHARGE
OF ASSESSING ALL NEW EMPLOYEES.

211
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,750
I'LL BE THE ONE
WHO ULTIMATELY DECIDES

212
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,791
WHAT KIND OF POSITIONS YOU'LL
BE ASSUMING FOR THE COMPANY. 

213
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,875
- I'M SURE THE COMPANY
WILL APPROVE

214
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,500
OF YOUR HANDS-ON APPROACH.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

215
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,833
- ( loud rumbling )
- HUH?

216
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,666
- ( screaming )

217
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,041
- ( shrieks )

218
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,583
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S A ROGUE BOOMER.

219
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,583
WHAT DO WE DO?  HUH?

220
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,333
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!
I'M AN EXECUTIVE!

221
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,750
- WHAT A TOTAL JERK.

222
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,291
- Man: McNichols, are you
and Wong still near Sodom?

223
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,833
- ACKNOWLEDGED.

224
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,666
- We got a mad boomer tearing up
a restaurant in Soto Ward.

225
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,166
The regular police have
asked us to step in

226
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,791
and handle the situation.

227
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,541
- YOU SAID YOU WERE BORED.
- ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

228
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,333
SCREW YOU, WONG.  HANG ON!
- ( screams )

229
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,916
THOSE SABERS AREN'T GONNA
BEAT US THIS TIME!

230
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,041
- ( screaming )

231
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,416
- Linna: ANOTHER EXIT!

232
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,541
OH, GREAT.

233
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,875
WHY IS EVERYONE AFTER ME?

234
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,833
- IT IS BREAK TIME.
EVERYBODY TAKE A BREAK.

235
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,000
- NO, THANKS.

236
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,583
- Nene: Come on, Priss.
We've got to hurry.  Come on!

237
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,750
- Priss: Shut up
or I'm going to spank you.

238
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,375
- Ha.  I'd like to see you try.

239
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,083
- YOU'VE BOTH CHECKED
YOUR AUTO-STARTERS, RIGHT?

240
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,083
I WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO
EACH OTHER'S GAUGE AT ALL TIMES.

241
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,791
UNDERSTOOD?
- I'm so sick of hearing that.

242
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,333
- Priss:
I'm suited up.  I'm going.

243
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,708
- DESTROY IT.
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING LEFT.

244
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,250
- ( explosions )

245
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,250
- ( gasps )

246
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,166
WHY CAN'T YOU FIND SOMEONE ELSE
TO FOLLOW?

247
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,916
THIS IS BAD.

248
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,791
( screaming )

249
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,208
- NO!

250
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,916
- ( snarling )

251
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,541
- ( screams )

252
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,166
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
THEY DO EXIST.

253
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,625
NO WAY!  ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I HAVE TO JUMP?

254
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:04,916
WAIT A SECOND!

255
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,791
OH!

256
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,666
( screaming )

257
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,083
- WAY TO GO, PRISS.
I'LL GET HER.

258
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,916
- HANG ON.

259
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,666
- ( sirens wailing )

260
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,958
- ( tires screeching )

261
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,958
- UH-OH, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
TOO LATE AGAIN, LEON-POO.

262
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,666
- DAMN!

263
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,750
- Woman: AND AS YET ANOTHER
PEACEFUL MORNING DAWNS

264
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,791
UPON THE GREAT MEGA CITY
COMPLEX,

265
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,083
LET US ALL GIVE THANKS

266
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,500

I'LL SEE YOU ALL AT THE REGULAR

273
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,375
HUH? ( gasps, laughs )

274
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,500
THAT WAS A ROUGH NIGHT,
WASN'T IT?

275
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,833
I LOOKED FOR YOU, BUT I
COULDN'T FIND YOU ANYWHERE.

276
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,750
- I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR SUCH AN EXCITING DATE.

277
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,750

- I CAME HERE TO THANK YOU.

279
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,583
- HOW ABOUT THIS EVENING?

280
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,166
- OH, NO.

281
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,500
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEN.

282
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,583
HERE IT COMES!
- ( shouts )

283
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,625
- Wong: PRISS, BABE,
WANNA GRAB A BREWSKI WITH US?

284
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,625
- NEXT TIME.

285
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,166
THANKS BUT NO THANKS.
YOU KICKED ASS TONIGHT

00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,041
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT MY SCAR, MISS BIG SHOT?

289
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,625
- IT'LL HEAL UP
ALL BY ITSELF.

290
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,583
- YOU'RE ONE OF THE KNIGHT
SABERS, AREN'T YOU?

291
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,541
I WANT TO BE
A KNIGHT SABER, TOO.

292
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:28,541
AND I'M NOT GIVING UP.

293
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,750
OH!  WAIT UP!

294
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,125

SEEKING TO JOIN THE MYSTERIOUS
KNIGHT SABERS,

298
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,500
LINNA TRACKS DOWN THE SINGER

IN A SERIES OF UNEXPECTED
CHALLENGES,

TO DON THE KNIGHT SABERS'
