1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,666
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,208
- Man: ALL RIGHT, LEON.

4
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,166
I THINK THIS TAPE
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

5
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,208
IF YOU'VE GOT AN EXPLANATION,
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,583
- ( groans )
McNichols here.

7
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,416
Those damn Knight Sabers
beat us to it again.

8
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,750
The situation is over.
- THE SITUATION IS OVER?

9
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,250
IT'S JUST BEGINNING.

10
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,125
YOU WERE SPEAKING ON AN OPEN
COMM FREQUENCY, YOU IDIOT!

11
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,708
WHAT THE HELL WERE
YOU THINKING?

12
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:15,041
- MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT WE ALL
STARTED THINKING, SIR.

13
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,708
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE
ABOUT THE KNIGHT SABERS.

14
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,541
- YES, BUT IT'S NOT OUR JOB.

15
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,125
THEY'RE UNDER THE JURISDICTION
OF THE REGULAR POLICE.

16
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,958
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE

17
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,333
THAT THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS,

18
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,416
NOT SOME NEW KIND
OF BOOMER TECHNOLOGY.

19
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,125
NOT ONLY ARE THEY
INCREDIBLY MOBILE,

20
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,583
BUT THEY'RE A QUARTER
OF THE SIZE OF ANY COMBAT ARMOR

21
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,458
I'VE EVER HEARD OF,
WITH THREE TIMES THE WEAPONRY.

22
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,583
FRANKLY, THEY MAKE OUR
DIVISION'S MOST ADVANCED K-2s

23
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:47,166
LOOK LIKE REFUGEES
FROM THE 20TH CENTURY.

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,500
- ALL THAT MAY
OR MAY NOT BE TRUE,

25
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,750
BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE AD
POLICE ISN'T RESPONSIBLE

26
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,500
FOR CONTROLLING THESE
VIGILANTES.

27
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,500
- AH, SOMEONE UPSTAIRS
HAS TOLD US TO BACK OFF.

28
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,125
- NO, I NEVER SAID THAT,
AND I DENY IT CATEGORICALLY.

29
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,875
NOW GET OUT OF HERE, YOU BUMS.
AND THE NEXT TIME

30
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,541
THE KNIGHT SABERS BEAT YOU,
I'LL TRADE THEM FOR YOU.

31
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,958
- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE
KNIGHT SABERS

32
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,541
ARE A LOT LIKE THE
GUARDIAN ANGELS.

33
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,125
- THE GUARDIAN WHAT?
- ANGELS.

34
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,625
THEY WERE A VOLUNTEER POLICE
FORCE THAT TRIED TO PROTECT

35
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,000
THE SUBWAYS IN LATE 20TH CENTURY
NEW YORK AGAINST MUGGERS.

36
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,625
- EXCEPT THAT THE KNIGHT SABERS

37
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,583
AREN'T INTERESTED
IN REGULAR CRIME.

38
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,541
THEY ONLY SHOW UP
FOR BOOMER INCIDENTS.

39
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,208
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
INTERESTED IN JUSTICE,

40
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,125
JUST AN EXCUSE
TO KICK SOME ASS.  DAMN!

41
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,125
WHY DOES TOKYO ATTRACT
ALL THE NUTS?

42
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,916
- YOU KNOW--
- DID YOU JUST HAVE AN IDEA?

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,916
- MAYBE IT'S SOME KIND OF TEST.
- A TEST?

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,958
WHAT FOR?

45
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,291
- THEIR POWERED SUITS
ARE YEARS AHEAD

46
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,291
OF ANYTHING
I'VE EVER HEARD OF,

47
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,125
AND THAT INCLUDES
MILITARY MODELS.

48
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,625
THAT KIND OF EFFICIENCY MUST
HAVE COST A BUNDLE TO DEVELOP,

49
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,000
WHICH MEANS THEY MUST BE PART

50
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,000
OF SOME LARGER ORGANIZATION,
RIGHT?

51
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,666
- YOU MEAN LIKE MAYBE
A MILITARY STRIKE FORCE.

52
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,666
- YES, BUT IT'S ONLY A THEORY.

53
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,125
- THEORY OR NOT.

54
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,000
IT'S JUST ONE MORE GOOD REASON
TO GET RID OF 'EM.

55
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,375
- Nene:
GOOD MORNING, LEON-POO.

56
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,500
- NENE, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
KEEP CALLING ME

57
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,833
BY THAT INFANTILE
NICKNAME?

58
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,666
- 'CAUSE I LIKE YOU, SILLY.

59
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,333
- HOW CAN YOU REFUTE SUCH
AN ELOQUENT ANSWER?

60
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:26,083
- DAMN IT, DALEY.  WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO KEEP ON ENCOURAGING HER?

61
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,458
- I WAS JUST PROVIDING...
- ( Nene laughing )

62
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,500
- ...A DIVERSION.
- HUH?

63
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,958
- ♪ LEON'S A GREAT BIG
POO HEAD ♪

64
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,250
- THIS ISN'T THE POLICE.
IT'S A KINDERGARTEN.

65
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,833
GOD HELP US.

66
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,000
- THIS DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

67
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,000
ALL THAT VIOLENCE,
ALL THAT DESTRUCTION,

68
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,250
AND THERE'S NOTHING ON THE NEWS
ABOUT IT AT ALL.

69
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,833
- Boomer Female Supervisor:
MISS YAMAZAKI,

70
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,666
MISS LINNA YAMAZAKI.

71
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,208
- PSST, LINNA.

72
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,208
SHE'S TALKING TO YOU.

73
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,291
- HELLO, CAN I HELP YOU?

74
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,041
- ACCESSING A NEWS SITE
USING YOUR WORKSTATION

75
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,750
IS EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED.  THIS
WILL BE NOTED ON YOUR RECORD.

76
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,916
- HEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU WARN ME
A LITTLE EARLIER?

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,416
- EXCUSE ME.  I WARNED YOU
FOUR TIMES, BRAIN DONOR.

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,083
- OH!  I'M STARTING TO HAVE
SERIOUS SECOND THOUGHTS

79
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,916
ABOUT WORKING HERE.

80
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,583
- HMM.

81
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,000
NOW THIS SHOULD SHOW OFF
THAT LOVELY FIGURE OF YOURS.

82
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,500
- YES, BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT MIGHT BE SHOWING OFF

83
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,958
A LITTLE TOO MUCH?

84
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,291
- FOR SOME PEOPLE, BUT WHEN
A GIRL HAS A LOVELY BODY,

85
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,958
I CAN'T STAND TO SEE HER HIDING
IT UNDER A BUNCH OF FLOPPY RAGS.

86
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,750
PLEASE, TRY THIS ONE ON FOR ME.

87
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,916
- WELL, IF YOU INSIST.
- ( doorbell rings )

88
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,916
- WHY, IT'S PRISS THE SINGER.
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,708
IF YOU'LL JUST WAIT
THERE A MOMENT,

90
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,083
I BELIEVE I'VE GOT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

91
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,333
- ( scoffs )

92
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,041
- SO HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

93
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,416
HAVE YOU FINALLY TIRED
OF THAT WORN LEATHER LOOK?

94
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,333
HMM, AND JUST LOOK
AT ALL THOSE SPLIT ENDS.

95
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,000
YOU'LL NEED A NEW CONDITIONER.

96
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,416
- I WANT MY PAY.

97
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,000
- HUH?
OH, YES, OF COURSE.

98
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,125
I HAVEN'T PAID YOU
FOR THE LAST ONE, HAVE I?

99
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,791
YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU
TO WEAR THE CLOTHES I RECOMMEND

100
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,958
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

101
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,875
- I WEAR YOUR HARDSUITS.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

102
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,250
SHE DOESN'T FIGHT VERY WELL AND
SHE'S ALWAYS GETTING IN MY WAY.

103
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,208
- YOU MEAN NENE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

104
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,166
SHE WANTS TO FIGHT AND SHE'S
THE ONLY BACKUP WE HAVE.

105
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,833
- I WAS JUST WONDERING

106
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,666
IF YOU WERE READY TO MAKE
ANOTHER HARDSUIT YET.

107
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,333
- ANOTHER HARDSUIT?
DO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN MIND?

108
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,541
- NOT REALLY.

109
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,833
- MISS, IT'S NICE,
BUT ARE YOU SURE THIS OUTFIT

110
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,750
REALLY COVERS ENOUGH OF ME?

111
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,750
- OH, NO, YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

112
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,541
HERE, LET'S TAKE A GOOD LOOK
IN THE MIRROR, OKAY?

113
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,666
- I WANT TO BE A KNIGHT SABER,
TOO, AND I'M NOT GIVING UP.

114
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,083
- So will I see you later?
- OF COURSE.

115
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,833
I'LL SHOW YOU THE ROPES.
( laughs )

116
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,500
- ( gulps )
- WHY, GOOD MORNING, KAIN.

117
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,041
DID I JUST HEAR YOU MAKING
A DATE OVER YOUR COMPUTER?

118
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,583
- NO, IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS ANYWAY.

119
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,708
- FORTUNATELY, THE REGULATIONS
DON'T SAY THAT I CAN'T USE

120
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,125
SOMEONE ELSE'S COMPUTER
TO ACCESS THE NET.

121
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,791
LET'S SEE WHAT THERE IS
ON THE KNIGHT SABERS.

122
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,083
- ( videogame beeping )

123
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,083
- ( alarm blaring )

124
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,708
- HUH?

125
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,041
THE AD POLICE COMPUTER
MUST HAVE SOME RECORD

126
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,375
OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

127
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,166
- TRYING TO CRACK INTO THE FILES
OF THE KNIGHT SABERS, ARE YOU?

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,208
YOU'RE BRAVE, BUT CLUMSY.  LET'S
SEE HOW BRAVE YOU REALLY ARE.

129
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,583
- ( maniacal laughter )
- WHAT?

130
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,208
- Nobody who has investigated
the Knight Sabers

131
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,250
has ever survived.

132
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,500
Turn back before it's too late.

133
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,708
- WHAT IN THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

134
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,875
- HEY, WAIT, I KNOW HER.

135
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,125
- Man: MISTRESS SYLIA.
- HUH?

136
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,625
- ARE YOU INTENDING
TO ADD ANOTHER MEMBER

137
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,541
TO THE KNIGHT SABERS,
MILADY?

138
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,541
- NENE LACKS THE SKILLS TO BE
A SOLID PARTNER FOR PRISS,

139
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,083
AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE
READY ANYTIME SOON.

140
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,333
OF COURSE, I COULD GO BACK
TO ACTIVE DUTY MYSELF.

141
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,041
BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T
LIKE THAT IDEA.

142
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,333
- ( sighs )

143
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:44,000
THE CURRENT MEMBERS WERE FOUND
THROUGH FORTUNATE ACCIDENTS.

144
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,666
SURELY YOU DON'T EXPECT
SERENDIPITY

145
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,166
TO PROVIDE YOU ANOTHER
VIABLE CANDIDATE.

146
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,458
- I'M GETTING SICK AND TIRED
OF YOUR WORRYING, HENDERSON.

147
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,208
THE TRUTH IS THAT
I HAVEN'T DECIDED

148
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,125
WHETHER TO INCREASE
THE NUMBER YET OR NOT.

149
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,583
- SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, MILADY.

150
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,500
- ( whirring )

151
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,625
- HMM.

152
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,458
- Woman: Greetings, Sylia.

153
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,041
You have an encoded
voice transmission.

154
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,541
- LET'S HEAR IT.

155
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,666
- Man: Things are really
beginning to heat up.

156
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,708
People in the tower are
beginning to become sensitive

157
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,000
to the fact that the ratio
of mad boomer occurrences

158
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,166
is slowly increasing.
There's a rumor going around

159
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,666
that the lab people suspected
it may be transmittable.

160
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,375
But the Tower is spreading
disinformation to the contrary,

161
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,250
claiming that the boomers
are completely safe.

162
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,666
We're headed for a crisis.

163
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,416
I'll call you again later
when it's safe.

164
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,875
- Woman: End of transmission.
No more voice mails.

165
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,041
- DAMN IT!
BOOMERS ARE SAFE!

166
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,208
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MINDS?

167
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,208
BOOMERS ARE A THREAT
TO EVERYONE ON THE PLANET.

168
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,750
THOSE FOOLS, DON'T THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE PLAYING WITH?

169
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,666
( sobs )

170
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,708
THEY'RE INSANE.
THEY MUST ALL BE INSANE!

171
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,166
- I LIKE BOOMERS, MASON.

172
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,250
IN FACT, THE TRUTH IS
THAT I LOVE THEM.

173
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,541
THEY EXIST ONLY TO RELEASE
MANKIND FROM THE BURDENS

174
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,583
OF PHYSICAL PAIN
AND EXHAUSTION.

175
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,625
WHEREAS PREVIOUS SOCIETIES

176
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,250
HAVE BANISHED THOSE

177
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,083
WHO PERFORMED THE MOST BASIC
AND VISIBLE TASKS

178
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,875
TO THE LOWEST CASTES,

179
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,791
MY BOOMERS WILL CHANGE
THIS FOREVER.

180
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,000
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM.

181
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,041
- BUT, SIR,
THE MARKET IS SHRINKING

182
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,583
AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCT
IS DECREASING.

183
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,541
WE OVERPRODUCED
AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE

184
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,125
AND THE MARKET IS FLOODED.

185
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,125
- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
ADVANCED THE SCHEDULE

186
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,958
FOR THIS SHOWHAM PROJECT,
ISN'T IT, MASON?

187
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,875
- TRUE AND WHEN THE PROJECT
SUCCEEDS, YOU AS THE MASTER

188
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,875
OF THE GENOM CORPORATION
WILL BE IN A PRIME POSITION

189
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,833
TO TAKE CONTROL
OF THE ENERGY INDUSTRIES

190
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,458
OF EVERY NATION
IN THE WORLD.

191
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,125
- ( sighs )

192
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:01,416
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR PURELY
FINANCIAL GAINS, MASON.

193
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,875
- I KNOW THAT, SIR.
HOWEVER--

194
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,041
- ( laughs )

195
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,666
I CAN HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS

196
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,000
AS PLAINLY AS IF YOU'RE
SPEAKING OUT LOUD.

197
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,708
YOU'RE WONDERING
IF I'LL EVEN LIVE TO SEE

198
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,625
THIS PLAN THROUGH
TO COMPLETION, AREN'T YOU?

199
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,916
I MUST LOOK PATHETIC TO YOU

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,958
DESPERATELY CLINGING TO LIFE.

201
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,833
- NO, SIR.
- I WON'T BE LIKE THIS FOREVER,

202
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:28,333
MASON, AND IT'S THAT THOUGHT
THAT KEEPS ME ALIVE.

203
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,833
WHY DO YOU THINK
I INVESTED SO MUCH

204
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,833
INTO MAKING GENOM CONTROLLER
OF ALL BOOMER TECHNOLOGY?

205
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,833
- HMM.  HOW PATHETIC.

206
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,625
AS ANTICIPATED,
CHAIRMAN ROSENKREUTZ

207
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,000
HAS INSTRUCTED US TO ACCELERATE
THE TIMETABLE

208
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,708
FOR THE SHOWHAM PROJECT.

209
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,958
INCREASE OUR PRODUCTION
OF BOOMERS ACCORDINGLY.

210
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,583
- YES, MR. VICE PRESIDENT.

- OKAY, KNOCK OFF
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

221
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,333
- I'D KILL FOR A SMOKE
RIGHT NOW.

222
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,291
- I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA QUIT.
- HUH?

223
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,250
- Man: DON'T YOU KNOW ALL
MUSICIANS ARE SELF-DESTRUCTIVE?

224
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,000
- YOU AGAIN.  BUT HOW?

225
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,750
- I JUST ASKED THE MANAGER
OF THE CLUB

226
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,500
YOU WERE PLAYING AT LAST NIGHT.

227
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,458
HE TOLD ME I COULD PROBABLY FIND
YOUR BAND REHEARSING HERE.

228
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,208
- OH, A GROUPIE!

229
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,833
- REALLY?  LET ME SEE.

230
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,416
MAN, WHY DOES OUR PRISS ALWAYS
ATTRACT THE MOUSY COUNTRY GIRLS?

231
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,833
- I DON'T KNOW, DUDE.
MAYBE WE'RE PLAYING

232
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,500
IN THE WRONG KIND OF CLUBS.
- I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

233
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,416
- OKAY, YOU FOUND ME.
NOW WHAT?

234
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,375
- I WANT TO JOIN UP.

235
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,791
- JOIN WHAT?
- YOU KNOW.

236
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,666
- THE BAND?
- OF COURSE NOT.

237
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,583
YOU KNOW WHAT.
- BIKER GANG.

238
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,083
- LOOK, I'M SERIOUS.
STOP PLAYING WITH ME.

239
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,041
- AM I?

240
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,500
- YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE.

241
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,958
- TRUE.
BUT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT.

242
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,208
- YOU GET OFF ON TAUNTING ME,
DON'T YOU?

243
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,166
JUST BECAUSE I'M A DUMB
COUNTRY HICK DOESN'T MEAN

244
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,166
THAT I HAVE TO TAKE YOUR CRAP.
NOW CUT IT OUT OR ELSE, DAMN IT!

245
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,166
- OR YOU'LL CRY AGAIN?

246
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,291
- LISTEN, IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
SCARE ME OFF, YOU'RE WRONG.

247
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,000
I KNOW YOU'RE ONE OF THE KNIGHT
SABERS AND I WANT TO SIGN UP

248
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,750
WHATEVER IT TAKES.
- IT TAKES MORE THAN WORDS.

249
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,000
HEY, GUYS, I GOTTA SPLIT.
- WHAT?

250
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,708
HEY, ONE "MOMENTITA",
SENORITA.

251
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,125
WE STILL HAVEN'T WORKED OUT
A BRIDGE FOR THAT NEW SONG YET.

252
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,291
COME ON, LITTLE SCOOTER.

253
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,125
YOU COST ME MY ENTIRE
FIRST PAYCHECK.

254
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,458
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP UP
WITH HER.

255
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,583
COULD THIS BE SOME KIND
OF TEST?

256
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,833
( screams )
OH, NO!

257
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,666
YOU CAN'T BREAK DOWN.

258
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,083
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BOUGHT A USED ONE.

259
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,583
( panting )

260
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,833
- WOW.  SHE'S GORGEOUS.

261
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,250
- Linna:
BUT NOW WHAT?

262
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,250
WHY ARE THEY GOING IN THERE?

263
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,958
( grunting )

264
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,208
THAT WAS TOO EASY.

265
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,791
- UM, EXCUSE ME.  HELLO.

266
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,041
I'M NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING,
AM I?

267
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,416
HUH?  NO WAY.

268
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
HOW CAN IT BE A DEAD END?

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,250
( screams )

270
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,125
I SUPPOSE THAT IF THIS PLACE
IS REALLY THE HIDDEN BASE

271
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,166
OF THE KNIGHT SABERS, THEY'D
NEED THIS TO HANDLE INTRUDERS.

272
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,166
HUH?!

273
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,458
- Nene: HEY, PRISS,
LOOK AT THE NEW MODIFICATIONS

274
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,750
NIGEL MADE TO MY HARDSUIT.

275
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,541
- NENE, IT'S YOUR BODY
THAT NEEDS FINE TUNING,

276
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,000
NOT YOUR HARDSUIT.
- OH!

277
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,083
HUH?
- WELL, WELL.

278
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,333
- AT LONG LAST SHE ARRIVES.
- HEY, I DIDN'T ASK HER.

279
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,666
SHE JUST FOLLOWED ME HOME.
- EXCUSE ME.

280
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,958
- HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
I KNOW HER, TOO.

281
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,208
SHE'S THE ONE WHO HACKED
INTO THE AD SERVER

282
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,000
LOOKING FOR INFORMATION
ON THE KNIGHT SABERS.

283
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,708
AND SHE WAS THE ONE
WE RESCUED THE OTHER NIGHT.

284
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,291
- HMM.

285
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,458
- IF YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE...

286
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,166
- YOU'RE A PRETTY ONE,
AREN'T YOU?

287
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,833
NICE HIGH CHEEKBONES,
VERY NICE INDEED.

288
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,166
AT LEAST NOW I'M FINALLY
BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND

289
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,250
WHY OUR LITTLE PRISS WANTS YOU
TO JOIN OUR LINEUP.

290
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,208
- THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I SAID, YOU KNOW?

291
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,000
- PRISS WANTS ME TO JOIN?

292
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,333
- NOW WAIT A SECOND.
PRISS WANTS HER ON THE TEAM?

293
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,583
BEING A KNIGHT SABER
IS A BIG RESPONSIBILITY.

294
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,458
WE CAN'T JUST LET ANYONE
WALK IN OFF THE STREET.

295
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,708
- YES, THAT'S TRUE.  THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD SYLIA,

296
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,875
BUT SHE GAVE YOU
A HARDSUIT ANYWAY.

297
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,541
- STOP BEING MEAN TO ME!
- STOP IT!

298
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,666
- HMM?

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,708
- PLEASE, BEFORE YOU MAKE UP
YOUR MINDS ABOUT ME,

300
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,875
LET ME SPEAK FOR MYSELF.

301
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,000
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT YOU YET,

302
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,708
BUT I KNOW THAT I WANT
TO BE ONE OF YOU.

303
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:04,291
I DIDN'T MOVE TO TOKYO
JUST TO GET A STUPID JOB.

304
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,500
I'VE BEEN READING RUMORS ABOUT
A GROUP OF ARMORED VIGILANTES

305
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,541
ON THE INTERNET
FOR OVER A YEAR NOW.

306
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,833
AND THE MORE I HEARD,
THE MORE I FELT THAT WHAT

307
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,875
YOU WERE DOING WAS IMPORTANT
ENOUGH TO RISK EVERYTHING

308
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,625
TO JOIN THE KNIGHT SABERS,
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.

309
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,541
- WELL, LET'S TRY YOU OUT.

310
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,541
THE HARDSUITS WE WEAR
HAVE TO BE CUSTOM FITTED.

311
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,291
THE PLUMBING AND MUSCLE
CONNECTIONS ALONE

312
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,291
ARE A NIGHTMARE
TO CONFIGURE.

313
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,250
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT
THERE'S NO WAY TO TEST YOU

314
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:37,000
IN REAL ARMOR, SO WE HAVE TO
USE THIS TORTURE DEVICE INSTEAD.

315
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,833
WELL, COME ON, GIRL.  THIS IS
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR,

316
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,416
ISN'T IT?  LET'S SEE IF YOU'VE
REALLY GOT WHAT IT TAKES

317
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,416
TO BE A KNIGHT SABER.

318
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,791
- TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

319
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,250
- Sylia: IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE SAME, OF COURSE,

320
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,958
BUT THE SIMULATOR
SHOULD GIVE YOU AN IDEA

321
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,625
OF WHAT A REAL MISSION
IS LIKE.

322
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,250
NENE, PULL UP FILE 84.

323
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,541
ARE YOU STILL SURE YOU WANT
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

324
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,750
- I'M SURE. ( gasps )

325
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,166
- TARGET CONFIRMED.
LET'S DO IT.

326
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,791
- EVERYBODY, STAND BACK.

327
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,500
THE K-2 WILL HANDLE THIS.

328
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,375
- Nene: OH, BOY,

329
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,166
IT'S THAT IDIOT DHARMA
AND HIS PIECE OF JUNK.

330
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,041
- WELL, LET'S SEE
IF HE'S LEARNED ANYTHING YET.

331
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,416
- HA!  GOTCHA!

332
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,666
- Priss: NOPE, PARTY OVER.

333
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,500
CLOSING TOO QUICKLY.
- WHAT?

334
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,333
- ( screaming )

335
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,083
- SHOULDN'T WE HELP HIM?

336
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,291
- Nene:
PRISS, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

337
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,875
- Sylia: ALL RIGHT, PRISS,
YOU'VE HAD YOUR LITTLE FUN.

338
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,666
NOW GET IN THERE
AND TAKE THAT BOOMER OUT.

339
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,041
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

340
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,708
- DAMN IT.  HERE COME
THE KNIGHT SABERS.  STOP 'EM!

341
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,875
- ( panting, screaming )

342
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,750
- I'M GOING IN.
- ( screaming )

343
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,125
- Nene: WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF TIME, PRISS.  HURRY!

344
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,875
- ( panting )

345
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,541
OH, MY GOD.

346
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,000
MY GOD.

347
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,333
- ( theme music playing )

348
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

349
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:08,250
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040,"

350
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,875

AS HER KNIGHT SABERS' HARDSUIT

351
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,375
IS READY FOR ITS FIRST TEST.

352
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:18,250
