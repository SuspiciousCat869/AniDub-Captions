1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:04,791
- SECURITY!

4
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,541
SECURITY,
CALL THE AD POLICE NOW.

5
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,083
IT'S A MAD BOOMER!

6
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,333
( gasps )

7
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,750
( screams )

8
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,500
( whimpers )

9
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,750
( screaming )

10
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,708
- ( rock music playing )

11
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,125
- ( elevator dings )

12
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,708
- Linna: THERE YOU ARE.

13
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,083
YOU'RE LATE, PRISS.

14
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,166
- WE SEEM TO HAVE
A FACTORY BOOMER 

15
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,083
IN THE 11th DISTRICT THAT IS
IN THE PROCESS OF GOING ROGUE.

16
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,083
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE AD POLICE 

17
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,083
HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED
ORDERS TO DISPATCH.

18
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,541
- AND THAT'S NOT
THE WORST OF IT.

19
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,333
APPARENTLY, THE BOOMER IS FUSING
WITH THE OTHER MACHINES

20
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,041
IN THE FACTORY.

21
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,958
- HMM.  LET'S GO.

22
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,000
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THERE,

23
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,333
BUT IT'S BAD.

24
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,333
GO AHEAD AND SEND
THE PROBOT IN.

25
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,708
- ROGER.
LAUNCHING PROBOT.

26
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,416
- UH-HUH.

27
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,833
LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALREADY
GETTING OUT OF CONTROL HERE.

28
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,416
- ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE BOOMER 

29
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,750
OR OUR COLLEAGUES?

30
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,291
LET'S HANG BACK
FOR A MINUTE.

31
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,250
- ( car door opens )
- HMM?

32
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,708
MY MY MY.
SUCH DEDICATION.

33
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,916
- THE AD POLICE LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE GETTING READY

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,666
TO START A WAR.

35
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,666
- Linna: PRISS?

36
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,708
ABOUT THIS BOOMER.

37
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,958
HOW BAD IS IT?

38
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,125
- IF IT FUSES WITH ALL
THAT MACHINERY IN THERE,

39
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,416
REALLY BAD.

40
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,375
- COME ON, LINNA.
HURRY UP!

41
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,833
- MMM.

42
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,375
- KNIGHT SABERS,
PREPARE FOR ACTION.

43
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,166
- TELL ME, MASON,

44
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,500
WHY ARE YOU USING
THE AD POLICE FOR THIS?

45
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,833
- THERE ARE MANY OFFICERS
IN THE ADP

46
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,041
WHO HARBOR A CERTAIN
ANIMOSITY

47
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,833
TOWARDS THE KNIGHT SABERS.

48
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,500
THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR US
TO ACCOMPLISH OUR OBJECTIVES

49
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,666
WITHOUT TOO MANY
UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS.

50
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,625
IT WAS A MATTER
OF CONVENIENCE.

51
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,666
- AND WHAT ABOUT THE BOOMER?

52
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,583
HAVE YOU DISCOVERED
HOW TO MAKE THE BOOMER'S CORE

53
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,583
GO ROGUE ON COMMAND?

54
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,916
- NO.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,250
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE,
SIR.

56
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,541
NOT WITH OUR
CURRENT TECHNOLOGY.

57
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,875
OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING
TO DECIPHER THE ALGORITHM.

58
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,541
- I SEE.

59
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,541
AND YET YOU ARE ABLE
TO MANUFACTURE

60
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,250
A ROGUE BOOMER INSTANT.

61
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,083
HOW IS THAT?

62
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,208
- IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.

63
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,541
WE REMOVED
THE SERVICE DRONE'S CORE

64
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,458
AND REPLACED IT WITH ONE
FROM A BOOMER

65
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,208
THAT WAS ALREADY
GOING ROGUE.

66
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,458
WITHIN A FEW HOURS,
WE HAD THE DESIRED RESULTS.

67
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,541
- HOW CLEVER.

68
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,250
I WONDER IF OUR
LOVELY IRON LADIES

69
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,416
WILL APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS
ON THEIR BEHALF.

70
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,250
- AND ONCE WE HAVE
OBTAINED THE KNIGHT SABERS,

71
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,916
WHAT DO YOU INTEND
TO DO WITH THEM, SIR?

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,916
- DINNER, PERHAPS.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,250
I WOULD LIKE TO
HEAR THEIR STORY.

74
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,833
I'M SURE THEY COULD TELL US
MANY INTERESTING THINGS.

75
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,958
- SIR, I'VE LOCATED THE BOOMER.

76
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,958
- WOW, WHAT A MON--

77
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,000
( gasps )

78
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,916
DAMN.  IT JUST ABSORBED
OUR PROBE ROBOT.

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,458
YAMAGUCHI,

80
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,583
TAKE YOUR SQUAD IN
AND WASTE THAT THING.

81
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,041
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ANY CIVILIANS

82
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,291
WHO MIGHT GET IN THE WAY.

83
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,000
- Understood.
Have the K-suits standing by.

84
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,041
- SQUAD THREE, MOVE OUT!

85
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,625
- OH, PLEASE. THOSE IDIOTS ARE
GOING TO TRY A FRONTAL ASSAULT.

86
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,166
- Priss: BAD MOVE.

87
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,750
THAT BOOMER'S GOT THE POWER
OF THIS WHOLE FACTORY BEHIND IT.

88
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,625
NENE, CAN YOU ACCESS
THE POWER GRID?

89
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,208
- OF COURSE I CAN.

90
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,541
BUT FIRST, I'VE GOTTA
TAKE CARE OF THOSE

91
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,291
ADP SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.

92
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,791
TAKE CARE OF THE NEWBIE
FOR ME.

93
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,958
- THE WHAT?
( sighs )

94
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,291
SO SHOULD WE RUSH IT
FROM BEHIND?

95
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,083
- WHAT YOU'LL DO IS
STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

96
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,291
- EXCUSE ME?
I MAY BE THE NEW GIRL,

97
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,958
BUT I DON'T ROLL OVER
FOR ANYONE.

98
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:25,916
LET'S GO.

99
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,375
- THE KNIGHT SABERS
ARE HERE, SIR.

100
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,416
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

101
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,666
HUH?

102
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,291
WHAT THE--?

103
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,125
- AH AH AH.

104
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,875
IT'S NOT POLITE
TO SPY ON PEOPLE.

105
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,625
- Mason: SWITCHING TO THE CAMERA
MOUNTED IN THE BOOMER.

106
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:59,250
- I JUST WANT TO ASK THEM
A QUESTION, MASON.

107
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:03,875
I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY
HATE BOOMERS SO MUCH.

108
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,208
WHY CAN'T THEY
LOVE MY BOOMERS?

109
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,916
WE MUST TAKE THESE
KNIGHT SABERS APART

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,375
AND FIND OUT
WHAT DRIVES THEM.

111
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,375
I WANT TO SEE WHAT IS
IN THEIR BRAINS.

112
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,250
UNLESS WE CAN TEACH
WOMEN LIKE THESE KNIGHT SABERS

113
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,708
TO LOVE MY BOOMERS,

114
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,583
MY VISION OF
A BOOMER-SUPPORTED PARADISE

115
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,708
CAN NEVER COME TO PASS.

116
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,666
DON'T YOU THINK SO,
MASON?

117
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,166
- I REALLY CAN'T SAY,
SIR.

118
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,708
BOOMERS AND HUMANS
MAY BE INCOMPATIBLE.

119
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,375
- AH, I SEE.

120
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,875
YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE BOOMERS,
DO YOU, MASON?

121
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,041
- YOU MAY REST ASSURED
THAT WE SHARE THE SAME GOALS.

122
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,000
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

123
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,083
- YES, LADIES.

124
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,083
YOU WILL COME TO LOVE 
AND ACCEPT MY BOOMERS,

125
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,375
JUST AS THE MASTERS
OF THIS CITY DID.

126
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,250
YES.

127
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,791
WHEN THIS CITY COLLAPSED
INTO RUIN AND RUBBLE,

128
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,125
IT WAS MY BOOMERS WHO
BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE.

129
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,458
I GAVE THEM MY WORD,

130
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,916
AND MY BOOMERS
MADE IT SO.

131
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,416
FOR THIS THEY
DESERVE RESPECT.

132
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,458
- ( moans )

133
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,750
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THE CHAIRMAN ASKED ME?

134
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,166
HE ASKED IF
I HATED BOOMERS.

135
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,500
- BUT YOU DO, SIR.

136
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,208
YOU DO HATE BOOMERS.

137
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,833
- ( chuckles )

138
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,166
- ( gasps )

139
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,125
- I DON'T HATE BOOMERS.

140
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,500
- ( sighs )

141
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,208
- NOT ALL OF THEM,
ANYWAY.

142
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,708
AS YOU KNOW.

143
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,291
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
I CONTINUE TO CATER

144
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,916
TO THAT SENILE OLD ZOMBIE'S
EVERY WHIM.

145
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,416
AS YOU KNOW,

146
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,625
I HAVE VERY SPECIAL
REQUIREMENTS.

147
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,458
AND FOR THOSE NEEDS...

148
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,083
I NEED A VERY SPECIAL BOOMER.

149
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,708
- ( sighs )

150
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,875
- PATTERNS.

151
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:31,958
THERE MUST BE A PATTERN.

152
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,250
- Reporter: THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY
THE EARTHQUAKE IS INDESCRIBABLE.

153
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,125
TOKYO'S PRESTIGIOUS
BIOSCAPE LABORATORIES

154
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,041
IS IN UNRECOGNIZABLE RUIN.

155
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,625
- Henderson:
MISTRESS SYLIA?

156
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,916
I'VE JUST RECEIVED A CALL
FROM BIOSCAPE HEADQUARTERS.

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,250
YOUR FATHER HAS BEEN MISSING
SINCE THE EARTHQUAKE.

158
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,125
I'M AFRAID THAT
THE AUTHORITIES

159
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,250
BELIEVE THAT
HE MUST BE DEAD.

160
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,708
I'M SO SORRY.

161
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,041
- IS IT SO BAD 
THAT HE'S DEAD?

162
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,125
- ( gasps )
MISTRESS SYLIA.

163
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,458
- I THINK MY MOTHER 
MAY HAVE CALLED HIM.

164
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,791
- I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE TO
RUN A CABLE OUT TO THEM.

165
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,041
I WANT COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN US
AND THE ASSAULT TEAM RESTORED.

166
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,375
SO DO IT!

167
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,750
I KNEW THIS PLAN
WAS DOOMED FROM THE GET-GO.

168
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,416
HUH?

169
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,083
OH, LEON.  I THOUGHT
YOU WERE OFF TODAY. 

170
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,333
- GOING A LITTLE OVERBOARD,
AREN'T YOU?

171
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,166
- NOT AT ALL.
THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO TRUST

172
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,666
THE AD POLICE,
AND THIS BROADCAST

173
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,291
WILL PROVE THEY ARE PERFORMING
A NECESSARY FUNCTION.

174
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,875
WHERE'S THAT CAMERA,
DAMN IT?!

175
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,416
- It's almost ready, sir.
- WAIT A SECOND.

176
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,875
THIS IS ALL A PUBLICITY STUNT?

177
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,875
- THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT THE WHOLE THING

178
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,625
SMELLS REALLY FUNNY TO ME.

179
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,416
IT'S NOT LIKE OUR TOP BRASS.

180
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,291
WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO
STAGE A BIG SHOW LIKE THIS?

181
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,500
WE'RE TOO FAR AWAY
TO RISK EVERYTHING NOW.

182
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,958
- TOO FAR AWAY FROM WHAT,
DALEY?

183
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,083
- ( explosion )
- Both: HUH?

184
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,416
- AAH!

185
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:05,958
( screams )

186
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,291
( screaming )

187
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,333
- ( screams )

188
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,666
- SEND IN THE K-SUITS.

189
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,125
OUR FIREARMS AREN'T EVEN
SCRATCHING THE DARN THING.

190
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,208
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
GONNA TRY

191
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,333
THOSE OUTDATED PIECES
OF JUNK AGAIN.

192
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,875
SOME PEOPLE JUST
WANT TO DIE.

193
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,458
- TO DIE?

194
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,375
NENE, HAVEN'T YOU
FINISHED YET?

195
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,375
- I'VE BEEN BUSY.

196
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,125
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SO SIMPLE THAT
EVEN YOU COULD HAVE DONE IT.

197
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,916
GIVE ME A SECOND.

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,416
I'LL HAVE IT DOWN
AS SOON AS I CAN.

199
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,291
- WELL, HURRY UP.

200
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,416
SYLIA, I'M GOING IN NOW.

201
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,916
Priss: Sylia?

202
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,416
- ( gasps )
PRISS,

203
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,833
STATUS REPORT.

204
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,166
- The ADP are pulling out
their assault team

205
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,291
and moving their K-suits in.

206
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,583
- OKAY.

207
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,291
LET'S HIT IT HARD AND FAST.

208
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,000
- ( roars )

209
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,458
- ( grunts )

210
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,333
- ( screaming )

211
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,083
- THIS IS A TOTAL FIASCO.

212
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,083
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE KNIGHT
SABERS HAVEN'T SHOWN UP YET.

213
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,250
- ( screams, grunts )

214
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,125
( gasps )

215
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,666
- ( roars )

216
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,875
- THE K-SUITS.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

217
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,833
- GET OUT OF THE WAY, SIR.
LET US FINISH IT OFF.

218
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,416
- AND HERE COME THE CLOWNS.

219
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,416
OH, NENE?

220
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,291
HAVEN'T YOU FINISHED YET?

221
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,750
- OH, CHILL OUT.

222
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,750
I HAVEN'T DONE THIS 
IN AWHILE, YOU KNOW.

223
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,083
- Priss: Yeah, whatever.

224
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,458
Just stop screwing around
and do it.

225
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,375
- I'M NOT SCREWING AROUND.

226
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,833
YOU'RE THE EXPERT ON THAT.

227
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,333
- YEAH, WE GOT IT!

228
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,708
- YOU IDIOT.
IT'S NOT DEAD YET.

229
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,416
- ( gasps )

230
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,125
- GET OUT OF THERE NOW!

231
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,958
THAT THING'S TRYING TO 
ASSIMILATE YOUR K-SUIT.

232
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,416
- ( screaming )

233
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,791
- TA-DA!  I'M DONE.

234
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,125
ARE YOU READY, PRISS?

235
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,791
- Priss:
I've been ready, lard butt.

236
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,833
- ( sighs )

237
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,708
HERE WE GO.

238
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,875
BOMBS AWAY.

239
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,750
SWITCH ON.

240
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,708
- Priss:
HUH. IT WORKED.

241
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,041
- Linna:
WHAT DID SHE DO?

242
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,166
WHY DID IT SHRINK?

243
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,791
- LET'S GO.
- ( gasps )

244
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,375
- I KNEW THEY'D SHOW UP.

245
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,583
- YES.

246
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:36,000
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU LADIES.

247
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,666
- Priss: NENE REVERSED
THE PHASE OF THE CURRENT FLOW.

248
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,208
THAT'S WHY IT
STOPPED GROWING.

249
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,833
COME ON,
WE GOT A BOOMER TO KILL.

250
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,791
- ( gasps, screams )

251
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,333
- LINNA!  DAMN.

252
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,708
( grunts )

253
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,333
- PRISS, WE'VE GOT TO HURRY!

254
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,125
THAT THING WILL BLOW UP
ONCE ITS POWER CELLS ACTIVATE.

255
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,125
( grunts )

256
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,541
- Priss: NENE.

257
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,666
- NOT TOO SHABBY, HUH?

258
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,041
WHY SHOULD YOU HARD BODY
TYPES HAVE ALL THE FUN?

259
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,041
- NENE, STOP BRAGGING
AND SMASH ITS CORE.

260
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,958
- Nene:
I know the drill, Sylia.

261
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,958
- Sylia:
GOD, WHAT A MONSTER.

262
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,250
- MAMA, WHAT IS PAPA MAKING?

263
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,916
- IT'S...

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,583
A BIO-ORGANIC CONSTRUCT.

265
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,791
- WHAT'S BIO-ORGANIC?

266
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,375
- A MACHINE THAT'S ALIVE.

267
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,833
SOMETHING THAT CAN TAKE
THE PLACE OF HUMAN BEINGS.

268
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,250
- REALLY?  PAPA'S GREAT,
ISN'T HE, MAMA?

269
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,250
- I DON'T KNOW.

270
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,916
I WONDER...

271
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,250
WHAT HE'S DOING IS
AGAINST THE WILL OF GOD.

272
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,291
EVEN THOUGH HE'S YOUR FATHER,

273
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,291
EVEN THOUGH I LOVE HIM,

274
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,625
CAN I FORGIVE HIM FOR THAT?

275
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,291
AND WILL YOU BE ABLE
TO FORGIVE HIM, SYLIA?

276
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,541
- MAMA?

277
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,708
( giggles )

278
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,291
- PAPA.

279
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,416
- ( Nene screams )

280
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,708
- ( gasps )

281
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,875
- ( whimpers )

282
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,291
- ( gasps )
- LINNA.

283
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,833
- THOSE POWERED SUITS...

284
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,750
SUCH PERFECTION.

285
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,708
- ( roars )

286
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,166
- OKAY.
HERE GOES NOTHING.

287
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,833
( shouts )

288
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,333
- I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'LL
HAVE TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.

289
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,791
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

290
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,333
ARE WE JUST SUPPOSED TO
LEAVE LIKE NOTHING'S HAPPENED?

291
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,083
WHY DOESN'T HE WANT TO 
SEE HIS WIFE AND CHILD?

292
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,875
ARE HIS EXPERIMENTS MORE
IMPORTANT TO HIM

293
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,916
THAN HIS FAMILY?

294
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,666
WHAT KIND OF MAN
HAS HE BECOME?

295
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,125
- I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

296
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,208
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO,

297
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,208
THE REJECTION SYMPTOMS
ALWAYS OCCUR.

298
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,333
EVERY SINGLE EXPERIMENT
HAS ENDED IN FAILURE.

299
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,666
- Sylia's Mother: 
OF COURSE IT DOES!

300
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,208
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
DOING SOMETHING

301
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,875
WHICH GOES AGAINST
THE WILL OF GOD!

302
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,333
COME HERE, SYLIA.
- Young Sylia: AAH!

303
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,791
- YOUR FATHER'S SAYING
HE DOESN'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.

304
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,750
- THE DOCTOR NEVER SAID
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

305
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,083
- Sylia's Mother:
LET'S GO, SYLIA! 

306
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,750
- PAPA!

307
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,250
( crying )

308
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,291
- Sylia: PAPA...

309
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,291
WHY DID YOU
LEAVE IT TO ME?

310
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,375
- ( crying )

311
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,708
MAMA IS-- MAMA.

312
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,500
- YOUR MOTHER WAS SICK.

313
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,041
AND SHE HASN'T BEEN
THE PERSON SHE WAS 

314
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,500
FOR A LONG TIME.

315
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,041
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

316
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,375
I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU
FROM NOW ON.

317
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,416
- PAPA.

318
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,833
- DON'T WORRY.

319
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,166
HAVE FAITH IN ME.

320
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,708
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

321
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,375
BUT FIRST,
I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP.

322
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,875
- WHAT?

323
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:01,416
- I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
WITH MY RESEARCH.

324
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,208
- DOING WHAT?

325
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,083
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO ANYTHING. 

326
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,750
YOU JUST NEED TO
GO TO SLEEP FOR 

327
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,208
A LITTLE BIT,
THAT'S ALL.

328
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,416
YOU TRUST YOUR FATHER,

329
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,750
DON'T YOU, SYLIA?

330
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,041
AND YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
MY RESEARCH IS TO ME, RIGHT?

331
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,708
SO YOU WILL HELP ME,
WON'T YOU?

332
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,083
- MM-HMM.

333
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,416
- THAT'S GOOD.

334
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,041
AT LAST I CAN GIVE
LIFE TO MY BOOMER.

335
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,958
- ( grunts )

336
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:32,916
( screams )

337
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,416
( grunts )

338
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,750
- CLOSE CALL.

339
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,125
- THANKS, NENE.

340
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,583
- WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME LEFT.

341
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,958
CHECK YOUR BATTERY.
- HUH?  OH NO.

342
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,333
- LINNA!

343
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,041
NENE AND I WILL TRY
TO HOLD THE BOOMER.

344
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,458
YOU GO IN AND SMASH ITS CORE.

345
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,833
- OKAY, PRISS.
I'M ON IT.

346
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:52,833
- LET'S DO IT!

347
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,333
- ( gasps )

348
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,166
- SMASH THE CORE, LINNA!

349
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,333
- ( gasps )

350
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,458
MM.

351
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,458
( shouts )

352
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,333
( breathing heavily )

353
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,166
I DID IT.

354
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,625
- Nene: LINNA, COME ON!

355
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,583
- NO TIME TO GLOAT.
WE'VE GOT TO GO.

356
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,166
- WAIT!  WHAT THE HELL?

357
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,625
ARE YOU TRYING
TO KILL THEM? 

358
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,250
ARE YOU INSANE?

359
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,541
- DON'T HIT THEM.
THIS IS JUST A THREAT.

360
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,125
BUT DON'T LET THEM
GET AWAY EITHER.

361
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,875
- NOW THIS ALL MAKES SENSE.

362
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,208
THIS WASN'T ABOUT 
THE BOOMER AT ALL.

363
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,583
- YEAH, I GET IT NOW.

364
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,208
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

365
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,583
WHY ARE THEY
SHOOTING AT US?

366
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,708
( screams )

367
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:22,916
- SYLIA!

368
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,833
- ( screams )

369
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,166

371
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,250

THE AD POLICE HAVE
THE KNIGHT SABERS CORNERED,

374
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,708
AND IT LOOKS LIKE PRISS,
LINNA, AND NENE MAY BE TRAPPED.

375
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:17,208
WITH THEIR BATTERIES DRAINED
AND THEIR WEAPONS EXHAUSTED,

376
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,791
THERE'S ONLY ONE HOPE LEFT.

377
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,375
BUT WILL IT
ARRIVE IN TIME?

378
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,916
WAR ERUPTS ACROSS TOKYO
AS THE ADP FINALLY DECIDE

379
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,458
