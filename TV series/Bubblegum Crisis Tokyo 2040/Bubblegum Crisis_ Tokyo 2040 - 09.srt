1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,000
- ( sirens blaring )

4
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,041
- NO, THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER.

5
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,000
THE FLOW'S STILL RUNNING
17% BELOW OPTIMUM.

6
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,541
IT'S HOPELESS, SIR.

7
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,250
THE SYSTEM CONNECTORS
DOWN HERE WERE ALL INSTALLED

8
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,208
WAY BACK IN THE 2020s.

9
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,583
- We can't change that.

10
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,125
Budget won't let us replace
something that works.

11
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,875
Not while we've still got
all this quake damage to fix.

12
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,500
At least the pipes
in that section

13
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,250
all share a common
drain system.

14
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,625
- SIR, I'VE DETECTED
A BLOCKAGE.

15
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,666
SHALL I FIX IT?

16
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,416
- YEAH, BUT BE QUICK ABOUT IT.

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,416
WE'VE GOT THREE MORE
TUNNELS TO HIT TONIGHT.

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,750
- YES, SIR.
BEGINNING REPAIR.

19
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,041
- YOU KNOW, WHEN I
APPLIED FOR THIS JOB,

20
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,958
THEY TOLD ME THAT HUMANS DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO DOWN HERE ANYMORE.

21
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,916
SO WHY AM I STUCK HERE 200 FEET
DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,625
WITH TWEEDLEDUM
THE WONDER BOOMER?

23
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,958
- Because drains that were
built before the quake

24
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,416
have to be certified 
by a human inspector.

25
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,083
But I wouldn't
complain too much.

26
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,833
If that boomer
wasn't so stupid,

27
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,625
you wouldn't have a job,
would you?

28
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,041
But don't worry.
That'll change. 

29
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,000
- JEEZ.  WHAT A JERK.

30
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,458
HEY, HAVEN'T YOU
FINISHED THAT YET?

31
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,458
- THE K-3 UNIT IS BROKEN.

32
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,833
A REPLACEMENT
IS NECESSARY.

33
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,458
- A K-3 UNIT?
YOU KIDDING ME?

34
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,416
I DON'T THINK I HAVE
ANYTHING THAT OLD IN THE KIT.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,291
YOU REALIZE THIS MEANS
I'M GONNA HAVE TO WALK

36
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,416
ALL THE WAY TO THE SURFACE
FOR ONE CRAPPY PIECE OF PIPE?

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,625
OH, WELL.

38
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,416
I GUESS I CAN TAKE
MY PSEUDO-BACCO BREAK

39
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,125
BEFORE I GO.

40
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,166
- ( growling )
- HUH?

41
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,500
( screams )

42
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,875
DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT.

43
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:49,125
- I'M SORRY, SIR.

44
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,375
- ( gulps )

45
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,791
UHH...

46
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,166
( sighs )

47
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,500
( gulps )

48
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,166
( shudders )

49
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,375
( gasps )

50
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,875
( shudders )

51
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,416
- GOOD MORNING, MISAE.

52
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,750
- OH, HI, LINNA.

53
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,375
HAVE YOU HEARD YET?

54
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,375
HITORI IN SALES
JUST GOT DEMOTED.

55
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,375
THEY CRUCIFIED HER.
- THEY WHAT?

56
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,375
BUT WHY?

57
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,541
- NOBODY SAID YET.

58
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,291
BUT THE BUZZ IS THAT
SOMEONE CAUGHT HER

59
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,750
GIVING A KICKBACK
TO SOMEONE AT GENOM.

60
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,208
- I'M SHOCKED.

61
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,541
SHE WAS THE ONLY
DECENT SUPERVISOR WE HAD.

62
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,458
NOT TO MENTION THE ONLY
FEMALE IN MANAGEMENT.

63
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,875
- WELL, WHAT DID YOU 
EXPECT IN THIS PLACE?

64
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,875
I MEAN, THE PEOPLE
RUNNING THIS COMPANY

65
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,875
WERE ALL BORN IN 
THE 20th CENTURY.

66
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,416
AND SPEAKING OF
STONE HEADS,

67
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,208
THE ACCOUNTING BOOMER
IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

68
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,458
I THINK YOU MADE 
A LITTLE BOO-BOO.

69
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,916
- OH, NUTS!

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,458
- YEAH, BUT MAYBE
YOU'LL LUCK OUT

71
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,583
AND SHE'LL DISAPPEAR TOO.
- HUH?

72
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,625
- YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW,
COUNTRY GIRL?

73
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,333
- HUH?  KNOW WHAT?

74
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,125
- ABOUT ALL 
THE MISSING BOOMERS.

75
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,875
THEY'VE BEEN DISAPPEARING
MYSTERIOUSLY

76
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,250
OVER IN THE OLD
28th WARD,

77
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,583
AND NOBODY KNOWS WHY.

78
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,916
- REALLY?
- WELL, IT'S JUST A RUMOR.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,250
IF IT WAS REAL,
IT WOULD BE ON TV, RIGHT?

80
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,791
UH-OH.
NO SUCH LUCK.

81
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,166
THE ACCOUNTING BOOMER
IS BACK.

82
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,125
- ( typing, beeping )

83
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,416
- HMM.

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
IF WE RULE OUT
THE QUESTIONABLE ONES,

85
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,250
THERE'S SEVEN CASES.

86
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,708
BUT IF WE GO AHEAD
AND INCLUDE

87
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,458
EVERY POSSIBLE DISAPPEARANCE
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS,

88
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,500
THEN THERE ARE OVER 20.

89
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,291
MMM.

90
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,666
- I BREWED SOME APPLE 
WITH THE TEA, MY LADY.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,458
- WELL, SINCE NO HUMANS
HAVE BEEN ATTACKED YET,

92
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,708
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE MISSING
BOOMERS WENT ROGUE.

93
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,166
- Henderson: THERE'S BEEN
NOTHING ON THE NEWS.

94
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,125
DO YOU THINK SOMEONE'S
STEALING THEM?

95
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:35,125
- Yes, sir. We still don't
know what's going on.

96
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,500
But it appears that the Boomers
that disappeared last night

97
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,041
were destroyed,
not stolen like we thought.

98
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,458
- DESTROYED?
BY THE KNIGHT SABERS

99
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,500
OR SOME OTHER ANTI-BOOMER
TERRORISTS?

100
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,750
- No, sir.

101
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,625
We found some pieces
of the Boomers.

102
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,291
Very small pieces
of the Boomers.

103
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,833
They looked as if
they'd been crushed

104
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,291
under tremendous pressure.

105
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,333
Totally inconsistent
with explosives

106
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,541
or incendiaries.

107
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,958
- WE'LL FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS.

108
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,666
WHAT ABOUT YOUR
OTHER ASSIGNMENT?

109
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,375
- Actually, it's
rather interesting

110
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,750
that you brought that up, sir.

111
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,625
As you can see,
13 of the 15 missing Boomers

112
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,208
all disappeared
within a kilometer

113
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,541
of the 28th Ward.

114
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,708
And of those 15,

115
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,833
13 disappeared while
they were working in

116
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,166
the underground
tunnel network.

117
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,083
- THE 28th WARD.
- That's right. 

118
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,750
And you'll notice
on this map

119
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,291
of pre-quake Tokyo,

120
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,875
the Bioscape Corporation
had several lab facilities

121
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,666
located in the same area.

122
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,541
Of course,
it's always possible

123
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,208
that it could just
be a coincidence. 

124
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,666
But you know how I feel
about those, don't you, sir?

125
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,541
- HMM. SO THE NEWS BLACKOUT

126
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,208
WAS A WISE PRECAUTION.

127
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,000
KEEP LOOKING--
- Damn. Hold on, sir.

128
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,916
I think someone's hacked into
our communications net.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,375
Give me a minute, sir. I'm gonna
have to cut this channel off

130
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,625
in order to smoke the little
rat out of the system.

131
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,416
- ( sighs )

132
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,375
- I'm sorry, sir.
I failed to catch the hacker.

133
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,208
- WELL, AT LEAST 
YOU STOPPED THEM.

134
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,416
THERE ARE MOLES
EVERYWHERE THESE DAYS.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,875
- ( yawns )

136
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,875
BOY, THAT WAS TOO CLOSE.

137
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,083
BUT I PROVED THAT
SYLIA'S RIGHT.

138
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,958
THE BOOMERS ARE
DISAPPEARING,

139
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,833
AND THERE IS
A PATTERN TO IT.

140
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,250
- EXCUSE ME.

141
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,708
THERE'S A PATTERN
TO WHAT?

142
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:16,791
- ( stammers )

143
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,416
- HEY, WAIT A SECOND,
KIDDO.

144
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,083
YOU WOULDN'T BE
USING YOUR PC

145
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,750
FOR PERSONAL USE,
WOULD YOU?

146
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,500
ONLINE STOCK PORTFOLIO
INVESTMENTS, IS IT?

147
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,958
- DO I LOOK THAT DUMB?

148
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,458
AND DON'T CALL ME KIDDO,
YOU JERK.

149
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,083
- WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW GLAD I AM TO HEAR THAT.

150
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,416
I'D REALLY HATE TO HAVE TO
REPORT YOU, YOU KNOW.

151
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,750
- ( sighs )

152
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,083
- ( clears throat )

153
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,625
BUT BY THE WAY...

154
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,416
- HMM?
- HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU

155
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,291
HANGING OUT IN A CLUB
CALLED "HOT LEGS" IN SATO?

156
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,000
- I'VE BEEN THERE
ONCE OR TWICE.

157
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,916
- OH, I THINK YOU MUST
HAVE BEEN THERE

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
MORE THAN JUST ONCE OR TWICE

159
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,000
IF THEY LET YOU IN
WHEN IT'S CLOSED. 

160
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,083
- NOW I'VE ONLY
DONE THAT ONCE.

161
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,416
BUT HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT, LEONARDO? 

162
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,875
- ( stammers )
HEY, DON'T CALL ME THAT.

163
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,750
- WHY?  IT IS YOUR
REAL NAME,

164
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,791
AND IT SOUNDS SO CUTE,
LEONARDO.

165
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,291
AND WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
FOLLOWING ME TO NIGHT CLUBS,

166
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,375
MR. STALKER?

167
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,625
- I WASN'T!
I WAS LOOKING FOR PRISS.

168
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,791
- HUH?  PRISS ASKED YOU
TO COME TOO?

169
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,416
- YOU MEAN, YOU KNOW HER?

170
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,416
- WOW.
PRISS ASKED A GUY OUT.

171
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,125
THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING.

172
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,291
- WELL, ACTUALLY
I WAS JUST--

173
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,083
- BUT WAIT A SECOND.

174
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,958
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
KNOWN HER ANYWAY?

175
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,416
- HOW LONG HAVE I--
WELL...

176
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,291
- SHE REALLY ASKED YOU,
HUH?

177
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,791
PRISS NEVER SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

178
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,875
WELL, ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

179
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,041
- JUST HOW WELL 
DO YOU KNOW HER?

180
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,833
- ( giggles )

181
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,916
WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW HER PERSONAL
EMAIL ADDRESS, LEONARDO.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,083
DO YOU WANT IT?

183
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,000
- I DON'T THINK
PRISS WOULD LIKE IT

184
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,041
IF YOU DID THAT.

185
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,791
- GOOD.
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA.

186
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,583
SHE TOLD ME A LONG TIME AGO

187
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,791
THAT I SHOULDN'T GIVE HER
ADDRESS OUT TO ANY WEIRDOES,

188
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,166
BOYFRIENDS,
OR STRANGE MEN.

189
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,708
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

190
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,833
- BOYFRIENDS?!
HERS OR YOURS?

191
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,000
- YOU <i>DO</i> WANT IT,
DON'T YOU?

192
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,458
- I NEVER SAID THAT,
AND YOU KNOW IT, NENE.

193
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,750
- ( giggles )

194
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,208
- AHH.

195
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,875
- ( sighs )

196
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,416
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE, DOES IT?

197
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,708
- HMM?  WHAT DOES?

198
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,708
- THE NEWS AND THE BOOMERS.

199
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,875
WHY WOULDN'T THEY
TALK ABOUT IT ON THE NEWS

200
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,166
UNLESS THERE WAS SOMETHING 
ELSE THEY WERE COVERING UP?

201
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,916
- YOU'VE GOT A ONE-TRACK MIND,
HAVEN'T YOU?

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,083
- BUT HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED

203
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,208
HOW THE NEWS ALWAYS
SEEMS EDITED?

204
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,375
LIKE THEY'LL START TO SHOW
SOMETHING, AND THEN CUT AWAY.

205
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,416
- YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT
THE KNIGHT SABERS AGAIN,

206
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,416
AREN'T YOU?

207
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,625
- I'M SERIOUS.
WHAT IF SOMEONE'S

208
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,875
CONTROLLING
ALL OF THE MEDIA?

209
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,875
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'VE HEARD MORE THAN ENOUGH

210
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,750
ABOUT YOUR CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

211
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,958
( sighs )

212
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,333
COME ON, LINNA.

213
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,875
IF WE'RE LATE,
THE BOSSES WILL BE

214
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,833
CONSPIRING
TO TAKE AWAY OUR JOBS.

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,916
- UH, HEY, WAIT.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,833
( sighs )

217
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,375
SORRY.

218
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,958
- How's it going, Priss?

219
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,416
- WHAT?

220
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,041
- Hey, guess what?

221
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,666
You know that guy Leon who
works at the same station as me?

222
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,875
- UH, YEAH.

223
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,791
- He was at your show
at Hot Legs the other night

224
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,250
after the club had closed.

225
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,291
- OKAY, IF YOU SAY SO.

226
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,958
IS THERE SOME KIND OF
POINT TO THIS?

227
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,541
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,708
I just realized that you're not
as tough as you pretend to be. 

229
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,166
- YOU WANT TO FIND OUT
HOW TOUGH I AM?  BUG OFF!

230
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,125
TWIT.

231
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,916
- She's mad. There's
something there all right.

232
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,250
- NO WAY.
PRISS IS DATING A COP?

233
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,625
- Nene: Not just a cop.
An AD Police officer.

234
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,250
I mean who would have
ever expected that?

235
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,250
- UM, ISN'T THAT
A BAD IDEA?

236
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,250
- Why?  Leon's a nice guy.

237
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,333
- NO, THAT'S NOT MY POINT.
THINK ABOUT IT.

238
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,666
- Well, he is a late bloomer,
but so is Priss.

239
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,291
I think it's cute.

240
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,666
- NENE, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
THAT THE AD POLICE

241
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,000
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO KILL US
FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS?

242
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,208
THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

243
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,666
- Well, a little antagonism
is good for a relationship.

244
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,833
- WAIT A SECOND.
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

245
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,416
I MEAN, SYLIA WILL
HIT THE CEILING

246
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,958
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT IF THIS
IS REALLY GOING ON, YOU KNOW.

247
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,291
AND PRISS HATES COPS.

248
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,208
- You know, if they're
just starting out,

249
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,375
I can be their go between.
That would be so cool.

250
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,833
- EARTH TO NENE.
THIS IS BAD.

251
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,458
- Huh?
- ( sighs )

252
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,875
- ( cheering )

253
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,791
- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,833
- GOOD.
GO FIVE METERS LOWER.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,208
- OH, MAN.

256
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,583
I HATE DIGGING IN
THESE PRE-EARTHQUAKE SITES.

257
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,250
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
SHORING WE PUT UP,

258
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,791
IT'S NEVER GOING
TO BE STABLE.

259
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,291
- ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
THERE WERE UNDERGROUND BUNKERS

260
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,958
ALL OVER BACK THEN. YOU NEVER
KNOW WHAT YOUR GOING TO FIND

261
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,125
WHEN YOU START DIGGING.

262
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,958
- ( yawns )

263
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,083
- YOU KNOW WHY
WE GOT THIS ASSIGNMENT?

264
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,291
BECAUSE ALL OF
THE SENIOR DIGGERS REFUSED IT.

265
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,750
- HMM?  REALLY?
WHY'S THAT?

266
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,500
- 'CAUSE IT'S NOT SAFE
TO BE DIGGING

267
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,041
IN THIS PART OF
THE TUNNEL SYSTEM,

268
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,583
AND THEY KNOW IT,
THAT'S WHY.

269
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,250
BEFORE THE QUAKE,
THERE WERE A LOT OF

270
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,916
SECRET LABS IN THIS AREA.

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,250
AFTERWARDS, NOBODY KNEW
WHERE ALL OF THEM WERE,

272
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,000
SO SOME OF THEM WERE JUST
LEFT DOWN HERE BURIED ALIVE.

273
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,916
AND EVERY SO OFTEN WHILE
WE'RE DIGGING IN THIS AREA,

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,458
WE'LL CRACK INTO ONE OF
THOSE FORGOTTEN HELL HOLES.

275
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,916
- JUST WHAT KIND OF
SECRET LABS ARE THEY?

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,166
- YOU NAME IT.

277
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,250
BIOLOGICAL, MILITARY,
GERM WARFARE,

278
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,750
THE WHOLE SHEBANG.

279
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,958
ANYTHING SECRET OR DIRTY
THAT COMPANIES

280
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,666
OR THEIR LESS SCRUPULOUS
CUSTOMERS

281
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,125
WANTED TO KEEP HIDDEN
FROM THE AUTHORITIES.

282
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,125
AND LET ME TELL YOU
ONE MORE THING.

283
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,416
IF YOU FIND ONE,
DON'T GO IN.

284
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,083
- ( gulps )
- BECAUSE OTHERWISE

285
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,750
THE GHOST OF A LAB WORKER
WHO WAS BURIED ALIVE

286
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,958
MIGHT APPEAR
AND EAT YOUR SOUL!

287
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,458
( laughing )
- HEY, MAN.

288
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,791
DON'T EVEN MAKE JOKES
ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT.

289
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,458
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY BODIES
ARE STILL BURIED DOWN HERE.

290
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,541
IT'S CREEPY.

291
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,208
- YEAH, ESPECIALLY NOW.
- HUH?

292
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,625
- HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

293
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,875
THEY SAY THAT SOMETHING'S 
BEEN ATTACKING THE BOOMERS

294
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,958
DOWN IN THESE TUNNELS.

295
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,625
- OKAY.  IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO MEASURE

296
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,458
THOSE DRAIN PIPES,
BOOMER.

297
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,791
START OFF WITH THE ONE
ON THE RIGHT, OKAY?

298
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,375
THAT'S GOOD.

299
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,041
NOW GO IN ANOTHER
80 METERS.

300
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,541
- ( sighs )

301
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,500
I THOUGHT I HATED BOOMERS.

302
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,666
BUT IS IT HATRED
OR FEAR?

303
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,041
I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S
WALKING ON MY GRAVE.

304
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,083
WHAT IS IT?

305
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,500
- NOTHING.

306
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,666
UH, SYLIA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

307
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,041
I MEAN, YOU LOOK
WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING.

308
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,583
- I'LL BE FINE,
MACKY.

309
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,916
- SURE.

310
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,875
- NO, WAIT.

311
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,541
I SWEAR THAT I WILL
ALWAYS PROTECT YOU.

312
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,416
- ( sighs )

313
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,791
- ( drilling )

314
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,750
- HEY!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

315
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,750
DID I TELL YOU 
TO DRILL THERE?

316
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,125
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER?

317
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,458
ALL RIGHT.
I GUESS YOU CAN COME BACK NOW.

318
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,958
- AHH.

319
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,625
I LOVE THOSE THINGS.

320
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,791
SO ANYWAY,
EACH ALGORITHM HAS ITS OWN

321
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,208
SIGNATURE, YOU SEE?

322
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,208
- MM-HMM.
- MMM.

323
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,791
AND WITH THAT, I CAN
TELL WHO PROGRAMMED IT.

324
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,125
LIKE THIS.

325
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,458
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

326
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,666
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
HACK SO FAST BEFORE.

327
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,000
- ( chuckles )

328
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,583
I AM A GENIUS.

329
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,250
- I'LL SAY YOU ARE.

330
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,541
YOU'RE REALLY A SMART KID.

331
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,041
- EXCUSE ME?

332
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,041
JUST WHO IS CALLING
WHO A KID HERE?

333
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,500
SHOW ME A LITTLE RESPECT,
JUNIOR.

334
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,791
- OH, OKAY.  SORRY, NENE.

335
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,958
- ( groans )

336
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,666
THAT'S MISS NENE TO YOU.

337
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,666
- OKAY.  MISS NENE,

338
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,500
COULD YOU TEACH ME 
ABOUT THIS ONE NOW?

339
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,666
- WELL, UM, SURE.

340
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,416
- NENE.

341
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,708
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE TRAINING ROOM RIGHT NOW?

342
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,041
- UHH...

343
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,625
I'LL BE THERE
IN A MINUTE. 

344
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,625
OKAY.  THE FIRST THING
YOU HAVE TO DO

345
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,125
IS ESTABLISH
YOUR PARAMETERS.

346
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,166
- ( sighs )

347
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,625
- BY THE WAY, SYLIA,

348
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,875
HAVE YOU HEARD
THE LATEST ABOUT PRISS?

349
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,458
- HUH?
- SHE'S GOT A NEW BOYFRIEND.

350
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,583
IT'S LEON.
ONE OF THE GUYS I WORK WITH.

351
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,500
AT LEAST, HE WANTS TO BE,
BUT PRISS IS ACTING LIKE PRISS.

352
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,291
SO I'M THINKING ABOUT
GIVING THEM BOTH

353
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,041
A LITTLE CYBERNETIC
PUSH ON THE BACK.

354
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,916
- WAIT A SECOND.
IS THIS GUY IN THE AD POLICE?

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,541
- MM-HMM.

356
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,833
HUH?

357
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,750
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

358
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,833
- UHH.
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

359
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,666
HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS?!

360
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,666
- SYLIA...

361
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,666
- SCREW UP ONE MORE TIME
AND YOU'RE OUT, NENE.

362
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,416
WE DON'T NEED
ANY DEAD WEIGHT.

363
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,375
- ( sighs )

364
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,791
- ( instruments tuning )

365
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,625
- HMM.

366
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,625
- I GOT A THING, GUYS.
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

367
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,916
YOU'RE HERE
KIND OF EARLY.

368
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,250
DID YOU TAKE
THE DAY OFF?

369
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,666
- SORT OF.
I GOT OFF EARLY,

370
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,875
SO I CAME STRAIGHT HERE.

371
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,083
- I SEE.

372
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,750
- IT'S NOT LIKE
I KNOW ANYONE ELSE.

373
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,083
AM I IN THE WAY?

374
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,083
- NO.

375
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,458
- THERE'S SOMETHING...

376
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,875
- HMM?

377
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,041
- THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO ASK YOU. 

378
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,375
- ABOUT WHAT?

379
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,375
- THE AD POLICE.

380
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,708
- ( sighs )

381
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,875
- WHY DO YOU
HATE THEM SO MUCH?

382
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,875
- JUST WHAT DID
NENE TELL YOU? 

383
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,208
- UM, NOTHING. 
NOTHING AT ALL.

384
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,791
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

385
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,041
- YEAH, RIGHT.
THAT LOUDMOUTH BITCH.

386
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,750
- NO, PRISS. I'M THE ONE
WHO'S SNOOPING, NOT HER.

387
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,916
- ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW,

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,041
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

389
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,250
I HATE THEM BECAUSE
THEY'RE JUST ANOTHER LIE.

390
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,916
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO
PROTECT THE PEOPLE,

391
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,750
BUT THE TRUTH IS
THEY DON'T GIVE A CRAP

392
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,458
WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE THEY DO 
OR WHOSE LIVES THEY DESTROY.

393
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,625
- AND THAT'S IT?

394
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,916
- ( beeping )

395
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,333
- Priss, Linna, we've got
another rogue boomer.

396
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,500
- Both: MM-HMM.

397
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,250
- DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'VE POUTED LONG ENOUGH?

398
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,333
WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

399
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,750
- HEY, IS SOMETHING WRONG,
NENE?

400
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,458
- Sylia: DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HER RIGHT NOW.

401
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,125
JUST GO BACK AND PUT ON
YOUR HARDSUITS.

402
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,833
- WE'LL SORT THIS OUT LATER.

403
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,416
- I'M NOT A SCREW UP.
I WON'T GIVE UP.

404
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,375
- ( siren wails )

405
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,583
- ( men screaming )

406
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,541
- HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT HERE FIRST.

407
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,500
- ( chuckles )
FOR A CHANGE. 

408
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,666
WHAT IN THE HECK IS THAT?

409
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,041
- WE DON'T HAVE
TIME TO ASK!

410
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,375
- ( both gasp )

411
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,333
- ( screeches )

412
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,791
- DO YOU THINK WE'LL
BE ABLE TO HOLD IT

413
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,041
TILL THE TANKS
GET HERE?

414
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,750
- DO WE HAVE A CHOICE?
- ( groans )

415
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,208
- HUH?!

416
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,875
SHEESH.  I THINK I CAN
START TO LIKE THESE GIRLS.

417
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,166
- LINNA, WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE
RIGHT ON TOP OF IT.

418
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,291
- RIGHT!
( shouts )

419
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,833
- THIS IS THE WARD
WHERE ALL THOSE BOOMERS

420
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,041
HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING.

421
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,250
- IT'S BEHIND YOU.
LOOK OUT.

422
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,458
- ( gasps )

423
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,416
(yelps )

424
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,916
- ( grunts )

425
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,875
WE'VE GOT HIM NOW.

426
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,291
- I'M GOING IN.

427
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,583
- GET OUT OF THERE,
YOU IDIOT!

428
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,750
- NENE, DON'T ATTACK IT
FROM THE FRONT!

429
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,208
- I CAN DO IT!

430
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,833
I'M NOT DEAD WEIGHT,
DAMN IT!

431
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,791
- ( screeches )

432
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,375
- YEAH!

433
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,541
BULLS EYE.

434
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,833
( grunts )

435
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:57,958
- GOD, YOU'RE A MORON.
- OW.

436
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,500
( screams )

437
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,041
- NENE!

438
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,500
- ( screams )

439
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,916
OH, NO!

440
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,250
( screams )

441
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,083
- WHAT THE HELL?
- ( screams )

442
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,541
- MOTHER-- WHAT?

443
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,833
- ( roars )

444
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,625
- WHAT IN THE HELL
IS THAT THING?!

445
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,208
- ( theme music playing )

446
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

447
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:05,791
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS: TOKYO 2040,"

448
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:09,000
A NEW MENACE STALKS
THE STREETS OF TOKYO.

449
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,666
A TOWERING MONSTER
THAT APPEARS AND DISAPPEARS

450
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,333
WITHOUT A TRACE.

451
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,541
NOW, THREE FACTIONS
ENTER A DEADLY RACE

452
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,916
TO FIND THE CREATURE
AND ITS ORIGINS.

453
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,541
THE KNIGHT SABERS,
THE AD POLICE, AND GENOM.

454
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,541
IF THE SABERS
DON'T GET THERE FIRST,

455
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,375
EVERYBODY LOSES.

456
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,708
NEXT EPISODE...
