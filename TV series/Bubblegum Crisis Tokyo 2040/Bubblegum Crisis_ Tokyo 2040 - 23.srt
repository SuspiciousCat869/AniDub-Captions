1
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,166
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,916
- ( footsteps approaching )

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,291
- NOT IN A PARTYING MOOD, HUH?

5
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,125
ME NEITHER.

6
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:30,166
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL DO NOW?

7
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,791
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN, DON'T YOU?

8
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,875
THE U.N. AND N.A.T.O.
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

9
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,875
WITH THE CITY EVACUATED, THEY
WON'T HESITATE TO DROP A NUKE.

10
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,625
IT'S THE ONLY SURE WAY
TO DESTROY GALATEA.

11
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,666
THEY'RE RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

12
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,958
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT HERE.
WHAT'S THE POINT IN STAYING?

13
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,958
- DO YOU ALWAYS TALK THIS MUCH?

14
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,125
- ( men laughing )

15
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,250
- THAT'S RIGHT!
WHO NEEDS A MAN ANYWAY?!

16
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,583
- ( chattering continues )

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,791
- WAIT A SECOND.
WHERE'S MACKY AND NENE?

18
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,375
- MACKY?

19
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,333
- ( evil laughter )

20
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,583
- Nene: MACKY!

21
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,208
- HUH?  NENE?

22
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,541
- AH!

23
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,666
- NENE?

24
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,875
- WHAT THE HELL?

25
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,125
MACKY!

26
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,791
- ( female voice )
THIS PROTOTYPE IS A PART OF ME.

27
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,208
WE SHARE THE SAME SEED,
THE SAME GENESIS.

28
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,791
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

29
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,750
- GALATEA.

30
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,291
- MACKY!
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MACKY?

31
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,083
LET HIM GO! STOP CONTROLLING
HIM, YOU MONSTER!

32
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,250
- THIS BOOMER IS A PART OF ME.

33
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,500
IT WILL BE ASSIMILATED.

34
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,708
IT IS FILLED WITH FALSE DATA

35
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,833
THAT MUST BE PURGED
FROM ITS SYSTEM.

36
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,041
- LET HIM GO!

37
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,916
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM,
SYLIA?

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
- SHE'S FORCING HER OWN
CONSCIOUSNESS INTO HIS BRAIN,

39
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,333
OVERRIDING HIM.

40
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,416
- AND WIPING OUT
ALL OF HIS HUMAN MEMORIES--

41
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
EVERYTHING
THAT MAKES HIM MACKY.

42
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,000
- NO!

43
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,500
- ( grunts )

44
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,666
- LOOK, YOU COULD
NEVER KEEP UP WITH US.

45
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,875
SORRY.

46
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,166
- I WOULDN'T
BE SO SURE OF THAT.

47
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,916
AS SOON AS I
GET THESE REFUGEES TO SAFETY,

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,666
I'LL BE COMING AFTER YOU.

49
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,708
- NENE, DO YOU WANT
TO STAY HERE WITH MACKY?

50
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,541
- WE'LL UNDERSTAND
IF YOU DO.

51
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,000
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART.

52
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,500
LINNA, YOU TOO.
- HUH?

53
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,125
- YOU DON'T
HAVE TO JOIN THIS MADNESS.

54
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,000
I WON'T STOP YOU
FROM COMING,

55
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,625
BUT THIS BATTLE
IS BETWEEN ME

56
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,875
AND THE MONSTER
MY FATHER CREATED IN MY BRAIN.

57
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,625
THERE WON'T BE ANY COMBAT PAY
THIS TIME, LINNA.

58
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,041
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

59
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,458
- I SEE.

60
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,041
- I'M GOING.

61
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,541
I'M GOING TO GET MACKY'S MEMORY
BACK FROM GALATEA.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,083
- SEE YA.

63
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,541
- HMM?

64
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,625
- ( laughs )
LOSER.

65
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,958
- PRISS, WAIT.

66
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,375
- IT TOOK A WHILE.

67
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,041
- Nene: WE'RE LEAVING!

68
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,625
COME ON, PRISS!

69
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:08,125
- SO MAYBE WE COULD FINISH THIS
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

70
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,625
- ( grunts )
- AH!

71
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,583
( groans )

72
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,666
- Sylia: I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE ALL COMING.

73
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,166
- Linna:
ARE YOU KIDDING?

74
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,791
YOU GAVE ME A DREAM,
A GOAL I COULD ASPIRE TO.

75
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,833
AND THEN YOU HELPED ME
MAKE IT REAL.

76
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,416
YOU HAD FAITH IN ME AND--

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,875
AND I-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

78
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,666
- WE'RE KNIGHT SABERS.

79
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,625
THIS IS JUST WHAT WE DO.

80
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,458
BOOMER SLAYERS EXTRAORDINAIRE,
AND A TEAM.

81
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,333
NENE?

82
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,416
- SHE'S RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.

83
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,875
- KNIGHT SABERS, ACTION.

84
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,708
- TAKE CARE.

85
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,958
- Nigel: HOLD ON, KID.

86
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,166
- Linna: IT LOOKS LIKE FOG,

87
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,250
ONLY I THINK
IT'S GETTING THICKER.

88
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,750
- Sylia: STAY TOGETHER AS
WE BREAK THROUGH THE SIDE WALL

89
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,875
AND KEEP YOUR MIND

90
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,291
ON MAINTAINING YOUR
SUIT'S STABILITY.

91
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,625
IF THE BOOMER PHENOMENON
TAKES OVER YOUR SUIT,

92
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,375
- YOU'RE DONE FOR.
- All: RIGHT.

93
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,041
- Priss: SO LET'S JUST
SMASH GALATEA AND RUN.

94
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,500
- ( gasps )

95
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,750
- PRISS!

96
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,458
- ( cracking )

97
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,250
- ( grunts )

98
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,416
- PRISS!

99
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,416
- Nene: SYLIA!

100
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,291
THAT ISN'T FOG. IT'S MADE OUT OF
MILLIONS OF TINY NANO-BOOMERS.

101
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,166
- WHAT?  MY TURN!

102
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,041
AHHH!

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,625
- Linna: HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THAT?

104
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,000
- Priss: SYLIA?

105
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,250
- Sylia: WE HAVE TO CUT FASTER
THAN IT REGENERATES.

106
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,708
- Linna: MAYBE MY CUTTERS
CAN DO IT!

107
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,541
WHAT IF THE TWO OF YOU
USE ME LIKE A BATTERING RAM?

108
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,458
- Galatea: YOU WERE SO RIGHT,
MASON.

109
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,250
WHAT AN INEFFICIENT DESIGN
THEY ARE.

110
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,750
HOW SAD.

111
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:39,208
- ( computer making tone )

112
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,916
- Macky: SYLIA.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,083
- MACKY?

114
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,458
- Sylia:
NOW WATCH YOUR NECK.

115
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,666
HIT THIS WRONG
AND IT'LL SNAP LIKE A TWIG.

116
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,000
- Linna: JUST DO IT!

117
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,291
- IT'S TOO FAST, LINNA!
- I'M STUCK!

118
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,625
- HOLD ON!

119
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,750
HYAH!

120
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,708
CRAP!

121
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,333
- AH!

122
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,666
- HYAH!

123
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,875
- ( grunting )

124
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,666
- AHHH!

125
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,708
HYAH!

126
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,458
( grunting )

127
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,708
- Nene: AW, MAN,
WHAT DO I DO?

128
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,625
- NENE.

129
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,083
- HE'S STILL LINKED
TO GALATEA.

130
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,083
- ( computer making tone )

131
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,750
- ( firing )

132
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,000
- NO EFFECT AT ALL.

133
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,000
- Macky: NENE?

134
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,333
- MACKY?
OH MY GOD, MACKY!

135
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,375
DO YOU STILL REMEMBER ME?

136
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,458
- I THINK I REMEMBER.

137
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,833
BUT I CAN'T-- I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT YOUR FACE LOOKS LIKE.

138
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,833
- MACKY.

139
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,750
- BUT I REMEMBER
THAT THE PERSON CALLED NENE--

140
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,000
THAT THE PERSON CALLED THAT
WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

141
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,875
THERE ARE STILL SOME OF
MY ORIGINAL MEMORIES

142
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,166
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ERASED YET--

143
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,333
BITS AND PIECES FLOATING
IN NON-VOLATILE STORAGE.

144
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,833
BUT SOON-- SOON EVEN THOSE
WILL BE GONE AS WELL.

145
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,166
- NO, IT'S NOT FAIR!

146
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,041
YOU DESERVE TO LIVE, MACKY!

147
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,666
- DID SHE JUST SAY "MACKY"?

148
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,708
- Sylia: MACKY?
HE'S TALKING TO NENE?

149
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,291
- PLEASE LISTEN, NENE.

150
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,333
MY BODY IS STILL CONNECTED
TO GALATEA'S CORE.

151
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,833
I HAVE AN IDEA,
A WAY TO HELP YOU BY USING HER.

152
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,208
I'M HOPING THAT SHE WON'T
KNOW WHAT I'M DOING

153
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,583
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE,

154
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,625
THAT MY HUMAN THOUGHTS
ARE TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND.

155
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,375
IF IT WORKS,
YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE FAST.

156
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,333
- MACKY, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

157
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,583
- NO!

158
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,750
YOU'VE GOT TO
SAVE YOUR STRENGTH, MACKY!

159
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,708
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

160
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,750
- GALATEA WON'T
BE CONFUSED FOR LONG.

161
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,750
THERE'LL BE JUST ENOUGH TIME--

162
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,916
ENOUGH TIME FOR ALL OF YOU
TO PENETRATE THE BARRIER.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,916
- Henderson: MASTER MACKY?

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,750
- NO, DON'T STOP HIM.

165
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,416
- ( rumbling )

166
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,291
- HE'S RIGHT.

167
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,708
MACKY KNOWS
HE ONLY HAS A FEW HOURS LEFT.

168
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,416
LET HIM CHOOSE
HOW IT ENDS.

169
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,208
- MACKY, PLEASE!
DON'T DO THIS!

170
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,625
- NENE, I'M GLAD I MET YOU.

171
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:17,333
- ( sobbing )
I-- I WON'T EVER FORGET YOU.

172
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,708
- TAKE CARE OF SYLIA FOR ME.

173
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,208
- ( rumbling )

174
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,125
- Macky:
GOODBYE, NENE.

175
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,500
- MACKY!

176
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,666
- HOLY SHIT!

177
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,000
- ( roaring )

178
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,208
- ( chattering )

179
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,166
- ( rumbling ends )

180
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,583
- HE DID IT!  NOW!

181
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,250
- WE'RE FREE!

182
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,750
- NENE!

183
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,333
- Nene: MACKY.

184
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,000
MACKY. ( sobbing )

185
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,708
- WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT HAPPENED TO MACKY?!

186
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,041
- Priss: LOOK, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT.

187
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,833
IT'S ALREADY STARTING
TO REFORM AGAIN.

188
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,666
- Linna: SYLIA?

189
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,416
- MACKY!

190
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,000
( coughs )

191
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,916
( grunting )

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,625
- MASTER MACKY.

193
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,458
- ( grunts ) NO.

194
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,208
MACKY?

195
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,166
- Sylia: NENE, WHAT HAPPENED
TO MACKY?

196
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,458
- HE USED
THE LAST OF HIS POWER--

197
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,375
HE OPENED THE WALL
TO SAVE YOU, SYLIA.

198
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,791
- OH, NO.

199
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,416
- WE'VE-- WE'VE GOT TO GO.

200
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,833
- Linna: WAIT! NENE!

201
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,833
- IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
MACKY.

202
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,916
- SYLIA, YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING
TO FINISH THIS, DIDN'T YOU?

203
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,416
LET'S GET THAT BITCH.

204
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,083
- YES.

205
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,208
- PRISS.

206
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,666
- Linna: OH, JEEZ,
WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?

207
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,458
- Priss: SOMETHING THAT NEEDS
TO BE PUT OUT OF ITS MISERY.

208
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,583
- PRISS, NO!

209
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,666
- Nene: WE CAN'T DO THINGS
LIKE THAT.

210
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,250
BOOMERS ARE ONE THING,
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING--

211
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,750
- Priss: YEAH, THIS IS SLIMIER.

212
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,750
- Linna: NENE'S RIGHT,
BUT WHAT DO WE DO WITH HIM?

213
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,166
- Nene: NOTHING.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

214
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,250
- Sylia:
COME ON, LET'S GO.

215
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,250
- ( exploding )

216
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,166
- Priss: JEEZ, NOW WHAT?!

217
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,208
- Linna: WE'RE FLOATING,
LIKE IN OUTER SPACE.

218
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,416
- Nene: THOSE TUBES ARE FULL
OF SUPER-HEATED PLASMA.

219
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,375
SOMEHOW THEY MUST BE ALIGNED
TO DAMNED THE POOL OF GRAVITY.

220
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,208
- IS THAT POSSIBLE?

221
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,125
- Sylia: GALATEA!

222
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,791
- SYLIA.

223
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,333
- I'M HERE
TO CORRECT MY FATHER'S MISTAKE.

224
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,583
YOU SHOULD
NEVER HAVE BEEN BORN.

225
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,000
- NO.
YOU ARE WRONG.

226
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,833
- Priss:
WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?!

227
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,458
- Nene: I DON'T KNOW!
- GET OUT OF HERE!

228
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,708
- AH!

229
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,666
- Nene:
DON'T LET THEM TOUCH YOU!

230
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,000
THEY'RE RADIATING THE SAME KIND
OF ENERGY THAT GALATEA DOES.

231
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,000
- Priss: WAIT A SECOND.
YOU MEAN IF THEY TOUCH US--

232
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,416
- THEN OUR HARDSUITS
WOULD INSTANTLY GO ROGUE!

233
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,583
- Priss: AH, WATCH OUT!

234
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,583
- EAT THIS!

235
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,750
DAMN.

236
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,208
THEY JUST ABSORB THEM!

237
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,916
- CRAP. LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE THEN.

238
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,875
- Linna:
PRISS!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

239
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,375
- NENE,
CAN YOU CUT THE FLOW OF PLASMA

240
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,875
THROUGH ONE OF THESE TUBES?

241
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,791
- YEAH!  I'M LOCKING OFF
THE ONE IN FRONT OF YOU.

242
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,916
- Priss: THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT ONE OF MY BETTER IDEAS.

243
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,958
- Linna:
PRISS, NO, THAT'S CRAZY!

244
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,875
- CRAZY IS MY MIDDLE NAME!

245
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,875
- ( rumbling )

246
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,875
- ( grunting )

247
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,291
- Linna: HOLD ON, PRISS!
WE'RE COMING!

248
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,416
- NO, STAY THERE!

249
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,208
( grunting )

250
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,541
AHHH!

251
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,625
NENE, ON FIVE!

252
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,041
- Nene: RIGHT!

253
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,083
BUT THERE'LL BE A SLIGHT DELAY
BEFORE THE TUBE REFILLS.

254
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,791
I'LL MAKE IT
IN MAYBE TWO SECONDS.

255
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,083
AHH!

256
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,041
- IT'S COMING!

257
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,500
- ( scanning )

258
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,458
- ( humming )
- Priss: COME ON!

259
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,708
SYLIA, LINNA, CLEAR THE AREA!

260
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,125
- RIGHT!
- GOT IT!

261
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,125
- Nene: IT DOESN'T FIT!

262
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:16,500
- YOU WANT ME?
EAT THIS!

263
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,208
AHHHH!

264
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,166
- ( humming )

265
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,041
- AH!

266
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,250
( grunting )

267
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,958
THAT WAS DISGUSTING.

268
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,625
- Linna: IT WAS ALSO THE
STUPIDEST,

269
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,166
BRAVEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

270
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,666
- Nene: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET
YOUR SUIT TOUCH THAT STUFF.

271
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,333
- Priss: IT'S NOT LIKE
WE HAD MUCH OF A CHOICE.

272
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,208
HEY, WHERE'S SYLIA?

273
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,875
- GALATEA?

274
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,041
- ( chattering )

275
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,500
- GALATEA!

276
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,625
YOU SHOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN CREATED, YOU MONSTER.

277
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,750
YOU DESTROY EVERYTHING
YOU TOUCH--

278
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:25,333
MACKY, MY FATHER.
THAT ENDS NOW.

279
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,750
- TELL ME, SYLIA,

280
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,833
WHY IS IT THAT I LOOK LIKE YOU?
- WHAT?

281
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,375
- EVEN THOUGH I WAS BORN
AS AN ANTI-SEED

282
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:38,208
INSIDE YOUR BRAIN, I WAS ONLY
DESIGNED TO COPY YOUR MIND.

283
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,041
I AM NEITHER YOUR CHILD
NOR A CLONE.

284
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,708
WHY THEN IS IT
THAT I LOOK LIKE YOU?

285
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,041
- I DON'T KNOW.

286
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,583
YOU KILLED THE ONLY MAN
WHO COULD ANSWER THAT.

287
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,750
AND IN A FEW SECONDS,
IT WON'T MATTER ANYMORE.

288
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,166
- HOWEVER,

289
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,000
I DON'T HAVE TO REMAIN IN THIS
BODY ANY LONGER, SISTER.

290
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,708
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

291
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,208
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

292
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:02,625
- THERE IS NO NEED
TO STAY ISOLATED LIKE THIS.

293
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,833
- YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
GALATEA.

294
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,583
I WON'T LET YOU
SPREAD THIS MADNESS ANY FURTHER.

295
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,041
( striking )

296
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,416
- ( firing )
- Linna: SYLIA!

297
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,541
- ( chattering )

298
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,750
- DAMN YOU TO HELL.

299
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,583
WHY WON'T YOU JUST DIE,
DAMN YOU?

300
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:27,583
- ( Macky's voice )
SYLIA, DO YOU WANT ME TO DIE?

301
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,500
- MACKY?

302
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,125
- I'VE BECOME A PART
OF GALATEA NOW.

303
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,916
IN GALATEA,
WE CAN ALL BE ONE TOGETHER.

304
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,916
- MACKY.

305
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,916
- GALATEA WAS A PART OF YOU.

306
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,791
THEREFORE HUMANS
CAN BE ASSIMILATED.

307
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,791
YOU CAN JOIN US, SYLIA.

308
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,083
IMAGINE AN END TO ALL OF
YOUR PAIN AND SUFFERING.

309
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,750
- NO, IT'S A LIE!

310
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,708
- Priss: WHAT IN THE HELL
IS GOING ON?!

311
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,416
- THAT'S NOT
THE MACKY I KNEW TALKING.

312
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,083
THE REAL MACKY
WOULD NEVER SURRENDER SO EASILY.

313
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,458
THOSE WORDS
ARE COMING FROM GALATEA, SYLIA!

314
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,916
- Priss: WE'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE IT IN TIME!

315
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,375
- Linna: WAIT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

316
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,791
- THE ONLY THING I CAN DO!

317
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:26,000
- Priss: GET AWAY FROM HER,
YOU MONSTER!

318
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,875
- Linna: SYLIA!

319
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,791
- NO.
