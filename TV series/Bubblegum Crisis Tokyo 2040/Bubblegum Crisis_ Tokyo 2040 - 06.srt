1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,333
- LINNA!

4
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,333
HUH?

5
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,833
- WHAT THE--?

6
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:45,958
- Reporter:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

7
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,291
THOSE ARE THE TERRORISTS

8
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,000
WHO JUST DESTROYED
THIS BOOMER FACTORY.

9
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,750
AND AS WE SPEAK, UNITS OF THE
AD POLICE ARE SURROUNDING THEM.

10
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,041
- THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING ON 
OUR ONE DAY OFF, WOULDN'T IT?

11
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,708
- WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LEON?

12
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,375
WERE YOU PLANNING ON
CAPTURING THE KNIGHT SABERS

13
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,666
ALL BY YOURSELF?

14
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,041
- KNIGHT SABERS, 
GET OUT OF THERE.

15
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,708
THIS WHOLE INCIDENT HAS BEEN
SOME KIND OF GIANT TRAP.

16
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,375
THERE'S A NEWS CAMERA
UP IN THAT BLIMP,

17
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,708
AND THEY'RE BROADCASTING
EVERYTHING ON LIVE TELEVISION.

18
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,791
- Nene:
Sylia! Linna fell.

19
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,375
I think they've got her!

20
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,500
- WHAT?

21
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,833
- ( breathes deep )

22
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,041
( gasps )

23
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,000
- Nene:
Linna, are you okay?

24
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,083
- I'M ALL RIGHT,
BUT I'M ALMOST OUT OF POWER.

25
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,416
- Nene:  Hold on.
We'll think of something.

26
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,791
- THERE IT IS.
I'VE FOUND IT, SIR.

27
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,666
- ( screams )

28
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,708
( grunts )
I CAN BARELY MOVE IN THIS THING.

29
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT WE'VE BEEN WORRIED

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,041
ABOUT SOMETHING THIS PATHETIC
FOR SO LONG.

31
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,291
- Back off, Kuyama.

32
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,250
You're supposed to hurt it,
not kill it.

33
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,166
- THE LIGHT'S NOT
VERY GOOD IN HERE, SIR.

34
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,083
I MIGHT MISS.

35
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,541
( grunts )

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,750
- Nene: PRISS!

37
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,500
THAT'S A K-SUIT,
NOT A BOOMER!

38
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,000
- WHO CARES?
AN ENEMY'S AN ENEMY.

39
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,125
- ( Linna sighs )

40
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,750
THANKS.
- COME ON, LINNA.

41
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,708
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

42
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,125
( screams )

43
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,958
- ( Linna and Nene screaming )
- DAMN!

44
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,958
ALL RIGHT.
THE GLOVES COME OFF!

45
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,791
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
NOT TO KILL THEM.

46
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:41,833
FIRE!

47
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,666
- ( men shouting )

48
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,666
- ( grunts )

49
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,166
DIE!

50
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,083
NENE, LINNA?

51
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,416
( grunts )

52
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,541
( groans )

53
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,000
- PRISS!

54
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,000
- OH, CRAP.

55
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,666
I THINK THEY GOT ME.

56
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,458
( screams )

57
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,833
DAMN.

58
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,958
WHAT A WAY TO GO.

59
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,291
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

60
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,791
THEY'RE PEOPLE,
NOT BOOMERS.

61
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,000
ARE YOU TRYING
TO KILL THEM? 

62
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,333
- YOU'RE OFF DUTY, LEON.

63
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,916
WE'VE GOT OUR ORDERS,
SO BACK THE HELL OFF.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,458
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
I'M GONNA--

65
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,833
- HOLD IT, LEON.

66
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,375
THE ORDER FOR THIS CAME FROM
ABOVE THE COMMISSIONER.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,583
- ( sighs )

68
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,166
- PRISS.

69
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,083
- IT'S OVER.
MY BATTERY'S GONE.

70
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,041
- WHAT NOW?
- I GUESS WE DIE.

71
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,958
- ( men shout )

72
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:43,916
- HUH?

73
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,833
- Nene: SYLIA!

74
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,208
- THERE'S ANOTHER ONE?

75
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,541
- NOW THAT'S INTERESTING.

76
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,666
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS ONE
IN A LONG TIME.

77
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,208
- ( grunts )

78
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,875
- ( screams )

79
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,208
( grunts )

80
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,833
( whimpers )

81
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,875
- SHOOT IT, SHOOT IT!

82
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,958
- HUH?
LEON, TIME TO RUN.

83
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,541
- DALEY!
- ( man screams )

84
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,875
- WHAT THE--?

85
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,083
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

86
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,416
- ( men shouting )

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,916
- FALL OUT, FALL OUT!

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,916
- Man: GO!

89
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,083
- Reporter: IN A SPECTACULAR
FAILURE FOR THE AD POLICE,

90
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,708
IT APPEARS THAT
THE TERRORIST GROUP--

91
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,416
- WE'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT
THE RELAY FROM OUR REMOTE UNIT 

92
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,916
IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,750
THIS SPECIAL NEWS BREAK
WAS BROUGHT TO YOU

94
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,916
BY GENOM CORPORATION,

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,916
THE COMPANY OF
BOOMER TECHNOLOGY.

96
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,625
- Stewardess: WE'RE ABOUT TO
BEGIN OUR DESCENT TOWARD JAPAN

97
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,625
AND THE HANEDA AIR SPACE PORT.

98
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,375
PLEASE RETURN ALL
CHAIRS AND TABLES

99
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,416
TO THEIR UPRIGHT
STOWED POSITION.

100
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,833
- NICE.  LOOKS FAST.

101
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,458
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED,

102
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,625
WOULD YOU LET ME
GIVE IT A TRY?

103
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,708
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

104
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,500
REPAIRS AGAIN?
- UH-HUH.

105
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,791
OH, NO.

106
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,916
NO, NOT THAT ONE.

107
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,625
- OKAY.
I'LL GO UP THERE LATER.

108
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,625
- NIGEL?

109
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,666
UM...

110
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,333
JUST HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN SYLIA?

111
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,000
- A LONG TIME.

112
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,625
- OH.

113
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,583
- ( engine starts )

114
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,750
- ( sighs )

115
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,833
I REALLY DO
HATE THIS JOB.

116
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,083
- MISS YAMAZAKI.

117
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,083
- UH?

118
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,666
- I CAN'T LET THIS GO ON.

119
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,416
A CHAIN IS JUST AS STRONG
AS ITS WEAKEST LINK.

120
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
AND ONE BAD ATTITUDE CAN
SOUR A WHOLE DEPARTMENT,

121
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,666
YOU KNOW.

122
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,208
YOU SEE,
PERFORMING IN ONE'S WORKPLACE

123
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,208
IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER
FORM OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIP.

124
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,375
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'M SAYING, MISS YAMAZAKI?

125
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,875
IF YOU DON'T TREAT
YOUR WORK WITH RESPECT,

126
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,791
IT CAN MAKE LIFE
VERY DIFFICULT. 

127
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,708
IT MAY BE TEDIOUS TO STARE
AT THESE NUMBERS ALL DAY, 

128
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,041
BUT A JOB WELL DONE
CAN BE LIKE A GOOD BOYFRIEND.

129
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,250
EHH?

130
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,375
BUT OF COURSE
I DON'T HAVE TO

131
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,208
TELL YOU ABOUT THAT,
DO I?

132
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,708
( laughs )

133
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,208
I WANT THAT PROJECT FINISHED
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

134
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,541
- ( sighs )

135
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,000
- OH, MISS YAMAZAKI?

136
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,708
IT'S ALL VERY WELL
FOR YOU EXERCISE, 

137
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,041
BUT PLEASE DON'T OVERDO IT.

138
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,875
YOUR CALVES ARE
MUCH TOO MUSCULAR.

139
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,791
( laughing )

140
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,250
- ( groans )

141
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,125
I'D LIKE TO
CRUSH HIS CORE.

142
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,416
- ( sighs )

143
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,708
IT'S REALLY SO DEPRESSING 
WHEN YOU'RE NO LONGER ABLE

144
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,416
TO WEAR AN OUTFIT
THAT YOU REALLY LIKE.

145
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,833
- MISTRESS SYLIA,

146
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,625
YOU SEEM TO HAVE A GUEST
WAITING FOR YOU.

147
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,958
- NIGEL YOU MEAN?

148
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,250
WELL ACTUALLY,
I WAS EXPECTING HIM

149
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,583
TO COME BY A LITTLE LATER.

150
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,458
- UH, NO.
IT'S NOT HIM.

151
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,125
- HUH?

152
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,041
( gasps )

153
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,458
OH.

154
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,125
IS THAT...?

155
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,750
- THIS GENTLEMAN
KEEPS INSISTING 

156
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,000
THAT HE'S YOUR BROTHER,

157
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,791
EVEN THOUGH I'VE
TOLD HIM REPEATEDLY

158
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,000
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY BROTHERS, MY LADY.

159
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,000
- MAKI?

160
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,083
- SYLIA.

161
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,541
- IT CAN'T BE.

162
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,541
BUT IT'S REALLY YOU.

163
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,208
- MISTRESS SYLIA?

164
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,791
- OH, IT'S FINE.

165
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,458
WHAT ON EARTH
GAVE YOU THE IDEA

166
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,791
THAT I DON'T HAVE
ANY BROTHERS, HENDERSON?

167
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,125
- ( gasps )

168
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,333
- YES, THAT'S EXACTLY 
WHAT HE IS, HENDERSON.

169
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,458
HE'S THE ONLY FAMILY
I HAVE LEFT.

170
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,791
WELL, COME ON, 
LITTLE BROTHER.

171
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,083
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO GET
A ROOM READY FOR YOU, WON'T WE?

172
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:43,875
- ( elevator dings )

173
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,625
- NIGEL, GUESS WHAT?

174
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,500
I FINALLY GOT TO WEAR MY 
HARDSUIT AGAIN YESTERDAY.

175
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,041
- YOU SHOULDN'T
PUSH YOURSELF SO HARD.

176
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,666
- OH, YOU REALLY DO
CARE ABOUT ME, DON'T YOU?

177
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,833
- WE CAN'T AFFORD 
THAT KIND OF RISK.

178
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,833
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE SO CROSS. 

179
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,250
I KNOW THAT I SHOULDN'T BE
WEARING THAT HARDSUIT ANYMORE.

180
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,500
SO HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
THE REPAIRS WILL TAKE?

181
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,833
- FOR ALL THREE SUITS?
PROBABLY A WEEK.

182
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,166
- THAT'S TOO LONG!

183
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,083
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
IF ANOTHER BOOMER

184
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,625
GOES OUT OF CONTROL
BEFORE THEN?

185
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,166
I'M SORRY.

186
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,208
I GUESS I'VE BEEN JUST
A LITTLE ON EDGE LATELY.

187
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,833
OH, BY THE WAY,
MY BROTHER'S HERE.

188
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,541
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
I DO HAVE ONE.

189
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,833
A YOUNGER BROTHER.

190
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,208
HIS NAME'S MAKI.

191
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,625
- Henderson:
THIS WILL BE YOUR ROOM FOR NOW.

192
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,875
PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF 
AT HOME, MASTER MAKI.

193
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,875
- UM, EXCUSE ME?

194
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,250
- YES, MASTER MAKI?

195
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,208
- IS SYLIA STILL,
UM, YOU KNOW?

196
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,708
- YES?

197
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,750
- UM... NEVER MIND.

198
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,041
JUST FORGET IT.

199
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,208
- MASTER MAKI.
- HUH?

200
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,250
- WELCOME TO TOKYO, SIR.

201
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,916
I THINK WE'RE ALL
VERY GLAD

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,583
THAT YOU'RE FINALLY HERE.

203
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,500
- OKAY.

204
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,250
SYLIA.

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,083
- THE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE
OF THE AD POLICE

206
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,583
WILL TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THEIR FAILURE

207
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,291
TO CAPTURE THE KNIGHT SABERS.

208
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,708
IN ADDITION,
I'VE ENSURED

209
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,291
THAT WE'LL CONTINUE
TO HAVE SOMEONE

210
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,958
WHO WILL BE WILLING TO GO ALONG

211
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,291
WITH ALL OF OUR
FUTURE SUGGESTIONS.

212
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,958
- THAT'S ALL VERY WELL, MASON.

213
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,958
BUT FINDING SCAPEGOATS
IS HARDLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

214
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,625
ITEM ON YOUR AGENDA.

215
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,791
- SIR?

216
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,958
- HAVE THERE BEEN 
ANY FURTHER DELAYS

217
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,958
ON THE SHOWEN PROJECT?

218
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,958
- IF YOU'RE REFERRING
TO THE REPORT

219
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,291
THAT FOUR OF THE BOOMERS
ASSIGNED TO THE SPACE PLATFORM

220
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,583
HAVE ALREADY GONE ROGUE,
IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED.

221
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,500
OUR OPERATIVES WERE ABLE
TO DISPOSE OF THEM.

222
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,625
- VERY GOOD.

223
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,250
BOOMERS ARE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS.

224
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,916
IF HUMANS WERE KEPT IN SPACE
FOR THE SAME LENGTH OF TIME,

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,458
I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE
GONE MAD AS WELL.

226
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,000
- THAT MAY BE TRUE, SIR,
HOWEVER,

227
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,666
THE NUMBER OF MAD BOOMER
INCIDENTS IS INCREASING.

228
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,833
- BOOMERS ARE A MENACE
THAT SHOULD BE ERADICATED.

229
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,500
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,
ISN'T IT, MASON?

230
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,500
- NO.

231
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,166
- I'LL HAVE YOSHIKIRI

232
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,166
HANDLE THE BOOMER BUSINESS.

233
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,541
I WANT YOU TO CONCENTRATE
ON THE SHOWEN PROJECT.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
- ERADICATE ALL OF
THE BOOMERS?

235
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,333
( chuckles )

236
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,333
( sighs )

237
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,666
LAUGH.

238
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,833
- LAUGH?

239
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,750
- LAUGH.

240
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,375
- ( laughing )

241
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,791
- Mason: IT'S ME.

242
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,708
YOU HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT WE'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR YET, HAVE YOU?

243
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,375
- NOT YET.
BUT DON'T FORGET,

244
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,000
THE CENTER STRATUM 
FROM THE EARTHQUAKE

245
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,333
WAS DISPERSED ALL OVER.

246
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,041
- YES. THERE WAS CERTAINLY
ENOUGH POWER AVAILABLE.

247
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,375
- SEARCHES MADE AT GROUND LEVEL
ARE EXTREMELY RISKY.

248
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,625
- I UNDERSTAND.

249
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,916
I'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT 
A WAY TO WORK AROUND IT.

250
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,500
IS THERE SOMETHING FUNNY?

251
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,458
- NOTHING, SIR.

252
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:42,125
- THEN WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING,
YOU PATHETIC TOY?

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,750
- YES, THIS WOULD LOOK
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL ON YOU.

254
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,416
- REALLY?  CUT THAT LOW?

255
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,916
- OF COURSE.
YOU HAVE SUCH A LOVELY FIGURE.

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,583
IT WOULD BE A SHAME
NOT TO SHOW IT OFF 

257
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,791
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

258
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,750
- HUH?

259
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,750
( gasps )

260
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,666
( sighs )

261
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,000
- ( elevator dings )

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,333
- OHH.

263
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,458
OH, YOU REALLY KNOW
HOW TO COMMUNICATE 

264
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,875
WITH MACHINES, DON'T YOU?
- HMM?

265
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,166
- UM, YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN, DON'T YOU? 

266
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,375
A MACHINE CAN UNDERSTAND WHETHER
IT'S BEEN PUT TOGETHER CORRECTLY

267
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,916
AND WHEN ITS POWER SUPPLY
HAS BEEN OPTIMIZED.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,833
YOU'RE A REAL MASTER,
AREN'T YOU?

269
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,833
- MAKI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HUH?

270
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,750
- DID I SAY THAT
YOU COULD COME IN HERE?

271
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,166
WELL, HENDERSON HAS PREPARED
A LOVELY MEAL FOR US.

272
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,166
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS 
AND EAT, SHALL WE?

273
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,083
I'M SO HAPPY THAT WE'RE FINALLY
TOGETHER AGAIN, MAKI.

274
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,541
I HADN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU,
YOU KNOW,

275
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,500
BUT THERE ARE THINGS
I HAVE TO DO HERE

276
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,208
THAT HAVE BEEN
OCCUPYING MY ATTENTION,

277
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,291
AND, WELL...

278
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,625
- UM, SYLIA,

279
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,708
IS THERE A REASON
THAT THE MAN DOWNSTAIRS

280
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,708
DIDN'T COME UP 
TO EAT WITH US?

281
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,541
- UM, NIGEL...

282
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,166
DOESN'T DO THAT.

283
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,083
- Maki: HE REALLY IS
INCREDIBLE, ISN'T HE? 

284
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,708
I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE
I LOVE MACHINES THE WAY HE DOES.

285
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,416
A MACHINE CAN'T OPERATE
AT ITS FULL POTENTIAL

286
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,333
UNLESS THE PERSON WHO MAINTAINS
IT REALLY CARES FOR IT.

287
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,208
- ( groans )
- ( gasps ) 

288
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,708
- STOP TALKING ABOUT MACHINES
AS IF THEY WERE HUMAN BEINGS,

289
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,666
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!
- ( gasps )

290
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,583
- OH, I'M SORRY, MAKI.

291
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,833
IT'S JUST THAT...

292
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,791
WELL, SOMETIMES I LOSE
CONTROL OF MY TEMPER. 

293
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,083
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT HAPPENS,
BUT IT DOES.

294
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,416
I GUESS MAYBE I HAVE MORE
OF MY MOTHER'S GENES IN ME

295
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,583
THAN I THOUGHT I DID.

296
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,958
( chuckles )

297
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,750
I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU
HAVEN'T INHERITED ANY OF THAT,

298
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,000
HAVE YOU, MAKI, DEAR?

299
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,583
- OF COURSE NOT, SYLIA.

300
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,583
YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T.

301
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,916
- ( sighs )

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,916
THE ONLY THING
I HAVE TO KNOW

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,583
IS THAT YOU'RE MY REAL
YOUNGER BROTHER, MAKI.

304
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,916
AND FROM NOW ON,

305
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,458
THE TWO OF US ARE GOING
TO LIVE HERE TOGETHER

306
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,083
THE WAY A REAL
FAMILY SHOULD.

00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,041
- Nene: LINNA,
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

323
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,375
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

324
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:42,708
- Linna:
Um, well, define "wrong."

325
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,000
- Nene:
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

326
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,708
- Linna: Um, no.

327
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,291
- I SEE.

328
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,958
- IT'S JUST THAT
I WAS WONDERING 

329
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,625
IF YOU'D EVER DONE
ANY SPECIAL TRAINING

330
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,875
LIKE IN A GYM.

331
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,541
- UM, NOT REALLY.

332
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,875
I'M NOT VERY GOOD
AT THAT SORT OF THING.

333
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,458
- BUT YOU'RE STILL ABLE
TO MOVE AROUND IN YOUR HARDSUIT

334
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,708
PRETTY WELL, AREN'T YOU?

335
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,708
- YES.
BUT I'M SPECIAL THAT WAY.

336
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,458
NOT ONLY AM I A MASTER HACKER
AND A COMPUTER GENIUS,

337
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,375
BUT I'VE ALSO BEEN BLESSED
WITH NATURAL GRACE

338
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,125
AND AN AMAZING
ATHLETIC ABILITY.

339
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,125
AND DID I MENTION
DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS?

340
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,416
( laughing )

341
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,833
ACTUALLY, THAT WAS 
JUST A JOKE, LINNA.

342
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,416
- Linna: I KNEW THAT.

343
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,750
- WELL, YOU COULD AT LEAST
HUMOR ME FOR A BIT.

344
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,583
- IT'S JUST THAT I'VE
BEEN GOING TO THE GYM

345
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,958
EVERY DAY, NENE.

346
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,750
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN WASTING MY TIME.

347
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,083
- HMM.

348
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,250
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
- HMM?

349
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,416
- WELL, TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY

350
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,750
HOW THE HARDSUITS
ACTUALLY OPERATE.

351
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,916
SYLIA'S GOT A REAL HANG UP
WITH SECURITY, YOU KNOW.

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,583
BUT I THINK THEY'RE MUCH MORE
THAN JUST SUITS OF ARMOR.

353
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,708
FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO DETERMINE, 

354
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,708
THE ABILITIES OF
THE SUIT DEPEND UPON

355
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,750
THE STRENGTHS OF THE WEARER.

356
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,750
- OH, SO I AM ON
THE RIGHT TRACK.

357
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,750
- SURE.
BUT TAKE IT EASY, WILL YOU?

358
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,250
THE LAST THING WE NEED
IS FOR YOU TO WEAR YOURSELF OUT.

359
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,458
- THANKS, NENE.
NIGHTY NIGHT.

360
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,916
- DON'T LET
THE BED BUGS BITE.

361
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,583
- HUH?

362
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,041
- REGINA 45.

363
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,500
- HUH?

364
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,958
- DON'T MAKE ME
REPEAT MYSELF. 

365
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,583
- YOU MEAN YOU WANT ME
TO HELP YOU?

366
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,458
- I ASKED FOR A REGINA 45.

367
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,458
- AHH!  YES, SIR.

368
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,958
HERE YOU GO.

369
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,166
- ( door chimes )

370
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,458
- HMM.

371
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,375
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S 
A MISSING MODULATOR

372
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,833
COMPONENT TO THIS ONE.

373
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,166
COULD YOU GO FETCH
A NEW ONE FOR ME? 

374
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,833
- UM, WHERE SHOULD I LOOK?

375
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,166
- ( sighs )

376
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,166
I'M NOT SURE, EXACTLY.

377
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,458
PROBABLY IN THE UPSTAIRS
STORAGE AREA.

378
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,166
- OKAY.
I'LL GO GET IT THEN.

379
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,208
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

380
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,500
MAYBE I SHOULD
HAVE TOLD HIM 

381
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,125
I DON'T KNOW MY WAY
AROUND HERE YET.

382
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,750
OH, WHAT'S THIS?

383
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,708
( yelps )

384
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,666
( stammering )

385
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,208
- I THINK I'M GOING TO 
SCREAM MY HEAD OFF NOW.

386
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,625
- OH MY GOD.

387
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,625
- ( screams )

388
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,916
- AAH!  EXCUSE ME!

389
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,041
( panting )

390
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,500
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

391
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,458
- NO, NOTHING WRONG AT ALL.
REALLY, SIR.

392
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,875
( yelps )

393
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,416
( murmurs )

394
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,166
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE,

395
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,541
YOU LITTLE PERVERT?

396
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,291
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT
THIS PLACE IS FOR GIRLS ONLY?

397
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,958
- ( stammers )
BUT I-- BUT HE--

398
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,750
- THAT MAN IS AN EXCEPTION.
WHO ARE YOU?

399
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,666
- OUR LITTLE FRIEND'S NAME
IS MAKI STINGRAY.

400
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,875
- SAY WHAT?!

401
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,541
- MAKI STINGRAY, HUH?

402
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,875
STRANGE.

403
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,500
I DIDN'T KNOW SYLIA
HAD A LITTLE BROTHER.

404
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,625
- ( murmurs )

405
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,875
- OKAY, HOW MUCH DID YOU SEE?

406
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,208
- OF WHAT?

407
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,583
- OF ME IN THE DRESSING ROOM,
YOU LITTLE SNEAK!

408
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,583
- OH, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO SEE ANYTHING.

409
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,083
I WAS OUT OF THERE BEFORE I EVEN
HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AROUND.

410
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,541
- OKAY THEN.

411
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,250
- YEAH.
SO I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE

412
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,458
TO SEE YOUR PINK UNDERWEAR
OR ANYTHING.

413
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,458
( gasps )

414
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,000
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

415
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,875
( groans )

416
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,708
- ( murmurs )

417
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,750
- HEY, WAIT A SECOND!
COME BACK HERE, YOU! 

418
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,666
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,
I'M SO SORRY!

419
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,333
- Nene: NOT AS SORRY AS
YOU'RE GOING TO BE!

420
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,583
- Maki: PLEASE NO! I WAS JUST
GUESSING ABOUT THE PINK PART.

421
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,000
- Nene: WHICH OF YOUR BONES
AM I GOING TO BREAK FIRST? 

422
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,250
COME BACK HERE!
- ( Maki screams )

423
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,625
- ( theme music playing )

424
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

425
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:10,041
- IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS: TOKYO 2040,"

426
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,375
A SERIES OF
UNEXPLAINED OCCURRENCES,

427
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:17,041
AN UNDERSEA BOOMER
ON THE LOOSE IN TOKYO.

428
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,041
WHERE DID IT COME FROM
AND WHAT IS ITS PURPOSE?

429
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,125
WITH LINNA'S SUIT
DOWN FOR REPAIRS,

430
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,875
IT'S UP TO PRISS AND NENE
TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY

431
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,041
AND PREVENT A MURDER.

432
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:32,708
NEXT EPISODE...
