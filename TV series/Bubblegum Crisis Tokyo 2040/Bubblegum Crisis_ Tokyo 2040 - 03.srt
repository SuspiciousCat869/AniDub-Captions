1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,208
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,958
- NIGEL,
CAN YOU SPARE A MINUTE?

4
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,125
SHE'S ACTING
A LITTLE CHOPPY.

5
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,666
YOU CAN HEAR IT,
CAN'T YOU?

6
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,625
I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE ROTATED
THE ENGINE TOO HIGH.

7
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,458
IT'S FINE WHEN IT'S
IN HIGH ROTATION,

8
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,458
BUT WHEN IT'S LOW,
IT BECOMES KIND OF UNSTABLE.

9
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,000
- ( engine revving )

10
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,958
- SHE NEEDS A NEW HARDSUIT.
HAVE YOU HEARD YET?

11
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,416
- ( tool ratcheting )
- I JUST DID.

12
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,791
I'M GOING UP THERE LATER.

13
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,083
- Man: This is Salusa Source.

14
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,666
We're currently patrolling
over the submerged city.

15
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,333
Nothing out of the ordinary
to report.

16
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,666
- ( yawns ) ROGER.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OH, HI, LEON-POO.

18
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,541
DID YOU COME ALL THE WAY OVER
HERE JUST TO SEE ME?

19
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,541
- ( laughing )

20
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,750
- HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO TELL YOU

21
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,791
TO QUIT CALLING ME THAT?

22
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,750
- WHY?  IT FITS YOU SO WELL,
LEON-POO.

23
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,708
YOU ARE MEAN.

24
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,458
- ARE YOU GONNA
CALL ME THAT ANYMORE?

25
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,666
- YOU'RE NOT PLAYING FAIR.

26
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,666
- WHAT'S MY NAME?
- LEON-POO.

27
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,333
- HUH?
- OH!  IT'S LEON!

28
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,583
- RIGHT.

29
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,208
- YOU'RE STILL MEAN.

30
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,708
- ( laughs )

31
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,541
LOOK, YOU CAN ACCESS
ALL THE CASE FILES

32
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,500
FROM HERE, CAN'T YOU?
- YEAH, SO WHAT?

33
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,291
- SO I'D LIKE TO LOOK
AT SOME OF THEM.

34
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,083
THE KNIGHT SABER REPORTS.

35
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,541
- I DON'T KNOW
IF WE HAVE ANY OF THOSE.

36
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,541
- WELL, CHECK THE DIRECTORY.

37
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,250
- OH, YEAH.
- OH!

38
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,500
COME ON, THEY'VE GOTTA
BE IN THERE.  JUST LOOK.

39
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,458
- IS THIS HOW YOU ASK
FOR A FAVOR?

40
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,791
- AWW.

41
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,958
ALL RIGHT, PRETTY PLEASE.

42
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,583
HMM?

43
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,291
THIS IS FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.

44
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,291
- ( gasps )

45
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,708
- Misae: HEY, LINNA,
WHAT'S WITH THE HANDS?

46
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,166
- WHAT?

47
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,958
( laughs )

48
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,041
I WAS JUST THINKING WHAT
BEAUTIFUL ELEGANT FINGERS

49
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,500
I HAVE, MISAE,

50
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,958
AND WHAT A SHAME IT WAS
TO TYPE WITH THEM.

51
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,166
- BOY, DO YOU LIVE 
IN A FANTASY WORLD.

52
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,625
- ( sighs )

53
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,500
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO BE LIKE THAT.

54
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,583
CAN I REALLY DO THIS?

55
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,833
- THAT'S ALL THERE IS?

56
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,833
- YEP, THAT'S IT.

57
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,416
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT
THE FIELD DATA RECORDERS

58
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,250
WERE JAMMED SOMEHOW.

59
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,875
EVERY TIME THE KNIGHT SABERS
APPEAR, WE LOSE ALL THE VIDEO

60
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,291
AND AUDIO SIGNALS.

61
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,916
- OKAY, THANKS FOR TRYING.
- BLAH!

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,250
THANKS FOR BEING SO GULLIBLE.

63
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,208
- SO, PRISS TOLD YOU,
DID SHE?

64
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,083
- I BROUGHT ALL THE PARTS.

65
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,750
- TAKE THEM DOWN TO THE PIT.

66
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,291
- YOU'LL FIND ALL HER DATA
AND MEASUREMENTS ON FILE

67
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,875
IN THE SIMULATOR BOOTH.

68
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,541
- THIS IS THE NEW RECRUIT.
LINNA YAMAZAKI.

69
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,291
- SHE'S A CUTE ONE, ISN'T SHE?

70
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,416
AND VERY ATHLETIC.  PRISS WAS
THE ONE WHO FOUND HER ACTUALLY.

71
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,833
IT'S RATHER ODD, ISN'T IT,

72
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,833
THAT PRISS WOULD WANT TO RECRUIT
ANOTHER PERSON, I MEAN.

73
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,125
NICE, YOU TOOK THE CORE OUT,
I ASSUME.

74
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,166
- OF COURSE.

75
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:24,208
- THIS IS ONE OF PRISS' BACKUPS,
BUT I GUESS IT'S OKAY.

76
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,916
- I'VE HAD SOME NEW IDEAS.

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'D LIKE TO TRY THEM OUT
ON THIS ONE.

78
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,916
- OF COURSE.
DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

79
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,625
- Nene: SEE YOU LATER.
BYE.

80
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:14,291
HUH?
- NENE, CAN WE TALK?

81
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,375
SO, NENE, WHY DID YOU JOIN

82
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,958
THE YOU KNOW WHO?

83
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,250
- PROBABLY THE SAME REASON
YOU DID.

84
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,291
IT LOOKED KIND OF INTERESTING.

85
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,000
- BUT HOW WERE YOU RECRUITED?

86
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,666
- ACTUALLY, I HAD HACKED THIS
SYSTEM AND I CAUGHT SYLIA

87
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,000
TRYING TO BREAK INTO
THE MASTER DATABASE AT GENOM.

88
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,541
I SENT HER A LITTLE "HOW-TO"
AND SHE PROPOSITIONED ME.

89
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,708
AT LEAST SHE WANTED ME
FOR MY MIND, NOT MY BODY.

90
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,500
- YEAH, I KIND OF THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE LIKE THAT.

91
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,291
- WE CAN'T ALL BE AMAZON
GODDESSES, MISS YAMAZAKI,

92
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,916
BUT WHEN I PUT ON MY SUIT,
I CAN FIGHT BOOMERS

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,333
WITH THE BEST-- OH!

94
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,083
- HEY, YOU SPILLED THAT ON ME.

95
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,375
YOU STUPID PLASTIC MORON!

96
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,000
LOOK WHAT YOU DID.
THESE WERE BRAND-NEW JEANS.

97
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,583
- I'M VERY SORRY
FOR MY MISTAKE, SIR.

98
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,125
THE MANAGEMENT WILL PAY
THE CLEANING BILL.

99
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,916
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

100
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,250
IT WAS YOUR FAULT, BOOMER, AND I
WANT YOU TO MAKE GOOD ON IT.

101
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,916
- OH, MAN, WHAT A JERK.

102
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,250
HE WOULDN'T TALK
TO A REAL PERSON LIKE THAT.

103
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,750
- POOR LITTLE THING.

104
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,666
- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THIS UNIT
TO DO TO SATISFY YOU, SIR?

105
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,583
- I WANT YOU TO LICK IT OFF.

106
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,416
- ( laughs )
- ( Linna shouts )

107
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,166
- HUH?
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

108
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,458
I'VE HAD ALL
I CAN TAKE OF THIS.

109
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,750
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
YOU PERVERT?

110
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,208
- WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?

111
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,625
- OH, MAN.  DID YOU HAVE TO
MAKE A SCENE, LINNA?

112
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,125
- I'M TEACHING THIS BOOMER

113
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,791
A LITTLE RESPECT
FOR ITS MASTERS.

114
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,625
- UH-HUH.

115
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,958
AND DOES YOUR GIRLFRIEND TEACH
YOU THE SAME LESSON EVERY NIGHT?

116
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,583
- ( laughing )

117
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,458
- SHUT UP.  THERE'S A DIFFERENT
BETWEEN HUMANS AND BOOMERS.

118
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,583
DAMN BOOMER LOVERS.

119
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,916
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.

120
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,708
PLEASE COME BACK AGAIN.

121
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,000
- IT'S JUST THAT

122
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,833
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN REALLY DO THIS.

123
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,166
- WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT SURE,

124
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,458
MAYBE YOU SHOULD QUIT NOW
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

125
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,000
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

126
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,250
- LOOK, WHEN YOU TRY ON YOUR
HARD SUIT, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

127
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,000
YOU'VE ONLY GOT
SO MUCH BATTERY TIME

128
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,000
AND ROPED BOOMERS
MOVE AROUND A LOT.

129
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,666
IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT, PRISS
AND I HAVE ENOUGH TO DO ALREADY.

130
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,666
WE DON'T NEED TO BE
BABYSITTING YOU, TOO.

131
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,250
WELL, ACTUALLY,

132
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,208
THAT'S WHAT PRISS SAID ABOUT ME
WHEN I TOOK LONGER

133
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,333
TO GET THE HANG OF MY SUIT
THAN SHE DID.

134
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,750
SHE'S KIND OF WEIRD.
TERRITORIAL, TOO.

135
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,416
IF YOU'RE SMART,
YOU WON'T EVEN THINK

136
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,875
ABOUT TRYING
TO COMPETE AGAINST HER.

137
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,708
- YEAH, SURE.

138
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,291
- SO STILL ON BOARD?

139
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,000
- ALL THE WAY.
THANKS, KID.

140
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,708
- DON'T CALL ME KID,
YOU ROOKIE.

141
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,208
- SORRY.  THANKS, NENE.

142
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,333
- HMM.
- ( both laugh )

143
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,208
- Rosenkreutz: SO THESE
ARE THE KNIGHT SABERS.

144
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,250
ARE THEY?

145
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,708
- OUR INTELLIGENCE DIVISIONS
ARE STILL TRYING

146
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,416
TO GATHER MORE DATA ON THEM,
BUT THEY'VE KEPT A LOW PROFILE.

147
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,916
- ( laughs )

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,541
WHY DON'T WE JUST
LEAVE THEM ALONE?

149
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,625
THEY'VE DONE SUCH
A GOOD JOB

150
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,541
DESTROYING THE ROGUE BOOMERS

151
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,041
AND THE EVIDENCE FOR US.

152
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,958
- BUT, SIR, WHAT HAPPENS
IF SOMEONE DISCOVERS THE EXTENT

153
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,166
OF THE DESIGN FLAWS IN THE
BOOMER METAL BATTERY SYSTEMS.

154
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,708
WHAT IF THE PUBLIC FINDS OUT?

155
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,708
- THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY

156
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,583
OF THAT, MASON.
- SIR.

157
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,791
- WHY DO YOU THINK
WE HAVE INVESTED SO MUCH TIME

158
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,250
AND EFFORT IN THE AD POLICE.

159
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,416
- TO BE HONEST, SIR,
I DON'T THINK THE AD POLICE

160
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,250
ARE A THREAT AT ALL.
THEY'RE POORLY ORGANIZED,

161
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,166
POOR LED AND RELY TOO MUCH
ON CONVENTIONAL METHODS

162
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,208
AND FIREPOWER
TO BE EFFECTIVE.

163
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,958
- EXACTLY.

164
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,291
THE AD POLICE ARE SEEN
AS A JOKE

165
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,000
BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

166
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,083
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF SWAGGERING,

167
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,083
OVERBEARING,
WOULD-BE SOLDIERS

168
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,625
WHO USE TANKS
AND HIGH EXPLOSIVES

169
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,375
TO HANDLE THE OCCASIONAL
UNSTABLE BOOMER,

170
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,958
BUT AS LONG AS THEY
ARE IN CHARGE,

171
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,958
THE REAL POLICE
CAN'T GET INVOLVED.

172
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,125
- YES, SIR.
AND WHAT OF THE KNIGHT SABERS?

173
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,541
- THEY DO NOT EXIST.
WE HAVE SUPPRESSED ALL MENTION

174
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,958
OF THEM IN THE MEDIA.

175
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,083
LIKE MAD BOOMERS,
THEY ARE SIMPLY URBAN LEGENDS,

176
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,041
JUST ONE MORE MYTH THAT
THE POLITICIANS USE

177
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,208
TO KEEP THEIR PRIVATE ARMY,

178
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,291
THE AD POLICE, ALIVE.

179
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,041
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

180
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,458
IT'S ONE BIG CONSPIRACY.

181
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,458
HUMOR ME, MASON.

182
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,541
I'VE BECOME A CHILD AGAIN.

183
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,458
AND A CHILD WHO CANNOT PLAY
WITH HIS TOYS

184
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,708
CAN BECOME QUITE DESTRUCTIVE.

185
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,875
- YOO-HOO, WAITRESS.
WE'RE HUNGRY HERE!

186
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,666
- HEY, NOT SO LOUD.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING US.

187
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,458
- BUT I'M STARVING
TO DEATH ALREADY.

188
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,791
THIS RESTAURANT USUALLY HAS
SUCH GOOD SERVICE.

189
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,791
WHERE COULD OUR WAITRESS BE?

190
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,375
- ( licking )

191
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,416
- SYLIA!

192
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,541
WELL, THAT'S STRANGE.

193
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,583
LET'S CHECK THE PIT.

194
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,208
HUH?

195
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,583
HEY, NIGEL WAS HERE.

196
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,083
LINNA, THAT MEANS YOUR HARDSUIT
MIGHT BE READY.

197
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,000
HEY, NIGEL!

198
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,666
- UH... HELLO, SIR.

199
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,666
MY NAME IS LINNA YAMAZAKI.

200
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,500
- SO I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I HAVE MORE WORK FOR YOU.

201
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,458
AH, YOU'RE EARLY.

202
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,125
- YES, MA'AM.

203
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,208
- HMM? HMM?

204
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,250
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
BUS TABLE THREE.

205
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,958
YOU CAN'T EVEN BUY A GOOD
WAITRESS THESE DAYS.

206
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,291
WHY ME, GOD?

207
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,083
- WHOA!
WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT?

208
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,416
WOW!

209
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,750
HEY!

210
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,583
WAIT A SECOND.

211
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:06,333
ISN'T THIS JUST A LITTLE
ADVANCED FOR A STARTER SUIT,

212
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,541
NOT TO MENTION
A LITTLE FORM-FITTING?

213
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,500
- NIGEL WANTED TO TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

214
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,000
I THINK IT'S SEXY.

215
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,166
OF COURSE WE DID HAVE
A NICE FORM TO BUILD ON.

216
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,958
NIGEL CAST IT TO FIT YOU
LIKE A SECOND SKIN.

217
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,625
- COULD--

218
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,250
- YES.

219
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,833
- COULD I TRY IT ON NOW?

220
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,750
- ( laughs )

221
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,000
- HELP ME!

222
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,166
- SEEMS A LITTLE TIGHT ON ME.

223
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,166
( grunting )

224
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,041
- THE SKIN SUIT TRANSMITS
YOUR BODY'S NERVE IMPULSES

225
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,541
TO THE HARDSUIT.
TO DO THAT, IT HAS TO BE SNUG.

226
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,583
WATCH OUT FOR
THE PLUMBING CONNECTION.

227
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,333
- RIGHT. ( grunts )

228
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,208
- ( shrieks )

229
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,416
- ( screaming )

230
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,708
- HERE WE GO AGAIN.

231
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,750
- GET HER OFF OF ME!

232
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,875
- OH!

233
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,791
- IT WILL FEEL A LITTLE COLD,
BUT JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE TIME,

234
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,166
AND IT WILL ADJUST
TO YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE.

235
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,708
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME
AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL

236
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,750
OF THE CONNECTIONS MATCH UP.

237
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,583
- OH. COLD.

238
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,875
- GOOD.

239
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,083
NOW LEAN FORWARD
AND PUT YOUR ARMS IN.

240
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,750
- WHAT NOW?

241
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:28,708
- WAIT.  I'M RELEASING YOU
FROM THE HANGER.

242
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,458
- ( gasping )

243
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,791
IT LOOKED HEAVY,
BUT IT'S REALLY LIGHT.

244
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,583
- IT'S DANGEROUS TO MOVE AROUND
LIKE THAT IN THE BEGINNING.

245
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,500
YOU HAVE TO GET USED
TO IT GRADUALLY.

246
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,666
- WOW! ( laughing )

247
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,333
- Hey, Sylia,
we got a rogue boomer in 24.

248
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,083
- I KNEW THESE NEW FEMALE MODELS
WERE GOING TO BE TROUBLE.

249
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,625
- WHAT DO WE DO, SYLIA?
IT'LL TAKE FOREVER

250
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,541
TO DRIVE THE MOBILE PIT OUT
TO WHERE PRISS IS.

251
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,500
- WE DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH TIME.  SUIT UP.

252
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,833
- ME?  ALL BY MYSELF?

253
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,208
- OF COURSE NOT.
REMEMBER?

254
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,166
- HUH?

255
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,166
- ( man whimpering )

256
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,958
- Priss: RUN, YOU IDIOT!

257
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,000
- SYLIA, SENDING HER
INTO COMBAT LIKE THIS IS,

258
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,000
IT'S JUST RECKLESS.

259
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,791
- YOU STILL WANT TO BE ONE
OF THE KNIGHT SABERS, DON'T YOU?

260
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,250
WELL, THEN THE CHOICE IS YOURS.
DO YOU WANT TO BACK OUT?

261
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,833
- NO.
- REMEMBER, THE TWO OF YOU

262
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,458
HAVE TO KEEP A CONSTANT EYE
ON EACH OTHER'S BATTERY STATUS.

263
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,041
- I KNOW.

264
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,750
COME ON, LINNA.
- RIGHT.

265
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,958
- STEP UP.
THIS IS THE LAUNCH PLATFORM.

266
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,708
- THE WHAT?
WHERE'S YOUR SUIT?

267
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,541
- ACTUALLY, WE NORMALLY
PUT OUR SUITS ON IN HERE,

268
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,083
BUT SINCE THIS WAS
YOUR FIRST TIME,

269
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,875
WE HAD TO WATCH YOU DO IT.

270
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,208
- YOU WERE WATCHING ME?
- NO TIME.

271
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,958
GO ON, GET IN.
- WHAT?  BY MYSELF?

272
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,541
- WELL, OF COURSE.
COME ON, HURRY UP.

273
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,916
MAKE SURE YOUR SEAL
YOURSELF PROPERLY.

274
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,583
- WHAT SEAL?
- ON YOUR HELMET.

275
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,708
- WHY AM I DOING THIS?

276
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,000
- Nene:
IT'S TIME TO GO.

277
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,250
BRACE YOURSELF,
'CAUSE THIS CAN BE PRETTY ROUGH.

278
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,666
- RIGHT.

279
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,541
( gasps )

280
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,041
- KNIGHT SABERS,
PREPARE FOR ACTION.

281
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,666
- ( screaming )

282
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,291
- LINNA, YOU HAVE TO JUMP
AS SOON AS YOU HIT A SURFACE.

283
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,583
YOUR THRUSTERS WILL KICK IN
AUTOMATICALLY,

284
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,708
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR ANGLE
IN BALANCE JUST RIGHT,

285
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,666
YOU COULD SLAM INTO SOMETHING.
- I'LL TRY.

286
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,791
- HEY, YOU DID THAT REALLY WELL.
HOW IN THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT?

287
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,250
- I'M FLYING. ( laughing )

288
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,666
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SO LIGHT.

289
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,041
- HEY, DON'T FLY SO HIGH.

290
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,958
HOW IS IT THAT YOU CAN FLY
HIGHER THAN ME?

291
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,250
- HOW LONG TILL MY HARDSUIT
GETS HERE?

292
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,333
- Sylia: Hurry up and get out
of there while you still can.

293
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,958
The AD Police
are already on their way.

294
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,166
- BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS BOOMER?

295
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,416
- Don't worry. The Knight Sabers
will handle it.

296
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,041
- Woman: We've got an update
on the mad Boomer in 24.

297
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,833
It's a waitress model
and it's attacking a customer

298
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,666
inside the restaurant.
- ROGUE WAITRESS BOOMERS?

299
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,875
WHAT NEXT?
- MAYBE SOMEONE UNDERTIPPED HER.

300
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,541
- LET'S DO IT.

301
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,500
- WE'VE NEVER SEEN THESE
NEW BOOMERS GO ROGUE BEFORE.

302
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,750
STANDARD ARMORED PIERCING ROUNDS
MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH.

303
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,875
- WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO WAIT FOR BACKUP, MR. WONG.

304
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,250
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S WHERE WE ATE TODAY.

305
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,250
- Nene: OH, CRAP!

306
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,875
SYLIA, THE AD POLICE
ARE ALREADY HERE.

307
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:14,333
- You've got to hurry.
Priss is trapped inside.

308
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,416
- ( snarling )

309
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,666
- ( theme music playing )

310
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

311
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:08,291
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040,"

312
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:12,041
SHE'S PASSED THE FIRST TEST,
BUT IN HER FIRST CONFRONTATION

313
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,666
