1
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,666
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,958
- Priss:
THE WHOLE BUILDING'S MOVING!

4
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,666
- Nene: IT'S THE TOWER!

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,000
GALATEA HAS TRANSFERRED HER
CONSCIOUSNESS INTO THE TOWER.

6
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,375
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

7
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,791
- YOU MEAN THIS WHOLE THING'S
BECOMING HER?!

8
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,041
- ( exploding )

9
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,166
- Priss: DAMN IT.

10
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,833
HOW IN THE HELL
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT THAT?

11
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,541
- ( electrical static )

12
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,458
- HMM?

13
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,791
- HOW'S SYLIA?

14
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,375
- ( sighs )

15
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,416
SHE'S JUST BEEN SITTING THERE.

16
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,333
- MACKY.

17
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,833
- NENE, MACKY IS TOO HUMAN

18
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:58,291
TO FORGET SOMETHING
AS IMPORTANT TO HIM AS YOU.

19
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,708
- I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT, LINNA.

20
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,000
- IT'S NOT OVER YET, YOU KNOW.

21
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,750
- NOT UNTIL WE FINISH IT.

22
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,166
- BRING ME THE TOOL BOX.

23
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,333
- UM, NIGEL?

24
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,083
- I DON'T CARE WHETHER
YOU WANT THIS BIKE OR NOT.

25
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,500
IT'S THE ONLY THING
LEFT HERE FOR ME TO FIX.

26
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,375
- I THINK SYLIA
COULD USE YOUR HELP TOO.

27
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,875
SOME PEOPLE
CAN HANDLE BEING ALONE.

28
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,375
BUT YOU KNOW
SHE'S NOT ONE OF THEM.

29
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,791
- ( electrical pulsating )

30
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,750
- ( beeping )

31
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,333
- YEAH, ALMOST THERE.

32
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,166
JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER.

33
00:04:56,291 --> 00:05:00,083
COME ON.
COME TO NENE.

34
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,958
- ( computer pings )
- I DID IT!

35
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,750
ROMANOVA THE GIRL GENIUS
STRIKES AGAIN.

36
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,541
GALATEA'S IN ORBIT?

37
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,125
- UM, WHERE'S THE CAMERA?

38
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:15,208
- OH, IT'S A LIVE FEED
FROM THE N.S.A. SPY SATELLITE.

39
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,666
- THAT'S 30 YEARS.

40
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,333
- FROM THE LOOK OF IT,

41
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,583
GALATEA SEEMS TO BE HEADING
FOR THE UMBRELLA.

42
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,125
- BUT WHY IS SHE GOING THERE?

43
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,750
- THE UMBRELLA IS AN ARRAY
OF ORBITING SOLAR COLLECTORS.

44
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,125
IT WAS THE CENTERPIECE
OF GENOM'S SHOWEN PROJECT.

45
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,625
- Nene: THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT I'M AFRAID GALATEA

46
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,875
INTENDS TO USE IT
FOR A VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE.

47
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,208
- Priss: SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA LIKE THIS.

48
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,250
- Nene: THE SHOWEN PROJECT
WAS DESIGNED

49
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,458
TO FUNNEL CONVERTED SOLAR ENERGY
FROM THE UMBRELLA

50
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,958
INTO THE DRAGON LINE
UNDERGROUND.

51
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,416
THE GENOM TOWER WAS DESIGNED
TO ACT AS THE CONDUIT

52
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,875
BETWEEN THE TWO.

53
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,958
DIDN'T YOU READ THE REPORT
I WROTE FOR SYLIA ABOUT IT?

54
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,083
- ( laughs )
I GUESS I MUST HAVE SKIMMED

55
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,250
THROUGH THE PARTS
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

56
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,333
- GALATEA USED THE DRAGON LINE
TO SPREAD THE VOOMER PLAGUE.

57
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,416
- FORTUNATELY WE WERE ABLE
TO CUT IT OFF

58
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,583
BEFORE SHE COULD SEND IT
TO OTHER CITIES.

59
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,625
I'M AFRAID THAT'S THE REASON
SHE'S HEADING FOR THE UMBRELLA.

60
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,333
- WHAT? PLEASE DON'T TELL ME

61
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,916
THAT YOU'RE THINKING WHAT
I THINK YOU'RE THINKING.

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,291
- IT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY,
ISN'T IT?

63
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,333
- MOST EFFECTIVE FOR WHAT?

64
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,583
- TO TRANSMIT THE BOOMER PLAGUE
TO EVERY MACHINE ON THE PLANET.

65
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,291
- ( computer beeps )
- WAIT.

66
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,000
IT LOOKS
LIKE SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

67
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,708
TARGET LOCKED?
- WAIT A SECOND.

68
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,541
IF YOUR FEED
IS AN N.S.A. SPY SATELLITE,

69
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,750
- THAT MUST MEAN--
- UH-HUH.

70
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,125
--THE UNITED STATES
IS LAUNCHING MISSILES.

71
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,208
- IF YOU'RE RIGHT,

72
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,208
THEN THEY'RE USING
NUCLEAR WARHEADS.

73
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,958
- NUCLEAR?!

74
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,958
- ( Linna gasps )

75
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,166
SHE'S ABSORBING THEM.

76
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,000
- SHE CAN STOP THOSE MISSILES
SO EASILY.

77
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,291
MY GOD.

78
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,375
- Nene: I'M TAPPING
INTO THE U.N. DEFENSE GRID.

79
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,208
EVERYONE'S ONLINE.

80
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,208
ALL THE DEFENSE NETS
KNOW THAT THE U.S. NUKES FAILED

81
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,250
AND THEY'RE PUTTING
THEIR OWN LAUNCHES ON HOLD.

82
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,791
- THEY ARE FOR NOW.
BUT FOR HOW LONG?

83
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,000
I CAN TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'LL DO

84
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,583
ONCE THEY FIND OUT
WHAT GALATEA IS UP TO.

85
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,125
- AND WHAT'S THAT?

86
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,583
- THEY'LL TRY TO DESTROY THE
SOURCE OF THE VOOMER INFECTION.

87
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,375
- AND NUKING TOKYO
CUTS THEIR PROBLEMS IN HALF.

88
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:33,208
- WE'VE GOT TO DESTROY HER
BEFORE SHE GETS US.

89
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,375
- Sylia: YOU KNOW,
FOR THE LONGEST TIME,

90
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,666
ALL I COULD THINK OF
WAS LEAVING THIS TOWN.

91
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,291
MY SINGING WAS GOING
TO TAKE ME ALL OVER THE WORLD.

92
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,250
THEN THIS THING HAPPENED.

93
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,750
I WAS MAKING GOOD MONEY,

94
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,958
KILLING BOOMERS,

95
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,666
AND I KEPT PUTTING IT OFF.

96
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,416
I HAD MY BAGS PACKED
EVERY NIGHT.

97
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,125
BUT I NEVER WENT ANYWHERE.

98
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,375
NOW EVEN THIS PLACE
IS GONE.

99
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,625
- SOMETIMES YOU NEED
A KICK IN THE TEETH

100
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,875
TO GET OUT
OF THE RUT YOU'RE IN.

101
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,750
IT'S LIKE FALLING IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S TAKEN.

102
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,333
AS LONG AS YOU STAY NEAR HER,
YOU CAN'T SEE ANYONE ELSE.

103
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,583
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SMART
AND WALKING AWAY,

104
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,583
YOU KEEP WAITING FOR SOMETHING
THAT WON'T HAPPEN.

105
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,083
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY,
THE IDEAL SOLUTION

106
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,583
WOULD BE IF YOUR FRIEND SYLIA
WOULD DESIGN A HARDSUIT FOR MEN.

107
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,583
OF COURSE, I'D LOOK
PRETTY STRANGE IN HIGH HEELS.

108
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,666
BUT I THINK I WOULD--

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,458
- SHUT UP.

110
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,708
- LOOKS LIKE IT'S SERIOUS NOW.

111
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,083
- I DON'T KNOW.

112
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,500
I DON'T THINK LEON-POO WILL
ENJOY BEING HENPECKED.

113
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,958
- ( laughs )
OR WILL HE?

114
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,833
- OKAY, I THINK WE'VE
GOT THIS WORKED OUT WELL ENOUGH.

115
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,416
AHEM.
- HMM?

116
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,541
- HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN STANDING THERE?

117
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,333
- WHAT?  WE CAME OUT HERE FIRST,
REMEMBER?

118
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,500
AND ANYWAY,
WE WERE JUST LEAVING.

119
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,000
IT WAS GETTING TOO ICKY.

120
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,083
- IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT.

121
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,000
AND I THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE
WORKING ON A WAY

122
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,500
TO STOP GALATEA.

123
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,791
- YOU KNOW, THE DEFENSE FORCE
HAS ITS OWN MISSILE BASE.

124
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,625
- BUT THERE'S NO WAY
WE'D BE ABLE TO STAGE A LAUNCH

125
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,791
ALL BY OURSELVES.

126
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,791
IN ANY CASE,
I THINK LINNA AND I

127
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:33,125
CAME UP WITH A BETTER WAY
TO BEAT GALATEA TO THE UMBRELLA.

128
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,333
- HUH?

129
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,291
- Priss: THE SKY HOOK.

130
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,250
SYLIA,
WE'RE GOING AFTER GALATEA.

131
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,000
- Linna: WE'VE GOT TO GO NOW

132
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,000
BEFORE SHE GETS
TO THE UMBRELLA.

133
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,916
WE, UM, WE'LL TRY
TO MAKE YOU PROUD OF US.

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,416
- Nene: TAKE CARE OF MACKY
FOR ME.

135
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,666
I MEAN, UNTIL WE GET BACK,
OF COURSE.

136
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,833
WE'LL DEFEAT GALATEA AND GET
MACKY'S MEMORY BACK, SYLIA.

137
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,916
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE.
I PROMISE.

138
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,875
- IT'S SO QUIET OUT THERE.

139
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,250
- ( engine revving )

140
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,708
- SO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
- KNOW WHAT?

141
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,916
- THE REASON I USED TO HATE
THE AD POLICE.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,583
I'D BEEN LIVING
ON THE STREETS FOR A WHILE,

143
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,750
AND I WAS SLEEPING
IN THIS OLD FACTORY

144
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,500
WHEN A ROGUE BOOMER
TURNED UP.

145
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,708
- I'M PRETTY SURE I KNOW
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

146
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,875
THE A.D.P. SHOWED UP
AND BLEW THE PLACE TO HELL.

147
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,166
RIGHT?

148
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,208
- IT WAS LIKE THE EARTHQUAKE
ALL OVER AGAIN

149
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,000
WITH ARMORED TRUCKS,
GRENADES AND A ZILLION BULLETS

150
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,416
FLYING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

151
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
- THAT SOUNDS PRETTY BAD,
ALL RIGHT.

152
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,250
I GUESS YOU GOT HURT
IN THE CROSSFIRE, HUH?

153
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,416
- I GOT SHOT UP A LITTLE--
BROKEN ARM.

154
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,250
BUT THE THING
THAT MADE IT REALLY BAD

155
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,250
WAS THAT MY DISK
WAS DESTROYED IN THE FIRE.

156
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,583
- A DISK?

157
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,583
- IT HAD MY FAVORITE SONG ON IT.

158
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,583
I USED TO LISTEN TO IT AT NIGHT
AND DREAM OF PERFORMING

159
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,208
IN THIS GIANT STADIUM.

160
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,208
- ( laughs )

161
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,208
THAT IS A PRETTY SILLY REASON,
ISN'T IT?

162
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,208
- ( ball smashes )

163
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:27,125
- THE SKY HOOK MAKES A REGULAR
SUPPLY RUN TO THE UMBRELLA

164
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,833
FROM THE BOSO PENINSULA.

165
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,958
- BUT THOSE PICKUPS ARE JUST
UNMANNED CARGO PALLETS,

166
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,208
AREN'T THEY?

167
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,708
- YES, THEY ARE.
WHICH MEANS THAT THE SKY HOOK

168
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,666
HAS TO AUTOMATICALLY PICK UP
ANY PALLET IN LINE.

169
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,083
AND THAT MEANS ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS GET ON A PALLET AND--

170
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,458
- Both: FLY INTO SPACE!

171
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,333
- ( chuckles )

172
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,333
- HOW'D IT GO?
- HMM?

173
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,791
- I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHAT THAT SONG SOUNDED LIKE.

174
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,791
I WISH I COULD HAVE
HEARD YOU SING IT.

175
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,333

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,166
- AH, SOMETHING'S WRONG!

188
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,958
NENE, THE SLIDER PALLETS ARE
ALREADY MOVING ALONG THE TRACK.

189
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,875
- ( laughs )
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

190
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,375
THOSE PALLETS
CAN'T GO ANYWHERE

191
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,375
UNTIL THE SKY HOOK GRABS THEM
RIGHT-- OH MY GOD!

192
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,333
- PRISS, WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS.

193
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,833
MMM!

194
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,000
THE PALLETS
ARE JUST FALLING IN THE OCEAN!

195
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:42,791
SOMETHING AT THE END OF THE
PLATFORM MUST NOT BE WORKING.

196
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,166
- Priss: LOOKS LIKE THE BOOMER
PLAGUE BEAT US HERE.

197
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,250
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW, PRISS?

198
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,458
- THE SKY HOOK
WILL STILL BE COMING THROUGH,

199
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,541
EVEN IF THERE
AREN'T ANY PALLETS TO PICK UP.

200
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,791
- YOU'RE NOT THINKING WHAT I
THINK YOU'RE THINKING, ARE YOU?

201
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,958
- ( engine revving )

202
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:16,250
- THE SKY HOOK WILL BE GOING
780 KILOMETERS AN HOUR!

203
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,750
THAT'S REALLY REALLY DANGEROUS.

204
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,000
- THE MOTOSLAVE CAN MATCH IT.

205
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,250
AND OUR HARDSUITS
OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH PROTECTION.

206
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,416
OR DOES ANYONE HERE
HAVE A BETTER IDEA?

207
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,208
- ( engine dying down )

208
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,791
- WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE.
WE'RE LEAVING.

209
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,291
- ( revving )

210
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,875
- ( inaudible )

211
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,125
- ( dying down )

212
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,750
- WHAT I SAID
WAS THAT I DON'T EVEN CARE

213
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,041
IF THE WHOLE PLANET
TURNS INTO A BOOMER.

214
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,125
JUST REMEMBER THAT YOU
PROMISED ME YOU'D COME BACK.

215
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,041
SO DO IT!

216
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:06,416
- LEON-POO CERTAINLY SOUNDED
PUT OUT ABOUT BEING LEFT BEHIND.

217
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,833
- HE ALWAYS SOUNDS PUT OUT
ABOUT SOMETHING.

218
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,541
- JUST SHUT UP AND HOLD ON.

219
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,291
HERE WE GO!

220
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,500
- ROGER!

221
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,166
- LET'S DO IT!

222
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,541
- Priss: ROCK AND ROLL!

223
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:53,416
JEEZ, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU TWO WERE SO HEAVY.

224
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,208
- FOR THE SAKE
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP,

225
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,458
I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT OUR HARDSUITS.

226
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,250
- UH, YEAH.

227
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,250
- Both: BETTER.

228
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,541
- Linna: THERE'S AN OPEN HATCH!

229
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:29,291
- Nene: AH, COME IN,
COME IN, COME IN!

230
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,250
CAN'T YOU GO ANY FASTER, PRISS?

231
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,166
- I'M TRYING!

232
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,625
COME ON, MOTOSLAVE,

233
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,416
FORGET EVERYTHING I EVER
SAID ABOUT BOOMERS.

234
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,791
JUST DO THIS THING!
- ( revving )

235
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,416
- Linna: WE'RE ALMOST THERE!

236
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,375
ONLY A COUPLE OF FEET MORE.

237
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,333
- Nene: COME ON, PRISS!
YOU CAN DO IT!

238
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,083
- All: AH!

239
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,916
- WE'RE TOO HEAVY!
- LINNA, FIRE YOUR BLASTER!

240
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,375
- ( moans )

241
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,041
LINNA, WAKE UP, SLEEPING BEAUTY.

242
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,791
- UH, WHAT?

243
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,250
WAS THAT A KISS?
NO FRIGGIN' WAY.

244
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,500
- HOW ABOUT YOU, NENE?

245
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,166
- I'M FINE,
BUT I'LL PASS ON THE KISS.

246
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,166
- ( chuckles )

247
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,125
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA GO AROUND THE WORLD

248
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,666
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

249
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,333
- SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE'D
BETTER SEE IF WE CAN GET INSIDE.

250
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,166
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY,

251
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,500
OUR SUITS CAN GENERATE
SOME OXYGEN CHEMICALLY,

252
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,000
BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT FOREVER.

253
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,166
- YOU READY?

254
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,875
- WHO, ME?  SURE.

255
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,708
- AH!
- DON'T SHOOT!

256
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,375
- NOBODY IS ALLOWED TO
RIDE THIS SHUTTLE

257
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,791
WITHOUT SPECIAL PERMISSION.

258
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,916
I SHALL HAVE TO REPORT
YOUR PRESENCE

259
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,541
TO THE OPERATIONS CENTER.

260
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,541
- LOOKS LIKE THE BOOMER PLAGUE
HASN'T GOT THIS FAR YET.

261
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,458
- SINCE THE PALLETS
WERE FALLING IN THE OCEAN,

262
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,916
THERE WAS NO WAY FOR IT
TO SPREAD TO THE SKY HOOK.

263
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,708
LOOKS LIKE GALATEA SCREWED UP.

264
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,708
- DON'T WORRY, MR. BOOMER.

265
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,541
WE ALL HAVE TICKETS
SO IT'S OKAY THAT WE'RE HERE.

266
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,791
- OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,

267
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,916
PLEASE RELAX
AND ENJOY YOUR TRIP.

268
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,083
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID SO
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

269
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,125
NOT!
DO I LOOK DEFECTIVE TO YOU?

270
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,541
- WAIT A SECOND,
MR. BOOMER POO.

271
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,916
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM ANYONE
IN THE OPERATIONS CENTER LATELY?

272
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,583
MAYBE YOUR RECEIVER IS FAULTY.

273
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,541
- ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T
RECEIVED A PICK-UP ORDER

274
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,541
IN NEARLY A WEEK.

275
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,541
GOODNESS GRACIOUS,
ARE YOU SAYING

276
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,541
THAT I'VE BEEN
IGNORING PROPER ORDERS?

277
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,041
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

278
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,541
WE'RE HERE TO GIVE YOU
YOUR NEW ORDERS PERSONALLY.

279
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,958
- OH, THANK YOU.

280
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,208
- LOOK AT THE STARS.

281
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,541
I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM
LOOK SO BRIGHT.

282
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,291
- THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO
ATMOSPHERE TO MAKE THEM TWINKLE.

283
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,875
- JEEZ,

284
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,958
DOESN'T THE FACT THAT WE'RE IN
OUTER SPACE WORRY YOU AT ALL?

285
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,750
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

286
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,750
- I'VE DREAMED OF THIS
FOR YEARS.

287
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,291
BACK WHEN I WAS A KID,
I WANTED TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT

288
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,916
IN THE WORST WAY POSSIBLE.

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,416
- WHY DIDN'T YOU?

290
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,083
IT CERTAINLY CAN'T BE
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T SMART ENOUGH

291
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,750
TO PASS THE ENTRANCE EXAMS.

292
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,083
- THAT'S NOT
WHERE I CAME UP SHORT, LINNA.

293
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,583
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE AGENCY

294
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,250
HAS A HEIGHT REQUIREMENT?

295
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,416
- BUT YOU MADE YOUR DREAM
COME TRUE ANYWAY.

296
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,750
- I GUESS I DID.

297
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,708
SO WHAT'S YOUR DREAM, LINNA?

298
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,291
- WHAT?
UH, YOU MEAN NOW?

299
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:55,041
WELL, I USED TO DREAM
ABOUT BECOMING A KNIGHT SABER,

300
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,541
BUT SINCE I'VE DONE THAT,

301
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,291
I MAINLY DREAM
ABOUT STAYING ALIVE, I GUESS.

302
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,958
- ( both laugh )

303
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,833
- UH, WHERE DID PRISS GO?

304
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,333
- SHE'S GONE.

305
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:09,250
- UM, HEY.

306
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,625
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
YOU DID GOOD.

307
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,541
EVEN THOUGH YOU
LOOK LIKE A BIKE,

308
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,750
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY A BOOMER.

309
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,458
I'M SORRY
YOU GOT ALL BANGED UP LIKE THIS.

310
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,125
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD
TALKING TO YOU.

311
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,041
MAYBE IF WE'D ALL TRIED
TO COMMUNICATE A LITTLE BETTER,

312
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,875
WE WOULDN'T BE IN THE SITUATION
WE'RE IN NOW.

313
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,958
GOD KNOWS WE HUMANS
AREN'T THE EASIEST PEOPLE

314
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,791
TO GET ALONG WITH.

315
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,666
AND TO BE HONEST, I GUESS
I'VE GOT A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

316
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,666
FOR ALL THE BITCHING
AND MOANING I'VE DONE,

317
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,958
YOU AND MY HARDSUIT
HAVE NEVER LET ME DOWN.

318
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,791
THANKS.

319
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,041
- ( beeping )

320
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,791
- Nene: FOUR MORE HOURS
UNTIL WE ARRIVE AT THE UMBRELLA.

321
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,833
- AND WHERE IS GALATEA?

322
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,833
- I CAN TELL YOU IN A SECOND.

323
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,500
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MA'AM?

324
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,666
- HOOKING YOU
INTO THE N.S.A. NET.

325
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,500
- Both: HMM?
- FORTUNATELY FOR US,

326
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,041
THAT ANTI-GRAVITY DRIVE OF HERS
IS PRETTY SLOW.

327
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,416
I GUESS IT'S A GOOD THING
GENOM DIDN'T MAKE MISSILES.

328
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,208
- WE WILL GET THERE
BEFORE GALATEA, WON'T WE?

329
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,250
- IF WE DON'T, THEN
GOD ONLY KNOWS

330
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,166
HOW WE'RE GOING TO STOP HER.

331
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,916
- I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

332
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,416
- Boomer: EXCUSE ME?
BUT WHO IS THIS GALATEA?

333
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,333
IS SHE A NEW EXECUTIVE
IN CHARGE OF BOOMERS?

334
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,291
- THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE, ACTUALLY.

335
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,458
WAY TOO CLOSE.

336
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,875
AND IF SHE BEATS US THERE,

337
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,750
SHE'LL BECOME SOMETHING
MORE LIKE A GOD.

338
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,500
- ( Galatea laughing )

339
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,625
- ( static )

340
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,208
- JUST LOOK AT ALL THE STARS.

341
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:27,583
UP HERE BEYOND THE ATMOSPHERE,

342
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,916
THEY LOOK SO CLOSE

343
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,583
THAT YOU COULD REACH UP
AND TOUCH THEM.

344
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,958

345

346

- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040,"

347
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,250
AS GALATEA
ABSORBS THE SHOWEN PROJECT,

348
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,708
THE SABERS ARE CAUGHT
IN A DEADLY COUNTDOWN.

349
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,208
IF SUNLIGHT
STRIKES THE SOLAR COLLECTORS,

350
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,041
THE VOOMER PLAGUE
WILL BE TRANSMITTED

351
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,375
TO EVERY MACHINE ON EARTH.

352
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,375
AS THE SECONDS COUNT OFF,

353
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,333
THE KNIGHT SABERS
MUST STEEL THEMSELVES

354
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,708
FOR THE ULTIMATE CONFRONTATION

355
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:24,166
WITH BOTH GALATEA
AND THEIR OWN DOPPELGANGERS.

356
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,000
NEXT EPISODE,
"WALKING ON THE MOON."
