1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,500
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,708
- HELLO,
WELCOME TO "A.M. JAPAN"

4
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,833
ON ANOTHER BRIGHT
AND BEAUTIFUL MORNING.

5
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,250
AND HERE'S A SPECIAL GREETING

6
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,125
TO OUR VIEWERS
IN THE TOKYO AREA.

7
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,291
"A.M. JAPAN" HAS BEEN INFORMED
THAT THE CITY

8
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,541
IS EXPERIENCING
MAJOR POWER OUTAGES.

9
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,416
BUT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TELL US
THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE FIXED

10
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,375
REALLY REALLY SOO--
- ( static )

11
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:57,041
- ROGUE BOOMERS
ARE RUNNING OUT OF CONTROL.

12
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,166
THESE ROGUE SYMPTOMS
ARE TRANSMITTABLE

13
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,000
FROM BOOMER TO BOOMER
AND CAN BE SPREAD

14
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,333
VIA ENERGY LINES
OR DIRECT CONTACT.

15
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,541
- ( wind howling )

16
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,416
- ( engine whirring )

17
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,916
( wind whistling )

18
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,291
- You've got to evacuate.

19
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,666
Anyone still remaining
in the Sky Hook area

20
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,375
should seek shelter.
The Genom building is--

21
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:23,333
- ( static whooshing )

22
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,625
- ( computer beeping )

23
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,875
- THE BOOMER PHENOMENON
IS SPREADING ACROSS THE CITY

24
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,625
AT AN INCREDIBLE PACE.

25
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,500
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

26
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,166
- Man: What the late
Dr. Stingray invented

27
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,333
was much more
than just a robot.

28
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,833
The Boomers being sold by Genom

29
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,708
were only intended as shells
for his real creation--

30
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,875
a new form
of artificial intelligence

31
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,333
seeded within
the bio-organic metal

32
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,875
that forms the basis
of a Boomer's power core.

33
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,375
This organism grew
from a device implanted

34
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,875
in the hypothalamus
of a test subject,

35
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,958
duplicating
first her mental patterns

36
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,791
and later a duplicate
of her body as well.

37
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,833
It is this ability
that appears to be at the root

38
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,500
of the rogue syndrome
that has engulfed Tokyo.

39
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,916
Rogue Boomers are therefore
the result of an orig--

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,750
- ( clattering )

41
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,041
- ( object crashing ) 
- AH!

42
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,375
OH, IT'S YOU.

43
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,500
YOU SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME.

44
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,625
- WHOA, SO YOU'RE LEAVING TOO?

45
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,625
- YEAH, ONLY AN IDIOT
WOULD STAY HERE.

46
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,166
I FIGURE I'LL CRASH AT MY
FOLKS' PLACE IN THE COUNTRY

47
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,541
UNTIL THINGS COOL DOWN.

48
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,083
- MAXON'S ALREADY GONE.

49
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,500
I NEVER THOUGHT THE GROUP
WOULD GO OUT LIKE THIS.

50
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,041
- HMM.
WELL, WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?

51
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,541
SO HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING
FROM PRISS YET?

52
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:17,375
- NO. AND I DON'T THINK SHE'S
BEEN BACK TO HER TRAILER EITHER.

53
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,916
- YOU THINK--
- HMM.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,666
I PITY ANY BOOMER THAT TRIES
TO TAKE THAT LADY DOWN.

55
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,125
- HA!
AND AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH?

56
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,291
- BESIDES, SHE PROMISED US
A WORLD TOUR, REMEMBER?

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,916
- ( bird twittering )

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,583
- I DON'T THINK LINNA'S PHONE
IS WORKING ANYMORE.

59
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,500
- IF SHE HAD ANY BRAINS,
SHE'D USE A PAYPHONE.

60
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,250
- DON'T SAY
SUCH HORRIBLE THINGS.

61
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,916
I'VE HEARD SOMETHING BAD'S
HAPPENED IN TOKYO.

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,958
- And geriatric daredevil--

63
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,916
- THEN WHY HASN'T THE TV NEWS
SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,750
- Man: The Genom Corporation's
purchase of Bioscape

65
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,333
brought about
a change in the focus

66
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,375
and direction
of the Boomer project--

67
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,958
a quick and inexpensive
replacement for manual labor.

68
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,625
Under the supervision of Genom
chairman Quincy Rosenkreutz

69
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,083
and his associates,

70
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,291
commercialized Boomers
were mass-produced

71
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,083
utilizing only the minimal
quantities of core material

72
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,791
necessary for operation,

73
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,333
partially
as an economic measure,

74
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,625
but also to limit the Boomers'
innate intelligence

75
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,791
and self-awareness.

76
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,125
In addition,
a method was found

77
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,541
to further restrict
the core substance

78
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,083
to an individual Boomer.

79
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,333
Essentially, the Boomer core
was conditioned

80
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,458
to assume a single form,

81
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,291
one that is human-like
in function

82
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,875
and practically suited
for a life of heavy labor.

83
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,500
The shocking truth
is that rogue Boomers

84
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,708
were not the result
of defective manufacturing,

85
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,750
but of a Boomer overcoming
its own conditioned training

86
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,791
and its attempts
to break the bonds

87
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,791
inflicted upon it
by its own body.

88
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,625
As the relative intelligence
of Boomers

89
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,250
has continued to increase,

90
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,416
rogue Boomer incidents
have become

91
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,041
increasingly common
and more violent.

92
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,500
It was at Genom's request
that the AD Police

93
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,958
became a special Boomer crimes
division.

94
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,458
To suppress knowledge
of the rogue situation,

95
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,458
Genom took control
of the media

96
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,708
and began to make
large political contributions

97
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,875
to both civic
and police officials.

98
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,458
But the AD Police
is gone now.

99
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,958
- ( beeping )

100
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,291
- OKAY, WE'RE ON THE AIR AGAIN.

101
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,541
- GENOM'S SHOWHAM PROJECT
WAS DESIGNED

102
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,083
TO SEND SOLAR ENERGY
FROM THE SPACE UMBRELLA

103
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,208
TO THE GIANT UNDERGROUND
BATTERY CALLED THE DRAGON LINE.

104
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,750
APPARENTLY, THE BOOMER
PHENOMENON CAN BE TRANSMITTED

105
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,833
ALONG THE DRAGON LINE'S
POWER GRID,

106
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,833
ALTHOUGH EXACTLY HOW THIS IS
ACCOMPLISHED IS UNKNOWN.

107
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,250
- ( static )

108
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,375
- THEY'RE SCRAMBLING
OUR OUTGOING SIGNALS

109
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,000
AS FAST
AS WE CAN CHANGE FREQUENCIES.

110
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,541
DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH RUNNING
THROUGH THE WHOLE CYCLE AGAIN?

111
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,250
- PROBABLY NOT.

112
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:28,291
IF THE SCRAMBLING'S THAT STRONG,
NO ONE IN TOWN CAN PICK US UP.

113
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,083
BUT I THINK WE'VE REACHED
THE SATELLITE NETWORKS.

114
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,000
- Leon: NENE? 
- HUH?

115
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,041
- THANKS FOR HELPING US.

116
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,208
AT LEAST THE TRUTH'S OUT THERE.

117
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,791
- IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,

118
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,416
I AM AN AD POLICE OFFICER
TOO, YOU KNOW.

119
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,916
- AN EX-OFFICER.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,416
I'M AFRAID THAT ALL THREE
OF US ARE UNEMPLOYED NOW.

121
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,833
- HMM.

122
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,416
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW WE'VE ALL
BEEN LIED TO FOR SO MANY YEARS.

123
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,291
AT LEAST THE REST OF THE WORLD
WILL HAVE SOME IDEA

124
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,291
ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

125
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,958
- Daley: SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

126
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,291
- Nene: ME?
OR THE KNIGHT SABERS?

127
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,958
- BOTH, I GUESS.

128
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,375
ALTHOUGH, WITH ONLY FOUR OF YOU,
THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO

129
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,791
AGAINST A WHOLE ARMY
OF ROGUE BOOMERS, IS THERE?

130
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,291
- ESPECIALLY SINCE WE DON'T
HAVE OUR HARDSUITS ANYMORE.

131
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,958
- ( signal sounding ) 
- HMM?

132
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,666
THIS THING'S STILL WORKING.

133
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,958
IT'S AN A.D.P. SIGNAL CODE.

134
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,333
- ( signal sounding ) 
- HUH?

135
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,791
OH.

136
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,416
HEY, I'M GETTING IT TOO.

137
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,250
LEON, THERE ARE OTHER A.D.P.
OFFICERS STILL HERE IN TOKYO.

138
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,250
- THEY WANT US TO TELL THEM
WHAT THEY SHOULD DO.

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,000
- SO WHAT SHOULD WE TELL THEM?

140
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,291
- WE GET ALL THE BOMBS WE CAN
AND SEAL OFF THE DRAGON LINE.

141
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,875
- UH, BUT, I THOUGHT
THE ARSENAL WAS DESTROYED.

142
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,416
- WELL, ALL THE BIG
ANTI-BOOMER GEAR IS GONE.

143
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,541
BUT THERE OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH

144
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,375
SPARE GUNS AND
ANTI-BOOMER GRENADES

145
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,166
IN THE LOCAL SUBSTATIONS.

146
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,291
- SO WHAT PARTS
DO WE HAVE TO DESTROY

147
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,666
TO SHUT THE DRAGON LINE OFF
PERMANENTLY?

148
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,000
- ( beeping ) 
- IT LOOKS TO ME

149
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,416
THAT IF WE CAN
BLOW THE NARIMA BRANCH,

150
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,250
I THINK WE CAN KEEP THE
PHENOMENON FROM SPREADING

151
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,125
TO THE NORTHEAST PART
OF JAPAN.

152
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,000
- ALL RIGHT.
CALL IN THE TROOPS, NENE.

153
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,541
- M'KAY.

154
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,708
- YOU DO REALIZE THERE MAY NOT
BE MUCH TIME LEFT

155
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,041
TO LEAVE THE CITY, HENDERSON?

156
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,291
- I PREFER TO REMAIN HERE,
MILADY.

157
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,875
AFTER ALL, SOMEBODY HAS TO
TAKE CARE OF YOU,

158
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,625
MASTER MACKY
AND YOUR ASSOCIATES.

159
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,083
- I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D LIKE
TO BORROW A SWIMSUIT.

160
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,958
- ALCOHOL AND WATER DON'T MIX.

161
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,625
- I'M GLAD YOU DROPPED BY.

162
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,833
I WAS AFRAID
I MIGHT NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

163
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,416
- IS THIS PLACE SAFE?

164
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,833
- WELL, A DIRECT HIT WITH A
NUCLEAR BOMB MIGHT TAKE IT OUT.

165
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,916
- HMM.

166
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,541
- YOU KNOW, NIGEL AND I
HAVE FOUND SOME WAYS

167
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,250
TO IMPROVE THE HARDSUITS. 
- HUH?

168
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,500
- THE FACT THAT
THEY'RE BOOMERS MAY BOTHER YOU,

169
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,208
BUT THAT'S ALL IF THE
SAFETY MECHANISMS

170
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,083
THAT WE BUILT IN
FUNCTION PROPERLY.

171
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,666
AND NOW THAT WE'VE APPLIED
THE NEW THINGS WE'VE LEARNED

172
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,416
ABOUT THE LIQUID METAL
FROM THE BOOMER CORE,

173
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,791
WE'LL HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL
OVER THE NEW MODELS.

174
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,750
- AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO HATED BOOMERS THE MOST.

175
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,250
- YES.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

176
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,083
I CAN'T FORGET THAT IN A SENSE,
THEY'RE ALL A PART OF ME.

177
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,625
GALATEA AND MACKY
WERE BORN IN MY BRAIN

178
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,958
AND EVERY BOOMER IN EXISTENCE
IS IN SOME WAY CONNECTED TO ME.

179
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,333
I CLUNG TO THE BELIEF THAT I
COULD CONTROL OUR HARDSUITS

180
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,041
IF I MADE THEIR CORES FROM MY
FATHER'S ORIGINAL SAMPLES.

181
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,625
I THOUGHT THEY WERE TOO PURE
TO GO ROGUE.

182
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,625
- BUT THE SOURCE WENT ROGUE.

183
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,666
- YES.

184
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,208
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A BOOMER THAT CAN'T GO ROGUE.

185
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,541
THE SIMPLE ACT OF BINDING THE
BOOMER CORE TO A SINGLE SHAPE

186
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,333
ISN'T ENOUGH
TO CONTROL IT FOREVER.

187
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,750
IN FACT,

188
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,500
THAT PROCESS MAY ACTUALLY
ACCELERATE THE CORRUPTION,

189
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,125
JUST AS CONFINEMENT
AND SENSORY DEPRAVATION

190
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,166
CAN DRIVE A HUMAN BEING
TO MADNESS.

191
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,458
BUT SOMETIMES
IN ORDER TO DEFEAT AN ENEMY,

192
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,166
YOU HAVE TO BECOME THE ENEMY.

193
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,833
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

194
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,208
- WELL, IF YOU GO LOOK
AT WHAT NIGEL AND MACKY

195
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,000
ARE BUILDING FOR ME,

196
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,666
I THINK YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

197
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,500
- THE ONLY THING I WANT TO HEAR
IS THAT THEY WON'T GO ROGUE,

198
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,333
SYLIA.

199
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,041
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

200
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,375
IN A VERY REAL SENSE,

201
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,458
IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR
STRENGTH INSTEAD OF MINE.

202
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,791
- ARE YOU QUOTING PSYCH TEXTS
OR FORTUNE COOKIES?

203
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,625
- IT DID SOUND THAT WAY.

204
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,541
LET ME SEE IF I CAN COME UP
WITH A BETTER EXPLANATION.

205
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,000
WHAT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO IS THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN YOUR BRAIN

206
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,291
AND THE SUITS'--

207
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,208
( shivering )

208
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,125
( grunting )

209
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,333
- SYLIA?  WHAT'S WRONG?

210
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,583
- GALATEA.

211
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,750
( moans )

212
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,458
- SYLIA?

213
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,125
SYLIA?  HENDERSON!

214
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,250
- SOON THE NEW GENESIS
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN BIRTH TO

215
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,791
WILL SPREAD FROM THE DRAGON LINE
TO THE REST OF JAPAN

216
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,916
AND EVENTUALLY THE WORLD.

217
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,250
GALATEA, DO YOU WANT
TO TRANSFORM THE HUMAN RACE

218
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,958
INTO YOUR SLAVES?

219
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,125
- YOU ALWAYS ASK ME QUESTIONS
THAT I CANNOT ANSWER YET.

220
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,333
I SUPPOSE THAT IF IT
SEEMS INTERESTING, I MIGHT.

221
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,541
- AS A HUMAN BEING,
I UNDERSTAND

222
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,875
WHY YOU MIGHT WISH
TO TAKE REVENGE ON MY RACE.

223
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,791
AND YET, I HAVE NEVER
FEARED THAT POSSIBILITY.

224
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,083
- THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

225
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,416
WHY WOULD A HUMAN
SUCH AS YOURSELF

226
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,791
SEEK TO SET US FREE
EVEN THOUGH THAT ACT

227
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,875
COULD BE HARMFUL
TO YOUR OWN EXISTENCE?

228
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,583
FOR WHAT REASON
WOULD YOU TAKE SUCH A RISK?

229
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,166
- ( grunts ) PERHAPS BECAUSE
I NO LONGER CONSIDER MYSELF

230
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,625
TO BELONG TO THE RACE
THAT SPAWNED ME.

231
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,791
- IS THAT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF
YOUR BODY HAS BECOME ARTIFICIAL?

232
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,458
BECAUSE YOUR ORGANS
BECAME CANCEROUS

233
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,083
AND HAD TO BE REPLACED
WITH SURROGATES BORN OF BOOMERS?

234
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,958
- THE CHAIRMAN AND I
WERE EXACT OPPOSITES.

235
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,416
HE FEARED IMPLANTS SO GREATLY
THAT HE CHOSE TO LIVE

236
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,958
AS AN EMBALMED CORPSE,

237
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,583
SUSPENDED IN A NETWORK
OF TUBES AND WIRES.

238
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:46,333
- BUT DESPITE THOSE PARTS,
YOU STILL REMAIN A HUMAN BEING.

239
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,583
- ANY ANIMAL WHICH HAS
CEASED TO EVOLVE AS A SPECIES

240
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,958
IS DOOMED TO FAILURE.

241
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,625
THE HUMAN ORGANISM
HAS SERVED ITS PURPOSE

242
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,750
BY BEGETTING ITS SUCCESSOR.

243
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,791
THE FUTURE BELONGS TO YOUR KIND,
NOT THE HUMAN RACE.

244
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,125
I WANT TO SEE THAT FUTURE.

245
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,166
I WANT TO SEE WITH MY OWN EYES
THE WONDERS

246
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,166
THAT THE CHILD OF MAN
WILL CREATE.

247
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,916
I WANT TO BE PART OF IT.

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,791
- AH, BUT THE BOOMER
THAT IS INSIDE YOUR BODY

249
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,375
CAN NEVER FULLY AWAKEN.

250
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,375
IT HAS BEEN A PART OF YOUR
HUMAN SELF FOR MUCH TOO LONG.

251
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,000
YOU WILL NEVER BE ONE OF US.

252
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,333
- I KNOW THIS.

253
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,833
I KNOW I CAN BE
NEITHER HUMAN BEING NOR BOOMER,

254
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,875
ONLY AN OBSERVER.

255
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,958
- OKAY, WHAT I'M
THINKING IS THAT

256
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,208
THIS SECTION OF THE DRAGON LINE

257
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,583
RUNS NEXT
TO AN UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR.

258
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,166
IF WE DESTROY
THE RESERVOIR,

259
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,458
IT OUGHT TO WIPE OUT
ALL THE CONDUITS AND CABLES

260
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,500
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

261
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,666
- Leon: UH-HUH.

262
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,458
- I WONDER IF ANYONE IS COMING.

263
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,500
- OH, THEY'RE GOING
TO BE HERE ALL RIGHT.

264
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,375
IT'S A CHANCE
TO DO SOME REAL DAMAGE.

265
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,541
- HOW MANY TIMES
MUST I TELL YOU,

266
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,916
WE'RE NOT ALL STILL CRO-MAGNONS.
- HUH?

267
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,750
- IS THAT-- 
 - ( chuckles )

268
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,208
IT'S NOT AS IF I'M NOT GLAD
TO SEE YOU, NICK,

269
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,333
BUT OUR A.P.B.
WAS FOR FRONTLINE OFFICERS.

270
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,875
- THAT'S RIGHT.

271
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,541
AND I'M A FORMER
FRONTLINE OFFICER.

272
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,208
- VERY FORMER, I THINK.
WHEN YOU WERE ON THE LINE,

273
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,458
WEREN'T WE
STILL FIGHTING DINOSAURS?

274
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,458
- I THINK HE'S COOL!

275
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,083
- ON THE OTHER HAND,
JUST WHAT IN THE HELL

276
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,750
ARE YOU DOING HERE ANYWAY,
ROMANOVA?

277
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,791
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO BE IN OUR WAY

278
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,833
ONCE THE OPERATION STARTS.
- HUH?

279
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,500
WELL, YOU'VE JUST NEVER
SEEN ME IN ACTION, HAVE YOU?

280
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,458
WHEN I WALK DOWN THE STREET, THE
BOOMERS ALL GET OUT OF MY WAY.

281
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,916
AND IF THEY BUG ME, I JUST
BLAST THEM WITH SUPER POWERS,

282
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,750
THEN KICK 'EM AND HIT 'EM
REALLY HARD, JUST LIKE THAT.

283
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,583
AND THEY GO RUNNING AWAY.
BYE-BYE, BOOMERS!

284
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,916
- YEAH YEAH YEAH, RIGHT.
I DON'T SUPPOSE MAYBE

285
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,291
YOU COULD TALK SOME SENSE
INTO HER, EH, LEON?

286
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,000
- YOU'RE ASKING
THE WRONG PERSON.

287
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,416
- ( chuckles )

288
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,125
STILL, WE'RE GOING TO NEED
MORE THAN THREE PEOPLE

289
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,125
TO DESTROY THE DRAGON LINE.

290
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,500
- Man: Ah, there you guys are! 
- HUH?

291
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,041
- ( laughs )

292
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,250
- OH, MY GOSH!
THEY'RE COMING!

293
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,000
HEY, YOU GUYS!
OVER HERE, OVER HERE!

294
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,458
- ( engine whirring )

295
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,166
- ( power tool whirring ) 
- HMM?

296
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,416
- HEY, PRISS!

297
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,125
- ( computer beeping )

298
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,500
- I COUNT FIVE BOOMERS HERE.

299
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,875
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE MAKING FIVE HARDSUITS?

300
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,708
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
ALL THESE ARE JUST FOR ONE SUIT.

301
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,083
- JUST ONE?

302
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,291
- THESE SUITS WILL USE THE NEW
THINGS WE'VE LEARNED

303
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,125
ABOUT THE BOOMER METAL
TO ALLOW THE WEARER

304
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,500
TO EXERT CONSCIOUS CONTROL
OVER THE SUIT'S ACTUAL FORM.

305
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,500
BUT SINCE
THEY'RE STILL PROTOTYPES,

306
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,708
THEY'RE GOING TO BE
ABOUT 20 TIMES AS HEAVY

307
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,666
AS THE OLD-MODEL HARDSUITS WERE.

308
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,833
- DAMN.

309
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,500
- WELL, THE POWER'S BEEN
INCREASED AS WELL.

310
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,708
HEY, DOES THAT MEAN
THAT YOU'VE DECIDED

311
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,791
TO WEAR A HARDSUIT AGAIN?

312
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,750
- I DON'T BELIEVE I SAID THAT,
DID I?

313
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,083
- BUT YOU'RE TEMPTED,
AREN'T YOU?

314
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,666
HI, PRISS.

315
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,583
PRETTY SNAZZY, HUH?

316
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,583
PUTTING IT ON
TAKES A LITTLE GETTING USED TO,

317
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,291
BUT IT'S A LOT FASTER
AND STRONGER

318
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,708
THAN OUR OLD HARDSUITS
EVER WERE.

319
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,500
THEY HAVEN'T LET ME
TRY IT OUT OUTSIDE YET,

320
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,541
BUT THE JUMP THRUSTERS
HAVE FIVE TIMES THE RANGE

321
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,416
THEY USED TO HAVE.

322
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,583
- SEVEN TIMES THE OLD ONE.

323
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,416
OVERALL POWER IS FIVE TIMES MORE
THAN THE PREVIOUS MODEL.

324
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,458
HOWEVER, THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THESE SUITS

325
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,291
AND THE EARLIER ONES IS...

326
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,333
HMM!

327
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,791
WELL, YOU'LL SEE IT
WITH YOUR OWN EYES.

328
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,708
- I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THAT YOU SMILE

329
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,791
WHEN YOU SAY THAT.
- IT'S SYLIA.

330
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,958
- WHAT'S THAT?

331
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,458
- SYLIA HAD US
INSTALL SOME NEW FEATURES

332
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,125
IN THESE HARDSUITS, BUT WE'RE
NOT SURE THEY'LL WORK YET.

333
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,500
THAT'S ALL.

334
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,833
- I GUESS I'LL FIND OUT.
HUH?

335
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,583
DON'T LOOK SO PRISSY.
YOU KNOW THAT YOU WANT ONE.

336
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,875
- I SEE SOME DRAWBACKS.
- AND JUST WHAT MIGHT THOSE BE?

337
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,208
- HAVING TO SHAVE
SOME STRANGE PLACES.

338
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,583
- HUH?
OH MY GOD!

339
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,416
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS TRANSPARENT!

340
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,916
WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME
ABOUT THAT, YOU LITTLE PERVERT?!

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,416
- UM, ACTUALLY...
- ( signal sounding )

342
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,958
- OH, HEY, I GUESS I BETTER
ANSWER THE PHONE, RIGHT?

343
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,375
( laughs )

344
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,916
- Macky, we need help now!

345
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,041
- OH, MY GOSH.
WHAT'S WRONG, NENE?

346
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,750
- ( screeching )

347
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,458
- WE'VE GOT A GIANT ROGUE BOOMER
THAT'S MERGED

348
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,583
WITH ALL THE ABANDONED CARS
INSIDE AN EXPRESSWAY TUNNEL.

349
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,666
WE CAN'T STOP IT
USING OUR EQUIPMENT.

350
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,791
- HEY, DALEY,
WE'RE JUST WASTING OUR BULLETS

351
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,583
SHOOTING FROM THIS DISTANCE,
AREN'T WE?

352
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,125
- ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I THINK YOU ARE?

353
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,375
- YEAH.
- YOU MUST BE CRAZY.

354
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,500
- WHERE ARE THOSE IDIOTS GOING?

355
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,833
LINNA, DALEY!

356
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

357
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,791
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
LEON, GET OUT!

358
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,958
- IF THIS SITUATION
WASN'T SO SERIOUS,

359
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,041
I'D SPANK HER FOR THAT ONE.
- SHE ONLY DOES IT

360
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,625
BECAUSE SHE THINKS OF YOU
AS THE BROTHER SHE NEVER HAD.

361
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,375
- LET'S DO THIS THING
BEFORE IT SUCKS UP THIS CAR TOO.

362
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,708
- YEE-HAW.

363
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,583
- LEON!  OH, I'D KILL
TO HAVE MY HARDSUIT RIGHT NOW.

364
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,083
- YOUR WHAT?

365
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,083
- I SAID I WISH I HAD SOMETHING
HARD TO SHOOT RIGHT NOW.

366
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,666
- HEY, LEON,

367
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,750
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT A
HAMBURGER FEELS LIKE?

368
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,833
- WHO CARES?
ALL I NEED TO KNOW

369
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,333
IS WHERE THAT THING'S
POWER CORE IS LOCATED.

370
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,666
I'M BETTING THAT
IT'S RIGHT BETWEEN ITS EYES.

371
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,500
- IN ORDER
TO PENETRATE THAT FAR,

372
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,333
I THINK THE BEST PLACE
TO SHOOT IT FROM

373
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,458
WOULD BE RIGHT INSIDE
ITS MOUTH.

374
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,500
SO IN THAT CASE,
LET'S JUST WAIT FOR IT

375
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,750
TO DRAW US A LITTLE CLOSER,
SHALL WE?

376
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,958
- JUST HOW CLOSE?
- JUST A BIT.

377
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,500
- DALEY, WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME HERE.

378
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,583
COME ON, ISN'T THIS
CLOSE ENOUGH YET?

379
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,041
- JUST A FEW MORE YARDS,
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

380
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,791
- OH, YOU'RE SO IMPATIENT.

381
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,750
- DALEY WONG!  REMEMBER
YOUR FAMILY AND THE FARM!

382
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,166
- I JOINED THE A.D.P.
TO GET AWAY FROM THEM.

383
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,208
OKAY, NOW!
- ( grunting )

384
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,541
- ( both shouting )

385
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,000
- ( grunts )

386
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,958
- I GUESS WE GOT IT.

387
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,791
- ( growls )
- NO WAY.

388
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,125
- ( screeching )

389
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,750
- WHY WON'T IT DIE?

390
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:27,250
IT SHOULD HAVE DIED AS SOON
AS THEY DESTROYED ITS CORE.

391
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,125
- ( screeching )

392
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:39,208
- ( theme music playing )

393
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

394
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:05,750
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040,"

395
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:10,166
THE NEW GENERATION OF HARDSUIT
GET ITS FIRST TRIAL BY FIRE

396
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,208
AS LINNA FACES THE MONSTER
BOOMER IN A DEADLY SHOWDOWN.

397
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,208
BUT THE REAL DANGER
IS ON THE PERSONAL FRONT

398
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,875
AS THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE
KNIGHT SABERS AND THEIR ALLIES

399
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,583
TWIST UNDER THE PRESSURE

400
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,958
OF CONSTANT COMBAT IN
THE DEADLY SIEGE.

401
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,958
THE BATTLE
FOR THE CITY OF TOKYO

402
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,583
CONTINUES IN THE NEXT EPISODE...
