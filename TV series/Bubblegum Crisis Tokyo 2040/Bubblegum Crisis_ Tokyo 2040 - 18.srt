1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,125
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,291
- Daley: WHAT?  HOW CAN YOU
TALK ABOUT THE STRIKE

3
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,833
AT A TIME LIKE THIS? 
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

4
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,916
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT LITTLE
PHRASE "TO SERVE AND PROTECT"?

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,958
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU NEED TO BE RESCUED.

6
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:55,083
WHAT THE-- THEY HUNG UP!
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THOSE

7
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,916
UNION JERKS, DALEY.
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH MEN

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,166
TO HANDLE THIS
ALL BY OURSELVES.

9
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,083
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MEN?
- All: YES, SIR!

10
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,833
- REMEMBER, IF ANY OF YOU
GET SEPARATED DOWN THERE,

11
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,833
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET UP WITH
LEON AT THE MAIN LOADING DOCK.

12
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,375
- Daley: OKAY, SPARKS AND HIS
MEN ARE IN THE SEWERS NOW.

13
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,916
I'M GUESSING THAT IT WILL TAKE
TEN MINUTES FOR THEM

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,875
TO REACH THE BASE
OF THE TOTEM POLE.

15
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,416
- ROGER.  WE'LL MEET UP
WITH THEM INSIDE.

16
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,916
- FIRE!

17
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,416
- KEEP THE ENTRANCE CLEAR WHILE
WE SCOUT OUT THE FIRST LEVEL.

18
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,833
- RIGHT, SIR.

19
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,666
- HEY, GET BACK HERE!

20
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,625
HOLD UP.
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE ALONE.

21
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,416
- WHICH WAY NOW?
- FORGET ABOUT UP.

22
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,083
IF ANYONE'S STILL IN HERE,
THEY'RE PROBABLY

23
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,416
ON THE LOWER LEVELS.  THAT'S
WHERE ALL OF THE OFFICES ARE.

24
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
UPSTAIRS, THERE'S NOTHING
BUT COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT

25
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,958
AND COOLING SYSTEMS
FOR THE TOTEM POLE.

26
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,750
DO YOU REALLY WANNA TRY
TO FIND NENE ALL BY YOURSELF?

27
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,208
- GET OFF.

28
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,458
- ( pounding )

29
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,375
- ( gasps )

30
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,416
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

31
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,791
( screams )

32
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,583
- Man: HEY, ROMANOVA,
IS THAT YOU?

33
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,125
- Nene:
HUH?

34
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,125
OH, MY GOD, A K-SUIT!

35
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,750
MR. ROLAND, IS THAT YOU?

36
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,958
- I HAD THIS UP
IN THE MAINTENANCE CENTER.

37
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,750
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S THE ONLY
ONE.  ARE YOU OKAY?

38
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,208
- YOU ALMOST MADE ME RUIN
MY UNDERWEAR

39
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,125
WITH THAT THING.

40
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,125
- DON'T JUST STAND THERE.
DUCK, ROMANOVA.

41
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,125
- UH-OH.
( screaming )

42
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,583
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

43
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,125
I'M IN THE FRAY,
HEADED INTO THE FIRE.

44
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,875
- HEY, ROLAND,
I'M GETTING LOW!

45
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,833
- RIGHT, PULL BACK.

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,291
- THIS IS AS LOW
AS THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR GOES.

47
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:41,250
- WHERE NOW?
- THEY'RE PROBABLY IN--

48
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,583
THIS IS NUTS.
THEY JUST KEEP COMING.

49
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,416
- UM, SIR.

50
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,958
- OH, MY GOD.
WE'VE BEEN FLANKED.

51
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,333
- IT'S ALL OVER.

52
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,416
- OH, MY GOD.  PRISS!

53
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,000
- LEON, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

54
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,458
- PRISS, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
CAME FOR ME.

55
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,333
- NICK, WE BLEW OUT THE DOOR
TO THE MAIN LOADING DOCK.

56
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,458
WE CAN EVACUATE EVERYONE
VIA THE FREIGHT ELEVATORS.

57
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,416
IS THIS ALL THERE IS?

58
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,458
- KID.

59
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,958
- PRISS, TAKE NENE
AND CLEAR A PATH FOR US.

60
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,416
- COME ON, MOVE YOUR ASS,
NENE.

61
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,541
- RIGHT.

62
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,333
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING
OKAY FOR SOMEONE YOUR AGE, NICK.

63
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,750
- QUIT BROWN-NOSING, LEON.

64
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,041
- ARE THOSE STAIRS CLEAR?

65
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,041
- I'M CHECKING.

66
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,791
( screams )

67
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,333
- ENOUGH, SIR!

68
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,958
- ( snarls )

69
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,250
- WHAT'S THAT?

70
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,916
- Leon:
NICK, IT'S ON YOUR BACK.

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,416
- IT'S WHAT?

72
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,666
- YOU'LL HAVE TO
SHAKE IT OFF OF YOU SOMEHOW.

73
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,458
I'M TOO CLOSE TO SHOOT
THAT THING OFF SAFELY.

74
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,666
- ( laughing )

75
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,541
- HOLD ON.
- GET OUT OF THAT K-SUIT.

76
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,416
THAT BOOMER'S FUSING WITH IT.

77
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,625
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

78
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,250
DAMN IT, I CAN'T GET THE HATCH
ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK TO BLOW.

79
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,416
- ( laughing )

80
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,083
- STOP LAUGHING.

81
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,791
- GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY, ROLAND.
- RIGHT.

82
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,666
HERE IT COMES!  ( screams )

83
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,791
- WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF AMMO.

84
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,208
WILL YOU STOP PLAYING
AND GET WITH THE PROGRAM?

85
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,208
- ( grunts ) OH, SURE.

86
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,666
THIS'LL JUST BE A WALTZ
IN THE PARK.

87
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,458
WELL, COME ON, DAMN IT!

88
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:26,125
LET'S GET MOVING.
AND BY THE WAY, THANKS.

89
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,000
- ( engine revving )

90
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,000
- I HOPE YOU'VE GOT
A REAL GOOD GRIP ON ME.

91
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,333
'CAUSE I'M NOT STOPPING.

92
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,541
- ( shouting )

93
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,250
- ( growls )

94
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,375
- NENE.
- MOVE YOUR ASS!

95
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,000
- ( gasps )

96
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,333
- WELL, COME ON.

97
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,583
- THANKS, GUYS.
- LEON-POO CAN BE SO COOL.

98
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,625
- ( growling )

99
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,125
- LEAVE THE BIKE.

100
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,083
- ( grunting )

101
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,125
- DAMN IT.
- ( screaming )

102
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,583
- GET READY TO CLOSE IT.

103
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,958
SAFE.

104
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,916
OH!

105
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,458
UH...

106
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,416
- ( squealing )

107
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,083
- HARUMA.
- HUH?  OKAY.

108
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,500
IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH.

109
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,750
THEY'RE JUST ABSORBING
THE BULLETS.

110
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,958
- ( glass shatters )
- OH!

111
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,833
THERE'S NO WAY.

112
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,166
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK
AND FIND ANOTHER WAY OUT.

113
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,333
- Daley: WHAT?  WHAT DO YOU
MEAN NOBODY'S THERE?

114
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,666
- Man: THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CUT OFF.

115
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,208
BUT WE'VE GOT THE MASTER
POWER GRID SECURED.

116
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,333
- OKAY, TURN IT ON.
( sighs )

117
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,208
- ( electricity crackles )

118
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,125
- WELL, AT LEAST THE LIGHTS
ARE BACK ON.

119
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,083
- SPARKS GROUP MUST HAVE
RESTORED THE POWER.

120
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,125
- DOES ANYBODY ELSE THINK
GOING DOWN'S A BAD IDEA?

121
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,416
- YEAH, I DO.

122
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,875
I GUESS THE ONLY WAY
TO GO IS UP.

123
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,416
- IS ANYONE ELSE COLD?

124
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,375
- IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS UP HERE.

125
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,375
THAT'S THE LIQUID NITROGEN TANK
THAT COOLS

126
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,958
THE ADP COMMUNICATIONS TOWER.

127
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:49,333
- LIQUID NITROGEN.
NO WONDER I'VE GOT GOOSE BUMPS

128
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,708
ON MY GOOSE BUMPS.

129
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,916
I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET MY HANDS
ON THE IDIOT

130
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,083
WHO PUT A MINISKIRT
ON A COP'S UNIFORM.

131
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:59,041
- WOULD YOU REALLY WANNA DEPRIVE
US POOR OLD FOSSILS

132
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,416
OF ONE LAST CHANCE TO SEE A LEG
WITHOUT VARICOSE VEINS?

133
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,416
IF YOU WANNA BLAME SOMEONE,
BLAME THE IDIOTS WHO INSTALLED

134
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,083
A COMMUNICATIONS TOWER
THAT'S 100 TIMES MORE POWERFUL

135
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,250
THAN WE'LL EVER NEED.

136
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,750
- WHAT IN THE HELL?  WHY ARE
ALL THE BOOMERS GOING UP?

137
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,666
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

138
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,666
COMMANDER SPARKS, ARE YOU
SURE THIS DATA'S ACCURATE?

139
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,666
- IT'S ACCURATE.

140
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,750
- Leon: DALEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
- HUH?

141
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,583
- LEON, WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

142
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,708
- WE'RE INSIDE
THE COMMUNICATIONS TOWER.

143
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,958
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE NOT ALONE.

144
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,291
- WHAT?!

145
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,250
EVERY BOOMER IN THE PLACE
IS HEADING TOWARD YOU.

146
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,500
GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE
RIGHT NOW!

147
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,041
- WE'RE TRYING TO.

148
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,000
- NOT AGAIN.

149
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,708
- I GUESS THE LADDER'S
THE ONLY WAY.

150
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,500
- IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY WAY
LEFT TO GO IS UP.

151
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,375
DAMN IT, DALEY,
CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING?

152
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,833
- DO SOMETHING?

153
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,041
ARE YOU NUTS?
I'M ALL ALONE, YOU BIG IDIOT.

154
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,333
- ( door opens )
- HUH?

155
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,750
- OH, NOT COMPLETELY ALONE.

156
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,000
WELL, IF YOUR FRIEND
AND THE OTHERS

157
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,958
HAVE DECIDED TO GO UP,

158
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,000
I SUPPOSE THE LEAST WE CAN DO
IS TO GO UP

159
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,791
AND MEET THEM.

160
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,333
- ARE YOU WHO I THINK YOU ARE?

161
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,333
- HEY, DON'T LOOK A GIFT HORSE
IN THE MOUTH.

162
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,708
- ( laughs nervously )

163
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,125
- HUH?

164
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,083
THEY'VE STOPPED FOLLOWING US.

165
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,541
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

166
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,833
- THEY WERE NEVER
FOLLOWING US.

167
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,000
THEIR REAL TARGET MUST BE THE
CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS NEXUS.

168
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,583
FROM THERE, THEY CAN JACK
INTO EVERY COMPUTER NETWORK

169
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,000
IN THE CITY.

170
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,875
- YOU'VE GOT TO GET CLOSER.

171
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,333
- I KNOW THAT.

172
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,875
- ( groans )
HEY, WATCH IT!

173
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,375
WHERE IN THE HELL DID YOU
LEARN TO FLY THIS THING?

174
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,291
- THIS ISN'T A STUPID TAXI,
LADY.

175
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,291
- ( grunting )

176
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,083
OHH!

177
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,666
I'M SORRY, ROLAND.

178
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,916
- IF ROMANOVA'S RIGHT AND THOSE
BOOMERS ARE REALLY PLANNING

179
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,625
TO FUSE WITH
THE COMMUNICATIONS TOWER--

180
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,708
- THEN THIS WHOLE PLACE
HAS GOTTA BE FILLED WITH THEM.

181
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:56,041
OH, MY GOD.
OH, NO!

182
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,208
- HARUMA, HOW MANY BULLETS
DO YOU HAVE LEFT IN THAT THING?

183
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,166
- I HAVE 65 ROUNDS
OF BLASTERS LEFT.

184
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,375
- I THINK I'M ABOUT
TO BE BRILLIANT.

185
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,375
HEY, YANO, JUST HOW
MUCH LIQUID NITROGEN

186
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,625
IS THERE INSIDE THAT
COOLING SYSTEM?

187
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,625
- IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SAY.
IT USUALLY DEPENDS.

188
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,250
ASSUMING THAT THE CENTRAL TANK
IS FULL,

189
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,583
IT'S GOT A MAXIMUM CAPACITY
OF ABOUT 350 TONS.

190
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,625
YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF--

191
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,000
- THAT'S JUST WHAT
I'M THINKING.

192
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,583
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S GOING TO HELP ME.

193
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,750
- ME?
- OKAY, EVERYBODY,

194
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,250
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT.

195
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,291
LET'S GET A MOVE ON.

196
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,708
- OH, MY GOD, LOOK.

197
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,666
- BOOMERS.

198
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,041
- YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, LEON.
THE WHOLE TOTEM POLE

199
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,750
IS BEING FUSED.
WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

200
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,833
- WE'RE ALMOST AT THE TOP
OF THE STAIRWAY.

201
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,250
- WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
- RIGHT ABOVE YOU.

202
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,041
ARE YOU WITH ALL THE OTHERS?

203
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,291
- NOT QUITE. NICK AND DIRECTOR
YANO ARE STILL DOWN THERE.

204
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,000
- DOING WHAT?
HEY, I SEE THEM.

205
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,125
- CAN YOU SET THIS THING DOWN
ON THE ROOF?

206
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,208
- I CAN TRY.  LEON, I'M GONNA
TRY TO LAND THIS THING

207
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,833
ON THE COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM.
- ROGER THAT.

208
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,833
- ALL RIGHT!
- WAIT A SECOND.

209
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,041
LEON, TELL THEM TO BACK OFF.

210
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,041
I KNEW IT!

211
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,583
- HURRY UP, YANO.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT.

212
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,958
- I'M HURRYING.
I'M HURRYING.

213
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,958
OH, NO, DAMN IT.
I CAN'T DO THIS, ROLAND.

214
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,375
- WHAT'S WRONG?

215
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,041
- REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU
THAT THE MAIN COOLING TANK

216
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,791
HAD OVER 350 TONS
OF LIQUID HYDROGEN IN IT?

217
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,041
- SO WHAT?

218
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,083
- IN ORDER TO OPERATE
THIS CONTROL PANEL,

219
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,791
YOU NEED A CLASS 1 LICENSE,
AND I ONLY HAVE A CLASS 3.

220
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,416
- ( laughs, screaming )

221
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,500
YANO, IF YOU DON'T DO IT,
THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH OF YOU

222
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,375
LEFT TO HAVE YOUR LICENSE
REVOKED.

223
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,541
DO IT NOW!

224
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,500
- FINE.  YOU EXPLAIN IT
TO THE LICENSE BOARD.

225
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,375
- ( screaming )

226
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,083
- All:
OH, YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

227
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,625
- MOVE YOUR ASS, NICK.  WE CAN'T
HOLD 'EM OFF MUCH LONGER.

228
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,000
- WHAT ARE WE DOING
TO HOLD THEM OFF?

229
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,625
- DO IT NOW, LEON!

230
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,375
- PRISS, NENE,
ARE YOU OKAY?

231
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,750
- LINNA, MACKY.

232
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,250
- WELL, IT WORKED.
I'LL PROBABLY LOSE MY CLASS 3

233
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,041
FROZEN GASSES LICENSE
OVER THIS.

234
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,250
- I THINK THEY'LL UNDERSTAND,
YANO.

235
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,791
I GUESS THE A.D. POLICE

236
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,083
REALLY IS DEAD AND BURIED NOW.

237
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,666
- Rosenkreutz:
WELL, GENTLEMEN,

238
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,666
ARE WE IN AGREEMENT THEN?

239
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,666
- Man: WE'LL CALL
FOR A GENERAL MEETING

240
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,791
OF THE STOCKHOLDERS
IMMEDIATELY.

241
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,208
- AND NOW, MASON,

242
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,041
MY WOULD-BE KING,

243
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,250
YOU SHALL LEARN THAT
YOU ARE JUST A PAWN.

244
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,583
YOU!

245
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,416
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DESTROYED.

246
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,625
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

247
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,541
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER ME?

248
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,875
NO BOOMER CAN IGNORE
MY ORDERS.

249
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:04,250
NO, YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.

250
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:08,000
I CREATED YOU, BOOMER!

251
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:12,208
MASON!

252
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,541
- PLAY TIME NOW.

253
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,958
- ( theme music playing )

254
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:05,875
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040,"

255
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,333
THE BATTLE FOR TOKYO MOVES
ONTO THE CITY STREETS

256
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,708
AS WAVE AFTER WAVE
OF ROGUE BOOMERS

257
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,208
ARE UNLEASHED AS GALATEA'S
POWERS BEGIN TO FULLY MANIFEST.

258
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,458
THE KNIGHT SABERS FIND
THEMSELVES COMPLETELY

259
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,708
OVERWHELMED.
THEIR ONLY CHANCE--

260
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,416
A DANGEROUS NEW TYPE
OF TECHNOLOGY.

261
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,708
BUT ARE THEY READY
FOR THE RISKS INVOLVED?

262
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:28,250
NEXT EPISODE...
