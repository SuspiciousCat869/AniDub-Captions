1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,250
- GALATEA!

4
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,583
- SYLIA, WHO IS THAT GIRL?

5
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,166
- ( groans )

6
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,791
I'VE GOT A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

7
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,083
- PRISS, LINNA,
MY ARMOR'S FUSED SOLID!

8
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,791
- ( groans )
AAH!

9
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,875
( grunts )

10
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,666
EJECT YOUR BATTERIES.

11
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,458
YOUR SAFETY SYSTEMS ARE
STILL ACTIVE.

12
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,875
- I GOT IT.
( grunts )

13
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,750
( groans )
- HUH?

14
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,416
SYLIA.

15
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,625
SYLIA!

16
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,375
( grunts loudly )

17
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,750
- ( loud clanking )

18
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,375
- ( water dripping )

19
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,500
- ( girls breathing heavily )

20
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,916
- SYLIA, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,916
- THE SOTAI'S FREE.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,916
- THE SOTAI?
- SHH.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,083
- ( gasps )

24
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,708
- WAIT HERE.

25
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,458
IT'S NOT A BOOMER.

26
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,375
- COME ON, PRISS,
DON'T TAKE ANY DUMB CHANCES.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,375
- WHO'S THERE?

28
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,375
- THERE'S NOBODY DOWN HERE
BUT US RATS.

29
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,250
NOW TURN AROUND
AND GO AWAY.

30
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,583
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?!

31
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,916
- I SURE DID.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,458
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M HEARING THAT VOICE

33
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,625
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.
- ( slightly gasps ) 

34
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,875
LEON?

35
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,333
- SOMEHOW, I DON'T THINK
YOU CAME DOWN HERE

36
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,583
FOR THE ACOUSTICS, DID YOU?

37
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,791
- MAYBE I DID.

38
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,083
- UH-HUH.

39
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,125
WELL THEN , IF THAT'S TRUE,

40
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,625
THEN THAT OUTFIT'S
A LITTLE SKIMPY FOR THIS COLD.

41
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,125
UH...
( clears throat )

42
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,083
ANYWAY, BESIDES YOUR ODD
CHOICE OF CLOTHING,

43
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,750
IT'S JUST THAT
RUNNING INTO YOU DOWN HERE

44
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,000
IS A REALLY STRANGE
COINCIDENCE.

45
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,500
- WHAT I'M DOING HERE
ISN'T ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

46
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,041
- ACTUALLY, SINCE THE A.D.P.
RECEIVED A TIP

47
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,333
THAT THE KNIGHT SABERS

48
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,500
WERE INVOLVED IN THE FREEWAY
EXPLOSION, IT IS.

49
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,500
- ( gasps )

50
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,416
- ( shivering )

51
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,833
- SYLIA...

52
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,375
- SHH, QUIET.

53
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,833
- COME ON, PRISS.

54
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,625
- SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

55
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,625
CALL IN YOUR GOON SQUAD?

56
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,458
- ( sighs )

57
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,041
WELL...

58
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,958
- IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS,
IS IT?

59
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,875
- ( deeply sighs )

60
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,291
LOOK, THEY A.D. POLICE WAS
SPECIFICALLY ORDERED

61
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,958
NOT TO GET INVOLVED

62
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:54,875
WITH THIS INCIDENT.

63
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,041
I'M HERE...

64
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,791
BUT I'M NOT ON DUTY.

65
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,208
- LEON?

66
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,500
- News Reporter: THE
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED TODAY

67
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,750
THAT THE EMERGENCY CLOSURE

68
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,375
OF THE SHENI SOBE EXIT
WAS DUE TO THE REOPENING

69
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,541
OF AN UNDERGROUND FISHER

70
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,041
ORIGINALLY CAUSED
BY THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE.

71
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,916
A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
THE HIGHWAY BOARD

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,041
MADE A STATEMENT
THAT CONCRETE HAS BEEN POURED

73
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,916
INTO THE HOLE TO PREVENT
ANY FUTURE RECURRENCES. 

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,333
- ( airplanes flying overhead )

75
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,083
- GALATEA...

76
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,166
- I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

77
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,000
YOU DO REMEMBER ME, DON'T YOU?

78
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,750
YOU'RE NOT AN EMPTY-HEADED
GOLEM LIKE ALL THE OTHERS.

79
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,375
YOU'RE THE SOTAI,

80
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,083
THE FOUNTAINHEAD FROM WHICH
ALL ELSE WILL SPRING.

81
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,041
BUT I CAN'T JUST
CALL YOU THE SOTAI.

82
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,625
WHAT WAS IT THAT
SYLIA STINGRAY CALLED YOU?

83
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,791
GALATEA?
CAN I CALL YOU THAT?

84
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,875
GOOD-- FOR I HAVE
GREAT PLANS FOR YOU.

85
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,333
YOU SEE, MY DEAR,

86
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:10,041
I KNOW WHAT DR. STINGRAY
INTENDED FOR YOU TO BE.

87
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,375
I KNOW THAT HE WANTED TO CREATE
A NEW BREED OF HUMANKIND.

88
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,791
SOMETHING AS FAR BEYOND
HUMAN BEINGS

89
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,750
AS YOU ARE BEYOND
A MACHINE.

90
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,333
BUT STINGRAY WAS WEAK.

91
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,791
HE SOLD YOUR BIRTHRIGHT
AND TECHNOLOGY

92
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,958
TO THAT UGLY OLD MAN.

93
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,083
BUT I HAVE FOUND THE STRENGTH 
TO MAKE HIS VISIONS COME TRUE.

94
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,625
I HAVE WAITED ALL MY LIFE
FOR THIS MOMENT, GALATEA.

95
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,416
SINCE THE INSTANT
THAT OLD FOOL PUSHED THE BUTTON,

96
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,583
I HAVE DEVOTED EVERY
WAKING MINUTE TO FINDING YOU.

97
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,958
SOON YOU WILL MAKE
MY DREAMS COME TRUE.

98
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,958
SOON YOU WILL MAKE
THE BOOMERS AWAKE.

99
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,791
- BOOMER...

100
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,958
- MACKEY...

101
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,250
- HE'S ALL RIGHT.
- ( gasps )

102
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,458
- HE'S JUST SLEEPING NOW.

103
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,958
DON'T WORRY, HE WAS AWAKE
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

104
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,375
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON, NIGEL.

105
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,375
- MACKEY'S NOT...

106
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,166
MACKEY'S NOT NORMAL.
WHAT IS HE?

107
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,833
- WHAT HE IS 
IS UP TO YOU.

108
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,958
DO YOU JUDGE SOMEBODY
BY THEIR BODY OR THEIR HEART?

109
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,791
TO ME, MACKEY IS
AN EXCELLENT ASSISTANT,

110
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,208
A FRIEND.

111
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,875
HE'S NOT A BOOMER, NENE.

112
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,708
YOU CAN FEEL
IT'S THE TRUTH, CAN'T YOU?

113
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,375
- BUT MACKEY'S NOT A--

114
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,250
- Mackey:
A HUMAN BEING, EITHER.

115
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,458
- I'M SORRY.

116
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,125
- NO, I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD APOLOGIZE, NENE.

117
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,791
SYLIA TRIED TO KEEP ME
FROM GETTING INVOLVED.

118
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,166
BUT-- BUT I JUST
COULDN'T CONTROL MYSELF.

119
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,125
- SO WHO WAS THAT GIRL
GENOM WAS AFTER?

120
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,958
- SHE'S THE SAME AS ME.

121
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,041
WE'RE SYLIA'S BROTHER
AND SISTER.

122
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,625
- ( deeply sighs )

123
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,833
NOT EXACTLY.

124
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,625
AHH, YOU SEE,
MACKEY AND THE GIRL

125
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,625
WERE BOTH CREATED USING
SYLIA'S BODY AS A HOST.

126
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,458
IN THE WIZ LAB, WE REFER
TO THEM AS DOPPELGANGERS.

127
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,958
- THEY'RE CLONES?

128
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,291
- NO.

129
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,833
WHEN SYLIA WAS YOUNG,

130
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,625
HER FATHER IMPLANTED
A NANO-DEVICE INSIDE HER.

131
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,458
AN ARTIFICIAL SYNAPTIC CONDUCTOR
DESIGNED TO ANALYZE

132
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,875
AND COPY THE
FUNCTIONING PATTERNS

133
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,416
OF A LIVING HUMAN BRAIN.

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,250
IT WAS ALSO ABLE
TO REGENERATE ITSELF

135
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,916
FROM ITS HOST TISSUES.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,750
DR. STINGRAY BELIEVED
IT WOULD BE CAPABLE

137
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,833
OF REPLICATING ANY OF THE
FUNCTIONS OF THE ORIGINAL HOST.

138
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,375
BUY SYLIA WAS THE ONLY ONE
OF THE TEST SUBJECTS

139
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,541
WHOSE BODY DIDN'T REJECT
THE NANO-MECHANISM.

140
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,916
OF COURSE NOT!

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,625
STINGRAY CREATED
THE DAMN THING

142
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,625
BY DISSECTING
SYLIA'S MOTHER'S BRAIN

143
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,625
AND MAKING A COPY
OF HER NEURAL TISSUE,

144
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,375
SO THAT HER SYSTEM 
WOULDN'T REJECT IT.

145
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,583
- MY GOD, NIGEL.

146
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,583
HOW COULD...
HE DO THAT TO HER?

147
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,916
- BUT BECAUSE OF THAT,
I WAS ABLE TO BE BORN.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,541
EVEN THOUGH
I'M NOT A HUMAN BEING,

149
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:12,250
DOES MY EXISTENCE JUSTIFY THE
NIGHTMARE THAT SYLIA ENDURED?

150
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,875
- AHH, IN ANY CASE,
THE GIRL WAS THE FIRST ONE BORN.

151
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,291
SHE WAS THE ARCHETYPE
ON WHICH THE BOOMERS WERE BUILT.

152
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:25,458
MACKEY PROVED TO BE
TOO CLOSE TO A HUMAN BEING.

153
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,708
THAT'S WHY HE WAS ABANDONED.

154
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:31,541
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
SHE'S BEEN ALIVE ALL THIS TIME.

155
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,250
WE ALL THOUGHT SHE HAD BEEN 
DESTROYED BY THE EARTHQUAKE.

156
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,250
- NIGEL, WHAT ABOUT THE QUAKE?

157
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,500
WHY DID GENOM
START THE EARTHQUAKE?

158
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,333
- BECAUSE IT WAS
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP HER.

159
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,833
IF SHE HAD BEEN
ALLOWED TO ESCAPE,

160
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,500
THE RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE CATASTROPHIC

161
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,958
THAN A MILLION EARTHQUAKES.

162
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,666
- ( siren blaring )
- Female voice: SECURITY ALERT!

163
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,333
SECURITY ALERT!

164
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,666
INNER PERIMETER
HAS BEEN BREACHED.

165
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,708
- Man: IT'S BROKEN THE FOURTH
AND FIFTH BARRIER!

166
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,583
THEY'RE NOT EVEN
SLOWING IT DOWN!

167
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
- Man #2: THE MAIN CONTROL IS
GOING CRAZY.

168
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,416
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!

169
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,208
THE SOTAI'S HEADED
FOR THE SURFACE!

170
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,708
ALL SECURITY PERSONNEL,

171
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,708
RETREAT TO EXIT 3-A!

172
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,583
- WE'VE GOTTA STOP IT!
IF THAT THING GETS OUTSIDE,

173
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,458
THE HUMAN RACE
WILL BE ANNIHILATED!

174
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,041
- Female voice:
SECURITY ALERT.

175
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,250
OUTER PERIMETER
HAS BEEN BREACHED.

176
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,750
- IT'S NOT GOOD! 
WE CAN'T STOP IT!

177
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,875
( screams )

178
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,875
- ( police sirens blaring )

179
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,000
- AAH!
- ( grunting )

180
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,458
- OHH...

181
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,791
WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?

182
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,291
HUH?  AAH.

183
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,208
AAH!

184
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,625
- HUH?
( screaming )

185
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,625
- ( screaming )

186
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,958
- WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?

187
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,791
WHY HAS OUR COMMUNICATION
TO THE WIZ LAB BEEN CUT OFF?

188
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,625
WHAT IN THE HELL DID
STINGRAY DO, MASON? 

189
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,125
- HE WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL THE
SOTAI PHENOMENON, MR. CHAIRMAN.

190
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,583
OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY

191
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,708
THAT HE PROVED TO LACK THE
TALENT TO DO SO.

192
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,541
- I DON'T WANT CRITICISM.
I WANT ANSWERS.

193
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,541
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

194
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,666
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THAT THING.

195
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,166
- THE ONLY WAY WOULD DESTROY
THE WIZ LAB.

196
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,375
- HOW, DAMMIT?

197
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,875
- I BELIEVE THAT
THE EARTHQUAKE DEVICE

198
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,916
WE WERE DEVELOPING
FOR THE MILITARY

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,583
HAS REACHED
THE PROTOTYPE STAGE.

200
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,333
- MY GOD.
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY?

201
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,291
- IT'S YOUR DECISION,
MR. CHAIRMAN.

202
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,791
- HMM...

203
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,208
COVER OUR TRACKS.

204
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,166
- ( electric guitar riff plays )

205
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,125
- GALATEA.

206
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,166
COME HERE.

207
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,083
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT
IN YOUR CHAMBER

208
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,916
LIKE I ASKED YOU TO DO?

209
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,583
GO ON IN.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

210
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,166
PLEASE, GALATEA!

211
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,541
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK IN NOW.

212
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,041
IT'S TOO SOON TO DO 
WHAT I MADE YOU FOR.

213
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,833
YOU'RE NOT READY YET--
AAH!

214
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,666
AAH AAH,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

215
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,958
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND
I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOU?!

216
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,958
AAH!

217
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,333
GALATEA!
I MADE YOU!

218
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,458
- ( rumbling )

219
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,583
- ( explosion )

220
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,916
- Nigel: THE SOTAI PHENOMENON
WAS SOMETHING DR. STINGRAY

221
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,083
HAD KEPT HIDDEN UNTIL
IT WAS TOO LATE.

222
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,208
NONE OF THE LOWER ECHELONS
IN THE TECHNICAL STAFF

223
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,583
EVEN KNEW IT EXISTED.

224
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,541
I SAW WHAT HAPPENED
WITH MY OWN EYES.

225
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,500
AND GENOM MADE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

226
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,250
- NENE...

227
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,500
I HOPE NOW YOU CAN BEGIN
TO UNDERSTAND

228
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,958
WHY SYLIA HATES
ROGUE BOOMERS SO PASSIONATELY.

229
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,250
I WENT ROGUE.

230
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,416
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

231
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,583
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
MUCH OF IT,

232
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,625
BUT THAT'S HOW I CAME
TO LIVE IN THIS PLACE

233
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,458
WITH SYLIA AND NIGEL.

234
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,416
AND THAT'S WHY I MET YOU.

235
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,416
- JUST WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

236
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,416
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE,

237
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,916
BUT I REALLY WANTED
TO SEE SYLIA AGAIN.

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,250
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT
THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON

239
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,708
WHY I WANTED TO COME BACK
TO THE CITY.

240
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,250
BUT I WAS WRONG.

241
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,250
THE THING WHICH REALLY BROUGHT
ME HERE WAS THE OTHER ONE.

242
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,416
MY OTHER SISTER.

243
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,125
SO, MAYBE I SHOULD
SIMPLY CEASE TO EXIST.

244
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,000
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?!

245
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,250
HOW COULD YOU SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

246
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,250
YOU CAN'T KILL YOURSELF,
AND END YOUR PROBLEMS.

247
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,000
PEOPLE CAN'T DO THAT.

248
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,458
- PEOPLE...?

249
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,916
- NIGEL'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE HUMAN TO ME.

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,875
( crying )
- NENE... 

251
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,333
- Linna: YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SEE SYLIA, ARE YOU?

252
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,541
I GUESS NENE
WENT TO SEE MACKEY.

253
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,375
- ( beats drum once )
- PRISS, ARE YOU LISTENING?!

254
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,333
- IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS.

255
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,666
AND WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING TO
WORRY ABOUT THEM, ANYWAY, LINNA?

256
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,416
IT'S NOT LIKE SYLIA WAS
YOUR FRIEND,

257
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,041
OR NENE YOUR SISTER.

258
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,208
WE JUST WORKED TOGETHER.

259
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,291
THAT WAS ALL
THAT CONNECTED US.

260
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,666
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WAS"?

261
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,208
- WELL, IT'S ALL OVER,
ISN'T IT?

262
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,291
- WAIT A GODDAMNED SECOND!

263
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,750
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE
QUITTING THE KNIGHT SABERS?

264
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,083
YOU'RE JUST HANGING UP
YOUR HARDSUIT AND GIVING UP?

265
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:08,250
- OUR HARDSUITS ARE FUSED
INTO LITTLE PILES OF GARBAGE.

266
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,583
- UH, WELL, YEAH, BUT--

267
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,916
BUT I'M SURE THERE WILL BE
NEW ONES.

268
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,083
I BET NIGEL'S PROBABLY ALREADY
WORKING ON THEM RIGHT NOW.

269
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,875
- I'LL NEVER WEAR ONE OF
THOSE THINGS AGAIN.

270
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:19,916
- BUT WHY?

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,458
- I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

272
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,958
ABOUT WHY OUR SUITS
MALFUNCTIONED LIKE THAT.

273
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,916
AND I'VE BEEN PIECING THIS
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS TOGETHER.

274
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,375
IT ALL STARTED WHEN
THAT GIRL APPEARED.

275
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,708
THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENED
WAS THAT ALL THE BOOMERS

276
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,041
STARTED GOING ROGUE
SIMULTANEOUSLY.

277
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,666
- AND THEN, A FEW SECONDS LATER,

278
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,750
OUR HARDSUITS WENT
CRAZY AS WELL.

279
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,166
BUT NOTHING ELSE.

280
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,083
NOT EVEN THOSE BASTARDS
FROM GENOM WAS AFFECTED AT ALL.

281
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,750
JUST THE BOOMERS
AND OUR SUITS.

282
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,250
AND THEN I REMEMBERED
HOW THAT BUG THING

283
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,416
MADE OUR SUITS SHUT DOWN
AS WELL.

284
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,083
JUST LIKE A BOOMER.

285
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,583
- ( gasps )

286
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,541
WAIT A SECOND, PRISS.

287
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,208
ARE YOU-- ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT OUR HARDSUITS ARE--

288
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,708
- YEAH, THEY'RE BOOMERS.

289
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,083
- NO WAY.

290
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,000
- NIGEL KNEW IT ALL ALONG.

291
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,458
SO DID MACKEY.

292
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,291
BUT FOR SOME REASON, SYLIA
NEVER SAW FIT TO TELL US.

293
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,125
- I SEE.

294
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,791
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT THE SUITS
DIDN'T USE

295
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,416
CONVENTIONAL
SUIT TECHNOLOGY.

296
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,583
BUT WAIT! IF THEY'RE BOOMERS,
THEY MUST HAVE A CORE.

297
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,916
WHERE'S IT HIDDEN?

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,166
- IT'S GOT TO BE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

299
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,375
- AH, SO NOW I UNDERSTAND.
- ( girls gasp )

300
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,541
- DID YOU COME TO ARREST US,
MR. COP?

301
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,291
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M OFF DUTY.

302
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,625
I WAS HOPING THERE'D BE
A SHOW, BUT THIS, WELL...

303
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,208
- MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER
EAVESDROPPING UNETHICAL.

304
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,166
- OH, I HARDLY HAD TO EAVESDROP

305
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,625
THE WAY YOU TWO
WERE CARRYING ON,

306
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,000
PRINCESS.

307
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,791
- PRISS, WHO IS THIS GUY?

308
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,291
- HE'S A COP.
 A.D. POLICE.

309
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,541
- AHH!  YOU'RE THE ONE
 IN GREEN, AREN'T YOU?

310
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,416
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONE SEXY
LITTLE SUIT YOU'VE GOT,

311
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,083
AND FROM WHAT I SEE NOW,
IT MUST FIT YOU LIKE A GLOVE.

312
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,416
- JERK!  UH!

313
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,250
- HMM.

314
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,916
- PRISS!

315
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,250
I'M NOT GIVING UP YET.

316
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,875
MAYBE YOU CAN JUST QUIT,
BUT I CAN'T.

317
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,208
I'M SORRY, PRISS.

318
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,208
BUT SOME THINGS ARE
TOO IMPORTANT.

319
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,500
- HMM.

320
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,333
- CAN YOU RIDE A BIKE?

321
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,333
- HUH?

322
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,541
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THE OTHER DAY, DID YOU?

323
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,000
- YOU MEAN IN THE TUNNEL?

324
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,666
I TOLD YOU THAT I WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

325
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,458
I COULDN'T HAVE REPORTED YOU,
ANYWAY, NOT EVEN IF I'D WANTED.

326
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:46,458
- HUH.  I THOUGHT YOU
HATED THE KNIGHT SABERS.

327
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,125
- THAT'S RIGHT, I DID.

328
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,791
BECAUSE THEY KEPT MAKING US
LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.

329
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,625
SO, CAN I ASK YOU 
THE SAME QUESTION?

330
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,958
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH
THE A.D. POLICE?

331
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,416
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

332
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,750
I JUST CAN'T STAND ANYONE
WHO THINKS THAT A UNIFORM

333
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,833
MAKES THEM MORE IMPORTANT
THAN SOMEONE ELSE.

334
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,750
YOU'RE PAINTING WITH
A WIDE BRUSH.

335
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,250
WE DON'T ALL FEEL THAT WAY.

336
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,083
JUST A FEW BIG JERKS.

337
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,666
- IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D THINK THAT WAS AN APOLOGY.

338
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,125
- YEAH, WELL, I DON'T HAVE
MUCH PRACTICE

339
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,291
AT THIS KIND OF THING, YOU KNOW?

340
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,916
I'M HOPING THAT ONCE
YOU GET TO KNOW ME,

341
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,250
YOU'LL SEE THAT I CAN BE
JUST A NORMAL GUY.

342
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,250
- HEH.

343
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,750
YOU'D STILL BE A JERK THEN.

344
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,083
- YOUR TEAM'S BREAKING UP,
ISN'T IT?

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,250
( sighs )
SORRY.

346
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,833
MAYBE THAT WAS TOO PERSONAL.

347
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,875
BUT I'D REALLY HATE
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.

348
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,250
COMPETING WITH YOU IS ALL
THAT KEPT SOME OF US GOING.

349
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,666
- IT'S TOO LATE.

350
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,416
BUT THE WHOLE SHEBANG'S
GETTING READY TO BLOW UP ANYWAY.

351
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,916
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH
GENOM AND THE GOVERNMENT

352
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,875
TRY TO HIDE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

353
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,041
EVENTUALLY THE PUBLIC
WILL FIGURE OUT

354
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,791
THAT THE MAD BOOMER PROBLEM IS
GETTING WORSE, NOT BETTER.

355
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,958
I HOPE.

356
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,291
- YEAH, ME TOO.

357
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,458
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK A COP
CAN SEE WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON?

358
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,791
I MAY NOT BE AS SMART
AS MY BOSS OR PARTNER ARE,

359
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,291
BUT I'M SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW
A COVER-UP WHEN I SEE IT.

360
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,166
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THE SOTAI IS?

361
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,250
- THE WHAT?

362
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,916
- ( chuckles softly )

363
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,875
OH, JUST SOMETHING I HEARD.

364
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,458
- HEY, WAIT!

365
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,625
- Pilot:
THIS AREA'S A NO-PARKING ZONE.

366
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,791
YOU ARE IN VIOLATION
OF TRAFFIC REGULATIONS

367
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,166
NUMBER 241--
- STOW IT, JERK!

368
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,500
CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M TRYING TO SCORE HERE?

369
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,250
SEE THIS BADGE?!

370
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,750
IT MATCHES THE PLATES ON
MY OWN MARKED VEHICLE.

371
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,750
NOW BEAT IT!

372
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,416
- I'M SO SORRY, OFFICER LEON.

373
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,375
CARRY ON.

374
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,166
- SO, YOU'RE TURNING OVER
A NEW LEAF, HUH?

375
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,750
- YEAH, WELL, I'M TRYIN'.
SORRY.

376
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,833
AHH!  I GUESS I COULD HAVE
PHRASED THAT

377
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,500
A LITTLE NICER, HUH?

378
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,166
I'M JUST NOT GOOD AT DEALING 
WITH PEOPLE THAT AREN'T COPS.

379
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,833
- ( gasping )

380
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,833
- HUH?

381
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,333
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

382
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,208
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
PRISS!

383
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,708
- ( device beeping )

384
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,583
- HEY, ARE YOU TWO ALL RIGHT?

385
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,000
- I DON'T KNOW.

386
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,000
MACKEY?

387
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,416
- YES, I SEE IT TOO.

388
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,625
- ( groans )

389
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,458
WHY?

390
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,958
WHY ARE THESE THINGS
APPEARING MY MIND?

391
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,958
- AAH!

392
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,458
- SYLIA.

393
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,625
- Both: SYLIA.

394
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,666
- ( moaning )

395
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,333
GET OUT OF MY MIND, DAMMIT.

396
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,333
GET THE HELL OUT
OF MY BRAIN.

397
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,291
( breathing heavily )

398
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,125
- ( end theme playing )

399
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

400
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,708
- Woman:
IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF

401
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,750
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS:
TOKYO 2040"...

402
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,208
FROM HALLUCINATIONS
TO WALKING NIGHTMARES,

403
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,041
THE KNIGHT SABERS FIND
THEMSELVES TRAPPED AND HELPLESS

404
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,458
WITHOUT THEIR ARMOR.

405
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,791
AS MASON PREPARES GALATEA
FOR HER ULTIMATE PURPOSE,

406
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,583
THE A.D. POLICE ARE
GIVEN THE ORDER TO DISBAND.

407
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,750
CAN TOKYO WITHSTAND
THE ONSLAUGHT

408
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,750
OF A NEW ARMY
OF ROGUE BOOMERS?

409
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,458
THE GENESIS OF
THE KNIGHT SABERS IS UNVEILED.

410
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:27,750
NEXT EPISODE...
