1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,791
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,291
- ( screeching )

4
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,625
- ( signal sounding )

5
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,000
- COME ON!
ISN'T THIS CLOSE ENOUGH YET?

6
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,041
- A FEW MORE YARDS.

7
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,375
OKAY, NOW!

8
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,708
- ( both shouting )

9
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,125
- I GUESS WE GOT IT.

10
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,833
- ( screeching )

11
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,375
- WHY WON'T IT DIE?

12
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,750
IT SHOULD HAVE DIED AS SOON
AS THEY DESTROYED ITS CORE.

13
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,916
- MAYDAY!  MAYDAY!

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,416
- ( static )
- PREP ME FOR LAUNCH.

15
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,083
- OH.  BUT YOU WON'T
HAVE ANY SUPPORT.

16
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,416
- NIGEL, WHERE DID YOU HIDE
THE BATTERY IN THESE NEW SUITS?

17
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,125
- IT'S INTEGRATED
THROUGHOUT THE HARDSUIT'S BODY.

18
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,375
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE CHARGED UP.

19
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,833
- THEN PREP HER SUIT
FOR LAUNCH, DAMN IT!

20
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,875
AND MAKE ONE FOR ME.
- UH...

21
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,875
- ( screeching )

22
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,083
- WHY DIDN'T THAT THING DIE?

23
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,250
- WELL, I'D SAY THAT
EITHER IT'S GOT ANOTHER CORE,

24
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,083
OR IT'S EVOLVED
TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE

25
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,041
WITHOUT A CENTRAL
POWER STRUCTURE.

26
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,916
- UGH!
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING,

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,916
HOW IN THE HELL
CAN WE STOP IT?

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,541
- ( screeching )

29
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,291
- WHAT NOW?

30
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,875
- THAT'S IT.
- AH!  THE SKY HOOK!

31
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,458
IT'S STILL FEEDING POWER
INTO THE DRAGON LINE.

32
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:27,416
- YEAH, I THINK SO.
- ( screeching )

33
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,750
- IT'S DRAGGING THOSE CONDUITS
FROM THE DRAGON LINE.

34
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,833
THAT'S WHERE IT'S GETTING
ITS POWER FROM, ISN'T IT?

35
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:41,041
- ( screeching )
- ( exploding )

36
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,041
- ( all grunting )

37
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,500
- ( screeching )

38
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,458
- LINNA?

39
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,708
HEY!
- HUH?

40
00:03:56,791 --> 00:04:00,333
- YOU'VE GOT TO SEVER THOSE
CONDUITS FROM THE DRAGON LINE!

41
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,125
THAT'S WHAT'S GIVING IT
ITS POWER!

42
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,208
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO KILL IT.

43
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,333
- RIGHT!
THANK YOU, OFFICER.

44
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,208
HA!

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,250
- WHAT A SUIT!
I WANT ONE TOO!

46
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:46,208
- ( light chattering )

47
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,625
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW,
GALATEA?

48
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:58,583
- ( chattering )

49
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,541
- SPEAK ENGLISH! I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THAT LANGUAGE.

50
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,708
DON'T FORGET,

51
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,041
I WAS THE ONE WHO RESCUED YOU
FROM SYLIA STINGRAY.

52
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,375
AND ALL I ASKED IN RETURN

53
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,875
IS FOR YOU
TO MAKE MY VISION COME TRUE.

54
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,041
I WANT TO WATCH AS YOU CHANGE
THIS WORLD, GALATEA.

55
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,875
- YOU WANT TO BE GOD,
DON'T YOU?

56
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,250
- HUH?  ( chuckles )

57
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,625
YES,
I THINK THAT YOU ARE RIGHT.

58
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,375
BUT WHAT KIND OF GOD?
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

59
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,916
NOT A WEAK, PATHETIC GOD WHO
SIMPLY SITS BACK AND WATCHES,

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,333
BUT A GOD WHO PASSES JUDGMENT,

61
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:40,166
A GOD WHO CORRECTS THE MISTAKES
OF A MILLION YEARS OF EVOLUTION.

62
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,416
BUT IF I AM GOD, THEN WHAT DOES
THAT MAKE YOU?

63
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,166
- A CHILD OF MAN.

64
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,416
- HUH?
( laughs )

65
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,250
WELL, IT'S TRUE THAT A MAN
CREATED YOUR SEED.

66
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,750
AND THAT SEED WAS BORN
FROM THE FLESH OF A WOMAN

67
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,375
WHO WAS WITHOUT SIN.

68
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,583
BUT STINGRAY IMPLANTED YOU
INTO THE BODY OF HIS DAUGHTER

69
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,583
MERELY BECAUSE
IT WAS CONVENIENT.

70
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,625
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN CREATED
IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL.

71
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,541
- AND WHAT OF THE SEED
IN YOUR OWN BODY?

72
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,291
- IT HAS NEVER GROWN.

73
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,333
MY BODY CONSUMED IT.

74
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,500
BUT THE EMBRYONIC BOOMER CORE
I IMPLANTED IN MYSELF

75
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,291
WAS NOT LIKE YOURS WAS,

76
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,250
THOUGH I HAD HOPED
IT WOULD FIX MY HUMAN FAILINGS.

77
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,750
- WHY DO YOU REJECT
WHAT YOU ARE?

78
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,083
- AH?

79
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,833
- WHY DOES EVEN THE SISTER
WHO BORE ME

80
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,041
REJECT MY EXISTENCE?

81
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,458
- GALATEA, WAIT!

82
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,000
( gasps )

83
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,458
AH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

84
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO MY BODY?

85
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,125
AH!  OH MY GOD, GALATEA!

86
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,625
PLEASE!

87
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,291
- ( machinery clanking )

88
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,625
- Priss:
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE LARGE?

89
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,333
- WELL, IT HAS TO BE THAT BIG.
WE COMPRESSED THEM.

90
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,583
- YEAH, WELL, SAY WHAT YOU WILL.
THEY LOOK WEIRD.

91
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,375
- THEY LOOK STRANGE,
BUT THEY KICK MAJOR BUTT.

92
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,750
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE WAY
LINNA TOOK OUT THAT GIANT BOOMER

93
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,500
ALL BY HERSELF YESTERDAY.

94
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,375
- THEY BEAT THE OLD SUITS
IN ALMOST EVERY WAY.

95
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,833
BUT THEY ARE EMBARRASSING.

96
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,333
- EMBARRASSING?

97
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,291
- HEY, MACKY?
- HUH?

98
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,500
- YOU AND NIGEL ARE GOING
TO DO SOMETHING

99
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,000
ABOUT THAT LITTLE ISSUE,
AREN'T YOU?

100
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,208
- JUST WHAT
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

101
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,250
- ( whispering )

102
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,000
- MMM, MMM.  WHAT?!
YOU MEAN LIKE TOTALLY NAKED?!

103
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,708
NO WAY!

104
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,333
- ( beeping )
- WHERE IS NIGEL?

105
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,916
- UM, WELL, HE AND SYLIA
ARE HAVING A TALK UPSTAIRS.

106
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,875
- MMM.

107
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,500
- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE
ALL YOU'VE DONE.

108
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,333
- IT'S MY JOB.

109
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,541
JUST LIKE IT WAS MY JOB
TO ASSIST YOUR FATHER.

110
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,083
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

111
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,125
- THERE IS NO MEANING.

112
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,958
- ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU THINK
I'VE ONLY BEEN USING YOU?

113
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,666
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

114
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,208
OUR WORK AND THE FEELINGS I HAVE
FOR YOU ARE SEPARATE THINGS.

115
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,916
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT
I DON'T RESPECT

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,208
YOUR SKILLS AND ABILITIES.

117
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,333
BUT I THOUGHT
THAT WHAT WE SHARED

118
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,750
WAS MORE
THAN A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE.

119
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,875
I THOUGHT I MEANT SOMETHING
TO YOU.

120
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,958
WAS I JUST ONE MORE MACHINE
YOU HAD TO SERVICE?

121
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,958
OR IS THAT HOW YOU THINK
I FEEL ABOUT YOU?

122
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,291
THAT'S NOT HOW I FEEL.

123
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,625
NIGEL, I--

124
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,666
I LOVE YOU. 
- SYLIA,

125
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,625
THE NEW HARDSUITS
MAY USE NEW TECHNOLOGY,

126
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,625
BUT THEY'RE STILL BASED
ON YOUR ORIGINAL BIO-DATA.

127
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,125
MACKY AND I
BUILT A NEW SUIT FOR YOU,

128
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,958
AS YOU REQUESTED.

129
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,166
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD PUT IT ON.

130
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,125
I THINK YOU SHOULD RETIRE.

131
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,833
YOU'VE CHANGED TOO MUCH,
SYLIA.

132
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,541
YOU'RE NOT THE GIRL
THAT YOU WERE ANYMORE.

133
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,291
AND THE FEEDBACK FROM YOUR SUIT
COULD CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE.

134
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:21,000
- THANK YOU
FOR CARING ABOUT ME.

135
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,375
- ( engine revving )

136
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,625
- ( alarm sounding )

137
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,125
- AHHH!

138
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,166
GAL-- GALATEA!

139
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,208
( grunting )
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

140
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,375
- I HAVE KEPT THE PROMISE
THAT I MADE YOU.

141
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,125
I HAVE PUT YOU THERE

142
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,500
SO YOU CAN WATCH
AS I CHANGE THE WORLD.

143
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,958
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

144
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,833
- THERE ARE DRAGONS IN THE EARTH
AND I SHALL SET THEM FREE.

145
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,291
- ARE YOU INSANE?
UNLEASH THE DRAGON LINE?

146
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,583
- ( chuckles )

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,958
- ( deep rumbling )

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,708
- ( distant chattering ) 
- HMM?

149
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,708
- ( chattering )

150
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,166
- ( chuckling )

151
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,000
- ( all chattering )

152
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,250
- AHH!

153
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,166
- ( grunting )

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,875
- ( laughing )

155
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,458
AH!
- ( all grunting )

156
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,541
- I'M TOO OLD TO PLAY
WITH LITTLE CLOWNS LIKE YOU.

157
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,708
- ( laughing )

158
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,333
- ( grunts )

159
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,916
- ( all laughing, chattering )

160
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,583
- ( grunts )

161
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,958
AH!

162
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,541
AHH!

163
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,458
- ( laughs )

164
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:52,083
- ( gun fires several times )

165
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,958
- ( gasps )

166
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,000
- ARE YOU OKAY?

167
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,875
- UH... UH-HUH.

168
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,208
- ( chuckles )

169
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,708
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

170
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,875
- WHY IS IT
THAT WHENEVER I RUN INTO YOU,

171
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,625
YOU'RE ALWAYS IN TROUBLE
AND WEARING SOMETHING REVEALING?

172
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:15,291
- UGH!  PUT YOUR TONGUE
BACK IN YOUR MOUTH, JERK!

173
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,833
- SURE YOU DON'T NEED
TO GO SEE A DOCTOR?

174
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,875
- I'M FINE.
- IT'S NICE TO SEE

175
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,416
THAT YOU OWN SOMETHING
THAT'S NOT MADE OF LEATHER.

176
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,708
SO JUST WHAT IS IT WITH THE
URBAN COMBAT LOOK ANYWAY?

177
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,208
( gulps )

178
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,583
AND LEON THE DORK PUTS HIS FOOT
IN HIS MOUTH AGAIN.

179
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,125
- Priss: ISN'T THERE ANYBODY
LEFT IN TOWN?

180
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,750
- NO, THE WHOLE PLACE
IS SHUT DOWN.

181
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,250
- JESUS.

182
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,791
- WELL, GIANT MAN-EATING ROBOTS
TEND TO SCARE MOST PEOPLE.

183
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,791
- ( static )

184
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,458
- AND BESIDES--

185
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,000
- WHAT KIND OF SOLDIERS
ARE THOSE?

186
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,041
- U.N. R.D.F. TROOPS.

187
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,208
THEY'RE TRYING TO CUT TOKYO OFF
FROM THE REST OF JAPAN

188
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,750
TO KEEP THE BOOMER PLAGUE
FROM SPREADING.

189
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,583
- ( beeps )

190
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,833
- ( grunts )

191
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,000
LEON, JUST WHAT
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

192
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,916
- SHHH.

193
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:44,000
- ( signal sounding ) 
- ( sighs )

194
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,458
- There you are!
We need you at the pit.

195
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,708
- UH, I'M KIND OF--

196
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,958
- What? Is somebody there?

197
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,958
- UGH!
NO, NOBODY!

198
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,416
I JUST DON'T FEEL
LIKE COMING IN RIGHT NOW.

199
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,833
- You what?
- Ah!

200
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,708
Damn it, we don't have time
to argue about this!

201
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,333
This thing's huge--
Godzilla sized!

202
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,958
- HUH?

203
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,916
- ( rumbling )

204
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,791
( metal creaking )

205
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,500
- I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO WAIT FOR PRISS TO GET HERE.

206
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,916
THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON THAT
GALATEA WOULD SHIFT

207
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,416
SO MUCH POWER TO ONE SECTION

208
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,208
OF THE DRAGON LINE
AND THAT PART OF THE CITY.

209
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,166
SHE'S GOING TO TRY
TO BREAK THROUGH THE BLOCKADE.

210
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,375
- UM, LINNA, I HAVEN'T
DONE THIS BEFORE, BUT--

211
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,000
- AH!  MACKY?
- YEAH?

212
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,833
- CAN'T YOU DO THAT
BY REMOTE CONTROL?

213
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,416
- HUH?
- RUN ALONG, MACKY.

214
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,458
REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.

215
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,833
- AHH!  OH, THAT'S RIGHT!
I WAS JUST LEAVING!

216
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,375
AHHHH!

217
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,916
- ( all chuckle )

218
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,166
- ( motor revving )

219
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,875
- SO WHERE IS YOUR PARTNER?

220
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,375
- I DON'T KNOW.
ON HIS WAY HOME, I HOPE.

221
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,541
THE AD POLICE
HAS BEEN DISSOLVED.

222
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,791
WE RECEIVED ORDERS
TO PULL OUT.

223
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,041
- FIGURES.
SO WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

224
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,875
- BECAUSE I'M DUMB
AND STUBBORN.

225
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,083
BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE A REASON,
RIGHT?

226
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,708
- UH, WELL, TO BE HONEST,
NOT REALLY.

227
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:16,625
- SO WHY DO YOU HATE BOOMERS
SO MUCH?

228
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,208
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

229
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,166
- IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING.

230
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,916
- NOW I'M REALLY CURIOUS.

231
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,166
- STOP TALKING AND DRIVE!

232
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,125
- ( chuckles )

233
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,083
- Sylia: ALL RIGHT, NENE,
STEP INTO THE SUIT FRAME.

234
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,958
- HMM?

235
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,333
- ( pop song playing )

236
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,250
- HMM?  OH.

237
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,125
- ( machines whirring )

238
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,333
- EEK.

239
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,083
- Sylia: ALL RIGHT, MACKY,
START POURING.

240
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,250
- THIS PART'S
A LITTLE DISGUSTING.

241
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,208
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

242
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,791
- ( gurgling )

243
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,125
- EW!
WHAT IS THIS?

244
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,541
- Sylia: INNER METAL.

245
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,041
IT'S WHAT
BONDS EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

246
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,958
- THIS REALLY IS DISGUSTING!

247
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,916
- JUST DON'T GET IT
IN YOUR MOUTH.

248
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,333
- OKAY, HOLD IT THERE, MACKY.

249
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,333
- NOW THINK.
- THINK OF WHAT?

250
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,000
- YOU NEED A MENTAL
CHARM TO LINK THE HARDSUIT

251
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,166
TO YOUR BRAIN STEM.

252
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,625
- SAY THAT AGAIN,
IN ENGLISH THIS TIME.

253
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,708
- IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A COMPUTER PASSCODE, NENE.

254
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,708
YOU'RE TUNING THE INNER METAL
TO RESPOND

255
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,041
TO THE MENTAL COMMANDS
THAT YOUR BRAIN IS SENDING

256
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,250
THROUGH THE SUIT FRAME.

257
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,750
- THAT'S RIGHT.
JUST WATCH WHAT I DO, NENE.

258
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,958
I WANT TO BE STRONGER.

259
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,416
I WANT TO JUMP HIGHER.

260
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,625
- OH, WOW.

261
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,333
RIGHT, LET'S SEE.

262
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,166
I WANT TO BE AN INCREDIBLE
SHINY KNIGHT SABER.

263
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,458
AH!  HEY, WAIT!
( garbled )

264
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,708
OH, SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

265
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,000
- KNIGHT SABERS,
PREPARE FOR ACTION.

266
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,333
- ( electricity booming )

267
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,166
- Macky:
WELL, THERE THEY GO AGAIN.

268
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,666
- I DID TRY TO STOP THEM.

269
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,916
- MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE TRIED
TO STOP THEM TOO.

270
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,208
- IT DOESN'T MATTER, KID.

271
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,375
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A WASTE OF TIME.

272
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,500
- NIGEL?

273
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,291
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY HERE
AND HELP SYLIA, RIGHT?

274
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,541
I DON'T--

275
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,541
I'M NOT SURE IF I'M GOING TO BE
ABLE TO STAY HERE MUCH LONGER.

276
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,833
SO I WAS HOPING
THAT YOU MIGHT BE STAYING HERE

277
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:55,166
BECAUSE-- BECAUSE SYLIA NEEDS
SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

278
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,375
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

279
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,583
NOTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

280
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:07,416
MY LIFE SEEMS TO BE LIKE THAT.

281
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,916
- PRISS!
- ( panting )

282
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,125
- MACKY, GET MY SUIT READY!

283
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,041
- SO HOW DID YOU GET
ALL THOSE CUTS?

284
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,500
- ( door whirring )

285
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,500
- UM, THEY LOOK
LIKE TEETH MARKS.

286
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,916
- ( rumbling )

287
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,416
- Linna: WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE THOSE THINGS?

288
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,375
- YOU MEAN BESIDES DISGUSTING?!

289
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,750
- Sylia: THE DRAGON LINE IS
SPREADING THE BOOMER PHENOMENON

290
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,333
INTO EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES.

291
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,250
IT WON'T STOP GROWING AS LONG
AS THERE ARE MORE BOOMERS

292
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,250
AND ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS
TO ABSORB.

293
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,208
- ( rumbling ) 
- All: OH!

294
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,416
- ( screeching )

295
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,250
- Linna: MY GOD!
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THING!

296
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,916
- OH, COME ON, LINNA!
YOU FINISHED OFF THAT BIG BOOMER

297
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,750
THE OTHER DAY
ALL BY YOURSELF.

298
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,458
WITH THREE OF US, THIS SHOULD BE
A PIECE OF CAKE. LET'S DO IT!

299
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,083
- Both: RIGHT.

300
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,166
- HA!

301
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,958
HUH?

302
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,500
- HYAH!

303
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:37,916
- HYAH!

304
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:44,916
- NENE, YOUR TURN!
- ATTACK!  HYAH!

305
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,125
- DO I KICK ASS OR WHAT?
- WATCH OUT!

306
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,875
- UH-OH.

307
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,708
- ( grunts )

308
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:37,250
- I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
WIN THIS BATTLE, GALATEA.

309
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,458
DO YOU HEAR ME?
- ( distant chattering )

310
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,958
- I'LL STOP YOU IF I HAVE TO
DESTROY EVERY BOOMER IN TOKYO.

311
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,333
DO YOU HEAR ME, GALATEA?!

312
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,375
- Voice: Señores y señoras,

313
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,333
nosotros...
( continues, indistinct )

314
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,083
- AH!

315
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,000
AH AH!
MAYDAY!

316
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,333
- Female voice:
Señores y señoras...
