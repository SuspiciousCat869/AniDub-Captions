1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,875
- WELL, IF YOU REALLY
WANT MY OPINION, LEON,

4
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,833
I THINK YOU SHOULD START TAKING
THINGS A LITTLE MORE EASY.

5
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,750
- HEY, HOLD ON.

6
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,208
HEY, NENE.
SOMETHING WRONG, KIDDO?

7
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,208
- HUH?  OH, NO.
I'M JUST FINE, REALLY.

8
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,750
- ARE YOU SURE?
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAD

9
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,458
A LOT ON YOUR MIND.
- NO, REALLY.  I'M FINE.

10
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,083
IT'S JUST THAT MY BLOOD SUGAR'S
A LITTLE LOW, OKAY?

11
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,083
- I SEE.
- WELL, WE'RE GOING TO LUNCH.

12
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,250
YOU WANT TO COME?

13
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,791
- YOU'LL PROBABLY
SPEND THE WHOLE TIME

14
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,333
ASKING ME ABOUT PRISS,
WON'T YOU?

15
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,583
- ( groans )

16
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,583
- BY THE WAY,
HAVE YOU SEEN HER LATELY?

17
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,583
- NOPE.  NOT THAT
MR. DATELESS HERE

18
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,541
HASN'T BEEN KEEPING
AN EYE OUT FOR HER.

19
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,083
OR LACK OF INTEREST HASN'T
SHOWN UP ON HIS RADAR YET.

20
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,250
( chuckles )

21
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,250
- HEY, WAIT.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

22
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,916
SHE'S JUST--
UM, WELL... SHY.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,583
- SHE AND LINNA MUST BE
GOING AT IT 24 HOURS.

24
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,250
- Both: HUH?
- UH...

25
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,583
( chuckles nervously )

26
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,833
NEVER MIND,
I'M JUST BABBLING.

27
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,916
- 24 HOURS A DAY?

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,708
WHO'S LINNA?

29
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,250
- READY, SYLIA?

30
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,875
- Sylia:
ROGER, PRISS.  GO AHEAD.

31
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,000
- FIRING PULSE.

32
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,000
- ( beeping )

33
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,291
- NO.  THAT'S NOT
THE ONE, PRISS.

34
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,958
- Priss:
NUTS.  NOT THIS ONE EITHER?

35
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,625
- I'M SORRY.  PLEASE PROCEED
TO THE NEXT POINT.

36
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,833
- Priss:
OKAY, WHATEVER.

37
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,333
- ( sighs )

38
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,333
- Linna:
SYLIA, I'M IN POSITION.

39
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,375
- OKAY, FIRE YOUR EMP PULSE.

40
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,708
- ( beeping )

41
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,000
- Linna:
I'M NOT GETTING ANY RESPONSE.

42
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,666
I'M GOING TO MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT SPOT, OKAY?

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,000
- Sylia: ROGER.

44
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,291
ONLY SIX POINTS LEFT.

45
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,250
WHERE ARE YOU?

46
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,208
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

47
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,041
- Linna:
SYLIA, ARE YOU THERE?

48
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,375
- I'M SORRY, LINNA.
ARE YOU ALREADY THERE?

49
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,541
- Linna: NO, THIS TUNNEL
COMES TO A DEAD END.

50
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,375
AM I CLOSE ENOUGH
TO TRY FROM HERE?

51
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,375
- IF THE DISTANCE IS 
MORE THAN 300 METERS,

52
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,375
I'M AFRAID THE SONAR 
CAN'T REACH THAT FAR.

53
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,541
- Linna: I SEE.
IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY IN?

54
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,916
- LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,333
THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER
ACCESS TUNNEL NEARBY. 

56
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,208
- Priss: I DON'T THINK 
YOU'LL NEED TO DO THAT.

57
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,541
- WHAT'S THAT?

58
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,708
- Priss: I THINK WE HAVE
A WINNER HERE.

59
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,541
- Sylia:
THAT'S IT, PRISS.

60
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,875
NOW WITHDRAW AND
RETURN TO BASE. 

61
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,375
- HOLD ON. LET ME SEE HOW CLEAR
THE PASSAGEWAY IS FIRST.

62
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,958
- Sylia: UM, OKAY.

63
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,083
- Priss: HMM. LOOKS LIKE THIS
USED TO BE SOME KIND OF ROADWAY.

64
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,750
CORRECTION, FREEWAY.

65
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,083
THERE'S A BUILDING COLLAPSED
ACROSS THE ROAD.

66
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,416
SYLIA, THERE'S A PATHWAY
BENEATH THE BUILDING.

67
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,708
HEADING DOWN.

68
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,083
- Sylia:
PRISS, STOP RIGHT THERE.

69
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,125
- IT LOOKS CLEAR.
- Sylia: NO, PRISS. STOP NOW.

70
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,125
COME BACK NOW, DAMN IT! 
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

71
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,791
- ( sighs )

72
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,125
YOU COME HERE OFTEN?

73
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,791
- I WISH I COULD AFFORD
TO COME HERE OFTEN.

74
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,125
- IT'S WORTH IT.

75
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,000
- WELL, SINCE SYLIA'S PAYING.

76
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,291
I'M SURPRISED YOU ACTUALLY
LISTENED TO SYLIA

77
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,666
AND DIDN'T GO IN.

78
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,416
I THINK CURIOSITY WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN THE BETTER OF ME.

79
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,333
- WELL, IF MY BATTERY
HADN'T BEEN DEAD,

80
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,625
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE.

81
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,875
- IT'S DRIVING YOU CRAZY TOO,
ISN'T IT?

82
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,875
- YEAH, AFTER FIVE DAYS,

83
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,541
TO GET PULLED BACK FROM THE
BRINK LIKE THAT?

84
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,708
- YEAH, BUT I WONDER
HOW DANGEROUS

85
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,375
THAT THING REALLY IS.

86
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,083
- PRETTY DANGEROUS FROM THE WAY
SYLIA REACTED, I'D SAY.

87
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,250
- SHE WAS DESPERATE,
ALL RIGHT,

88
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,583
TO STOP YOU FROM
GOING IN THERE. 

89
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,583
- Priss:
BUT I'M ALMOST THERE ALREADY.

90
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,166
- Sylia:
GET BACK HERE NOW, DAMN IT!

91
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,833
- Priss: I JUST WANT
TO CHECK IT OUT.

92
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,666
- I SAID TO COME BACK NOW!

93
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,500
PRISS!

94
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,833
PRISS!

95
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,583
( gasps )

96
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,458
( breathing heavily )

97
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,250
- MY BATTERY'S OUT ANYWAY.

98
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,541
I'M COMING BACK.

99
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,333
- THANK GOD YOU FOUND IT.

100
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,416
AT LAST I'LL BE ABLE
TO DISPOSE OF IT PROPERLY.

101
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,625
- WHAT IS IT WITH THIS
"I" STUFF, SYLIA?

102
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,875
YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO FINISH
THIS ALL BY YOURSELF, WOULD YOU?

103
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,875
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'M DOING, PRISS.

104
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,208
I CAN HANDLE
THE REST FROM HERE.

105
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,375
- NO WAY.

106
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,083
LINNA AND I ONLY
AGREED TO HELP YOU

107
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,541
IF YOU KEPT US
IN THE LOOP.

108
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,291
- PRISS IS RIGHT, SYLIA.

109
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,291
KEEPING SECRETS
IS WHY WE LOST NENE.

110
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,541
- VERY WELL THEN.

111
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,625
I PROMISE WE'LL
DO THIS AS A TEAM

112
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,750
JUST AS SOON AS
EVERYTHING ELSE IS READY TO GO.

113
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,875
- Both:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES.

114
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,250
PLEASE COME BACK
TO VISIT US AGAIN.

115
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,541
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WANT TO SIGN UP?

116
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,083
- UM, SURE.

117
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,416
I'VE BEEN GOING TO A PLACE,
BUT THIS IS A LOT NICER.

118
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,875
I'M KIND OF SURPRISED
THAT YOU GOT SO INTO IT THOUGH.

119
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,583
- WHY'S THAT?

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,583
- NOW IF THIS HAD BEEN
THE Y.W.C.A.

121
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,916
- HMM.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,875
- UM, PRISS?
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM NENE?

123
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,041
- WE'RE INTO
THE HOME STRETCH NOW.

124
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,666
THE QUESTION IS,
WHERE CAN I GET THE POWER FROM?

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,583
ARE THERE ANY
ACTIVE LINES LEFT DOWN THERE?

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,916
- ( beeping )
- HERE WE GO.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THIS OLD POWER CONDUIT
JUST MIGHT DO THE TRICK.

128
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,250
IF I CHANNEL THE CURRENT FLOW
THROUGH THIS FACTORY

129
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,916
INTO THE GRID,
IT'S POSSIBLE.

130
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,666
- SYLIA?

131
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,541
SYLIA?
ARE YOU HERE?

132
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,125
SYLIA...

133
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,833
- Henderson:
I'M SORRY, MASTER MACKY.

134
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,000
MISTRESS SYLIA
IS OUT NOW.

135
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,625
- SHE WENT OUT?

136
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,458
DO YOU KNOW WHEN
SHE'LL BE BACK? 

137
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,291
- I'M AFRAID
SHE DIDN'T SAY.

138
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,958
LATE, I BELIEVE.

139
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,958
- OH, WHAT'S SHE UP TO?

140
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,916
- EXCUSE ME, SIR?

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,958
- SYLIA'S BEEN DISAPPEARING
A LOT RECENTLY.

142
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,291
I MEAN,
EVEN MORE THAN USUAL.

143
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,958
- PERHAPS SHE HAS PERSONAL
BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.

144
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,666
- ( sighs )
I THINK SHE'S AVOIDING ME.

145
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,250
- THAT'S HER WAY.
- HUH?

146
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,000
- MISTRESS SYLIA
FINDS IT DIFFICULT

147
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,666
TO SHARE HER CONCERNS
WITH PEOPLE SHE CARES ABOUT.

148
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,666
- OH.
- IF SHE'S AVOIDING YOU,

149
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,000
IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S BUSY
WITH SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

150
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,666
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO
IS ACCEPT HER FEELINGS

151
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,333
AND WAIT UNTIL SHE'S READY
TO EXPLAIN HERSELF TO YOU.

152
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,625
- ( sighs )
THIS CAN'T WAIT.

153
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,333
- WHAT'S WRONG?

154
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,333
- I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

155
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,083
I'M SENSING SOMETHING.

156
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,708
IT'S AS IF SOMEONE
IS CALLING ME.

157
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,375
- DR. SHAN TOLD ME
THAT YOU WOULD ALREADY KNOW

158
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,875
HOW TO OPERATE
ONE OF THESE. 

159
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,833
- YES.  TELL HIM 
I SAID THANK YOU.

160
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,708
- AND REMEMBER,

161
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,916
IF YOU CAN'T RETURN IT,
MAKE SURE IT'S DESTROYED.

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,666
- BELIEVE ME,
I SINCERELY HOPE

163
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,958
I'LL HAVE THE CHANCE
TO RETURN IT TO YOU.

164
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,416
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

165
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,250
- THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING.

166
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,916
I'LL SEND YOU
A VIDEO FEED.

167
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,958
- Mason: THAT'S IT.
GET READY TO MOVE. 

168
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,916
- YES SIR.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,875
- WHY IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE DAY?

170
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,291
CANCEL MY SCHEDULE 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

171
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,125
- AS YOU WISH,
MR. MASON.

172
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,791
- I HAVE ONE MORE
LETTER FOR YOU.

173
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,208
( chuckles )

174
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,458
"E."

175
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,791
FOR END OF GAME.

176
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,458
- WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

177
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,791
SET UP A SKIRMISH LINE AND BLOCK
THE UNDERGROUND EXPRESS WAY.

178
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,958
I'LL STAY HERE
AND WAIT FOR MR. MASON.

179
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,916
- THIS IS MURAKAMI.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,166
READY TO DETONATE
THE CHARGES, SIR.

181
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,625
- Mason: GO AHEAD.
- BLOW IT!

182
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,708
- ( Nene sighs )
I'M STARVING.

183
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,708
HEY, MEGU.

184
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,041
MEGU!

185
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,500
- HUH?

186
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,000
YOU WANT LUNCH ALREADY?

187
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,333
- WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE?

188
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,333
- IT'S NOT LUNCH YET,
YOU KNOW?

189
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,500
IT'S 30 MINUTES TILL
WE CAN TAKE A BREAK.

190
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,541
- BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW.

191
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,416
- ( beeping ) 
- YOU'LL LIVE.

192
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,208
YOU'VE GOT A CALL
COMING IN.

193
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,416
- THIS IS THE AD POLICE
HOTLINE.

194
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,958
HUH?  YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S
BEEN SOME KIND OF EXPLOSION

195
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,083
IN THE UNDERGROUND
EXPRESSWAY

196
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,916
IN THE OUTSIDE WARD?

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,208
- OUTSIDE WARD NEAR THE EXIT,
OF THE SHINO SOBE INBOUND.

198
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,416
IN ADDITION
TO THE EXPLOSION,

199
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,541
THERE'S SOME KIND OF
UNAUTHORIZED ROAD BLOCK.

200
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,833
- ( Dispatchers chattering )

201
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,250
- HEY, WAIT.

202
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,208
WHY ARE THERE ARMORED BOOMERS
GUARDING THOSE TRUCKS?

203
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,750
- ( siren wailing )
- THE SUBJECTS APPEAR TO BE

204
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,208
DIGGING BENEATH
THE FREEWAY.

205
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,541
- ( gasps )
- REPEAT, SUBJECTS ARE DIGGING

206
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,875
BENEATH THE FREEWAY.

207
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,041
- THE LAB WAS BURIED
BY THE EARTHQUAKE.

208
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,291
WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT.

209
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,750
- ( grunts )

210
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,708
- THIS IS CHIEF MYLES.
- HUH?

211
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,416
- ALL UNIT MOBILIZATION
ORDERS ARE CANCELED.

212
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
- THE CHIEF.

213
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,916
- NO INTERFERENCE
WILL BE PERMITTED.

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,583
WE HAVE RECEIVED WORD
THAT THE INCIDENT...

215
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,250
- ...NOW OCCURRING IN
THE UNDERGROUND EXPRESS WAY

216
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,583
HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED
ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS.

217
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,791
THIS IS AN ORDER FROM
THE TOP BRASS.

218
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,833
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

219
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,791
- I REPEAT,
ALL DISPATCHED VEHICLES

220
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,125
WILL RETURN TO
THE STATION IMMEDIATELY.

221
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,500
- ( phone beeping )

222
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,958
- HI, YAMAZAKI HERE.

223
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,583
- Nene: LINNA, I THINK SYLIA'S
GONE TO DESTROY THE LAB.

224
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,708
- SHE DID WHAT?!

225
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,250
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT SOMETHING'S GOING ON

226
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,708
AND GENOM'S SENDING TROOPS
DOWN INTO THE TUNNEL SYSTEM.

227
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,958
- HAVE YOU CALLED PRISS?
- SHE'S ON HER WAY.

228
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,958
GO TO THE FRONT DOOR
AND SHE'LL PICK YOU UP.

229
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,125
- ROGER.
I'M ON MY WAY.

230
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,125
- COME ON.

231
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,125
WHY DID YOU WASTE TIME CHANGING?

232
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,708
- BECAUSE WITH THAT
STUPID SKIRT ON,

233
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,041
I'D HAVE TO RIDE SIDE SADDLE,
AND I'VE SEEN YOU DRIVE.

234
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,333
- GOOD POINT.
HANG ON.

235
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,000
- WHERE'S ALL THAT
SMOKE COMING FROM?

236
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,791
YEAH, MAYBE I CAN TAP INTO

237
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,833
THE TRAFFIC CONTROL
CAMERAS FROM HERE.

238
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,750
THAT'S NOT IT.  NO.

239
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,625
AH-HA!  THERE IT IS.

240
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,791
SYLIA.

241
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,541
- SYLIA!
- SYLIA!

242
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,666
- DID YOU FIND HER?

243
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
- NO.
SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT HERE.

244
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,833
I CHECKED AND
THE MOBILE PIT'S MISSING

245
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:42,958
AS WELL AS HER HARDSUIT.

246
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,750
- SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
PLANNING THIS FROM

247
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,875
THE VERY BEGINNING.

248
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,208
NO WONDER SHE GAVE IN
SO QUICKLY.

249
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,333
- YEAH.  REMIND ME TO
BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HER

250
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,000
ONCE WE'VE SAVED
HER SORRY ASS.

251
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,375
- I CLAIM SECONDS.
- COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO HURRY.

252
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,375
- THIS WAY, SIR.

253
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,666
- YOU DON'T DO THINGS
HALFWAY, DO YOU?

254
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,666
- NO, SIR.

255
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,041
- YES, THIS IS IT.

256
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,458
I FEEL HER PRESENCE.
SHE'S WAITING.

257
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,375
- AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

258
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,375
GOD HELP ME.

259
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,791
OKAY, I HAVE POWER.

260
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,333
NOW ALL I NEED IS TIME.

261
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,125
AND A LITTLE LUCK
WOULDN'T HURT.

262
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,666
BUTCHERS.

263
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,500
- OH, MAN.

264
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,500
I DON'T KNOW IF I
SHOULD BE DOING THIS.

265
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,083
( grunts )

266
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,833
( grunts )

267
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,625
- ( panting )

268
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,000
I'M SORRY IT HAD TO
COME TO THIS.

269
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,125
BUT IT'S TIME
TO SAY GOOD-BYE FOREVER.

270
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,458
- Mason: I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE.

271
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,000
- HUH?
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, SYLIA.

272
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,583
- Sylia: MASON!

273
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,541
- PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON
AND YOU WON'T BE HARMED.

274
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,916
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T
LET YOU HAVE IT, YOU BASTARD.

275
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,916
- A MICROWAVE CANNON.

276
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,250
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO
DESTROY THE CONTENTS

277
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,916
WITHOUT RELEASING
THE SEAL?

278
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,125
( chuckles )
I'M AFRAID THAT WON'T WORK.

279
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,250
GENOM TRIED THE SAME THING
SEVEN YEARS AGO

280
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,916
AND IT DIDN'T EVEN
SLOW HER DOWN.

281
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,916
- MAYBE SO,
BUT SEVEN YEARS AGO

282
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,791
GENOM DIDN'T HAVE
THE SKYHOOK.

283
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,291
- HMM.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

284
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,291
SHE'S USING THE SKYHOOK'S
ELECTRIC SURGE

285
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,125
AS A POWER SOURCE!

286
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,500
STOP HER!

287
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,208
- SYLIA?

288
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,333
- THE CONTENTS MUST BE
ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING LIQUID.

289
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,166
NOTHING COULD WITHSTAND
THAT KIND OF MICROWAVE BARRAGE.

290
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,625
- BUT YOU'RE TOO LATE.

291
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,083
- HUH?

292
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,625
MACKY!

293
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,666
- MACKY STINGRAY.

294
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,541
SO THE QUEEN HAS SUMMONED
HER DRONES, HAS SHE?

295
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,000
- OH, UH--

296
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,000
- MACKY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

297
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,875
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS,
SYLIA?

298
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,166
SHE'S AWAKE.

299
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,333
- NO, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!
- Nene: SYLIA!

300
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,958
- Linna: MY GOD.
- Priss: SYLIA. 

301
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,250
- Nene:
MACKY? MACKY?

302
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,208
- MACKY, NO!

303
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,708
- HUH?
( screaming )

304
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,708
- Soldiers:
GET BACK! LOOK OUT!

305
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,708
( screaming )

306
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,375
- WHAT?  WHAT THE--

307
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,833
( screaming )
- ( gunfire )

308
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,125
- MACKY!  GET BACK.
( screams )

309
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,541
SOMETHING'S GOT ME!

310
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,541
- NENE!
- ( grunts )

311
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,708
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I DON'T KNOW.

312
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,958
MY HARDSUIT'S
NOT RESPONDING LIKE IT SHOULD.

313
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,375
- Sylia: MACKY,
