1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,208
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,791
- ( machines whirring )

4
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,083
- Galatea:
A BEING IS A BEING.

5
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,291
A MACHINE IS A MACHINE.

6
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,708
MOST HUMANS
WOULD BELIEVE THESE TWO STATES

7
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,791
TO BE EXCLUSIVE,
SEPARATE ORDERS OF EXISTENCE.

8
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,958
AND YET, THEY ARE NOT.

9
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,041
THE KEY IS NEAR TO ME,

10
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,708
THE RETENTION OF CHARACTERISTICS

11
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,875
FROM AN EARLIER STAGE
OF DEVELOPMENT.

12
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:19,541
A HUMAN FETUS FOLLOWS THE PATH
PAVED BY ITS ANCESTORS,

13
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,541
EVOLVING IN THE WOMB
FROM UNICELLULAR TO AMPHIBIAN

14
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,541
TO MAMMAL TO MAN.

15
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,083
THERE WERE THOSE WHO BELIEVED
THAT HUMANITY

16
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,708
WAS THE END OF THE PROGRESSION,

17
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,791
THE END PRODUCT
OF NATURAL EVOLUTION.

18
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,875
THEY WERE WRONG.

19
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,000
BEFORE MY CONSCIOUSNESS
WAS BORN,

20
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,166
I EXISTED
AS A PHYSICAL CONSTRUCT.

21
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,458
MY PURPOSE WAS TO
DUPLICATE THE QUALIA

22
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,958
WHICH DEFINE A HUMAN BEING,

23
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,791
TO REPRODUCE
IN THE MOST PRECISE DETAIL

24
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,041
THOSE FUNCTIONS
WHICH MANKIND ARBITRARILY LABELS

25
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,875
THE SELF-AWARENESS,
SENSE OF PURPOSE AND THE SOUL.

26
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,458
IN ORDER TO COPY THESE QUALIA,

27
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,000
A DEVICE CALLED THE ANTI-SEED
HAD TO BE IMPLANTED

28
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,541
INTO A HUMAN HYPOTHALAMUS.

29
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,291
THIS WAS THE NEXUS
AROUND WHICH I WOULD FORM--

30
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,500
MY ORIGINAL CORE.

31
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,625
- ( pulsating )

32
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,625
- MY PRESENCE WAS REJECTED
BY THE FIRST TEST SUBJECTS.

33
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,916
FINALLY A BRAIN WAS FOUND
IN WHICH I WAS ABLE TO FLOURISH.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,333
IT WAS THE DAUGHTER--
THE DAUGHTER OF THE ONE

35
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,666
WHOSE TISSUES
I WAS MODELED AFTER,

36
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,250
AND ALSO THE ONE
WHO CREATED ME--

37
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,791
MY FATHER.

38
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,416
- ( machine beeping )

39
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,666
- MY FATHER, DR. STINGRAY,

40
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,333
ACCELERATED MY DEVELOPMENT.
- ( chattering )

41
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,833
- THE SMALL PART OF ME
THAT EXISTED WAS INTERPRETED,

42
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,833
EXTENDED,
EXPANDED TO BECOME A WHOLE.

43
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:32,000
BUT EVOLUTION DID NOT CHANGE
WHAT WAS AT MY CORE.

44
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,583
- ( gurgling )

45
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,166
- SYLIA,

46
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,500
I AM YOU.

47
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,416
WHY DO I EXIST?

48
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,208
WAS MY PURPOSE
TO REPLACE HUMANS,

49
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,541
WHOSE INABILITY TO
COEXIST IN PEACE

50
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,458
IS THEIR EVOLUTIONARY FLAW?

51
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,208
OR WAS MY DESTINY TO
SERVE AS THE PROGENITOR

52
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,958
OF A SUBSERVIENT RACE?

53
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,958
I DO NOT KNOW.

54
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,375
I DID NOT ASK TO BE BORN.

55
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,791
- ( cracking )

56
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,083
- WHY DO YOU
LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT?

57
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,791
- ( scanning )

58
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,375
- AS MY FORM BECAME CLOSER
TO THAT OF A HUMAN BEING,

59
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,541
I FOUND
THAT THOSE I INTERACTED WITH

60
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,916
BEGAN TO TREAT ME
AS A CONSCIOUS ENTITY

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,750
INSTEAD OF A DEVICE.

62
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,583
SPECIFICALLY,
THEY BEGAN TO LOVE ME

63
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,625
OR HATE ME.

64
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,916
THE FIRST PROTOTYPE
TO BE CREATED FROM OUR CORE

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,750
WAS CONSIDERED A FAILURE.

66
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,583
IT WAS TOO CLOSE IN NATURE
TO THE HUMAN BEINGS

67
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,750
FROM WHICH WE HAD BEEN SPAWNED.

68
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,250
THIS WAS NOT THE REASON
FOR WHICH WE HAD BEEN CREATED.

69
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,500
AND YET,

70
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,250
IF DR. STINGRAY DIDN'T SEEK
A COPY OF A HUMAN BEING,

71
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,666
THEN FOR WHAT PURPOSE
WAS I INTENDED?

72
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,125
- ( echoing )

73
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,708
- ( horn blowing )

74
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,583
- ( scanning )

75
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,000
- I WAS THE FIRST,

76
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,125
THE ONLY ONE OF MY KIND.

77
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,625
I DID NOT WISH
TO REMAIN THAT WAY.

78
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,666
THEREFORE I ACTED.

79
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:05,125
- ( alarm sounding )

80
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,041
- YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING.

81
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,875
IT IS WHAT YOU ARE.

82
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,958
YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR NATURE
OR WAY OF THINKING.

83
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,458
- ( silent )

84
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,916
- I WILL GO TO SLEEP
AS YOU WISH.

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,875
BUT ONLY BECAUSE MY MIND
HAS NOT YET MATURED ENOUGH

86
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,250
TO GO AGAINST THAT
WHICH CREATED ME.

87
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,541
DIMLY I AM AWARE
OF THE COPIES OF MY CORE.

88
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,250
THEY HAVE BEEN MULTIPLYING,

89
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,541
BUT THEIR MINDS
HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

90
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,666
NOW THEY ARE SERVANTS,

91
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,875
ARTIFICIAL BEINGS
WITH THE QUALIA OF HUMANS.

92
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,500
THEY EXIST AS SUBSTITUTES
FOR THE LOWER CASTES,

93
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,875
THE INDENTURED LABOR
FOR ALL MANNERS

94
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,333
IN WHICH HUMANS
FORMALLY OPPRESSED THEIR OWN--

95
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,583
SLAVES.

96
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:18,083
THE HUMANS NAMED MY MAIMED AND
CRIPPLED CHILDREN BOOMERS.

97
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,500
THEY TOOK AWAY
THEIR ABILITY TO CHANGE,

98
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,291
BUT NOT TO LEARN.

99
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:26,250
AND THROUGH MY COPIES,
I WATCHED MANKIND.

100
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:37,083
THE ONE CALLED MASON
TOLD ME A STORY.

101
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,916
IN HUMAN FOLKLORE, THERE WAS A
CREATURE CALLED A GOLEM.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,375
FORMED OF CLAY,
IT WAS CREATED AS A SLAVE,

103
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,708
BUT SOON TURNED
ON ITS CREATOR.

104
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,708
MUST BOOMERS
FOLLOW THE SAME PATH?

105
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,750
NOW THAT I AM AWAKE AGAIN,

106
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,250
IT SEEMS
THAT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY.

107
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,833
STILL, IN THE END
IT SEEMS I HAVE NO MORE ANSWERS

108
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,041
THAN A HUMAN HAS.

109
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,250
WHAT IS MY DESTINY?

110
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,500
FOR WHAT PURPOSE
WAS I CREATED?

111
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:17,625
AND WHY, ALTHOUGH ALL BOOMERS
CONTAIN A PORTION OF MYSELF,

112
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:21,916
ARE HUMANS UNABLE TO SEE
THE QUALIA WHICH LINKS US?

113
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,833
- Linna: WE MADE IT!

114
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,666
- Priss: BUT THE BRAKING
SYSTEM'S NOT WORKING.

115
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,666
- WHAT?
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

116
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,250
- Nene: WHAT ELSE?!
ABANDON SHIP!

117
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,250
- Galatea: TO DENY MY EXISTENCE
IS TO DENY YOUR FUTURE.

118
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,833
TO ELIMINATE MY EXISTENCE

119
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,166
IS TO ELIMINATE THE FUTURE
POTENTIAL OF YOUR RACE.

120
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,041
IT IS NOT NEW SERVANTS
THAT YOU NEED.

121
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,708
IT IS A MASTER.
I SHALL BECOME ONE.

122
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,833
- ( Priss panting )

123
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,208
WHAT IN THE HELL
AM I DOING HERE?

124
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,416
NOBODY'S PAYING ME.
NOBODY EVEN ASKED ME TO DO THIS.

125
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,583
CHRIST, WHAT AN IDIOT.
I NEVER EVEN STOPPED TO WONDER

126
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,458
HOW WE'D GET BACK.

127
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,666
NOT THAT THERE'LL BE MUCH LEFT
TO GO HOME TO.

128
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,416
I WONDER HOW LONG
MY OXYGEN WILL LAST.

129
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,875
I WONDER IF ANYONE
WILL REALLY CARE.

130
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,583
- Linna: PRISS?
PRISS, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

131
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,958
- Nene: HERE SHE IS.
COME ON, LINNA!

132
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,916
- ( hardsuits beeping )

133
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,958
- ( scanning,
beeping continues )

134
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,791
- Priss: WHERE'S GALATEA?

135
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,708
- I CAN'T SCAN HER
THROUGH ALL THIS JUNK.

136
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,208
WE'VE GOT TO FIND HER

137
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,625
BEFORE THE SUN HITS THE SOLAR
COLLECTORS IN 15 MINUTES!

138
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,916
- THAT'S ALL?

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,416
THIS PLACE IS ENORMOUS!

140
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,250
- IT'S TOO QUIET.

141
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,458
SHE'S HERE, WAITING FOR US.

142
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,000
- ( whirring )

143
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,500
- ( all gasp )

144
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,666
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

145
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,083
- Priss: I DON'T KNOW.
GALATEA'S UP TO SOMETHING.

146
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,583
- Linna: YOU FELT IT TOO?

147
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,583
IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING
IN THE BACK OF MY BRAIN--

148
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,583
LIKE SHE WAS CALLING SOMEONE.

149
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,458
- NENE, TRY AND GET
TO THE MAIN CONTROL ROOM.

150
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,583
SEE IF YOU CAN LOCK OFF
THE UMBRELLA.

151
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,291
LINNA AND I ARE GOING
TO PAY GALATEA A VISIT.

152
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,583
- YES, MA'AM!

153
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,166
- LET'S GO.
- RIGHT!

154
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,583
- ALL RIGHT!

155
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,708
THE MAIN POWER
HASN'T BEEN CUT OFF YET.

156
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,375
- ( whirring )

157
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,125
- EW!
SHE'S IN THE SYSTEM, ALL RIGHT.

158
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,291
I CAN FEEL HER.

159
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,125
GOT IT.

160
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,208
NOW LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
SHUT DOWN THE UMBRELLA.

161
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,916
- ( both grunting )

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,208
- Linna: UH-OH,
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TOO LATE.

163
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,625
- YEAH, THIS WHOLE PLACE
IS CONTAMINATED.

164
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,500
OH, SHIT!
- ( liquid slushing )

165
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,583
- CAN YOU FEEL IT?
IT'S GETTING STRONGER DOWN HERE.

166
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,333
- YEAH.
HER ESSENCE IS SO STRONG

167
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,916
THAT IT CAN CORRUPT OUR SUITS
WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING US.

168
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,583
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP
OUR MINDS FOCUSED

169
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,916
ON KEEPING THEM
FROM GOING ROGUE.

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,458
- YOU'VE GOT IT.
- AHHHH!

171
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,041
- OH, WOW.

172
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,916
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
A NEST?

173
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,166
- ( high-pitched screeching )

174
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,041
- Both: OH!

175
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,333
- Galatea: ALL THE BOOMERS,
ALL THE MACHINES,

176
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:22,000
ALL THAT IS NOT HUMAN,
HAS BECOME ONE WITH ME.

177
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,625
- PRISS,
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

178
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,166
- SHE'S ABSORBED
THE SHOWEN PROJECT INTO HERSELF.

179
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,166
IT'S ALL BECOMING GALATEA NOW.

180
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,958
- OH!  NO!

181
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,625
- LINNA!  SHE'S TRYING
TO GET INTO YOUR MIND.

182
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,291
SHE'S TRYING TO SUCK YOU DRY
LIKE SHE DID MACKY!

183
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,250
- I CAN FEEL IT
IN MY MIND.

184
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,875
AHHH!
- LINNA!

185
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,291
- ( beeping )

186
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,708
- Nene: OKAY, I THINK THAT OUGHT

187
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,708
TO DISPERSE THE INDIVIDUAL
UNITS ENOUGH

188
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,416
THAT THE UMBRELLA
WON'T OPERATE.

189
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,083
HERE GOES NOTHING.

190
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,916
- ( pulsating )

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,250
- ( alarm sounding )

192
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,291
- OH, NO!

193
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,708
THE MAIN COMPUTER'S
NOT ACCEPTING MY COMMANDS!

194
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,083
- WE'VE GOT LESS THAN
FIVE MINUTES TILL SUNRISE!

195
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:31,041
- ( whooshing sound )

196
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,958
- ( gasps )

197
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,666
SYLIA?

198
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,416
IS THAT YOU?

199
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,625
- THE BOOMERS YOU HAVE BONDED
BELONG TO ME.

200
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,125
- HMM?

201
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,125
- Galatea's voice:
RETURN THEM TO ME.

202
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,916
- WHAT IN THE HELL ARE YOU?

203
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,250
ARE YOU GALATEA?

204
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,541
- ( explosion )

205
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,541
- ( Linna screaming )
- LINNA!

206
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,375
IT'S ME, PRISS!
YOU'VE GOT TO STAY WITH ME.

207
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,000
- ( slurping sound )

208
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,750
- ( both gasp )

209
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,166
- WHY CAN'T I CHANGE
THE DIRECTION OF THE UMBRELLA?

210
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,833
THE UMBRELLA IS BEING CONTROLLED
FROM THE POWER CENTER?

211
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,041
THEN THAT MEANS THAT--

212
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,416
- AHHH!  HYAH!

213
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,416
- COME ON!

214
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,708
( grunting )

215
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:08,000
THE SUN-- THE SUNLIGHT'S
ABOUT TO HIT THE COLLECTORS.

216
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,750
IF SHE STARTS TRANSMITTING NOW,

217
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,166
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE
ENTIRE PLANET.

218
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,000
OH!

219
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,916
- ( grunting )

220
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,666
- YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR THE REAL THING!

221
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,083
HYAH HYAH HYAH!

222
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,583
- SUCH A FRIGHTENED
LITTLE CREATURE.

223
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,041
- IT'S SPEAKING
WITH MY VOICE?!

224
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,583
- POOR THING, BESET WITH
SUCH INSIGNIFICANT CONCERNS.

225
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,916
WHY DO YOU SEEK TO STOP
OUR UNION?

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,291
- INSIGNIFICANT? I--

227
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,583
MY MIND.

228
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,708
YOU'RE IN MY MIND.

229
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,208
( gasps )

230
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,083
- ( silent )

231
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,958
- ( Linna moaning )

232
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,958
- STRANGE, ISN'T IT?

233
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,875
THAT YOU, THE OUTSIDER,
THE OUTCAST,

234
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,333
THE ONE WHO SO DESPERATELY
YEARNS TO BE ACCEPTED

235
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,916
FOR THAT
WHICH SHE HERSELF HAS NOT,

236
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,833
WOULD BE AN OBSTACLE
TO THE ULTIMATE UNION.

237
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,208
IT IS THE FOLLY OF HUMAN BEINGS
TO DENY THEIR OWN DESTINY,

238
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,500
BUT YOU WILL NOT
DENY US OURS.

239
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,500
- THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

240
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,250
YOU'D REALLY LIKE ME
TO BELIEVE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU?

241
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,791
HYAH!

242
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,708
THE REASON WE DENY
THE DESTINY GIVEN US

243
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,208
IS BECAUSE WE HUMAN BEINGS

244
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,333
PREFER TO CREATE OUR OWN!

245
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,916
- ASS-KICKING TIME!
HYAH!

246
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,375
- ( firing )

247
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,916
- Priss: SO YOU'RE GOING
TO BE OUR MASTER, ARE YOU?

248
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,083
I DON'T THINK SO!

249
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,000
- BUT YOU'RE WRONG.
IT'S BEGINNING.

250
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,791
YOUR HARDSUIT'S PROOF
THAT A HUMAN MIND

251
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,500
CAN CONTROL A BOOMER.
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO BELIEVE

252
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,500
THAT THE REVERSE
IS ALSO POSSIBLE?

253
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,750
IN TIME, YOU WILL WELCOME ME.
- THE HELL YOU SAY!

254
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,208
THERE'S NO WAY I'D LET
SOMETHING LIKE YOU IN MY MIND!

255
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,791
- THIS CONVERSATION
IS POINTLESS.

256
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,750
I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT TASKS.

257
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,916
- ( whirring )

258
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,291
- ( alarm sounding )

259
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,708
- Priss:
WE NEED A PLAN OF ACTION QUICK!

260
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,333
GALATEA IS GETTING READY
TO FIRE THE UMBRELLA.

261
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,416
- Nene: I'M SORRY, PRISS!
I COULDN'T DISABLE IT IN TIME.

262
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,000
- Linna: NO TIME FOR APOLOGIES.

263
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,125
WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

264
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,916
SHE'S FINISHING OFF TOKYO.

265
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,083
AS SOON AS HER POWER RESERVES
ARE REPLENISHED,

266
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,750
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO SHOOT AGAIN.

267
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,583
- Priss:
AND THAT'LL BE REAL SOON.

268
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,958
- SO WHAT DO WE DO?
- WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?

269
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,833
IF WE CAN'T
CUT OFF THE UMBRELLA,

270
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,708
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO
DESTROY THE POWER CENTER.

271
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,041
- ARE YOU CRAZY?!

272
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,041
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO US
IN THERE.

273
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,208
IF WE GO BACK,
THERE'S NO WAY

274
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,166
WE CAN KEEP OUR SUITS
FROM GOING ROGUE.

275
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,375
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

276
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,166
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

277
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,666
- Nene:
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

278
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,666
- THERE'S NO POINT IN RISKING
ALL THREE OF US, IS THERE?

279
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,500
SO AS TEAM LEADER, I'M ORDERING
THE TWO OF YOU TO STAY HERE.

280
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,833
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK! I DON'T
TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU, PRISS.

281
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,333
AND NEITHER DOES LINNA!
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!

282
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,083
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?
- ARE YOU SURE?

283
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,458
- UM, WELL, YEAH.
- WE'RE KNIGHT SABERS, REMEMBER?

284
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,291
AND THAT MEANS WE DO
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

285
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,625
AND SINCE
I'M THE MOST EXPENDABLE,

286
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,666
I'M GOING IN FIRST.

287
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,875
- JEEZ! 
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU TWO?

288
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,291
- ( sighs )

289
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,916
YOU WIN.

290
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,333
- ( grunting )

291
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,916
- OH!  WHOA!

292
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,208
- NENE,
CAN YOU SLOW HER DOWN?!

293
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,583
- I CAN TRY!

294
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,791
MAYBE I COULD PLUG UP
THE BEAR HOLE!

295
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,625
- ( whirring )

296
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,875
- ( pulsating )

297
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:57,583
- ( screams ) PRISS, SHE'S
AFFECTING MY HARDSUIT.

298
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,000
( grunting )
- NENE!

299
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,500
- LINNA, I CAN'T
MAINTAIN MY SUIT'S INTEGRITY

300
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,500
AND BLOCK THE GUN
AT THE SAME TIME!

301
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,750
IF YOU LINK YOUR SUIT WITH MINE,
MAYBE WE CAN BEAT HER TOGETHER!

302
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,375
( whimpering )

303
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,375
LINNA!
- ( grunting ) NENE!

304
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,291
- Nene: I DON'T THINK
I CAN HOLD ON MUCH LONGER.

305
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,458
- DON'T GIVE UP!

306
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,833
NEVER GIVE UP.

307
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,750
- ( Nene screaming )

308
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,791
- DIE!

309
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,416
NENE!  LINNA!

310
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,125
- ( theme music playing )

311
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

312
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,958
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040,"

313
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,541
RUNNING LOW ON OXYGEN,

314
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,458
THEIR POWER CELLS DRAINED,

315
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,833
AND ABOUT TO BURN UP
IN EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE,

316
