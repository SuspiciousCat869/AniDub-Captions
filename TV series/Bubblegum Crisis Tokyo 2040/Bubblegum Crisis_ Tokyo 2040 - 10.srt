1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,208
- IT'S EATING THAT BOOMER.

4
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,583
- UH... OKAY.

5
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,125
THE ROGUE BOOMER'S
BEEN DESTROYED.

6
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,250
GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW.

7
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,208
- EAT THIS!
- NENE!

8
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,833
- OH!

9
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,583
- DAMN,
THIS IS GETTING NUTS.

10
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,208
WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU GUYS?

11
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,083
- YOU IDIOT!  WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU SUIT IT FOR?

12
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,625
- IT SEEMED LIKE THE THING
TO DO.

13
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,625
- THE AREA'S BEEN CLOSED OFF
AS PER YOUR ORDERS.

14
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,625
WE'VE SET UP A COVER STORY
THAT THERE WAS A CAVE IN

15
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,625
AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE.

16
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,666
MAINTAINING SECURITY
SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

17
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,041
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE COMPANY
THAT WAS ACTUALLY DOING

18
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,791
THE EXCAVATION WAS
A GENOM SUBSIDIARY.

19
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,958
- OF COURSE.

20
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,458
- WE MAY HAVE TO
BUY OFF SOME WITNESSES

21
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,250
FOR A COMPLETE COVER UP.
- HMM.

22
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,250
I'M SURE YOU'LL COME UP
WITH SOMETHING.

23
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,625
- WE'LL HANDLE IT.

24
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,125
- A MONSTER THAT EATS BOOMERS.
HMM.

25
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,000
HOW INTERESTING.

26
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,666
- INCREASE THE EXTENSION RATIO
BY 5%.

27
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,666
- RIGHT, NIGEL.

28
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,125
SYLIA.

29
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,375
- ABOUT NENE.

30
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,583
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T
COMPLETELY HER FAULT.

31
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,208
- I KNOW THAT.

32
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:17,583
- CALL IT OFF?!
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

33
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,791
CLOSE THE DAMN DOOR, DALEY.

34
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,000
- HOW CAN YOU DO THIS
WITH THAT THING OUT THERE?

35
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,291
- I WAS TOLD TO.  THAT MONSTER'S
OUT OF OUR JURISDICTION.

36
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,333
- ARE YOU CRAZY?  WHO ELSE COULD
STOP A MONSTER LIKE THAT?

37
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,458
- WAS IT A BOOMER, LEON?

38
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:35,041
- WAS IT-- WELL, NO.
- NO, IT WASN'T, WAS IT?

39
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,250
AND WHAT'S OUR JOB HERE?
- TO CONTROL BOOMER CRIME, SIR.

40
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,250
- DALEY!
- WE FIGHT BOOMERS

41
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,916
AND NOTHING ELSE.
- GIVE ME A BREAK, DAMN IT!

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,416
IF THE ADP DOESN'T GO AFTER IT,
THEN WHO WILL?

43
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,875
THE FREAKIN' POUND?

44
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,833
AND WHY ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
ON THE NEWS?

45
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,958
THE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
THAT THING'S OUT THERE.

46
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,208
- DAMN IT, LEON, SINCE WHEN
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE NEWS

47
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,208
TELL THE TRUTH
ABOUT ANYTHING WE DO?

48
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,791
- ( gulps )

49
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,375
- AND LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING
MORE, MR. HOT SHOT DETECTIVE,

50
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,750
THE 28TH IS OFF LIMITS,
SO JUST STAY AWAY FROM THERE.

51
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,166
- ( grunting )

52
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,875
( growls )

53
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,875
- SIR.

54
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,083
- I HATE THIS JOB.
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

55
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,583
IT REALLY PISSES ME OFF.

56
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,041
- DON'T GET SO EXCITED.
HAVEN'T YOU FIGURED OUT BY NOW

57
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,375
THAT THE WAY OUR BELOVED LEADERS
HANDLE RESPONSIBILITY

58
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,416
IS TO STICK THEIR HEADS
IN THE SAND TILL IT GOES AWAY?

59
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

60
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:38,125
- BECAUSE I ALREADY HAD
AN ALTERNATE PLAN, OF COURSE.

61
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:43,375
- HUH?
- MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE,

62
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,583
BUT IF HE HADN'T BEEN
SO PISSED,

63
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,583
THE CHIEF MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED.

64
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,833
- MAN, I'M GLAD YOU'RE
ON MY SIDE.

65
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,958
- WE'RE HOPELESSLY LINKED
TOGETHER, IDIOT.

66
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,500
- ( sighs )

67
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,125
- HI.  WHAT'S UP?

68
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,541
- HI.

69
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,500
- NOT SO LOUD.  ARE YOU OKAY?

70
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,416
- OKAY WHAT?

71
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,375
- YEAH.  UM...

72
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,125
I MEAN,
YOU TOOK A NASTY SPILL.

73
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,958
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU
HAD ANY BRUISES OR ANYTHING.

74
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,291
- OH, NO, I'M FIT AS A FIDDLE.
SEE, EVERYTHING WORKS.

75
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:30,125
NO BRUISES.  HEY, WAIT.
DO YOU HURT AFTER A MISSION?

76
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,833
- WELL, SOMETIMES.  A LITTLE.

77
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,166
- WELL, I FEEL JUST PEACHY.

78
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,291
I GUESS OLD AGE HAS CAUGHT UP
WITH YOU ALREADY.

79
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:42,291
- RIGHT.  WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY, NENE.

80
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,750
BYE NOW.

81
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,416
- ( groans )

82
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,250
- Leon: OH, NENE.

83
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,666
( laughs )

84
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,666
- I'M AFRAID I'M NOT
IN ANY KIND OF A MOOD

85
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,000
TO PLAY GAMES WITH YOU TODAY,
SO BUG OFF, LEO.

86
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,333
- LEO?
- LEO.

87
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,416
- LOOK, I JUST NEED A FAVOR,
NENE.

88
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,875
- LIKE PRISS' EMAIL?
- HMM?

89
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,208
- TOUGH.  YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE
AND YOU BLEW IT, LEO.

90
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,375
- JUST WHAT'S ALL THIS
ABOUT PRISS' EMAIL?

91
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,583
- LOOK, I TOLD YOU. I DON'T NEED
ANY HELP LIKE THAT FROM YOU.

92
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,208
- OH, SURE, WE ALL KNOW WHAT
A LOUSY HACKER YOU ARE,

93
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,250
MR. ALL-THUMBS.

94
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,750
- YEAH. AND I'D LIKE
TO KNOW WHY YOU

95
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,583
HAVEN'T TOLD YOUR PARTNER
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

96
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,041
- THIS FAVOR HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HER.

97
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,500
- HMM.

98
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,750
- DOCTOR.
- YES. MR. MASON.

99
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,375
WE'VE JUST BEEN WAITING FOR YOU
TO GIVE THE ORDER

100
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,166
TO ENTER THE SHAFT.
- THEN LET'S PROCEED.

101
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,208
- YES, SIR.

102
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,708
- THIS ENTIRE PROJECT IS
TO REMAIN CLASSIFIED TOP-SECRET,

103
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,500
SPECIAL "A" CLASS.
NOBODY IS TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT

104
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,291
WITHOUT MY EXPRESS PERMISSION.
NOBODY.

105
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,125
- ABSOLUTELY.
AS YOU WISH, SIR.

106
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,708
- YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT
INCLUDES CHAIRMAN ROSENKREUTZ?

107
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,083
- YES, SIR.  THAT'S WHY
I WAS CAREFUL TO CHOOSE

108
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,333
ONLY TEAM MEMBERS
FROM THE LIST THAT YOU PROVIDED.

109
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:18,125
SECURITY SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.
- GOOD.

110
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,208
- I MUST ADMIT THAT I'M A BIT
SURPRISED BY YOUR INTEREST

111
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,583
IN THIS, MR. MASON.
GIANT MONSTERS AREN'T YOUR

112
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,583
USUAL AREA OF EXPERTISE,
ARE THEY?

113
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,166
- I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THE MONSTER, DOCTOR.

114
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,041
- THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

115
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,083
- I HAVE OTHER INTERESTS.

116
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:36,083
FINDING THIS MONSTER IS
JUST VERY CONVENIENT FOR ME.

117
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,333
AND BESIDES,
IF THAT THING EATS BOOMERS,

118
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,041
IT MAY HAVE COME
FROM THE SAME PLACE

119
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,041
AS WHAT I'M REALLY SEEKING.

120
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,166
- HUH?

121
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,083
- Woman: ( whispers )
OH, MY GOD.  DID YOU SEE THAT?

122
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,166
- HMM.

123
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,750
- ( laughing )

124
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,666
- ( shivering )

125
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,291
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

126
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,708
WHY AM I SO AFRAID?

127
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,541
- OH.  WELL, HELLO, PRISS.

128
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,541
- WHAT'S THIS COST?

129
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,458
- THAT?  WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TRY IT ON?

130
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:09,416
- NO.

131
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,250
- YOU'RE CERTAINLY HARD
ON THINGS, AREN'T YOU?

132
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,166
NIGEL JUST FINISHED FIXING
YOUR LATEST DAMAGE.

133
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,916
- SYLIA, CAN YOU SPARE ME
THE LECTURE THIS ONCE?

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,875
MY LIFE'S NOT WORTH MUCH,
BUT IT'S MINE TO RISK.

135
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,750
IF I SCREW UP OUT THERE,
I'M READY TO TAKE THE FALL,

136
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,041
BUT IF SOMEONE ELSE GETS HURT,
I DON'T WANNA SEE THAT COMING

137
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,208
DOWN ON MY HEAD.

138
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,250
- LIKE NENE?
- I'M NOT SAYING WHO'S RIGHT

139
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,666
OR WHO'S WRONG,
BUT WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO

140
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,375
IS THAT I CAN'T KEEP WORKING
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

141
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,041
I CAN'T.
- JUST WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

142
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,000
- TO LET HER GO.

143
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,250
SHE CAN'T CUT IT ANYMORE.

144
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,916
THE BOOMERS WE'VE BEEN FACING

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,625
HAVE BEEN GETTING WORSE
EVERY TIME.

146
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,000
HOW LONG UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO HER?

147
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,375
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT, SYLIA.

148
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,750
- ARE YOU IN A GAMBLING MOOD,
PRISS?

149
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,166
- HMM?

150
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,083
- A BET. IF YOU WIN,
I'LL TAKE HER OFF THE TEAM.

151
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,291
HOWEVER, IF I WIN,
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO

152
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,083
ONE LITTLE THING
I WANT YOU TO DO.

153
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,916
- I SHAVED THE WEIGHT ROLLER
GUIDE

154
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,916
BY .7 MILLIMETERS.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,208
- SO GIVING THE DRIVING BELT
MORE PLAY MEANS

156
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,250
THAT YOU INCREASE
THE MAXIMUM ROTATIONS,

157
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,875
BUT SACRIFICE SOME CONTROL.
- IT NEEDS A NEW MUFFLER.

158
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,458
- RIGHT.  OH.

159
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,458
NENE.
- HI.

160
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,750
- I'M SORRY ABOUT SYLIA.

161
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:48,583
- OH, NO, I DON'T MIND.
I'M USED TO HER.

162
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,791
- I'M SURE SHE KNOWS THAT
IT WAS ALL PARTIALLY HER FAULT.

163
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,541
BUT SHE'S NOT THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO CAN ADMIT THAT EASILY.

164
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,250
- ACTUALLY--
- HUH?

165
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,875
- I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK SYLIA'S RIGHT.

166
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,416
I MEAN, LINNA JUST JOINED

167
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,291
AND SHE'S ALREADY MUCH BETTER
THAN I AM, YOU KNOW?

168
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,208
IT WAS ONE THING WHEN IT
WAS JUST ME AND PRISS,

169
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,208
BUT NOW I--
- BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE, NENE.

170
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,208
I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT
OF THINGS YOU CAN DO

171
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,833
THAT THEY CAN'T.
- ARE YOU TRYING

172
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,500
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?
- UH-HUH.

173
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:27,000
- ( sighs )

174
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,541
- NENE, YOU'RE OUR EYES AND EARS
INSIDE THE AD POLICE.

175
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,916
AND WHEN IT COMES TO COMPUTERS,

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
NOT EVEN SYLIA CAN DO
THE THINGS YOU DO.

177
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,666
- I'M OKAY.
- ( beeps )

178
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,250
- BUT I'M SURE SYLIA COULD FIND
A LOT OF OTHER HACKERS

179
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,875
IF SHE WANTS TO.

180
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,958
- NOT LIKE YOU.
YOU CAN ANALYZE A DATA FILE

181
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,000
BEFORE IT'S EVEN BEEN DOWNLOADED
INTO YOUR SYSTEM.

182
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:52,000
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
- HUH?

183
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,958
- WHAT IS IT?
- OH, MY GOD!

184
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,041
THOSE IDIOTS TOOK ARMORED
JACKETS AND CLIMBING GEAR OUT

185
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,416
FROM THE DEPOT.

186
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,875
THEY WENT DOWN THERE.

187
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,291
- HUH?

188
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:28,208
- OKAY, WE TURN RIGHT
AT THIS INTERSECTION.

189
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,875
- OH, YEAH, YOU SURE
WE CAN TRUST THAT MAP?

190
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,541
- OF COURSE.
NENE DOWNLOADED IT

191
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,291
FROM A TOP SECRET CLASSIFIED
SERVER IN THE DEPARTMENT

192
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,625
OF PUBLIC SAFETY.
SHE MAY BE ANNOYING AT TIMES,

193
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,125
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HACKING,
SHE'S MIGHTY IMPRESSIVE.

194
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,125
- WHAT ABOUT HER?

195
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,583
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'D TURN US
INTO THE DIRECTOR.

196
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:48,583
- GIVE ME A LITTLE CREDIT
FOR INTELLIGENCE, WILL YOU?

197
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:52,541
I TOLD HER I NEEDED THE MAP
FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CASE.

198
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,750
OKAY, THIS IS IT.

199
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,125
MONSTER CENTRAL.

200
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,000
LOOKS PRETTY QUIET.

201
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,291
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?
- HMM?

202
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,208
BOOMERS?  WHAT ARE
THEY DOING HERE?

203
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,958
- WAIT.

204
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,375
- ( both gasp )

205
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,583
- WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

206
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,458
- I SAID WE'D STICK TOGETHER
NO MATTER WHAT,

207
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,916
BUT IF WE FIND A GUY
WITH A PITCHFORK.

208
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,666
- SOMETHING MUST BE BLOCKING
THE TRACKING BEACON, SIR.

209
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,458
- TAP INTO THOSE COMM CABLES.

210
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,625
THEN SEND THEM IN.

211
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,500
- WAIT.
- HUH?  WHAT'S WRONG?

212
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,583
- I'M PICKING UP
A LOCATOR BEACON.

213
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,750
- A LOCATOR?
- UH-HUH.

214
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,708
AND IT'S COMING
FROM THE 28TH WARD

215
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,583
ON SOMETHING THAT'S
AS FAR DOWN AS WE ARE.

216
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,125
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

217
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,541
BUT THE CODE'S NOT THE ONE
THE AD POLICE USES.

218
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:37,333
- CODE SCHMODE.
AT LEAST IT'S SOME KIND OF LEAD.

219
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,333
LET'S GO.
- RIGHT.

220
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,750
- HUH?  WOW.

221
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,125
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

222
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,041
- IT'S SOME KIND OF
LAB FACILITY.

223
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,041
- IT MUST BE PRE-QUAKE.

224
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,541
THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS MUST
HAVE KEPT IT FROM COLLAPSING.

225
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,708
- YEAH, BUT SINCE IT WAS
NEVER ON ANY MAP,

226
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,750
NO ONE EVER KNEW
IT WAS DOWN HERE.

227
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:07,666
- WHAT A PERFECTLY WONDERFUL
PLACE FOR A MONSTER TO HIDE.

228
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,958
- SO MUCH FOR MONSTER HUNTERS.

229
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,750
- POOR BASTARDS.

230
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,958
- ( both scream )

231
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,208
- THIS IS JUST GREAT.

232
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,416
IT THINKS WE'RE DINNER.

233
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,000
WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?
- IT'S LIKE SOME KIND OF

234
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,583
EMP WEAPON.

235
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,666
- ( grunting )

236
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,250
- HEY, I THINK IT ONLY
PARALYZES BOOMERS.

237
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,625
- LUCKY US.

238
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,750
NO PLACE TO RUN.

239
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,916
- I'D REALLY PREFER TO DIE
IN BED.

240
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,791
LEON!

241
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,250
- COME ON.

242
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,083
- LET'S DO IT.
- RIGHT.

243
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,166
- HOW DO THEY KEEP DOING IT?

244
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,083
DO I HAVE A TRACKING BEACON
ON MY BUTT OR WHAT?

245
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,541
- HYAH! THIS LOOKS LIKE IT!

246
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,500
WELL, WELL,
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

247
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,416
- ALL RIGHT!

248
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,000
THE EMERGENCY POWER'S
STILL ACTIVE.

249
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,500
- ONE OF THE OLD FACILITIES
JUST WENT ONLINE.

250
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,583
DATA COLLECTION ENGAGED.  GET
THOSE BACKUP SYSTEMS ROLLING.

251
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,458
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE
ANY OF THIS DATA.

252
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,500
I WANT TRIPLE REDUNDANT STORAGE.

253
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,333
- SYLIA, IT'S THE DATA
ON THAT MONSTER.

254
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,791
SYLIA.
- THAT MONSTER'S RAY.

255
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,000
IT SUCKED THE POWER
FROM THOSE BOOMER'S BATTERIES.

256
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,333
THAT MEANS--
OH, MY GOD.

257
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,916
OH, THE SUIT.
- SYLIA.

258
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,458
- MACKEY!
- WHAT?

259
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,666
- GET MY SUIT READY FOR LAUNCH
RIGHT NOW.

260
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,083
DO IT!

261
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,375
- DAMN.  MY KNUCKLEBALL
DIDN'T EVEN SCRATCH IT.

262
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,500
NENE, HOW'S IT COMING?

263
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,166
- ANY SECOND NOW?

264
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,541
( screaming )

265
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,708
- THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THEIR SUITS.

266
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,958
- PRISS, CAN YOU MOVE AT ALL?
- NO.

267
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,708
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE
I'M GONNA LOSE THE BET.

268
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,708
- HUH?  WHAT BET?

269
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,500
- IF NENE PERFORMS POORLY
ON YOUR NEXT MISSION,

270
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,375
I LOSE AND SHE'S OFF
THE TEAM.

271
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,583
BUT IF SHE DOES BETTER THAN YOU,
I WIN.

272
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,583
ARE YOU GAME?

273
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,583
- OKAY, YOU'RE ON.

274
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,458
- ISN'T THERE SOME WAY
TO HELP THEM?

275
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:11,333
- SURE THERE IS.
START PRAYING.

276
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,458
IT'S THE OTHER ONE.

277
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,666
- LINNA, PRISS,

278
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,833
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

279
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,375
- SYLIA, BEHIND YOU!

280
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,541
- SYLIA!
- SYLIA!

281
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,458
- NO!

282
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,458
- SYLIA!
- SYLIA!

283
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,458
- HUH?

284
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,833
- PAPA.
- SYLIA!

285
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,666
COME ON,
OPEN YOUR BIG FAT MOUTH.

286
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,000
THAT'S WHERE YOUR WEAK SPOT IS.

287
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,708
THERE!

288
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,791
( coughing )

289
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,250
- HUH?

290
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,208
- OH!

291
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,666
- Man:
THERE'S NO DOUBT, SIR,

292
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,500
THE ABANDONED FACILITY

293
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,666
WE FOUND WAS DEFINITELY

294
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,083
A CLASSIFIED BIOSCAPE
RESEARCH CENTER.

295
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,416
WHILE IT WAS BOOMER RELATED,

296
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,125
WE COULDN'T FIND ANY REFERENCE
TO THE PROJECT SERIES

297
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,208
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.
- I SEE.

298
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,208
- NOW THE MONSTER APPEARS
TO HAVE BEEN THE OFFSHOOT

299
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,000
OF AN EARLY BIOTECHNICAL
CONSTRUCT.

300
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,083
IT WAS BASED ON A CREATURE
FROM THE--

301
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,583
- TURN IT OFF.

302
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,583
- Sylia: I'M SORRY, PRISS,
BUT YOU DID LOSE OUR BET.

303
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:19,000
BESIDES, YOU LOOK
SO PRETTY IN PINK.

304
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,458
HOLD STILL.
- ( laughing )

305
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,833
THIS ONE'S FOR THE MAKEOVER
OF THE MONTH.

306
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,416
YEAH, YOU'LL NEVER
LIVE THIS ONE DOWN.

307
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,250
HEY, COME ON, SAY CHEESE.

308
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,791
- ( camera shutter clicks )

309
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,583
- OKAY, WHO WANTS 8 x 10s?

310
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,208
- YOU LOOK SO GREAT.

311
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,375
