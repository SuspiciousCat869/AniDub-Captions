1
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,791
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,041
- ( police sirens )

4
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,375
- OH, COME ON.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

5
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,250
Daley: IT'S NO JOKE, AND SINCE
IT ESCAPED FROM A CLASSIFIED

6
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,458
MILITARY HANGAR, YOU CAN BET
<i>WE</i> WON'T BE LAUGHING.

7
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,541
ALTHOUGH, IT MIGHT BE FUNNY
IF THEY DECIDED TO SEND YOU 

8
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,041
TO JAIL FOR DESTROYING
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.

9
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,708
- ( bangs fist ) SAY WHAT? ARE
THEY REALLY THREATENING THAT?

10
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:11,916
- ( sighs )

11
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,208
- DAMN, WHY DON'T THEY
JUST LET US SHOOT IT?

12
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,583
- IT'S UP TO YOU, PRISS.
NENE CAN'T GET AWAY 

13
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,291
AND I JUST FOUND OUT
LINNA'S NOT EVEN IN THE CITY.

14
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,083
- I FORGOT TO TELL YOU, SHE
MIGHT NOT BE COMING BACK.

15
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:38,500
- WHAT?!

16
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,458
- ( sighs ) THERE'S NO WAY.

17
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,666
EVEN IF I HAD THE CASH FOR
THE METRO EXPRESS

18
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,291
THE STATION'S AN HOUR AWAY.

19
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,583
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD
POSSIBLY GET THERE IN TIME.

20
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,750
- I THINK WE'D BETTER
BE GETTING BACK, LINNA.

21
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:49,708
IT'S TIME FOR DINNER.

22
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,916
- OH, DINNER?

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,791
GREAT, JUST GREAT.

24
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,000
THERE'S NO WAY I'M READY
TO MAKE A DECISION LIKE THIS.

25
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,416
THIS IS REALLY GOING
TO SCREW THINGS UP.

26
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,375
- MAYBE WE CAN HAVE
A NICE, LONG TALK OVER DINNER.

27
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:07,333
COME ON, LET'S GO.

28
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:11,375
Man: ROGER, PLEASE KEEP THE
CIRCUIT IN S-MODE AS IT IS.

29
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,083
TARGET IS NOT
CURRENTLY IN MOTION.

30
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,875
- ROGER THAT, COMMANDER F.

31
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,291
ASSAULT GROUPS 3 AND 5 ARE
TAKING POSITION.

32
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,750
WE HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED
PERMISSION TO ATTACK BOOMER,

33
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,458
ALL UNITS STAND BY.

34
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,541
( groans ) WAIT A SECOND HERE--

35
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,375
THIS IS THE ADP
INFORMATION CENTER.

36
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,666
YES MA'AM, THE NORMAL
POLICE HAVE BEEN ASKED

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,000
TO ASSIST WITH THE
CIVILIAN EVACUATION.

38
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,208
HUH?  THERE ARE TWO <i>MORE</i>
GIANT BOOMERS?

39
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,125
- MORE OF THEM!

40
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,500
- I KNEW IT,

41
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,541
THE MOD ARE GOING TO TRY TO
TAKE IT OUT THEMSELVES.

42
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,625
I GUESS NOT EVEN THE ARMY
TRUSTS US THESE DAYS.

43
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,583
- ( rumbling )

44
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,375
- SYLIA!

45
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,500
- TAKE OVER, I'M DRIVING THE
MOBILE PIT OUT TO SUPPORT PRISS.

46
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,666
- I'M ON IT!

47
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,125
- IT'S LIKE A COMBAT ZONE
OUT THERE.

48
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,041
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN INSANE
TO BUILD A BOOMER THAT BIG.

49
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,208
OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO THROW
EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT AT IT

50
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,541
AND PRAY.

51
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,708
- AN EVACUATION ORDER FOR

52
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,333
ALL CIVILIANS
RESIDING IN AREA G3

53
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,000
IS NOW IN EFFECT. 

54
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:22,000
THE DETAILS AND CAUSE OF THIS
INCIDENT ARE NOT YET CLEAR...

55
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,916
- ( melancholy piano )

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,541
- I'M SORRY, MASAKI,

57
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,791
BUT SOMETHING'S COME UP THAT
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF.

58
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,916
YOU'RE A REALLY NICE GUY,

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
AND I'M SORRY TO RUN OUT
ON YOU LIKE THIS, BUT--

60
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,250
BUT I'VE GOT RESPONSIBILITIES
I CAN'T IGNORE.

61
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,541
AND IF I WAIT ANY LONGER,

62
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,958
THE THING I WANT MIGHT
NOT BE THERE ANYMORE.

63
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,708
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

64
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,916
- THROWING MY OWN WORDS
BACK AT ME, HUH?

65
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:58,875
( sighs ) I REALLY DO UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM, LINNA.

66
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,625
BUT I GUESS THAT THE
TIME ALWAYS COMES

67
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,541
WHERE SOMEONE HAS
TO MAKE A CHOICE--

68
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,125
WHEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER
TO STICK WITH WHAT YOU HAVE,

69
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,875
OR BURN YOUR BRIDGES BEHIND YOU.

70
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:11,500
- YOU'RE RIGHT.  I GUESS YOU
DO UNDERSTAND.

71
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,000
WHICH IS GOOD,

72
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,166
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO ASK FOR A
REALLY BIG FAVOR FROM YOU.

73
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,291
- A FAVOR?

74
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I ASKED THAT.

75
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,250
OR THAT HE ACTUALLY
LOANED ME THE MONEY.

76
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,333
- ( sighs )

77
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,083
BUT I HAD TO,

78
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,250
FOR PRISS.

79
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,958
- THOSE IDIOTS!

80
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,708
- UH-HUH, ONE MORE HIGH-RISE
FOR URBAN RENEWAL.

81
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,416
BUT AT LEAST THE ARMY
WILL TAKE THE BLAME.

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,958
- LOOK!

83
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,625
- ( rumbling )

84
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,208
- TO HELL WITH THE FEDS,
THAT THING'LL DESTROY THE CITY.

85
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,500
IF WE DON'T STOP THAT BOOMER,
WHO WILL?

86
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,458
- ( screeches )

87
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,291
Roland: - ALRIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

88
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,458
TELL THE GENERAL
HIS TEAM BLEW IT.

89
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,416
WE'RE MOVING IN!

90
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,833
YOU HEARD ME, GET MOVING!

91
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,875
THAT THING'S A BOOMER,
AND WE'RE TAKING IT OUT.

92
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,708
Daley:
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

93
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,083
Officer: - SIR, I JUST REALIZED
THAT THING WAS USING

94
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,333
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES.

95
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,250
Roland:
- SWEET JESUS, YOU'RE RIGHT!

96
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,208
FIREBEES, GET THE HELL
OUT OF THERE!

97
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,875
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

98
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,458
- IT'S THE KNIGHT SABERS.

99
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,625
( grunting )

100
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,583
- BYE-BYE.

101
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,875
HUH?

102
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,583
- NENE, SYLIA'S NOT GOING TO
BE ABLE TO MAKE IT IN TIME!

103
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,125
- ( gasps)

104
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,208
- IT'S NO GOOD, THOSE JERKS
AT GENOM ARE STILL REFUSING

105
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,041
TO DECLASSIFY THE SCHEMATICS
FOR THAT BOOMER.

106
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,291
- ALRIGHT, IF THEY
WON'T COOPERATE

107
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,208
MAYBE WE CAN GET THEM
FROM THE ARMY ITSELF.

108
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,250
- HEY, I CAN'T LET YOU HACK
INTO THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.

109
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,458
- THEN TURN YOUR BACK
AND CLAIM YOU DIDN'T SEE IT.

110
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,875
( thinking )
HOLD ON, PRISS.

111
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,875
- ( cars honking )

112
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,333
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!

113
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,541
MY HOUSE IS RIGHT THERE, I'VE
GOT TO GO SAVE MY FAMILY!

114
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,166
Police Officer: - I'M SORRY SIR,
WE CAN'T LET ANYONE THROUGH.

115
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,458
IF YOU DON'T RETURN TO
YOUR VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY,

116
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,166
WE'LL BE FORCED TO ARREST YOU!

117
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,000
- I CAN'T GET THROUGH.

118
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,958
- ( screaming )

119
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,333
- I DON'T GET IT, WHY 
WON'T YOU DIE?!

120
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,791
- THIS ISN'T THE EASIEST HACK
I'VE EVER DONE, 

121
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,166
BUT AT LEAST IT'S NOT AS BAD
AS CRACKING INTO GENOM.

122
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,583
- ( beeping )

123
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,958
- WHAT PROGRAM'S THAT?
- A PARASITE BOMB.

124
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,083
IT'S LIKE A VIRUS COMBINED WITH
A LOW-VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL PULSE.

125
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,791
THE SURGE SNAPS THE SYSTEM,
AND THE VIRUS UPLOADS ITSELF.

126
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,541
- AND YOU'RE SENDING IT
TO THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT?!

127
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,875
- I'M GOING TO BLOW
THEIR FIREWALL AND GRAB THE DATA

128
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,916
BEFORE THEIR DEFENSE SYSTEM
KICKS IN.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,250
OTHERWISE, THIS COULD TAKE
HOURS TO HACK.

130
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,958
- OKAY, I DIDN'T SEE
ANY OF THIS, IT NEVER HAPPENED.

131
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,000
- HERE WE GO!

132
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,916
- WHERE IS THE CORE?

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,875
- ( screams )

134
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,041
Priss: - MACKY, HOW DO
I KILL THIS THING?

135
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,666
- JUST WAIT, NENE'S
TRYING TO PULL IT OUT

136
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,375
OF THE DEFENSE
MINISTRY'S COMPUTER.

137
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,375
HOLD ON!

138
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,208
- ( panting ) THIS MIGHT BE
TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE.

139
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,916
MY POWER CELL IS
ALMOST EXHAUSTED.

140
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,833
HURRY UP AND DIE,
DAMN YOU!

141
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,833
- ( screaming )

142
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,625
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M COVERING
FOR A KNIGHT SABER.

143
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,416
NOTHING WILL SURPRISE
ME ANYMORE.

144
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,541
- HOLD ON!

145
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,333
- ( panting )

146
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,208
- LINNA, YOU'RE BACK!

147
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,125
- MM-HMM.

148
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,958
- ( electric guitar )

149
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,833
- ( electric guitar )

150
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,375
- ( panting )

151
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,291
- I'VE GOT TEN SECONDS TO GO--

152
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,750
FIVE SECONDS--

153
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,791
GOT IT!

154
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,666
- HOLY COW!

155
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,416
NO WONDER WE CAN'T HIT THE CORE,

156
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,625
THAT THING'S NOT REALLY
A BOOMER AT ALL.

157
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,208
IT'S ACTUALLY A SUIT
WITH A NORMAL BOOMER INSIDE IT.

158
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,333
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T SEEING ANY OF THIS.

159
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,083
Sylia: - PRISS, YOU'RE
ALMOST OUT OF POWER,

160
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,291
GET OUT OF THERE
WHILE YOU CAN.

161
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,208
- IT'S A BIT LATE
FOR THAT NOW.

162
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,125
- Nene: ATTENTION AD
POLICE COMMAND TEAM,

163
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,291
THE LOCATION OF THE
MILITARY BOOMER'S CORE

164
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,541
HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.

165
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,791
TRANSMITTING DATA FILES NOW.

166
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,291
- ( shouting )

167
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,666
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

168
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,958
Linna:
- PRISS!

169
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,291
- ALRIGHT!

170
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,166
- UM, WHAT'S ALRIGHT?
- UH... ( laughing )

171
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,458
- Linna:
 LOOK OUT, PRISS!

172
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,166
JUMP!
TRUST ME!

173
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,833
- Linna:
 ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

174
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,500
Priss: - YEAH, BUT YOU TOOK
YOUR SWEET TIME GETTING HERE.

175
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,291
Linna: - WHY PRISS,
WERE YOU WAITING FOR ME?

176
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,458
Priss:
- LET'S GO.

177
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,541
- I'LL DRAW ITS FIRE.

178
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,666
- TIME TO DIE!

179
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,666
- ( grunting )

180
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,000
- THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

181
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,000
- THANK GOD NENE FIGURED IT OUT.

182
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,000
- YEAH, LET'S GO.
- SURE.

183
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,791
- WHAT IS GOING ON, MASON?

184
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,416
I THOUGHT WE HAD TOTAL 
CONTROL OF THE MEDIA.

185
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,416
THIS IS
A PUBLIC RELATIONS DEBACLE.

186
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,000
- IT'S NOT OUR FAULT SIR.

187
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,166
I HAVE PROOF THE MILITARY MADE
UNLICENSED MODIFICATIONS

188
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,250
TO THAT BOOMER,
WHICH CAUSED IT TO GO ROGUE.

189
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,458
- HM, SEE THAT THE MEDIA

190
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,416
STARTS DISTRIBUTING THE
STORY IMMEDIATELY.

191
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,750
THIS IS WHY I WAS AGAINST
THE APPLICATION OF BOOMERS

192
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,541
FOR MILITARY PURPOSES.

193
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,208
- AN IMPRACTICAL VIEW SIR.

194
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,000
MILITARY CONTRACTS ARE WHAT KEEP
OUR LEDGERS IN THE BLACK.

195
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,291
AND THOSE PROFITS
FINANCE THE SHOWEN PROJECT.

196
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,291
- YOU KNOW HOW HARD I'VE WORKED

197
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,166
TO MAKE PEOPLE ACCEPT BOOMERS
AS THE FRIENDS OF HUMAN BEINGS.

198
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,625
I WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS TYPE
OF ERROR AGAIN!

199
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,041
- ( coughing violently )

200
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,458
NOW, GO.

201
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,958
- ( door opens and closes )

202
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,500
Kusui: - YOU KNOW, THIS IS
A REALLY NICE CHAIR YOU HAVE.

203
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:54,916
ACTUALLY, THE WHOLE ROOM
IS PRETTY DARN SNAZZY.

204
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,666
IT'S GOT THAT, "I'M THE SECOND
MOST POWERFUL MAN

205
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,000
IN THE WHOLE
WORLD" FEEL TO IT.

206
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,875
- MHM, HOPING TO MOVE IN?

207
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,625
- I DON'T THINK SO,
IT'S A BIT TOO EXPOSED FOR ME.

208
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,708
I PREFER ANONYMITY AND
A GENEROUS PAYCHECK.

209
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,875
WHICH REMINDS ME, I WANT A BONUS

210
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,208
FOR RIGGING THAT
MILITARY BOOMER.

211
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,916
- I'M CHANGING OUR PLANS. IT'S
CLEAR THAT THE KNIGHT SABERS

212
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,708
HAVE BOTH A TECHNOLOGICAL
AND STRATEGIC EDGE.

213
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,833
NOT ONLY IS THEIR COMBAT
EQUIPMENT SUPERIOR,

214
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,916
BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE
OTHER RESOURCES

215
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

216
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,791
I HAVE NOW COME
TO THE CONCLUSION

217
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,458
THAT WE'VE BEEN GOING
ABOUT THIS THE WRONG WAY

218
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,791
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

219
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,291
RATHER THAN TRYING TO ELIMINATE
THE KNIGHT SABERS,

220
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,875
I SUGGEST THAT WE EMPLOY THEM.

221
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,291
- YOU WANT THE KNIGHT SABERS
TO SEARCH FOR YOU?

222
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,458
- STINGRAY LEFT ME
AN INHERITANCE.

223
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,833
I INTEND TO USE IT.

224
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,583
- ( chattering )

225
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,125
Sylia: - MACKY, TRY CHEWING
YOUR FOOD THIS TIME.

226
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,291
Linna:
- WOW THIS IS INCREDIBLE!

227
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,791
Nene:
- I'M SO HAPPY.

228
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,958
THIS IS WONDERFUL,
YOU'RE A GREAT COOK!

229
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,791
- I'M GLAD YOU ENJOY IT.
MORE WINE?

230
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,000
- HENDERSON <i>IS</i> A GREAT COOK.

231
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,541
BUT IF YOU EAT TOO MUCH

232
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,583
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIT
BACK INTO YOUR HARDSUIT AGAIN.

233
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,375
- BY THE WAY NENE, JUST HOW DID
YOU GET PAST THE FIREWALL

234
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,000
ON THE DEFENSE MINISTRY'S
COMPUTER NET?

235
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,083
- THAT'S <i>MS.</i> NENE, REMEMBER?

236
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,666
BUT SINCE YOU ASKED,
I USED A VIRUS I'M DEVELOPING.

237
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,125
- WHAT?  WAS THAT A SAFE THING
TO DO, NENE?

238
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,000
- OF COURSE IT WASN'T,
THEY'RE PROBABLY STILL TRYING

239
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,916
TO RECOVER THEIR HARD DRIVES
OVER THERE.

240
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,250
- Priss: BUT THEY WON'T KNOW
THAT YOU DID IT, RIGHT?

241
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,083
- Sylia: OF COURSE NOT,
NENE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

242
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,250
THE FIRST TIME I RAN INTO NENE,
I WAS TRYING TO HACK INTO GENOM

243
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,791
AND FOUND OUT THAT SHE HAD
ALREADY FOUND

244
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,375
THREE DIFFERENT BACK DOORS IN.

245
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,083
I ASSUME YOU USED A PULSE CODE
SCRAMBLER TO COVER YOUR TRACKS?

246
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,416
- Nene: (laughing)
ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T.

247
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,875
- HUH?

248
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,708
Nene: - DON'T WORRY, IF THEY
DO MANAGE TO TRACE IT BACK

249
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,916
THEY'LL FIGURE IT
WAS JUST SOME KIDS

250
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,583
USING A FAKE ADP LOG IN ID.

251
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,583
- YOU EITHER HAVE
NERVES OF STEEL,

252
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,041
OR NO COMMON SENSE AT ALL.

253
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,416
- ACTUALLY, I JUST DIDN'T
HAVE TIME TO WORRY

254
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,958
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES.

255
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:03,083
- ( all laughing )

256
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,083
Sylia: - SO, DID YOU HAVE A NICE
STAY AT YOUR PARENT'S HOUSE,

257
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,166
LINNA?

258
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,583
- I GUESS IT SET
MY PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.

259
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,458
- HM.

260
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,416
- HEY, NENE, CAN YOU HELP ME
LOAD THE NEW SYSTEM DOWNSTAIRS?

261
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,833
- IT'S MS. NENE TO YOU!

262
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,583
- BUT YOU'RE NOT
<i>THAT</i> MUCH OLDER THAN ME.

263
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,833
- I AM MENTALLY!

264
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,208
AND I WOULDN'T LET YOU
CALL ME JUST NENE

265
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,875
IF YOU WERE BORN A TRILLION,
JILLION YEARS BEFORE I WAS!

266
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,041
 OH, NO YOU DON'T! YOU'RE NOT
GETTING AWAY THAT EASILY!

267
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,708
- HEY, PRISS--
THANK YOU.

268
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,625
YOU KNOW...

269
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,083
- ( arguing continues
in background )

270
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,250
Henderson:
- MASTER MACKY...

271
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,291
Sylia:
- CHILDREN...

272
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,333
Nene:
- OKAY, I CREATED THIS SYSTEM

273
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,708
BUT IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I DEBUGGED IT.

274
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,833
HM, I'M AFRAID IT MAY BE
GETTING TOO LARGE

275
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,166
FOR THE SIZE OF THE BUS.

276
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,125
OF COURSE, IF I PUT A REPEATER
HERE AT THE BRIDGE

277
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,583
THE OVERALL RESPONSE RATIO OUGHT
TO BE IMPROVED A LITTLE BIT.

278
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,166
AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT.

279
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,041
- OH, I SEE. THAT MAKES SENSE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

280
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,041
WHEN THE CIRCUITS FOR SYLIA
AND PRISS GOT DOUBLED UP,

281
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:15,041
I SURE COULD HAVE USED YOU THEN.

282
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,041
- ( both shout )

283
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,791
- HEY, WAIT. I THINK
YOU SHOULD HAVE

284
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,625
TO FIGURE THESE THINGS
OUT FOR YOURSELF.

285
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:31,458
AND ANYWAY, I HAVE A LOT OF
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO

286
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,500
THAN BABYSITTING YOU.

287
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,500
- OKAY.

288
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,541
- BUT YOU CAN STILL
ASK ME QUESTIONS.

289
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,500
- THANK YOU, NENE.

290
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,583
- ( scowls )

291
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,000
- MA'AM!

292
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,000
- ( both laughing )

293
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,416
- THE GATE'S STILL OPEN.

294
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,250
WHOSE CAR IS THAT?

295
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,083
- ( gasps )

296
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,041
- ( heavy metal plays )

297
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,375
- I KNOW YOU,
YOU'RE DR. STINGRAY'S...

298
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,041
- I'M SORRY, BUT I THINK
THAT YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE.

299
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,666
YOU HAVEN'T MET THIS BOY BEFORE,
HE'S JUST MY ASSISTANT.

300
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,000
- REALLY?
WHAT AN UNUSUAL COINCIDENCE.

301
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,541
WELL, TAKE SOME TIME AND
THINK ABOUT MY OFFER.

302
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,916
STRANGE, YOU NEVER SEEMED LIKE
THE KIND OF PERSON

303
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:50,833
WHO'D WANT TO GET
HIS HANDS DIRTY.

304
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,500
- HEY, DON'T STAND THERE.
GET INSIDE, QUICKLY.

305
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:57,500
- THAT WAS PROFESSOR MASON,
WHAT DID HE WANT?

306
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,750
- FORGET ABOUT IT.
- DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT SYLIA?

307
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,750
- STUPID KID.

308
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,875
I WISH HE WASN'T
SO MUCH YOUNGER THAN ME.

309
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:19,208
- UGH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
AM I NUTS?

310
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,166
- I FINALLY FOUND OUT THAT
WHAT MASON'S BEEN LOOKING FOR

311
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,625
IS AN OLD UNDERGROUND RESEARCH
FACILITY CALLED THE WIZ LAB.

312
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,583
- WAIT A MINUTE, I THOUGHT
MY FATHER'S LAB WAS DESTROYED.

313
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,041
- THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVED,

314
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,416
BUT MASON APPARENTLY THINKS
THAT THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE

315
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,250
WAS SIMPLY DISPLACED
DURING THE EARTHQUAKE.

316
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,541
- AND HE'S TRYING TO FIND IT?
IS HE INSANE?

317
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,666
- HE'S BEEN BORROWING
ENGINEERS AND EQUIPMENT

318
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,875
FROM THE DRAGON PROJECT

319
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,583
IN ORDER TO CARRY
OUT HIS SEARCH.

320
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,083
ALL OF THIS WITHOUT CHAIRMAN
ROSENKREUTZ'S KNOWLEDGE,

321
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,166
I MIGHT ADD.

322
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,541
- NO, HE CAN'T BE
LOOKING FOR THAT,

323
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,166
IT MUST HAVE
BEEN DESTROYED!

324
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,250
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S ALL I KNOW
AT THE MOMENT, GOOD-BYE.

325
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,250
- ( monitor turns off )

326
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,333
- ( crying )

327
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,583
- GALATEA.

328
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,666
Kusui: - THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED, RIGHT?

329
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,250
- ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

330
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,750
I'M VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE
EMPLOYEES LIKE YOU.

331
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,000
Kusui: - FORTUNATE'S NOT
EXACTLY THE WORD THAT I'D USE.

332
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,791
I JUST SELL MY SERVICES TO
WHOEVER MAKES THE HIGHEST BID.

333
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,375
IT'S A MATTER
OF SIMPLE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES.

334
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,041
Mason: - AND A NOT SO
SIMPLE CODE OF ETHICS.

335
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,666
COME IN.
- HM?

336
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,583
- MR. KUSUI DESERVES A BONUS FOR
HIS SERVICES. GIVE IT TO HIM.

337
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,958
- SO ARE YOU THE BONUS, OR IS
THERE CASH INVOLVED AS WELL?

338
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,166
- THANK YOU, MR. KUSUI.

339
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,166
- ( choking sounds )

340
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,750
- ( crashing )

341
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,041
- THIS IS BORDERING
ON OBSESSION NOW.

342
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,333
( typing ) HM, LET'S SEE--
STINGRAY FAMILY RECORDS.

343
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,583
FATHER, 

344
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,166
MOTHER, 

345
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,291
BROTHER.

346
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,250
- ( gasps )

347
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,208
HEY NOW, WAIT A SECOND.

348
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,166
WHEN IN THE HELL WAS
THIS PICTURE TAKEN?!

349
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,916
OH MY GOD,
THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO.

350
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,916
Macky: - NIGEL, DID YOU TELL
PROFESSOR MASON ABOUT SYLIA?

351
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,916
Nigel:
- SHUT UP!

352
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,166
HURRY UP AND GO TO BED.

353
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,791
- ( theme music playing )

354
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

355
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,541
Woman: - IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040--"

356
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,500
SEEKING THE HELP
OF THE MYSTERIOUS DR. SHAN

357
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,875
SYLIA LEARNS THE TRUTH ABOUT
GENOM'S SECRET PLANS

358
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,041
FOR THE EXCAVATIONS
BENEATH THE CITY.

359
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,541
NOW SHE MUST FIND A WAY
TO STOP MASON FROM UNEARTHING

360
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,250
THE ULTIMATE NIGHTMARE.

361
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,583
BUT NEW FRICTIONS AMONG
THE KNIGHT SABERS

362
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,166
MAY PROVE TO BE HER UNDOING.

363
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,875
THE SECRETS TO HER BURIED PAST
ARE UNVEILED,

364
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,750
AND A NEW HORROR IS UNLEASHED.

365
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,750
NEXT EPISODE...
