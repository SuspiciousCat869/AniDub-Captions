1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,875
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:40,666
- Leon:
PRISS, WHAT'S WRONG?

4
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,833
DO YOU NEED A DOCTOR?

5
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,666
- ( crying )

6
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,958
PRISS?

7
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,083
PRISS!

8
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,416
- PRISS!

9
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,041
DID YOU SEE IT TOO?

10
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,666
- YEAH, COME ON.
WE'VE GOT TO GO SEE SYLIA.

11
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,125
( sighs )
- HUH?

12
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,625
- SYLIA!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

13
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,583
- HENDERSON SAYS THAT SHE
JUST COLLAPSED.

14
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,083
- THAT'S RIGHT,

15
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,791
AND HER PULSE AND TEMPERATURE
ARE BOTH DROPPING RAPIDLY.

16
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,458
I'VE ALREADY SENT
FOR THE DOCTOR.

17
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,458
- PRISS, LOOK.
- HUH?

18
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,416
WHAT IN THE HELL?

19
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,416
- ( moaning )

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,208
- THE SOTAI.

21
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,833
- Man: THE LEVEL OF
THE SOTAI PHENOMENON

22
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,916
SUDDENLY STARTED TO INCREASE
A FEW MINUTES AGO, SIR.

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,375
THE WALLS OF THE ENCLOSURE
ARE 500 TIMES AS STRONG

24
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,375
AS THE ONES IN
THE OLD WIZ LAB STRUCTURE.

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,750
HOWEVER--
- JUST RAISE THE ELEVATOR.

26
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,375
- OUR LITTLE GALATEA
IS JUST GETTING LONELY.

27
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:50,250
- ALRIGHT SIR, THE ELEVATOR
IS CLEAR. YOU MAY PROCEED NOW.

28
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,750
-  ( door opens )

29
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,666
- Mason:
WHAT'S WRONG, GALATEA?

30
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,416
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL
YOUR FRIENDS, HAVEN'T YOU?

31
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,125
I'M AFRAID THAT
IT'S MUCH TOO EARLY FOR THAT.

32
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,208
- IT IS, EARLY?

33
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,208
- MM, YOU'RE STILL TOO YOUNG.

34
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,583
YOU'RE A VERY CLEVER GIRL
MY DEAR, SWEET GALATEA.

35
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,166
MORE SO EACH DAY,

36
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,791
BUT I WON'T MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKE AS DR. STINGRAY

37
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,875
AND ALLOW YOU TO USE
YOUR POWERS PREMATURELY.

38
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,750
- I WANT TO PLAY.

39
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:15,000
- WELL, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY
THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND YOU

40
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:15,958
SOMETHING TO PLAY WITH.

41
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,000
WON'T WE THEN?

42
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,958
- ( giggling )

43
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,791
- SYLIA?
- SHE'S CALMING DOWN NOW.

44
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,416
- JUST WHO DO YOU MEAN BY "SHE?"

45
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,583
- THE SOTAI.
THE OTHER PROTOTYPE THAT WAS

46
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,416
CREATED AT THE SAME TIME
AS I WAS.

47
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,833
- SHE'S CONFINED SOMEPLACE
AND LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT.

48
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,541
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
HOW IS SHE CONNECTED TO SYLIA?

49
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,125
- IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL LIFE FORM.

50
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,666
SYLIA'S FATHER USED HER
LIKE A LABORATORY RAT

51
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,250
AND GREW IT INSIDE HER BRAIN.

52
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,041
- INSIDE HER BRAIN?

53
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,791
- MACKY:
YES.

54
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,958
AND THAT'S WHERE I
WAS GROWN AS WELL.

55
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,916
- IN ANY CASE,
THAT'S THE LINK.

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,375
- ( sighs )

57
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,166
- HEY, HER EYELIDS MOVED.

58
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,916
- ( groaning )

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,250
- WAIT SYLIA,
DON'T TRY TO MOVE.

60
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,083
MR. HENDERSON,
SHE'S AWAKE!

61
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,125
- Sylia:
THANK YOU, HENDERSON.

62
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,833
- ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
THE DOCTOR TO EXAMINE YOU,

63
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:19,625
MISTRESS SYLIA?

64
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,541
- NO, HOW COULD I EXPLAIN

65
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,291
THAT SOMEONE'S BEEN YELLING
INSIDE MY HEAD?

66
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,541
AND I DO FEEL BETTER.

67
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,000
- I'M SO GLAD,
WE ALL THOUGHT--

68
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,166
- I'M SORRY TO HAVE WORRIED
YOU ALL LIKE THAT, REALLY.

69
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,458
ESPECIALLY SINCE

70
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,625
YOU ALL SEEMED TO HAVE
EXPERIENCED MY MEMORIES.

71
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,791
- YES, WE ALL SAW IT
SO VIVIDLY.

72
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,916
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?
IT WAS--

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,166
- IT WAS LIKE WE WERE
DREAMING WIDE AWAKE,

74
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,333
BUT WITH YOUR DREAMS.

75
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,291
- YES.

76
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,708
- DO THOSE DREAMS MEAN

77
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,833
THAT WE'RE ALL CONNECTED
TOGETHER PSYCHICALLY SOMEHOW?

78
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,125
I MEAN, IT CAN'T BE
A COINCIDENCE,

79
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,833
SO IT MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH BEING KNIGHT SABERS, RIGHT?

80
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,833
- NO, IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.

81
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,750
PERHAPS IT WAS INEVITABLE.

82
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,708
I KNOW THAT PRISS HAS
SUSPECTED THIS FOR SOME TIME.

83
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,875
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW

84
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,333
THAT YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST
KNIGHT SABERS.

85
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,875
I FORMED A TEAM
BEFORE YOU.

86
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,041
AT THE TIME, I WAS YOUNG

87
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,000
AND ALMOST AS
HOT-HEADED AS PRISS.

88
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,833
I LED THAT TEAM
INTO BATTLE PERSONALLY.

89
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,458
I HAD RECRUITED THAT TEAM

90
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,875
IN MUCH THE SAME WAY
AS I DID YOU.

91
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,791
THERE WAS A MARTIAL ARTIST.

92
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,916
BUT SHE WAS NEVER ABLE
TO COMPLETELY MASTER

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,625
HER HARDSUIT
LIKE YOU HAVE, LINNA.

94
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,125
ANOTHER RECRUIT
WAS AN AMERICAN,

95
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,958
A FORMER
SPECIAL FORCES OPERATIVE

96
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,583
WHO HAD BEEN ATTACHED
TO THE PENTAGON'S DELTA FORCE.

97
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,000
BUT ALL OF THEIR SKILLS
AND ABILITIES

98
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,291
MEANT NOTHING IN THE END.

99
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,750
EVEN WITH MY HARDSUITS,

100
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,708
THEY WERE JUST ORDINARY WOMEN
WITH FANCY COMBAT ARMOR.

101
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,041
THEY FOUGHT BRAVELY,
BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

102
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,833
ONLY I WAS ACTUALLY
ABLE TO ACHIEVE A TRUE GESTALT.

103
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,666
WHAT I REALIZED TOO LATE

104
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,625
IS THAT A HARDSUIT REQUIRES MORE
THAN JUST A BODY TO FILL IT.

105
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,666
IT REQUIRES A COMPATIBLE MIND
AS WELL.

106
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,625
- THE SUITS ARE BOOMERS,
AREN'T THEY?

107
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,333
- SO THE SUITS ALLOW
A HUMAN'S BRAIN AND REFLEXES

108
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,583
TO CONTROL A BOOMER'S STRENGTH
AND AGILITY.

109
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,375
BUT THEN THAT MEANS
THAT WE...

110
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,000
- YES, AND I SHOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU ALL

111
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,416
WHAT YOU WERE GETTING INTO.

112
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,750
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I'M TRULY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

113
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,916
BUT I TOOK CARE TO USE ONLY
CORES THAT I BELIEVED TO BE SAFE

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,083
FROM THE DANGER OF GOING ROGUE.
THAT'S ALSO THE REASON I LIMITED

115
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,708
THE HARDSUITS POWER SUPPLY.

116
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,958
- Linna:
ONE QUESTION,

117
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,458
IS THERE A REASON YOU
ONLY RECRUITED FEMALES?

118
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,208
- WELL, I'M A FEMALE.
SO I DESIGNED THE FIRST SUIT

119
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,583
TO FIT A FEMALE'S CENTER
OF BALANCE AND ANATOMY.

120
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,333
ONCE I'D SOLVED THOSE PROBLEMS,

121
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,000
IT WAS SIMPLY A MATTER
OF EXPEDIENCE

122
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,416
TO RECRUIT WOMEN WHO HAD
PHYSIQUES AND ABILITIES

123
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,666
THAT WERE SIMILAR TO MINE.

124
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,583
- HOLD ON, NEITHER NENE
NOR I ARE BUILT LIKE--

125
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,875
- THAT'S RIGHT.

126
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,791
ALTHOUGH THE DIFFERENCES ARE
REALLY VERY MINOR.

127
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,541
WHAT I LEARNED WAS THAT I
NEEDED MORE THAN JUST A BODY.

128
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,000
- UHH...

129
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,000
- WHAT I NEED, NENE DEAR,

130
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,625
IS SOMEONE WITH WHOM I SHARE

131
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,958
A VERY SPECIAL PHYSICAL
COMPATIBILITY.

132
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,375
- OH, WAIT NOW A SECOND!
JUST WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

133
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,416
I MEAN, I LIKE-- I LIKE YOU
AND ALL THAT, BUT I'M--

134
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,750
I'M NOT CURIOUS THAT WAY.

135
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,375
AT LEAST NOT THE WAY
THAT I THINK YOU

136
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,375
AND MAYBE LINNA ARE,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

137
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,250
- OH, THANKS A LOT.

138
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,291
- LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN--

139
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,458
THE SUITS RESPOND
TO YOUR MOTOR REFLEXES,

140
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,375
BUT THEY ALSO TAP
INTO YOUR SYNAPSES

141
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,166
TO ANTICIPATE YOUR ACTIONS.

142
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,791
BUT FOR THAT PROCESS TO OCCUR,

143
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,916
YOUR BRAIN HAS TO
SUBCONSCIOUSLY ALLOW THE SUIT

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,916
TO ENTER YOUR MIND.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,250
- Sylia: YES, THAT'S
WHAT I MEANT

146
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,833
BY BEING PHYSICALLY COMPATIBLE.

147
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,166
IN A VERY REAL SENSE, THE SUITS
ARE AN EXTENSION OF ME.

148
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,541
OR AT LEAST THE ME THAT WAS
WHEN THE SUITS WERE MADE.

149
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,791
- Nene: OH YEAH, I KNEW
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.

150
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,000
- Priss: HOW CAN YOU SIT THERE
AND PRETEND THAT ANY OF US

151
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,375
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
I USED TO THINK YOUR MONEY

152
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,125
WAS WORTH PUTTING UP
WITH YOUR GAMES,

153
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,083
BUT YOU KNEW HOW I FELT
ABOUT BOOMERS

154
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,166
AND YOU STILL LIED TO ME,
YOU BITCH.

155
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,000
- I KNOW YOU HAVE EXTREME
FEELINGS ABOUT BOOMERS, PRISS.

156
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,500
BUT I THOUGHT THAT ONCE YOU
UNDERSTOOD WHAT MY GOALS WERE--

157
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,666
- SPARE ME YOUR
GODDAMNED EXPLANATIONS!

158
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,500
- I'M OUT OF HERE.
BYE, LINNA.

159
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,166
- Linna:
DAMN IT, PRISS.  WAIT!

160
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,708
- MACKY, WILL YOU PLEASE CALL
NIGEL FOR ME?

161
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,250
TELL HIM THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE
NEEDING THREE NEW HARDSUITS.

162
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,708
- RIGHT.

163
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,166
- UM, BUT, ARE THEY BOOMERS?

164
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,375
- YES, AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT
YOU CAN QUIT!

165
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,750
I'LL DO IT ALL BY MYSELF
IF I HAVE TO.

166
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,333
I'LL DESTROY THAT DAMN THING
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO!

167
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,875
- ( both sigh )

168
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,208
- Daley: WELL HEY THERE, TIGER.
I'VE BEEN HEARING ALL ABOUT YOU.

169
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,208
- HUH?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

170
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,458
- OH, I THINK YOU CAN SPARE ME

171
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,625
THE PROTESTS OF IGNORANCE,
LOVER BOY.

172
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,708
TRAFFIC'S ALREADY SPREADING
THE STORY ON YOU

173
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,666
AND THE LADY SINGER.

174
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,416
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO TELL, DALEY.

175
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,708
- I THINK YOU'RE FIBBING.

176
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,583
DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT THOSE FIREBEES

177
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,041
HAVE A CAMERA ON CONTINUOUS
RECORD, PINOCCHIO?

178
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,708
HEY WAIT,
WAIT JUST A SECOND,

179
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,708
YOU MUST BE REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS ONE

180
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,208
IF YOU HAVEN'T BRAGGED ABOUT IT
TO THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT YET.

181
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,166
- IS THIS THE ONLY THING
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

182
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,708
- NO, I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW

183
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,500
THAT THERE'S A MEETING
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

184
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,125
ALL THE HEADS, ABOUT THE
CONTINUED FUTURE

185
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,166
OF THE A.D. POLICE.

186
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,625
- HUH?

187
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,000
- YEAH, THE RUMOR MILL HAS IT
THAT WE'RE GETTING READY

188
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,333
TO BE RIFFED BACK INTO
THE NORMAL POLICE DEPARTMENT

189
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,583
AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

190
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,166
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

191
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,250
- UNFORTUNATELY OUR UNDERWRITER
SEEMS TO HAVE PULLED OUT ON US.

192
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,000
- BY THAT YOU MEAN GENOM?
- RIGHT.

193
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,875
APPARENTLY GENOM DOESN'T THINK
KEEPING ROGUE BOOMERS IN CHECK

194
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,500
IS A WORTHWHILE EXPENSE
ANYMORE.

195
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,000
- ARE THEY OUT OF THEIR MINDS?
THIS CITY NEEDS US.

196
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,500
- YOU AND I KNOW THAT,

197
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,333
BUT TO GENOM WE'RE JUST
A WASTE DISPOSAL SERVICE.

198
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,000
- ( shouting and gunshots )

199
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,416
- Leon:
GENOM!

200
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,125
- Dr. Rosenkreutz: MASON,

201
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,500
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING SOMETHING
FROM ME, HAVEN'T YOU?

202
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,750
- JUST WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT, SIR?

203
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,083
- UNDERESTIMATING ME
WOULD BE A FATAL ERROR.

204
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,625
I SUGGEST YOU TELL ME
THE TRUTH.

205
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,041
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT
YOU HAVE BROUGHT INTO MY TOWER

206
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,083
SOMETHING THAT MAY BE
DANGEROUS.

207
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,375
- I'M NOT SURE
AS TO WHAT YOU MAY MEAN

208
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,041
BY POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS,
MR. CHAIRMAN.

209
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,916
WHILE WE ARE CURRENTLY
DEVELOPING A SYSTEM

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
TO TRANSFER ENERGY
TO THE UMBRELLA,

211
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,166
I DON'T REALLY ANTICIPATE
ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

212
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,000
WITH ENERGY OVERFLOW.

213
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,041
IS THAT ALL?

214
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,541
- HM... MASON?

215
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,666
YES, WAS THERE
SOMETHING ELSE, CHAIRMAN?

216
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,416
- Dr. Rosenkreutz:
YOU WON'T BETRAY ME.

217
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,416
- NO.

218
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,500
- ( electric guitar )

219
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,333
- ( electric guitar )

220
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,333
- ( yawns )

221
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,750
- ( beeping )

222
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,250
- Nene:
A MESSAGE.

223
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:59,833
OH, GREAT.  WELL, I GUESS I CAN
ANSWER HIM THIS TIME.

224
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,083
- Macky:
HI, HOW'S IT GOING, NENE?

225
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,416
- THAT'S <i>MS.</i> NENE.

226
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,875
- Macky: OH, WHATEVER.
LOOK, CAN YOU COME

227
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,375
TO THE SHOP AFTER WORK TODAY?
- HUH?

228
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,708
- Macky: SYLIA'S TALKED NIGEL
INTO MAKING HER A NEW SUIT.

229
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,958
THE THING IS, THE CORES
WERE DESIGNED AROUND

230
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,375
HER ADOLESCENT BRAIN SCAN.

231
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,041
HER BODY'S MATURED TOO MUCH.
BUT IF YOU COME IN,

232
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,333
I CAN CONVINCE THEM TO MAKE
THE NEW SUIT FOR YOU.

233
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,625
- WAS ALL OF THAT JUST A
ROUNDABOUT WAY

234
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,083
OF CALLING ME IMMATURE?

235
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,458
- Macky: NO, I KNOW HOW YOU
FEEL ABOUT THE SUITS NOW.

236
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,791
BUT I CAN'T LET SYLIA DO
THIS TO HERSELF.

237
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,291
I'D FEEL BETTER IF THERE
WAS SOMEONE TO WATCH HER BACK.

238
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,250
SHE'S MY SISTER NENE,
I CAN'T LET HER KILL HERSELF.

239
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,291
PLEASE, HELP ME.

240
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,750
- YOU REALLY ARE HER BROTHER.

241
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,333
- HEY NENE, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING ON DUTY?

242
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,625
- I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
A LIFE, I GUESS.

243
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,166
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

244
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,541
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY
ELSE IN THIS ENTIRE SECTION

245
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,541
IS TAKING SICK LEAVE
THIS AFTERNOON?

246
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- IT'S A STRIKE.

247
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,916
WE'RE PROTESTING THE FACT
THAT THE A.D. POLICE

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,166
IS GOING TO BE MERGED
INTO THE NORMAL POLICE.

249
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,625
YOU ARE IN THE UNION,
AREN'T YOU?

250
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,708
- WELL, NO.  NEVER PAID
MUCH ATTENTION TO IT.

251
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,833
WELL, THE REGULAR POLICE
IS ALL UNION.

252
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,250
IF THE MERGER HAPPENS

253
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,500
YOU'LL HAVE NO CHOICE.

254
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,666
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON OFF?

255
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,958
GO SEE YOUR BOYFRIEND,
OR SOMETHING.

256
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,666
- AND WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE
A BOYFRIEND?

257
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,333
( groans )
WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?

258
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,000
DO I REALLY WANT
A NEW HARDSUIT?

259
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,125
- I THOUGHT YOU
WERE IN THE UNION.

260
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,750
YOU KNOW THEY'RE FINING
MEMBERS WHO SHOW UP

261
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,208
FOR WORK THIS AFTERNOON.

262
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,833
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT,
I'VE GOT A JOB TO DO, NICK.

263
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,708
AND IF HALF OF WHAT
I'VE HEARD IS TRUE,

264
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,666
THE A.D.P. IS GOING TO BE
DISSOLVED ANYWAY.

265
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,166
- THAT'S JUST A RUMOR
THAT'S GOING AROUND.

266
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,875
- Leon:
IS IT JUST A RUMOR?

267
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,208
- WELL, SOME RUMORS DO HAVE
A GRAIN OF TRUTH AT THEIR CORE,

268
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,625
AND THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM.

269
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,916
- HUH?

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,750
I SEE.
- BUT <i>I</i> DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT.

271
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,375
- YEAH, AND IF I GOT
THAT IMPRESSION,

272
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,083
IT WAS JUST IN MY MIND, RIGHT?

273
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,208
- Roland:
YOU'RE A GOOD COP, LEON.

274
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,583
YOU'VE GOT AN
OUTSTANDING TRACK RECORD.

275
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,333
THE NORMAL POLICE WOULD BE
GLAD TO HAVE YOU.

276
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,333
- I WAS IN
THE NORMAL POLICE, NICK.

277
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,000
I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE.

278
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,291
- SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN
TO BE COPS.

279
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,583
THEY WON'T EVER BE HAPPY
DOING ANYTHING ELSE.

280
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,125
- OH YEAH?
PROVE IT.

281
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,250
- ( laughs )

282
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,166
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE OLD.

283
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,166
- I WAS YOUNG TOO, ONCE.

284
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,375
- Nene: "SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, NENE?"

285
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,375
HM, WELL YOU'RE THE WEASEL--
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?

286
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,791
"I THINK YOU'RE SCREWED."

287
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,083
OH, THERE MUST BE
A WAY OUT OF THIS.

288
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,666
"SOMETIMES, YOU JUST HAVE
TO DECIDE WHAT'S IMPORTANT."

289
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,333
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

290
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,333
AND WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

291
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,500
( sighs ) I WONDER IF LINNA'S
GONE BACK TO SEE SYLIA.

292
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,791
I KNOW PRISS WOULDN'T,
BUT...

293
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,666
- ( alarm )

294
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,875
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

295
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,458
THE WHOLE SWITCHBOARD'S
BEEN CUT OFF!

296
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,166
- ( alarm )
- AHH!

297
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,583
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

298
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,625
- ( running )

299
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,583
- ( gasps )

300
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,041
NO WAY!

301
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,000
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

302
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,000
OW-WW!

303
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,750
OUCH-HH.

304
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,541
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING, AM I THE
ONLY ONE LEFT IN THE BUILDING?

305
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,375
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

306
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,708
- ( footsteps )

307
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,875
- AH-HH!

308
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,791
- HEY, KID!
- MR. ROLAND?

309
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,541
- YOU'RE AN OPERATOR IN THE
INFORMATION CENTER, AREN'T YOU?

310
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,833
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?!

311
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,583
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT,

312
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,750
BUT ALL OF OUR DEFENSE SYSTEMS
CAME ONLINE,

313
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,583
AND THEN THE PHONE SYSTEMS
CUT OFF.

314
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,833
- IT JUST CUT OFF?

315
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,916
I KNEW THAT BACKUP SYSTEM WAS
A PIECE OF JUNK!

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,166
BACK OFF YANNO,

317
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,666
IT'S PROBABLY RESTORING
ITSELF EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

318
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,083
- WHETHER IT CAN FIX ITSELF OR
NOT IS BESIDE THE POINT, HARUMA.

319
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,708
WE STILL NEED TO CHECK IT OUT!

320
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,250
- ( rumbling )

321
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,375
- THAT WASN'T
A SOFTWARE FAILURE.

322
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,166
- HOLD ON A SECOND.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

323
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,458
- I CAN CHECK OUT EVERY
LEVEL THROUGH MY STATION!

324
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,500
OKAY, LET'S TRY...

325
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,958
THE BASEMENT FIRST.

326
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,000
HUH?

327
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,500
WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?!

328
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,166
( screaming )
OH MY GOD, BOOMERS!

329
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,083
- ( rock music playing )

330
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,083
- ( explosions )

331
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,083
- WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

332
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,916
- HOW IN THE HELL DID
ALL THESE BOOMERS GET DOWN HERE?

333
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,208
- STORAGE. THOSE ARE ALL
ROGUE BOOMERS

334
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,000
THAT WERE BEING KEPT IN
THE EVIDENCE ROOM.

335
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,458
- BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
MADE THEM COME BACK TO LIFE?

336
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,916
- I DON'T KNOW,

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,750
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN
KILLING THEM AGAIN!

338
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,708
- Man:
IT'S AT JUNCTION K-24.

339
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,750
R-34.

340
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,333
Y-133 HAS BEEN SEALED.

341
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,625
THE CONTAMINATION IS TRAVELING
THROUGH THE DRAGON LINE

342
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,583
IN EXACTLY THE PATTERN
YOU PREDICTED, SIR.

343
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,125
- IT'S NOT CONTAMINATION,

344
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,041
THE SOTAI PHENOMENON
SIMPLY ALLOWS THE BOOMERS

345
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,583
TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT STAGE
OF THEIR EVOLUTION.

346
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,541
- ( giggling )

347
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,500
I THINK SHE'S HAD
ENOUGH PLAY TIME NOW.

348
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,291
- Man: THE INNER WALLS
HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED,

349
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,875
BUT THE EXTERIORS
REMAIN UNTOUCHED.

350
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,333
- Mason: WELL, WELL,
CHAIRMAN ROSENKREUTZ.

351
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,791
DID YOU EVER ENVISION THAT
YOUR PRECIOUS DRAGON LINE

352
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,416
COULD BE USED THIS WAY?
HAH, I THINK NOT.

353
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,416
SO, IS IT HAPPENING?

354
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,333
- Man: AS PREDICTED, THE
BOOMERS WHICH WERE STORED

355
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,416
IN THE UNDERGROUND WAREHOUSE
ARE REVIVING.

356
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,416
- ( laughing )

357
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,083
IT'S TOO BAD THERE'S NOBODY
LEFT IN THE TOTEM POLE

358
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,416
TO BEHOLD OUR HANDIWORK.

359
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,458
THE A.D.P. STRIKE
WAS CONVENIENT,

360
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,208
BUT I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE
HOW PATHETIC THEIR EFFORTS

361
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,333
TO STOP THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN.

362
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,000
- ( falls down )

363
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,625
- Nigel:
WHAT'S WRONG, SYLIA?

364
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:15,625
- IT'S HER, AS IF SHE'S INSIDE
MY BRAIN, SCREAMING TO GET OUT.

365
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,791
- SYLIA...
- ( elevator opens )

366
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,333
- HUH?

367
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,333
LOOKS LIKE THE FREQUENCY
IS INCREASING.

368
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:35,000
- Macky: BOOMERS WERE NOT
TO BE SLAVES TO HUMANS.

369
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,166
- Nigel:
IT'S YOU!

370
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,875
- YES, I AM THE SOTAI.

371
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,208
I AM THE ONE
THAT STINGRAY NAMED GALATEA.

372
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,916
- DAMN IT, YOU'RE NOT
A BOOMER, MACKY!

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,583
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT HER!

374
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,208
- BUT I--
I AM NOT HUMAN, EITHER.

375
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,208
- YOU ARE TO NENE.

376
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,625
- NENE...

377
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,041
NENE'S IN DANGER!

378
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,333
- Yano: ROLAND, THESE GUNS
AREN'T EVEN SLOWING THEM DOWN!

379
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,666
- Roland: PULL BACK,
I'LL USE A DELAYED CHARGE.

380
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,291
RUN-NN!

381
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,750
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

382
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,125
ROMANOVA, ARE YOU THERE?

383
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,041
TRY THE EMERGENCY BEACON,

384
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,083
AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET
A MESSAGE TO THE NORMAL POLICE.

385
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,416
- I'M TRYING SIR,

386
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,166
BUT ALL OF THE OUTSIDE CIRCUITS
HAVE BEEN CUT OFF.

387
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,000
EVEN THE RADIO
AND SATELLITE LINKS ARE DEAD.

388
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,500
- SHE'S RIGHT, THE SECURITY
SYSTEM IS PROGRAMMED

389
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,666
TO DROP A COMPLETE FIREWALL
ON ALL COMMUNICATIONS

390
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,291
IN CASE THERE'S EVER A HOSTILE
TAKEOVER OF THE BUILDING.

391
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,625
- Yano:
LOOK OUT!

392
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,000
THEY'RE COMING IN
THE BACK WAY, TOO.

393
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,333
- THAT FIREWALL WON'T
HOLD UP MUCH LONGER.

394
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,333
THIS WAY, HURRY!

395
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,875
- SIR, THE ENTIRE
SUBBASEMENT LEVEL

396
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,208
IS CRAWLING WITH THOSE THINGS.

397
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,250
YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP HERE
BEFORE THEY CUT YOU OFF!

398
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,041
- OKAY, WE'LL TRY IT.

399
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,041
BUT FIRST, IS ANYBODY ELSE STILL
IN THE BUILDING?

400
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:35,916
- Nene: NO, I RAN AN ID SCAN
AND WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT.

401
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,916
- AND MEANWHILE,
IN OTHER NEWS TODAY,

402
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,500
A.D. POLICE HEADQUARTERS

403
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,958
HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN BY A STRIKE
PROTESTING RUMORS OF A MERGER

404
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,708
BETWEEN THE A.D.
AND REGULAR POLICE.

405
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:02,041
ATTEMPTS TO GET A COMMENT FROM
AD OFFICIALS PROVED FUTILE...

406
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,125
- HEY, I LIKE THIS ONE.

407
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,375
WHAT-- WHAT IN THE HECK
WAS THAT?

408
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,750
DID I IMAGINE IT?

409
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,166
- ( phone rings )

410
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,250
HELLO?
LINNA YAMAZAKI SPEAKING.

411
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,416
- Macky: LINNA, IT'S NENE,
NENE'S IN DANGER.

412
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,208
SHE'S TRAPPED
IN THE A.D. POLICE BUILDING.

413
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,958
THE WHOLE PLACE IS FULL
OF ROGUE BOOMERS.

414
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,208
YOU'VE GOT TO SAVE HER, LINNA.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE!

415
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,250
- HOLD ON, I'M COMING.

416
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,958
DAMN IT, I'D KILL
FOR A HARDSUIT RIGHT NOW.

417
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,125
- ( theme music plays )

418
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

419
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,416
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS TOKYO 2040"...

420
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,625
AS PREVIOUSLY DESTROYED BOOMERS
CONTINUE TO REVIVE, 

421
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,625
THE REMAINING STAFF
OF THE A.D.P.

422
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:14,250
FIND THEMSELVES WAGING
A DESPERATE BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL.

423
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,708
WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD
UNAWARE OF THEIR FATE,

424
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,750
TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

425
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,375
ONLY NENE'S FELLOW SABERS
CAN SAVE THEM.

426
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,625
BUT TO DO THAT, THEY'LL NEED THE
AID OF THEIR FORMER ENEMIES--

427
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,041
THE A.D. POLICE.

428
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,416
NEXT EPISODE...
