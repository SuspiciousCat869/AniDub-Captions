1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,041
- ( door opens )

4
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,250
- I'D LIKE TO SEE
DR. SHAN.

5
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,166
OH!

6
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,625
- HMM?

7
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,583
- UM, I'M SORRY.

8
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,000
- IT WAS ALREADY BROKEN.

9
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,083
MAKES IT HARD
TO SNEAK IN. 

10
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,416
- UH, WELL I CAME HERE
TO VISIT DR. SHAN.

11
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,250
- THE WIND MASTER?
JUST GO THROUGH THAT DOOR.

12
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,916
IF THE DOCTOR
FEELS LIKE TALKING TO YOU,

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
HE'LL MAKE SURE YOU END UP
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

14
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,416
- OH, REALLY?

15
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,375
- YOU'RE NOT CHICKEN,
ARE YOU?

16
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,916
I WOULDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH.

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,958
THE DOC'S OLD,
BUT HE WOULDN'T PASS UP

18
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,041
A CHANCE TO GET
A CLOSER LOOK AT YOU.

19
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,291
- UM, THANKS, I THINK.

20
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,750
DR. SHAN?

21
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,541
ARE YOU IN HERE?

22
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,458
- ( crashing )

23
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,458
- ( chuckles )

24
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,416
DR. SHAN?

25
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,541
- HMM.

26
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,875
MY, IT CERTAINLY HAS
BEEN A LONG TIME.

27
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,458
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T
REALLY CALL YOU

28
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,958
MY LITTLE LADY ANYMORE,
CAN I, MISS STINGRAY?

29
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,791
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ACTUALLY RECOGNIZED ME.

30
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,083
- HOW COULD I FORGET SOMEONE
WHO WAS SO IMPORTANT TO US? 

31
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,666
NOW WHAT IS IT
THAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

32
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,625
TO BE HONEST, I HAVE SOME
QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWERING.

33
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,125
- I'M SURE YOU MUST.

34
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,791
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
VISIT SOMEONE

35
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,583
WHO WAS A PART OF
THAT DISTASTEFUL BUSINESS?

36
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,500
BELIEVE ME, MY CHILD,

37
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,666
I'M QUITE GLAD FOR
MY CHANCE AT ATONEMENT.

38
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,083
- AND I'M EQUALLY GLAD 
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

39
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,916
YOU SEE, I HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,666
THAT SOMEONE IS TRYING
TO DIG UP SOMETHING

41
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,041
THAT SHOULD BE LEFT BURIED.

42
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,500
- YOU MEAN BRIAN J. MASON.

43
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,250
- ( gasps ) 
SO YOU KNOW?

44
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,041
- HOW COULD I NOT?

45
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,791
GENOM HAS BEEN DIGGING
THEIR LITTLE EARTHWORM HOLES

46
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,791
BENEATH THE CITY
FOR QUITE AWHILE NOW.

47
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,500
BECAUSE OF THAT,

48
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,833
THE NATURAL FLOW OF ENERGY
THROUGH THE EARTH'S CRUST 

49
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,500
HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY
DISRUPTED.

50
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,166
IT'S ALL PART OF A PROJECT
THEY CALL "THE DRAGON LINE."

51
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,375
- SO MASON IS USING
THAT PROJECT AS A COVER

52
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,041
TO CONCEAL HIS SEARCH
FOR THE WIZ LAB.

53
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,166
- YES.  HE IS INDEED
SEARCHING FOR THE LAB.

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,583
BUT ALTHOUGH HE KEEPS
DIGGING EXPLORATORY HOLES,

55
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,208
HE KEEPS MISSING
THE TARGET.

56
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,541
- MISSING THE TARGET?
THEN YOU MUST KNOW...

57
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,708
- NO, I DON'T.
NOT EXACTLY ANYWAY.

58
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,541
THE CATACLYSM CAUSED 
A COMPLETE RESHIFTING

59
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,541
OF THE UNDERGROUND MASS.

60
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,208
EVEN MORE SO THAN WAS
INDICATED ON THE SURFACE.

61
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,833
HOWEVER, I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO RECONSTRUCT

62
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,708
THE GENERAL PATTERN
OF THAT EVENT.

63
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,208
- HMM.  I SEE.

64
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,166
- YOU CAME TO ASK ME HOW TO
FIND THE LAB, DIDN'T YOU?

65
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,625
- YES.

66
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,166
- AND WHAT IS IT THAT YOU
INTEND TO DO WITH IT

67
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,250
ONCE IT'S FOUND?

68
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,875
- I'LL DO WHAT
I HAVE TO DO. 

69
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,625
THE THINGS IN THAT LAB MUST
REMAIN LOCKED AWAY FOREVER

70
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,208
OUT OF THE REACH OF
MANIACS LIKE MASON.

71
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,208
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

72
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,750
- HMM.

73
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,750
I WONDER HOW DR. STINGRAY
WOULD FEEL ABOUT THAT.

74
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,916
- DOCTOR?!

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,541
- I'M SORRY.
A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS.

76
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,583
I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS,
MY DEAR.

77
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,541
I WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY
TO ASSIST YOU.

78
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,666
PLEASE, DO BE SEATED.

79
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,625
- ( sighs )

80
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,541
- I DON'T KNOW.

81
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,875
I JUST COULDN'T
FEEL THE BIKE

82
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,916
HANDLING THE SURFACE
OF THE ROAD, YOU KNOW?

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,750
- AT LEAST YOUR TIRES
ARE STILL OKAY FOR NOW.

84
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,250
BUT THREE NEW PARTS
AND THE SUSPENSION,

85
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,583
PLUS SWAPPING OUT
A CHAMBER.

86
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,708
IT WON'T BE CHEAP.

87
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,708
- LIFE'S A BITCH.

88
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,416
- OH, NENE!

89
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,666
YOU'RE HERE.

90
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,916
- HI, GUYS.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,208
- GREAT.
WHY'S SHE HERE?

92
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,625
NO, DON'T TELL ME.

93
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,583
- I WAS JUST PASSING BY, 
SO I THOUGHT I'D DROP IN.

94
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,708
- OH, THAT'S GREAT, NENE.

95
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,250
HEY, AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,

96
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,791
CAN YOU TEACH ME HOW TO DO
THAT OVERRIDE PATCH

97
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,791
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

98
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,250
- UM, NOT RIGHT NOW.

99
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,583
ACTUALLY, PRISS?

100
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,458
I WAS HOPING I COULD
TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND.

101
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,541
PLEASE?  SORRY, MACKY.
NEXT TIME, I PROMISE.

102
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,791
- ( sighs )

103
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,250
- AS YOU CAN SEE,

104
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,458
THE PATTERN OF MASON'S
DRAGON EXCAVATIONS

105
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,833
MAY SEEM FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE
ON THE SURFACE.

106
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,625
- BUT?
- BUT MASON'S CALCULATIONS

107
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,791
OBVIOUSLY HAVE NOT 
CORRECTLY ESTIMATED

108
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,583
HOW THE UNDERGROUND STRATA
WERE DISPLACED DURING THE EVENT.

109
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,916
AS HE IS OBVIOUSLY
BASING HIS EXCAVATIONS

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,458
ON SURFACE OBSERVATIONS,

111
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,166
HIS CHANCES OF ACTUALLY
FINDING THE LAB'S LOCATION

112
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,375
ARE VERY SLIM.

113
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,291
- BUT IF HE KEEPS ON DIGGING--

114
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,958
- YES, HE WILL FIND IT 
EVENTUALLY, I'M AFRAID.

115
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,833
BUT IF WE COMBINE OUR KNOWLEDGE
OF THE UNDERGROUND FLOW

116
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,000
WITH THE EXCAVATIONS
MASON HAS MADE,

117
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,333
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
ASCERTAIN THE PROBABLE

118
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,000
LOCATION OF THE LAB.

119
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,583
CAN YOUR PEOPLE
HANDLE IT FROM THERE?

120
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:55,916
- ABSOLUTELY.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,500
- THEN LET'S GET DOWN 
TO BUSINESS, SHALL WE?

122
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,750
I BELIEVE MY ASSOCIATES
CAN HELP US ELIMINATE

123
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,000
A FEW MORE OF 
THE VARIABLES,

124
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,666
BUT IT WILL
TAKE SOME TIME.

125
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,958
- I'M IN YOUR DEBT, SIR.

126
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,625
- NO, IT'S SOMETHING
I'VE OWED YOU

127
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,083
EVER SINCE I BECAME A PART
OF YOUR FATHER' AMBITIONS.

128
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,666
I'M AN OLD MAN WHO IS
ALL TOO AWARE

129
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,333
OF HIS IMPENDING MORTALITY.

130
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,666
I'VE DONE MUCH WRONG.

131
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,000
NOW I MUST ATONE.

132
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,583
- THANK YOU, SIR.

133
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,208
- HERE.

134
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,583
- UM, THANKS.

135
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,375
OKAY, I'M LISTENING.

136
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,333
- UM, JUST HOW MUCH
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT

137
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,708
SYLIA'S BACKGROUND?

138
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,041
- IS IT IMPORTANT?

139
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,250
- WELL, MAYBE NOT,

140
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,916
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
IT COULD BE.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,916
- LET'S SEE. YOU MET HER ABOUT
THE SAME TIME I DID, RIGHT?

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,125
THE FIRST TIME I SAW HER
WAS WHEN I WAS HAVING

143
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,708
A DISAGREEMENT WITH
SOME COPS AT A ROAD BLOCK.

144
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,708
SHE APPROACHED ME
A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT.

145
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,041
- I SEE.
WHAT I WAS WONDERING

146
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,375
WAS WHETHER SHE'D EVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT HER PAST OR CHILDHOOD?

147
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,333
- NOT REALLY.
IS ALL THIS GOING SOMEPLACE?

148
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,041
- WELL, THE THING IS,

149
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,875
I'M WONDERING
WHY SYLIA CREATED

150
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,458
THE KNIGHT SABERS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

151
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,916
- UH-HUH.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,041
- I WAS WONDERING EXACTLY
HOW HER FATHER FIT INTO IT.

153
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,916
- HER FATHER?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,500
ALMOST ALL THE ORIGINAL
BOOMER TECHNOLOGY PATENTS

155
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,416
WERE IN HIS NAME.
- YEAH?

156
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,333
- WELL, SYLIA REALLY
HATES BOOMERS, DOESN'T SHE?

157
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,583
IS IT BECAUSE HER FATHER
CREATED THEM,

158
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,750
OR IS THERE SOME
OTHER REASON?

159
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,666
- NENE, WHY ARE YOU 
SUDDENLY SO CURIOUS?

160
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,583
- HASN'T IT EVER
WORRIED YOU?

161
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,291
WELL, NEVER MIND.

162
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,958
I WAS JUST WONDERING,
THAT'S ALL.

163
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,875
- NIGEL,
ABOUT PROFESSOR MASON--

164
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,291
- I TOLD YOU NOT
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

165
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,333
- BUT, NIGEL...

166
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,916
SYLIA.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,875
- GOOD AFTERNOON, NIGEL.

168
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,000
I HAVE SOMETHING I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

169
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,083
- RIGHT.
WE CAN TALK IN THERE.

170
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,708
MACKY,
FINISH UP OUT HERE.

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,666
- Nene: HMM.
"DR. STEVEN STINGRAY.

172
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,291
CREATOR OF BOOMER
AND VOOMER TECHNOLOGY.

173
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,333
KILLED IN THE TOKYO EARTHQUAKE
SEVEN YEARS AGO."

174
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,750
- ( beeping )
- HUH?

175
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,791
HMM.

176
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,458
PASS CODE.
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

177
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,625
THAT'S THE TICKET.

178
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,458
I'M SO GOOD,
IT SCARES ME SOMETIMES.

179
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,458
HUH?  WHAT?

180
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,125
NO WAY.  IT CAN'T BE.

181
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,791
- ( beeping )

182
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,500
- ( sighs )

183
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,583
JUST AS I SUSPECTED.

184
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,500
THAT CREATURE WAS AN OFFSHOOT
OF MY FATHER'S EXPERIMENTS.

185
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,000
- ( dings )

186
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,916
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN 
PART OF THE RESEARCH

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,166
THAT LED UP TO THE CREATION
OF THE CORE PROTOTYPE.

188
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,166
- I BROUGHT THE THINGS
YOU ASKED FOR.

189
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,166
- OH, THANK YOU, NIGEL.

190
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,458
- DO YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
SET UP FOR THE TEST?

191
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,541
- YES, IT'S READY TO GO.

192
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,041
JUST PUT IT ON
THE TABLE, PLEASE.

193
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,125
- WHAT NOW?

194
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,833
- WE'LL USE THE RADAR
AND SONAR TOGETHER.

195
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,416
I'M SETTING IT UP NOW.

196
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,541
IF MY HUNCH IS CORRECT,

197
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,541
THAT MONSTER WAS ABLE
TO LOCATE BOOMERS

198
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,541
BY BROADCASTING A SERIES 
OF ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES

199
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,041
THAT TRIGGERED A SPECIFIC 
SERIES OF SONIC VIBRATIONS

200
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,708
IT COULD SENSE
THROUGH THE GROUND.

201
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,791
WE KNOW THE FREQUENCY
IT USED TO DISABLE THE BOOMERS,

202
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,166
SO LET'S TRY THIS.

203
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,583
- ( powering on )

204
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,000
- I'D SAY YOU GUESSED
CORRECTLY, RIGHT?

205
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,500
- YES.  SO IT WOULD APPEAR.

206
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,208
THIS OUGHT TO MAKE
THE TASK OF FINDING THE LAB

207
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,375
A LOT SIMPLER.

208
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,250
- UNFORTUNATELY,
THE EFFECTIVE RANGE

209
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,583
OF THAT HANDHELD EMP CANNON
IS BARELY 300 METERS.

210
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,250
IT WOULD TAKE 10 YEARS
TO COVER ALL OF TOKYO THAT WAY.

211
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,458
- NOT QUITE.

212
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,166
UTILIZING THE WIND MASTER'S
DATA,

213
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,458
WE CAN NARROW OUR SELECTION

214
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,583
OF POSSIBLE SEARCH
AREAS CONSIDERABLY.

215
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,458
THERE ARE 27 TARGET ZONES 
THAT WE'LL BE FOCUSING ON.

216
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,541
AND THANKS TO MASON,
MOST OF THEM SHOULD BE

217
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,083
ACCESSIBLE THROUGH
THE TUNNEL SYSTEM.

218
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,250
I THINK THE GIRLS AND I
CAN MANAGE THAT.

219
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,250
- TRUE, BUT EVEN ASSUMING
THAT YOU MANAGE TO FIND IT,

220
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,833
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH IT?

221
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,583
- ACTUALLY, GENOM HAS PROVIDED
THE FINAL SOLUTION THEMSELVES.

222
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,791
- GENOM?

223
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,916
IF THEY COULDN'T HANDLE IT
SEVEN YEARS AGO,

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,041
WHAT CAN THEY POSSIBLY
DO AGAINST IT NOW?

225
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,583
- IT'S AN APPLICATION
OF TECHNOLOGY

226
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,750
THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE
SEVEN YEARS AGO.

227
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,708
I CAME UP WITH IT AFTER
GOING OVER DR. SHAN'S DATA.

228
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,125
AND THIS TIME,
I'M GOING TO ELIMINATE

229
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,416
THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

230
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,625
- THAT'S THE 1:00 EXPRESS.

231
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,666
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
HEAD BACK SOON.

232
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,833
- MM-HMM.  OH WELL.

233
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,708
I GUESS WE'VE
PLAYED HOOKY LONG ENOUGH.

234
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,000
- I'M GLAD YOU
TOLD ME ABOUT THIS.

235
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,666
I KNEW NENE
WAS ACTING ODD,

236
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,958
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHY.

237
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,166
- WELL, HOPEFULLY SHE'LL
BE ABLE TO WORK IT OUT

238
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,416
BY HERSELF.

239
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,875
- ( engine revs )

240
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,791
- DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
ASK SYLIA ABOUT THIS?

241
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,000
I KNOW IT WOULD SEEM
LIKE WE'RE PRYING,

242
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,208
BUT TO BE HONEST,

243
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,083
I THINK NENE MIGHT
BE ONTO SOMETHING.

244
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,583
- HUH?

245
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,500
- WELL, JUST WHY DID SYLIA
START THE KNIGHT SABERS ANYWAY?

246
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,541
MONEY DOESN'T SEEM
VERY IMPORTANT TO HER,

247
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,333
SO I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE REASON.

248
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,583
BUT JUST WHAT ELSE
DOES THAT LEAVE?

249
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,041
- AND I THINK WE CAN ALSO
RULE OUT A BURNING DESIRE

250
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,583
TO PLAY SUPERHERO
AND SAVE THE WORLD.

251
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,375
THAT'S YOUR MOTIVATION,
RIGHT?

252
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,375
- ( sighs ) OKAY, YOU'VE
GOT ME WITH THAT ONE.

253
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,000
UH, HEY, PRISS, LOOK.

254
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,708
THE TRUTH IS, I DON'T CARE
WHAT KIND OF REASON SYLIA HAS.

255
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,708
WE'VE ALL GOT OUR
OWN LITTLE SECRETS.

256
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,708
BUT WHAT WE'RE 
DOING IS RIGHT.

257
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,375
SYLIA MAY BE STRANGE,
BUT I DO TRUST HER.

258
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,166
- MACKY, OIL FILTER.

259
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,458
- UH, RIGHT.

260
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,833
NIGEL--
- WRENCH.

261
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:57,791
- RIGHT.

262
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,750
SO, UM...
WHAT DID SYLIA WANT?

263
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,750
- WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?

264
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,750
- I DID,
BUT SHE WOULDN'T SAY.

265
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,041
- THEN I CAN'T
TELL YOU EITHER, CAN I?

266
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,083
- I UNDERSTAND.

267
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,041
BUT COULD YOU AT LEAST
TELL ME IF SHE'S PLANNING

268
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,416
SOMETHING DANGEROUS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

269
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,250
I JUST MADE SOMETHING
ACCORDING TO HER SPECIFICATIONS.

270
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,375
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS
OR HOW SHE USES IT.

271
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,458
- DID IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH PROFESSOR MASON

272
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,791
SHOWING UP YESTERDAY?

273
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,458
- MUFFLER.

274
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,125
GIVE ME THE MUFFLER,
PLEASE.

275
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,125
- RIGHT.

276
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,208
- IT'S TIME FOR A BREAK.

277
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,875
- HI, NIGEL.

278
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,666
- ( sighs )

279
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,500
- UH, HELLO, NENE.
- OH, HI, MACKY. 

280
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,791
- DO YOU TAKE CREAM
IN YOUR COFFEE?

281
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,625
OR WOULD YOU PREFER
COCOA TODAY?

282
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,791
- COCOA, PLEASE.

283
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,458
HEY, MACKY?

284
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,791
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

285
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,958
- 15.
- I THOUGHT SO.

286
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,458
AND YOUR FATHER WAS THE FAMOUS
DR. STINGRAY, RIGHT?

287
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,458
SO WHAT KIND OF
FATHER WAS HE? 

288
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,916
- UM, I REALLY DON'T
REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT HIM.

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,333
I WAS PRETTY YOUNG
AND HE WAS ALWAYS BUSY.

290
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,166
SYLIA COULD TELL YOU MORE.

291
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,000
- OH, YEAH.  OF COURSE.

292
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,500
- HERE'S YOUR COCOA.

293
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,833
- THANKS, MACKY.

294
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,458
SO ANYWAY, I GUESS
YOU LIVED WITH SYLIA

295
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,458
UNTIL YOU WERE HOW OLD?

296
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,916
- OH, WELL...

297
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,916
UNTIL I WAS EIGHT.
BUT WHY?

298
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,375
- EIGHT, I SEE.

299
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,583
WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHAT SYLIA WAS LIKE

300
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,791
BACK WHEN SHE WAS A KID,
THAT'S ALL.

301
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,916
I MEAN, WAS SHE ANY DIFFERENT
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER

302
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,333
THAN SHE IS NOW?

303
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,583
- HMM.

304
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,333
SHE WAS PRETTY SMART,
EVEN THEN.

305
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,666
I THINK SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT

306
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,375
SHE WAS A LITTLE 
COOL AND DISTANT.

307
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,166
BUT SHE WAS
REALLY NICE TO ME.

308
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,166
SHE SEEMED TO HAVE
A LOT ON HER MIND.

309
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,500
- HMM.

310
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,416
SO PRETTY MUCH
LIKE SHE IS NOW.

311
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,541
OH, I MEANT THAT ABOUT
THE BEING NICE PART.

312
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,875
( chuckles )

313
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,875
OKAY.  SO WHAT WERE YOU
LIKE AS A KID, MACKY? 

314
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,250
- HUH?  ME?

315
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,208
I HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH
SINCE THEN.

316
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,208
- LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.
- UH, RIGHT.

317
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,875
- THE STINGRAY WOMAN

318
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,958
CONTACTED A MEMBER
OF THE OLD ORDER. 

319
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,166
A MAN NAMED DR. SHAN.

320
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,541
- INTERESTING.

321
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,708
OBVIOUSLY THE OLD ORDER
ISN'T AS DORMANT

322
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,041
AS WE BELIEVED IT TO BE.

323
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,541
THEY COULD MAKE THINGS
DIFFICULT FOR US.

324
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,416
- THAT'S TRUE.
GENOM MAY HAVE TAKEN

325
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,666
THEIR PLACE IN
THE SPOTLIGHT,

326
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,458
BUT WITH THEIR ASSETS,
THEY COULD STILL PROVE

327
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,125
TO BE A FORMIDABLE
ADVERSARY.

328
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,583
- BUT THOSE SAME ASSETS
COULD MAKE THEM A USEFUL TOOL.

329
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,583
MISS STINGRAY IS AS RESOURCEFUL
AS I HAD HOPED.

330
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,083
- ISN'T THAT WHY
YOU PURPOSELY ALLOWED KUSUI

331
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,250
TO LEAK INFORMATION TO HER?
- OF COURSE.

332
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,125
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT
STINGRAY MAINTAINED

333
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,250
AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK
OF COLLABORATORS.

334
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,583
LET'S START USING THEM.

335
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,916
- IS THAT WISE?

336
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,666
THESE ARE SOME
VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE

337
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,583
YOU'RE PLAYING GAMES WITH,
DR. MASON.

338
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,750
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER SUBJECT?

339
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,583
- HMM.
NIGEL KIRKLAND?

340
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,750
WE'VE CONTACTED HIM
AS PER YOUR INSTRUCTIONS,

341
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,791
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WE NEED TO BOTHER 

342
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,666
WITH A NOBODY LIKE HIM.

343
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,458
- I TOLD YOU,
STINGRAY LEFT ME AN INHERITANCE.

344
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,791
I INTEND TO USE IT.

345
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,083
- YES, SIR.

346
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,916
- SO, YOU WANT US
TO GO UNDERGROUND

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,625
AND INVESTIGATE EACH
OF THESE 27 SITES?

348
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,458
- Sylia: THAT'S RIGHT.
AND I'LL BE PAYING YOU EACH

349
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,958
DOUBLE THE USUAL PRICE,
ALL RIGHT?

350
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,291
- WELL, I'M SURE YOU CAN
COUNT ME IN, SYLIA.

351
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:33,291
BUT THIS WIZ LAB, IS THERE 
SOMETHING DANGEROUS INSIDE?

352
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,125
IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T TRUST YOU,

353
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,583
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT
SPEED UP THE SEARCH 

354
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,708
IF WE KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

355
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,958
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

356
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,583
- I JUST WANT YOU
TO FIND THE LAB. 

357
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,625
SO IT'S POINTLESS
FOR ME TO TELL YOU MORE.

358
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,625
I'LL HANDLE EVERYTHING
AFTER THAT.

359
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,291
- CAN I ASK YOU
ONE QUESTION?

360
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,291
- WHAT?
- FROM WHAT YOU'VE SAID,

361
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,500
THIS WIZ LABORATORY
HAS BEEN MISSING

362
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,333
EVER SINCE THE EARTHQUAKE,
RIGHT?

363
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,000
- RIGHT.

364
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,791
- IS THIS YOUR FATHER'S LAB?

365
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,750
- WHAT?

366
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,166
- YES, IT IS.

367
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,333
- THEN SOMETHING DANGEROUS
MIGHT BE IN THERE.

368
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,666
- PLEASE, PRISS.
I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYMORE.

369
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,000
- OKAY,
YOU CAN COUNT ME IN.

370
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,666
WHO THE HELL AM I
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT GETTING

371
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,333
DOUBLE MY USUAL PAYCHECK?

372
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,666
- THANKS, PRISS.  NENE?

373
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,333
- HOLD UP.  WHY DIDN'T YOU
INVITE MACKY TO THIS BRIEFING?

374
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,500
- WHAT?
- IF IT'S YOUR FATHER'S LAB,

375
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,083
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
TOLD MACKY?

376
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,541
- IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

377
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,500
TRUST ME.

378
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,333
- I'M SORRY, SYLIA, BUT I'VE
BEEN GOING THROUGH YOUR FILES,

379
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,958
AND I'VE FOUND SOME
GLARING DISCREPANCIES.

380
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,875
NOW I WANT FACTS.
- NENE!

381
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,875
- AT FIRST I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE,

382
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,916
BUT THE MORE I DUG
THE MORE IT BECAME OBVIOUS

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,333
THAT IT WASN'T JUST
A CLERICAL ERROR.

384
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,333
THERE'S NO BIRTH CERTIFICATE,
NO ADOPTION RECORD,

385
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,375
NOTHING TO INDICATE
HE EVER EXISTED AT ALL.

386
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,541
DR. STINGRAY NEVER
HAD A SON, DID HE?

387
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,041
HE NEVER EXISTED!

388
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,708
WHO IS MACKY, SYLIA?

389
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,791
WHO IN THE HELL IS HE?

390
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,416
- ( both gasp )

391
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,041
- YOU WON'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION, WILL YOU?

392
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,375
- I'M SORRY, NENE.

393
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,250
- WAS HE INVOLVED WITH
THE ACCIDENT AT THE LAB?

394
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,041
- YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT TOO?

395
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,375
- SURE.

396
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,333
IT WAS QUITE A CHALLENGE
CRACKING THROUGH

397
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,583
ALL OF THE SECURITY SYSTEMS
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS

398
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,250
PROTECTING THEIR
ONE AND ONLY FILE.

399
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,541
BUT I FINALLY
GOT THROUGH TO IT

400
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,166
USING THE ADP MAINFRAME.

401
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,083
- WAIT, NENE. 
WHAT ACCIDENT?

402
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,083
- IT ALL BEGAN
THE YEAR BEFORE THE QUAKE

403
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,833
WHEN THE BIOSCAPE CORPORATION,

404
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,958
WHICH IS WHERE
DR. STINGRAY HAD BEEN WORKING,

405
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,833
WAS BOUGHT OUT,
AND THE BOOMER PROJECT

406
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,375
WAS TRANSFERRED TO GENOM.

407
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,291
DR. STINGRAY HAD 
FINALLY SUCCEEDED

408
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,916
IN CREATING A VIABLE CORE,

409
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,750
AND THE MASS PRODUCTION
OF BOOMERS HAD JUST BEGUN.

410
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,083
EVERYTHING SEEMED TO
BE GOING PERFECTLY, 

411
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,416
BUT SUDDENLY THERE WAS A
MYSTERIOUS ACCIDENT AT THE LAB.

412
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,750
THE FILES DON'T SAY
EXACTLY WHAT,

413
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,416
BUT IT WAS BAD ENOUGH
FOR THE GOVERNMENT

414
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,083
TO SECRETLY SEND IN
A BATTALION OF POLICE TROOPS.

415
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,750
- SO WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

416
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,083
- I DON'T KNOW.

417
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,041
THE FILE I WAS
ABLE TO ACCESS

418
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,416
WAS A RECORD OF
THE POLICE MOBILIZATION,

419
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,083
AND IT HAD BEEN HEAVILY 
EDITED IN SEVERAL SPOTS.

420
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,791
HOWEVER, EVEN THOUGH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

421
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,791
I KNOW HOW HORRIBLE
IT MUST HAVE BEEN

422
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,000
BY THE WAY GENOM
DECIDED TO DEAL WITH IT.

423
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,416
THE CHAIRMAN OF GENOM
JUDGED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE

424
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
TO SAVE THE SITUATION,

425
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,125
AND ORDERED THE DETONATION OF
AN ARTIFICIAL EARTHQUAKE DEVICE.

426
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,458
- Linna: NO WAY.

427
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,125
YOU'RE SAYING THAT SOMEONE
CAUSED THE EARTHQUAKE?

428
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,791
- Priss:
SYLIA, IS THIS TRUE?

429
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,458
- YES, IT'S ALL TRUE.

430
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,208
THE EARTHQUAKE, EVERYTHING.

431
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,666
- JESUS!  ALL THOSE PEOPLE
DIED IN THE EARTHQUAKE

432
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,458
BECAUSE ONE PERSON
PUSHED A BUTTON?! 

433
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,375
MILLIONS DIED!

434
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,791
- SO TELL ME, SYLIA.

435
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,458
WHAT WAS IT THAT WAS
INSIDE THAT LAB

436
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,125
THAT WAS WORTH DESTROYING
A CITY TO TRY TO STOP IT?

437
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,500
- I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

438
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,250
HOWEVER, MACKY HAD
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 

439
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,833
TO DO WITH
THE ACCIDENT, NENE.

440
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,500
I SWEAR IT'S THE TRUTH.

441
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,333
- YOU SWEAR?!

442
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,833
WHY IN THE HELL SHOULD I
EVER TRUST YOU AGAIN?!

443
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,125
- NENE!

444
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,833
- YOU CAN GO TOO
IF YOU WANT.

445
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,166
- SYLIA?
- WHAT NENE SAID WAS TRUE.

446
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,041
I WITHHELD INFORMATION
FROM YOU.

447
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,666
I'VE ASKED YOU
TO DO THINGS FOR ME

448
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,666
AND NEVER EXPLAINED
THE CONSEQUENCES.

449
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,500
I'VE USED YOU,
AND I'M ASHAMED.

450
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,125
- YEAH, WELL YOU SHOULD BE.

451
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,125
 SO...
- HUH?

452
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,916
- NONE OF THIS
CHANGES THE FACT

453
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,041
THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING OUT THERE

454
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,708
THAT WE STILL NEED
TO FIND, RIGHT?

455
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,208
SO LET'S GET WITH THE PROGRAM
AND FIND IT, OKAY?

456
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,708
- PRISS IS RIGHT.

457
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,708
IF THERE'S REALLY SOMETHING
LIKE THIS STILL OUT THERE, 

458
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,041
THEN WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE
BUT TO HELP YOU FIND IT.

459
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,333
BESIDES, YOU KNOW I'M A SUCKER
FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

460
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,875
- THANK YOU.
BOTH OF YOU.

461
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,125
- I JUST WISH...

462
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,625
HEY, PRISS.

463
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,875
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

464
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,541
- ABOUT NENE?

465
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,541
I'M THINKING IT'S
A GOOD THING SHE'S NOT HERE

466
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,750
IN HER CURRENT
MENTAL STATE, 

467
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,083
AND WE'RE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HER.

468
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,875
IF YOU AND I EACH SEARCH
