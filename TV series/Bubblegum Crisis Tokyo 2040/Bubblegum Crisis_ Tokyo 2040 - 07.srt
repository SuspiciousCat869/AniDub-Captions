1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,375
- Bill: PLEASE, ERIN,

4
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,208
I SWEAR I'LL BE
BACK HOME IN TIME

5
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,541
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY NEXT MONTH,
I PROMISE.

6
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,708
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET THAT
I COULDN'T MAKE IT HOME 

7
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,291
IN TIME FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,

8
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,083
BUT WE'VE BEEN
SO BUSY DOWN HERE.

9
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,750
- YOU'VE BEEN BUSY?

10
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,083
IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS.

11
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,041
WHAT IN THE HELL'S
BEEN TAKING SO LONG?

12
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,250
- I ALREADY EXPLAINED IT TO YOU.

13
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,041
EVER SINCE THAT
IMPLOSION IN FOUR,

14
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,625
WE'VE BEEN UNDERMANNED.

15
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,291
- RIGHT, BILL.

16
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,916
AND JUST HOW MANY TIMES
DID YOU COME HOME

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,416
BEFORE THAT ACCIDENT?

18
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,083
TWO TIMES IN A WHOLE YEAR.

19
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,250
AND ONE OF THOSE WAS
FOR JUST FIVE HOURS.

20
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,041
- HONEY, I PROMISE--

21
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,750
- DON'T MAKE PROMISES
YOU CAN'T KEEP.

22
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,041
- HEY, ERIN!

23
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,333
( sighs )

24
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,833
- RIGHT, BILL.

25
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,750
AND JUST HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU
COME HOME BEFORE THAT ACCIDENT?

26
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,875
TWO TIMES IN A WHOLE YEAR.

27
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,250
- HUH?

28
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:32,833
( gasps )

29
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,833
( screaming )

30
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,041
- ( grunts )

31
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,375
HEY, WATCH IT, BOOMER!

32
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,375
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T
USE THE SAME SIDEWALKS

33
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,333
THAT PEOPLE USE?

34
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,541
YEAH, YOU HEARD ME.

35
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,750
IF YOU DON'T GET
OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW,

36
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,000
I'LL CALL THE ADP.

37
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,208
- KEEP YOUR EYES
ON YOUR TOOLBOX,

38
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,541
MR. PEEPING TOM.

39
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,833
- WHAT?

40
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,500
- LET'S SEE HOW IT FITS.

41
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,250
( grunts )

42
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,750
COLD.

43
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,250
- Nigel: THE COOLANT LEVELS
ARE STILL BEING ADJUSTED.

44
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,208
JUST GIVE IT A SECOND.

45
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,583
HMM.

46
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,583
( grunts )

47
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,250
( sighs )
AWESOME.

48
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,541
IT'S A LOT LIGHTER,
NIGEL.

49
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,541
HEY, LOOK AT THIS, SYLIA.

50
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,583
CHECK OUT HOW I MOVE
IN THIS NEW ARMOR.

51
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,791
WITH THIS HARDSUIT,

52
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,791
I BET I COULD EVEN
OUTPERFORM PRISS! 

53
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,666
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN HERE, MACKY?

54
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,625
- UH?  HMM...

55
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,958
- ACTUALLY, HE'S THE REASON
THE NEW MODIFICATIONS

56
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,333
ARE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.
HE'S GOOD.

57
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,875
- MACKY,

58
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,750
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT YOU
GETTING INVOLVED WITH THIS.

59
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,291
I THOUGHT I MADE THAT
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

60
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,791
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE
AN ORDINARY BOY.

61
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,791
WHAT THE GIRLS AND I
ARE DOING DOWN HERE 

62
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,458
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

63
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,625
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

64
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,291
I KNOW WE MAKE A SPECIAL
EXCEPTION FOR NIGEL,

65
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,625
BUT THE KNIGHT SABERS
IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOMETHING

66
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,041
THAT'S JUST FOR US GIRLS.

67
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,333
RIGHT, SYLIA?

68
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,833
- Henderson: I'M AFRAID
THERE'S NOTHING HERE

69
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,833
THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO WEAR,
MASTER MACKY.

70
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,291
- YES, I SEE THAT.

71
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,500
UH, SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN WORKING HERE?

72
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,208
- WELL, I'VE WORKED
FOR YOUR SISTER

73
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,041
SINCE SHE RETURNED
TO TOKYO.

74
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,666
THE TRUTH IS THAT 
I OWE MY VERY LIFE

75
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,625
TO MISTRESS SYLIA.

76
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,416
- HMM.

77
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,333
BUT IS STAYING HERE
WORTH THE DEBT?

78
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,500
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

79
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,166
- OH, NEVER MIND ME.
I'M JUST BABBLING.

80
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,916
- ( children laughing,
chattering )

81
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,958
- ( sighs )

82
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,791
- Macky: WOW.

83
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,041
- HMM?
- UM, I'M SORRY, NIGEL.

84
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,208
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
FOLLOWED YOU LIKE THIS.

85
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,416
- WHERE'S SYLIA?

86
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,333
- UM, SHE WENT OUT
SOMEWHERE AGAIN,

87
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,875
SO I THOUGHT--

88
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,708
OH, WOW.
THIS MACHINE'S INCREDIBLE.

89
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,041
DID YOU MAKE IT 
ALL BY YOURSELF?

90
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,875
- IT'S NOT FINISHED YET.

91
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,750
- IT MUST BE WONDERFUL
TO MAKE THINGS LIKE THIS.

92
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,416
- Reporter: Meanwhile,
with the scheduled completion

93
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,083
of the Showen project
approaching,

94
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,750
the value of Genom's corporate
stock has risen dramatically

95
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,041
over the last few days.

96
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,916
As the Showen project
also promises

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,625
to severely curtail
energy dependence

98
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,625
on existing resources...

99
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,291
- YOU KNOW I HATE COMING HERE.

100
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,958
THE SIGHT OF THAT UMBRELLA
HANGING IN THE SKY

101
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,458
MAKES ME SICK 
TO MY STOMACH.

102
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,291
- SORRY, BUT I HAD TO
TELL YOU THIS IN PERSON.

103
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,291
- IT'S THE SHOWEN PROJECT,
ISN'T IT?

104
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,500
THE ORBITAL CONSTRUCTION
BOOMERS ARE GOING ROGUE,

105
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,458
AREN'T THEY?

106
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,125
- NO, QUITE THE OPPOSITE
IN FACT.

107
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,750
THE CHAIRMAN HAS
INSTRUCTED US

108
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,958
TO INCREASE BOOMER
PRODUCTION LEVELS AGAIN.

109
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,458
- THE QUAKE RECONSTRUCTION
IS ALMOST COMPLETE.

110
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,958
HOW CAN HE JUSTIFY THAT
KIND OF PRODUCTION OUTPUT?

111
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,958
- OH, HE'S COVERED THAT BASE.

112
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,875
FRONTIER PLANET DEVELOPMENT

113
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,625
IS THE NEW GENOM BUZZ WORD.

114
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,791
BOOMERS TO MINE
THE NATURAL RESOURCES

115
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,458
OF JUPITER AND SATURN.

116
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,416
THE DEEP SEA MODELS
THEY'RE TESTING NOW

117
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,791
ARE THE PROTOTYPES.

118
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,125
- DEEP SEA MODELS?

119
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,333
- YEAH, THE EXTREME
WATER PRESSURE

120
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,958
IS A GOOD TEST FOR
THE CONDITIONS

121
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,833
ON THE HEAVY GRAVITY PLANETS.

122
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,125
- AND?

123
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,125
- FIRST, LET ME ASK YOU
IF YOU UNDERSTAND

124
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,500
THE REMOTE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY
WE'VE BEEN EMPLOYING

125
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,833
ON OUR MOTO SERIES
OF BOOMER SLAVE DRONES.

126
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,666
- OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND IT.

127
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,333
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

128
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,583
YOU'RE USING A SIMILAR 
TECHNOLOGY, AREN'T YOU?

129
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,833
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
WHAT I'M USING.

130
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,833
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO
THE MOTO UNITS?

131
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,500
ARE THEY GOING ROGUE?

132
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,041
- WE'RE NOT SURE YET.

133
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,000
BUT IT APPEARS THAT
ONE OF THEM HAS DECIDED

134
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,833
TO COME TO TOKYO
ALL BY ITSELF.

135
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,833
NEEDLESS TO SAY, MY SECTION
IS RATHER CONCERNED ABOUT THIS.

136
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,166
- NOW WAIT A SECOND.

137
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,500
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

138
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,166
A MOTO SYSTEM CAN'T EVEN
OPERATE BY ITSELF.

139
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,500
- THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT.

140
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,333
BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO COMMUNICATE WITH

141
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,791
OUR DEEP SEA FACILITY
FOR A WEEK.

142
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,208
- IF THIS DEEP SEA MODEL
REALLY IS HERE IN TOKYO,

143
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,208
HOW WOULD SOMEONE
GO ABOUT STOPPING IT?

144
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,708
- IT WOULDN'T BE EASY.

145
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,875
IT'S BUILT TO WITHSTAND
INCREDIBLE WEIGHTS AND PRESSURE,

146
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,750
SO IT'D BE LIKE TRYING
TO STOP A WALKING FORTRESS.

147
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,416
- RIGHT.  CONTACT ME
IF YOU LEARN ANYTHING MORE.

148
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,750
- ( sighs )

149
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,791
- YOU LIAR.

150
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,458
- HEY, BABY.
- MM.

151
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,666
- Mason: JUST WHAT
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

152
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,083
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
THAT ONE OF OUR MOTO DRONES

153
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,666
DECIDED TO WALK TO TOKYO
ALL ON ITS OWN, DO YOU? 

154
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,875
IMPOSSIBLE.

155
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,125
- THE NAME OF
THE MOTO DRONE'S OPERATOR

156
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,458
WAS BILL NORDBERG.

157
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,791
ASIDE FROM OUR OWN STAFF,
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE

158
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,458
WHO HAD THE ACCESS CODES
TO OPERATE IT REMOTELY. 

159
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,250
AND WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT
HIS WIFE LIVES HERE IN TOKYO.

160
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,083
- I SEE.
- CONCERNED CITIZENS

161
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,750
HAVE ALREADY CALLED
THE AD POLICE ABOUT THE DRONE.

162
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,583
- OH, HAVE THEY?

163
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,416
THEN WE'LL LET THEM
DISPOSE OF IT, RIGHT?

164
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,291
- Sylia: THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S JUST
WANDERING AROUND THE CITY.

165
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,916
SINCE LINNA'S SUIT HASN'T
BEEN COMPLETELY UPGRADED YET,

166
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,250
IT'LL BE JUST YOU AND PRISS.

167
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,291
- Nene: RIGHT.

168
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,625
- ( chuckling )

169
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,250
( both laughing )

170
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:34,208
- ( siren wailing )

171
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,333
- ( laughing continues )

172
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,000
- ( sighs )

173
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,000
- ( groans )
- HUH?

174
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,666
- ( gasps )

175
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,208
- WHAT'S WRONG?

176
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,208
AW, IT'S JUST A BOOMER.

177
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,666
THOSE ADP JERKS 
ARE HANDLING IT.

178
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,000
- YOU'RE WRONG.

179
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,333
I THINK IT'S BILL.

180
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,416
- HUH?

181
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,166
- NO, NOT NOW.

182
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,375
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

183
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,541
YOUR HUSBAND'S
WHERE HE ALWAYS IS.

184
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,041
AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.

185
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,458
MMM.

186
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,291
HUH?
( yelps )

187
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,583
( screams )

188
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,333
- Officer: NOPE.
NO BOOMER IN HERE.

189
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,958
- UH-HUH.  CAN WE ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS, MA'AM?

190
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,250
- QUESTIONS ABOUT BILL?

191
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR HUSBAND.

192
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,958
WE THINK HE'S THE ONE
WHO'S CONTROLLING THAT BOOMER.

193
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,208
- UM, EXCUSE ME,

194
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,291
BUT WILL YOU BE NEEDING ME
FOR ANYTHING ELSE?

195
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,250
- SURE. BUT WE ALREADY KNOW
WHERE TO FIND YOU, MR. PARKS.

196
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,583
- ( gasps )
OH, MAN.

197
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,041
MY WIFE IS GONNA KILL ME.

198
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,291
- HE KNOWS.

199
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,250
- EXCUSE ME.

200
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,958
MAY I BORROW THIS, MA'AM?

201
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,958
- ( sighs )

202
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,916
( gasping )

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,750
BILL...

204
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,375
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING NOW,
DOESN'T HE?

205
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,833
- HUH?

206
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,291
- Officer:
ATTENTION ALL UNITS,

207
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,291
THE ROGUE BOOMER
IS STILL AT LARGE.

208
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,416
IF YOU FIND THIS BOOMER,
CALL FOR BACKUP IMMEDIATELY.

209
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,750
THIS MOTO DRONE CAN ONLY BE
STOPPED WITH HEAVY WEAPONRY.

210
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,250
- I WISH I COULD
GO WITH YOU.

211
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,708
- SORRY, BUT US OLD-TIMERS
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS.

212
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,375
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PRISS?

213
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,083
- JUST STAY OUT OF
MY WAY, OKAY?

214
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,041
- ( groans )
JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE

215
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,416
ALL THE MODIFICATIONS
THAT NIGEL'S MADE TO MY SUIT.

216
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,000
- WELL, THE AD POLICE SEEM TO
HAVE LOST THE TARGET AGAIN.

217
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,041
LET'S GO, GIRLS.

218
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,666
IS SOMETHING WRONG,
PRISS?

219
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,208
- WHAT?  UM, NO.
NOT REALLY.

220
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,208
- NIGEL'S BEEN
WORKING ON YOUR SUIT,

221
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,958
SO THE FEEDBACK RATIOS MAY BE
FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

222
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,791
Linna, you'll run 
support this time.

223
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,958
Meet me in the mobile pit.
- UM, RIGHT.

224
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,833
- WAIT.  NIGEL HADN'T
FINISHED THAT SUIT YET.

225
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,000
- Priss: LET'S DO IT!

226
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,958
- ( sighs ) HOW COULD
THEY LOSE IT AGAIN?

227
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,625
- YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING
STRANGE GOING ON HERE.

228
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,333
- WHAT'S SO STRANGE?

229
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,000
THE WOMAN'S HUSBAND
IS OUT OF TOWN

230
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,291
AND SHE GETS THE ITCH.

231
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,166
- OUT OF TOWN,
OF COURSE.

232
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,833
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS WHOLE CASE

233
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,625
THAT WASN'T MAKING ANY SENSE.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

234
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,583
- I THINK GENOM'S
HIDING SOMETHING FROM US.

235
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,791
WHERE WAS THIS
PICTURE TAKEN?

236
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,750
HELLO, WHAT'S THIS?

237
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,166
A PRESSURE GAUGE?

238
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,833
- ( chiming )

239
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,541
- BOOMERS FOR HIGH PRESSURE
ENVIRONMENTS.

240
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,458
- HEY, WHY ARE YOU STOPPED
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD?

241
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,750
HUH?
( screaming )

242
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,916
- REDIAL.

243
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,625
- Hi, you've reached
the Nordberg residence.

244
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,458
We're not available right now.

245
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,416
Please leave a message
after the beep.

246
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,416
- ( beeps )

247
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,875
- HI, HONEY.
I FORGOT TO SAY

248
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,875
I'LL BE TAKING
THREE WEEKS VACATION

249
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,208
STARTING WITH
OUR ANNIVERSARY, OKAY?

250
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,541
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL
I CAN SEE YOU AGAIN.

251
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,916
- ( pounding on door )

252
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,083
- Macky: NIGEL!

253
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,208
NIGEL!

254
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,083
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

255
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,041
NIGEL!  NIGEL!

256
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,250
- ( screeches )

257
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,333
- ( man screams )

258
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,375
- NIGEL!

259
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,583
NIGEL, YOU'VE GOT TO WAKE UP.

260
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,250
SYLIA SENT PRISS OUT
IN HER NEW HARDSUIT.

261
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,541
- WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

262
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,916
I NEVER TOLD HER ANY OF
THOSE SUITS WERE READY.

263
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,625
- WELL, COME ON!

264
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,166
- COME ON, WHAT?

265
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,833
MY JOB IS TO
MAINTAIN THE SUITS,

266
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,125
NOT PLAY NURSE MAID.

267
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,958
- NIGEL, WE'VE GOT TO
TELL SYLIA RIGHT NOW.

268
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,250
- IT'S BROKEN.
- WHAT THE--? HUH?

269
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,791
- Linna: UH-OH.

270
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,958
IT'S MUTATING.

271
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,791
- PRISS, NENE,
STATUS REPORT.

272
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,750
- Nene:
WE JUST GOT HERE.

273
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,708
THIS TIME I'M GOING FIRST,
PRISS.

274
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,166
- NENE!
- I CAN DO IT!

275
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,083
( shouts )

276
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:38,833
THERE!

277
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:39,833
HA!

278
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,291
- ( sighs )

279
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,541
- ( shouts )

280
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,208
I DID IT!

281
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,750
- NENE, BEHIND YOU!

282
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,916
- HUH?  WHAT?
( screams )

283
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,833
( grunting )

284
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,041
- Priss: LET HER GO!
- ( grunts )

285
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,666
- ( roars )

286
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,250
- ( shouts )

287
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,000
- OKAY, I THINK I'VE
GOT IT WORKING NOW. 

288
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,541
SYLIA!  SYLIA!
- HUH?

289
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,875
- Macky: The hardsuit
Priss is wearing

290
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,916
wasn't finished yet!
- WHAT?

291
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,666
- OKAY, I JUST PULLED UP
THE LAST TRANSMISSIONS

292
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,583
THAT NORDBERG MADE FROM
THE HP FACILITY.

293
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,041
- Leon: IS THAT HIM?

294
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,041
- Daley:
YEAH, BUT CHECK OUT THE DATE.

295
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,500
THIS WAS A MONTH AGO.

296
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,041
- A MONTH?
- THAT RIGHT.

297
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,458
IT'S BEEN A MONTH SINCE ANYONE'S
HEARD FROM THE FACILITY.

298
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,416
I WONDER WHY GENOM DIDN'T
WANT TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS.

299
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,750
- Leon: HEY, LOOK.

300
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,208
- DAMN.  IT IMPLODED.

301
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,208
- POOR CHUMP.

302
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,541
WAIT, IF HE'S DEAD,

303
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,083
THEN WHO'S CONTROLLING
THAT BOOMER?

304
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,958
- ( screeches )

305
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,416
- ( grunts )

306
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,750
- Sylia: Priss, pull out
and get back here immediately.

307
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,583
- WHAT?!

308
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,541
I'M KIND OF BUSY 
RIGHT NOW, SYLIA.

309
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,666
HERE WE GO!

310
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,750
( yelps )

311
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,833
( grunts )

312
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,541
WHAT THE--?

313
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,750
- Nene: What's wrong?!
- Priss: It's my arm! 

314
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,291
- HER SUIT'S FAILING.
- Priss: I can't move my arm.

315
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,333
- WE'RE TOO LATE.

316
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,708
- THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

317
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:50,958
- SYLIA!

318
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,708
- ( grunts ) SYLIA,
I NEED MY ARM. DO SOMETHING!

319
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,958
- Macky: PRISS,

320
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,666
YOU CAN MOVE YOUR LEFT
ARM A LITTLE, CAN'T YOU?

321
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,833
- HUH?!

322
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:02,666
- IF YOU SHOOT YOUR
RIGHT SHOULDER JOINT

323
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,083
WITH YOUR LEFT KNUCKLE BOMB,

324
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,458
THE SHOCK SHOULD RESTART
THE CIRCUIT.

325
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,291
CAN YOU DO THAT, PRISS?
- Priss: I could.

326
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,625
- MACKY?

327
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,125
- PRISS, DECREASE THE POWER
OF THE KNUCKLE BOMB

328
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,666
DOWN TO LEVEL THREE.

329
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,458
THAT OUGHT TO KEEP YOU
FROM BLASTING A HOLE

330
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,458
THROUGH YOUR OWN ARMOR.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

331
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,125
JUST DON'T EXPECT US
TO BAIL YOU OUT THE NEXT TIME.

332
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,958
- THANKS, NIGEL.
- GREAT.

333
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,458
NOW THEY'VE GOT ME
SHOOTING MYSELF.

334
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,291
( grunts )

335
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,750
( grunting )

336
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,625
- BILL!  STOP IT, BILL!

337
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,958
- GET BACK.
IT'S DANGEROUS.

338
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,833
- YOU CAME FOR ME,
DIDN'T YOU, BILL? 

339
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,666
BILL! I'M SORRY,
BILL. I'M SORRY!

340
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,833
( grunting )
- THAT'S A BOOMER!

341
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,791
- MRS. NORDBERG,
YOUR HUSBAND IS DEAD.

342
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,000
HE WAS KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT
OVER A MONTH AGO.

343
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,666
- WHAT?!

344
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,666
- YES!
( grunts )

345
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,375
HYAH!

346
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,083
( grunts )

347
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,166
COME ON.
- RIGHT.

348
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,500
- ( siren wailing )

349
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,875
- WHY, BILL?

350
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,166
IF YOU'D JUST COME HOME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY

351
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,291
LIKE I ASKED,
YOU'D BE ALIVE.

352
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,708
- I THINK HE INTENDED TO COME 
HOME THIS TIME, MRS. NORDBERG.

353
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,500
YOU SEE, HE'D ALREADY
SIGNED UP FOR THREE WEEKS

354
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,375
OF VACATION STARTING TODAY.

355
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,375
- HUH?

356
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,875
- AND HE'D ALSO
SET UP RESERVATIONS

357
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,291
FOR THE TWO OF YOU
TO GO TO HAWAII TOGETHER.

358
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,250
IT'S YOUR ANNIVERSARY,
ISN'T IT?

359
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,291
- HUH?

360
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,625
- ONE MORE THING.

361
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,958
HE'D ORDERED THIS FOR YOU.

362
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,916
- ( sighs )

363
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,291
( gasps )

364
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,583
( crying )

365
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,083
- IT'S STILL WAITING 
AT THE JEWELRY STORE.

366
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,458
HE SAID THAT
HE'D PICK IT UP

367
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,250
SO THAT HE COULD
GIVE IT TO YOU IN PERSON.

368
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,083
IT'S NOT MANY PEOPLE
WHO ARE LUCKY ENOUGH

369
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,208
TO BE LOVED THAT WAY.

370
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,416
- ( sobbing )

371
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,750
OH, GOD.

372
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,916
OH, GOD.

373
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,125
OHH...

374
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,916
OH, GOD.

375
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,041
( sobbing continues )

376
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,208
- ( theme music playing )

377
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

378
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:09,708
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF
"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS: TOKYO 2040,"

379
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:13,375
DELVE INTO THE MINDS
OF THE KNIGHT SABERS

380
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:17,666
AS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
BEGIN TO TEAR THE TEAM APART.

381
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,666
TEMPERS FLARE
AND BRIDGES ARE BURNED

382
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,875
AS A NEW FORM OF BOOMER
RUNS THE SABERS

383
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:25,375
ON A HIGH SPEED CHASE
THAT HAS NO END.

384
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,041
AND A NEW WEAPON
IS UNVEILED.

385
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,750
NEXT EPISODE,
"FIRE BALL."
