1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,666
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,833
- ( motor revving )

4
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,458
- ( hardsuit thumping ) 
- HUH?

5
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,750
UH, THAT IS YOU, PRISS.
RIGHT?

6
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,125
- ( motor revving )

7
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,916
- SO YOU'VE CHANGED
THE MOTOSLAVE TOO.

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,375
- Leon:
WE HAD TO MAKE SOME CHANGES

9
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,583
SO IT WOULD INTERFACE
WITH YOUR NEW SUIT.

10
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,708
SMALL CHANGES.
- BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE!

11
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,125
THE OLD MOTOSLAVE
WAS JUST A MOTORCYCLE.

12
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,208
BUT THIS IS--

13
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,041
- I KNOW.

14
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,083
IT'S A BOOMER.

15
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,625
IT'LL PLUG INTO MY BRAIN
JUST LIKE THE SUIT.

16
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,750
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S BE OFF THEN, SHALL WE?

17
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,958
HUH?

18
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,500
- I'M GOING BY MYSELF.
- HUH?

19
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,625
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  HUH?

20
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:21,500
- LOOK,
YOU'D JUST BE IN THE WAY.

21
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,208
- ( gun firing ) 
- Leon: DAMN IT!

22
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,541
THIS GUN
IS TOTALLY USELESS!

23
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,666
ALL RIGHT.

24
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,166
BUT ONLY IF YOU
PROMISE ME SOMETHING FIRST.

25
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,250
PROMISE ME
THAT YOU'LL COME BACK.

26
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,958
( grunts )

27
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,875
- ( Priss grunts )

28
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,833
- ( suit clomping )

29
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,833
- PRISS?

30
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,666
WE'LL TRY THAT AGAIN
WHEN YOU GET BACK,

31
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,750
WITHOUT THE HELMET.

32
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,625
- ( suit whirring )

33
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,541
- ( motor revving )

34
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,458
- ( explosion )

35
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,583
- DAMN IT.

36
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,458
- ( screeching )

37
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,416
- UGH!

38
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,500
LINNA!  NENE!

39
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,916
- ( both grunting, gasping )

40
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,458
- OH, IT'S GOT ME!

41
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,416
- THIS THING IS TRYING
TO FUSE WITH OUR SUITS!

42
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,125
- NO WAY!  SYLIA!
DO SOMETHING!

43
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,625
- ( grunts )

44
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,875
WHOA!

45
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,416
IT'S NO USE.

46
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,458
I CAN'T EVEN GET CLOSE
TO THE DAMN THING.

47
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,416
THE ONLY CHANCE IS TO CUT OFF
ITS LINK TO THE DRAGON LINE.

48
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,875
ALL RIGHT, HERE GOES!

49
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,416
IT KNOWS
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO!

50
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,333
- ( grunting )
IT HURTS.

51
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:36,208
LINNA?
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

52
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,291
Linna:
NENE, HOLD ON.

53
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,958
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE FAITH. 
- LINNA.

54
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,041
- LINNA?

55
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,250
- Linna: IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT,
NENE.

56
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,833
SYLIA WON'T GIVE UP.

57
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,958
AND I KNOW PRISS IS COMING.
I KNOW SHE IS.

58
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,500
 ( grunts )

59
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,750
- LINNA,
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU?

60
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,208
LINNA!

61
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,291
- Linna: DON'T WORRY.

62
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,583
I WON'T LET THIS MONSTER
BEAT ME.

63
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,083
- OKAY.  BUT WHY AM I HEARING
YOUR VOICE IN MY HEAD?

64
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,458
- IN YOUR HEAD?
YOU MEAN YOU HEAR IT TOO, NENE?

65
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,333
AH!

66
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,041
- ( blast fires ) 
- HUH?

67
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,500
- ( motor revving )
- Linna: PRISS!

68
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,916
SHE'S HERE!
- WHAT?  PRISS!

69
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:30,000
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
- THANK GOD.

70
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,041
- SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

71
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,333
- THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT IS
TO CUT OFF ITS LINK

72
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,333
TO THE DRAGON LINE.

73
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,458
IT'LL HAVE TO BE
RIGHT AT THE BASE.

74
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,416
COVER ME, I'M GOING IN.

75
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,833
- SYLIA! GOD!

76
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,041
- NOW, PRISS!

77
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,750
AH!

78
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,833
THAT'S IT.

79
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,750
AHHH!

80
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,166
( gasps )

81
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,791
IT'S TOO WELL PROTECTED
ON THE OUTSIDE!

82
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,416
AHH!

83
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,833
- SYLIA!
- ( crashing )

84
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,666
- HERE.
- OH.

85
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,583
THANKS.

86
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,208
- THIS IS WHAT I HATE
THE MOST--

87
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,083
THE WAITING AND NOT KNOWING.

88
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:44,000
- I KNOW IT'S HARD,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST THEM.

89
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,708
- AH...

90
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,916
- IT'S NOT LIKE
WE HAVE A CHOICE, YOU KNOW.

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,625
JUST HAVE FAITH
AND ANOTHER DRINK.

92
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,958
- ( whirring )

93
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:59,125
- I HOPE YOU WON'T MIND
IF I JOIN YOU GENTLEMEN.

94
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,916
- Macky: MR. HENDERSON?

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,916
- I'VE BEEN SAVING THIS
FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION.

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,625
BUT IT SEEMED A WASTE
TO DRINK IT ALL BY MYSELF.

97
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,041
- HMM.

98
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,833
- Macky: OF COURSE
YOU CAN JOIN US.

99
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,541
YOU'RE PART OF THE FAMILY.

100
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,125
- Henderson: YOU'RE VERY KIND,
MASTER MACKY.

101
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,416
- PRISS.

102
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,833
- COME ON, DAMN IT!
WHO WANTS TO BE FIRST?

103
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,833
- ( shivering )
NENE, LINNA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

104
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,833
- Nene: YEAH.

105
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,291
- WELL, I'VE BEEN BETTER.

106
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,416
- PRISS?

107
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,583
- ( grunting ) HYAH!

108
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,500
- ( grunting )
DAMN IT!

109
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:07,958
- Both: PRISS!

110
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,166
- WHAT THE HELL?
HYAH!

111
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,208
- OH, OF COURSE.  OH!
- SYLIA!

112
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,791
OH!
- ( both screaming )

113
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,375
- LINNA!

114
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,208
- Linna: HOLD ON, PRISS.
EVERYONE LISTEN TO ME.

115
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,666
SOMEHOW THE WAY THIS THING
IS TRYING TO ABSORB OUR SUITS

116
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,541
HAS CONNECTED THEM TOGETHER.

117
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,458
WHATEVER FORCE IS BINDING ALL
THESE BOOMER COMPONENTS TOGETHER

118
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,458
IS ACTING AS A CONDUIT
FOR THE IMPULSES

119
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,708
OUR BRAINS
SEND TO OUR HARDSUITS.

120
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,208
I THINK THAT LINNA AND NENE
WERE SOMEHOW ABLE

121
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,666
TO CONTROL THE WORM
FOR JUST A FEW SECONDS.

122
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,833
IF WE WORK TOGETHER, WE MAY BE
ABLE TO CONFUSE IT LONG ENOUGH

123
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,333
TO GIVE PRISS A SHOT
AT CUTTING OFF ITS POWER FLOW.

124
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,375
- Priss: DO YOU KNOW
HOW CRAZY THAT SOUNDS?

125
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,291
- Linna: WE CAN DO IT.
I KNOW WE CAN.

126
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,375
- ROGER. 
- Nene: OKAY.

127
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,541
- PRISS, DOWN ITS THROAT.

128
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,791
- I'M ON IT!

129
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,083
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU OVERGROWN WORM!

130
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,625
EAT ME!

131
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,041
I SEE IT.

132
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,458
( grunting )

133
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,291
- ( all shouting )

134
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,958
- SYLIA!

135
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,958
- NENE, LINNA.

136
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,375
- WHERE'S PRISS?
- OH NO!

137
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,125
PRISS!

138
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,625
- All: CHEERS!

139
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,166
- Nene: IT'S GOOD
TO BE OUT OF THAT SUIT!

140
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,458
- I CAME BACK.
- YEP.

141
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:45,625
- I FIGURED YOU'D BE HUNGRY,
SO I MADE SANDWICHES.

142
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,083
- ( laughs )
THANK YOU.

143
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,041
- HMM.

144
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,666
- JEEZ, LOOKS LIKE
I'M ODD GIRL OUT AGAIN.

145
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,583
- POOR CHILD.
REFILL?

146
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,958
- ( laughs )
UM, THANK YOU, I GUESS.

147
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,000
- THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BLEND.

148
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:08,208
- YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING HOW
THINGS CAN CHANGE SO QUICKLY.

149
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,416
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

150
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,375
- A FEW MONTHS AGO,
I HATED THE KNIGHT SABERS.

151
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,208
ALL I CARED ABOUT BACK THEN
WAS HOW BAD

152
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,708
YOU MADE THE A.D.P. LOOK
BY EASILY TRASHING ROGUE BOOMERS

153
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,375
THAT WE COULD BARELY HANDLE.

154
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,125
BUT HERE I AM,
UNEMPLOYED,

155
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,583
DRINKING A TOAST WITH YOU
AND THINKING.

156
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,833
- THINKING ABOUT WHAT?

157
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,833
- ABOUT HOW INCREDIBLY LUCKY
I AM TO BE HERE.

158
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,291
AND IF THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY
I COULD BE HERE,

159
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,250
I WOULDN'T CHANGE
ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED.

160
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,125
UM, PRISS?

161
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,500
REMEMBER THAT PROMISE?

162
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,125
- HMM?

163
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:51,500
- WELL, WHAT I SAID
ABOUT THE HELMET.

164
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,500
- DREAM ON.

165
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,958
YOU WANT ANOTHER DRINK?

166
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,000
- YEAH, I NEED ONE.

167
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,791
- THAT'S GREAT.

168
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,208
BUT WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE ONE OF THE BACON ONES?

169
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,583
HERE.

170
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,375
UM, ARE YOU OKAY?

171
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,458
- IS IT WRONG?
- HUH?

172
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,125
- I MEAN, THE ENTIRE CITY
IS BEING ABANDONED

173
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,583
AND THE BOOMERS
ARE GOING ROGUE EVERYWHERE.

174
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,458
I KNOW THAT ALL OF US
ARE REALLY IN HORRIBLE DANGER.

175
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,125
I KNOW
THAT I SHOULD BE SCARED,

176
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,916
AND YET I'M ENJOYING MYSELF.

177
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,458
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

178
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,833
- MACKY?

179
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,708
- I WONDER HOW LONG
I'LL REMEMBER THESE FEELINGS.

180
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,833
- HUH?

181
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,166
- THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I HAVE TO DO.

182
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,125
- HEY, MACKY!
WAIT UP.

183
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,125
- ( all chuckling )

184
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,291
- NO, OF COURSE
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

185
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,333
- ( chattering )

186
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,708
- ( silent )

187
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,500
- SO HAVE YOU DECIDED
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO YET?

188
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,000
- WHAT I'VE BEEN HOPING
IS THAT WE'LL BE ABLE

189
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,250
TO CONTINUE
FIGHTING THE BOOMERS FROM HERE.

190
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,958
WE NEED MORE TIME
TO DISCOVER WHAT THE NATURE

191
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,875
OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR
MINDS AND OUR SUITS ACTUALLY IS.

192
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,125
- SO YOU'LL PURSUE THAT PATH,

193
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,250
NO MATTER
WHAT THE COST MIGHT BE?

194
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,333
- I HAVE TO!
I DON'T WANT TO.

195
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,041
BUT YOU KNOW WHY I MUST.

196
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,208
- YES, I KNOW WHY.

197
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,000
AND I UNDERSTAND.

198
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,041
- I HAVE TO END THIS.

199
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,541
AND I NEED YOUR HELP TO DO IT.

200
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,916
PLEASE, NIGEL.

201
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,083
- ( computer beeping )

202
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,458
- EH, ALL OF THE OUTSIDE LINES
ARE DOWN.

203
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,833
MY TERMINAL IS USELESS.

204
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,375
- ( beeping )

205
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,916
- SO, UM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

206
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,333
- BACKUPS.  I'M BACKING UP
ALL THE DATA I CAN

207
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,458
WHILE I STILL HAVE THE TIME
AND POWER TO DO IT.

208
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,875
- ALL OF IT?
BUT THAT'LL TAKE YOU FOREVER.

209
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,291
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I HAVE TO START IT NOW.

210
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,916
- MACKY?

211
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,291
- ( rumbling )

212
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,333
- ( gasps )

213
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,666
- ( moaning )

214
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,000
- ( clamoring )

215
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,958
- WHAT'S WRONG?

216
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,125
CAN'T YOU SLEEP?

217
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,791
- NO.
I'M SORRY IF I WOKE YOU.

218
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,250
I'VE JUST GOT A FEELING THAT
SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

219
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,708
OH!
- OH!

220
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,083
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

221
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,041
- ( alarm sounding )

222
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,500
- OH!  WHAT'S THAT?!

223
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,375
- WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT ALARM FOR?

224
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,416
- AN INTRUSION DETECTOR,
I AM AFRAID.

225
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,208
- ( chirping ) 
- HMM?

226
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,916
( gasps )

227
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,875
MACKY?!

228
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,875
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

229
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,958
- HUH?

230
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,791
THAT'S THE INTRUDER ALARM.

231
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,750
- NENE, WHERE IS EVERYONE?

232
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,041
- I THINK THEY'RE ALL
STILL UPSTAIRS.

233
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,291
- ALL RIGHT, RUN A FULL SWEEP
OF THE BUILDING.

234
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,458
- YES, MA'AM!

235
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,666
- SYLIA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

236
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,916
- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO FIND OUT.

237
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,375
THERE ARE BOOMERS
UP ON THE ROOF.

238
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,000
- HEY, NOT JUST ON THE ROOF!

239
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,625
THE BOOMER CORE DETECTOR SAYS
THEY'RE IN THE BUILDING AS WELL!

240
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,125
- THERE CAN'T BE.
THAT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE.

241
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,541
- ( alarm pinging )

242
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,666
- THERE'S NO WAY
THE SECURITY SYSTEM HERE

243
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,541
COULD HAVE BEEN PENETRATED
SO EASILY.

244
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,666
WAIT A SECOND.

245
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,500
THERE'S NOTHING
ON THE SECURITY CAMERA SCREENS.

246
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,625
- I KNOW THERE'S NOTHING
ON THE CAMERAS, SYLIA!

247
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,416
BUT THE PROXIMITY DETECTOR
SAYS OTHERWISE.

248
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,833
- I BELIEVE YOU.

249
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,583
OKAY, BRING UP THE SECURITY
GATES AND FIREWALLS,

250
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,791
THEN SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING
ABOVE THIS LEVEL.

251
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,958
- RIGHT.
- ( pinging )

252
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,125
- Nene: SHUT DOWN COMPLETED.

253
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,625
WHAT?  NO WAY!

254
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,083
SOMEHOW THEY'RE GETTING PAST
ALL OF THE BARRIERS.

255
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,500
- BUT HOW?

256
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,500
WHERE IN THE HELL ARE THEY?

257
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,916
- Nene: THEY JUST HIT
THE GARAGE.

258
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,833
AH!
THIS IS NUTS.

259
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,000
IT'S LIKE ALL OF OUR DEFENSES
AREN'T EVEN THERE.

260
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,416
- THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

261
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,375
- HOW INTERESTING.
THAT IS A NEW CONCEPT.

262
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,833
- Both: HUH?

263
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,583
- HUH?
OH, I--

264
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:02,916
- ( rumbling ) 
- All: OH!

265
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,708
- NOW WHAT?

266
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,541
- SO WHAT WAS THAT?

267
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,666
- IT WASN'T AN EARTHQUAKE.

268
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,541
- OH MY GOD! THEY'RE GOING
TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE!

269
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,375
- ( pinging )

270
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,541
- THEY'RE--
THEY'RE AT OUR LEVEL!

271
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,708
THEY'RE RIGHT OUTSIDE
THE DOOR!

272
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,250
- ( grunts )

273
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,500
GO ON!
I'LL HOLD THEM HERE.

274
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,791
- ARE YOU NUTS?

275
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,291
- I KNOW THIS GUN
WILL BE PRACTICALLY USELESS,

276
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,666
BUT MAYBE I CAN
BUY THE REST OF YOU ENOUGH TIME.

277
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,291
GO ON.

278
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,583
I WON'T BE ABLE
TO HOLD THEM HERE LONG.

279
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,250
- YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

280
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,791
- Leon: NENE, IS THERE
ANOTHER WAY OUT OF HERE?

281
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,708
- THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT!

282
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:45,291
ACCORDING TO THE DETECTOR,
THEY'RE ALREADY INSIDE THE PIT!

283
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,208
WHAT'S GOING ON?

284
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,208
- ( gasps )

285
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,375
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, NENE.
THERE ARE NO BOOMERS IN HERE.

286
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,708
- THAT THING'S DEFECTIVE.
RESET IT.

287
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,000
- I- I DID!

288
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:02,416
- SOMETHING'S WRONG.
WHAT DID WE MISS?

289
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,958
OH!

290
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,666
- ( both screaming )

291
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,291
- IT'S THE SWIMMING POOL!

292
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,791
THE SWIMMING POOL
COVERED IT IN CLOTHES.

293
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,875
- ( scratching )
- OH!

294
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,291
- ( theme music playing )

295
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

296
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:07,500
- Woman: IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF

297
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,500

SABER'S HEADQUARTERS

298
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,916
IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
OF A NEW NIGHTMARE.

299
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,083
AS THE CITY OF TOKYO
IS CONSUMED BY A MONSTROUS WAVE

300
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,500
OF BIO-MECHANICAL HORROR,

301
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,500
THE FEW SURVIVORS

302
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,041
THROUGH AN EMPTY
METROPOLIS ABANDONED

303
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,666
TO THE WRATH OF THE BOOMERS.

304
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,166
CAN EVEN THE KNIGHT SABERS
WITHSTAND THE FURY

305
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,625
OF A MILLION RAMPAGING
MAD MACHINES?

306
