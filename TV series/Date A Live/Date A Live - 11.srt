1
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,208
[ORIGAMI] Five
years ago there was

2
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,958
a massive fire in Tengu City.

3
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,000
It mainly broke out in

4
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,250
a small neighborhood
called Nankou.

5
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,416
And that's when I first saw her.

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,166
The day she burned
my parents alive.

7
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,916
[KOTORI] If it's
that easy for me

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,125
to lose control over myself,
I wouldn't be shocked

9
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,625
if I already have
killed someone!

10
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,083
[SHIDO] We'll never
know what happened

11
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,500
unless Kotori and I both
get our memories back.

12
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,458
And until then--

13
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,583
[REINE] Eventually,
her power will be too much.

14
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't think she'll
last longer than two days.

15
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,750
Only one person can save her.

16
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,875
[SHIDO] I won't let her die.

17
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:27,166
[NARRATOR] His younger
sister is a Spirit,

18
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,833
he has a friend
who is in the AST,

19
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:33,500
and somehow Shido
must save them all.

20
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,500
[RYOKO] I heard they said you
could be discharged tomorrow?

21
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,291
That's great.

22
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,458
But take another
day off for safety.

23
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,833
You'd kill yourself
with how busy it's been.

24
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,416
Looks like your school is
out on break for a while, too.

25
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,541
That should give you
plenty of time to recover.

26
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,125
Roger that.

27
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,708
[RYOKO] Oh!
Almost forgot.

28
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,833
There's some
interesting equipment

29
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,833
being delivered to the base.

30
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,458
And it's not what
you might expect.

31
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,750
Should be there in
the next couple days.

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,541
[SHIDO] Ocean Park, huh?
Interesting.

33
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,500
Isn't that the amusement park
with the waterpark attached?

34
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,916
[REINE] It is.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,875
We all agreed it would
be the most suitable place

36
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,541
for your date with Kotori.

37
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,916
You have two more days.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,250
[KANNAZUKI] Lucky Duck!

39
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,416
It's swimsuit season;
which means you get to see

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,208
the Commander show off
her child-like charms

41
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,708
as well as her dangerous curves

42
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,750
in nothing but two
pieces of fabric!

43
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,208
Ya know, you don't have to
say all those things out loud.

44
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,875
[REINE] Well, "those things"
are why we have arranged

45
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,041
some training for
you before the date.

46
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,541
What? Training?

47
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,500
Bring it on!

48
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:07,083
Whatever it takes to
save Kotori. I'm ready!

49
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,708
[SHIDO] For real?

50
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,750
Is there some kind of
hidden message here?

51
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,083
How is shopping for
swimsuits training me?

52
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,833
[REINE] It will desensitize
you to other girls

53
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,791
in every type of swimwear.

54
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,125
We can't have you
getting distracted

55
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,458
while you're with Kotori.

56
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,958
That would be destructive.

57
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,041
Look, Kotori's fate
is on the line here.

58
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,458
I'm not gonna get distra--

59
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,625
[REINE] I hope
you haven't forgotten

60
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,791
that your heart rate
is being monitored.

61
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,500
You're gawking right now.

62
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,666
[SHIDO] Crap! Okay, train me!

63
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,916
[REINE] Will do.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,791
[TOHKA] Can you believe
how beautiful these are?

65
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,750
Is every one of
them called a mizugi?

66
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,916
[SHIDO] Uh, yeah. In Japanese.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,250
But what is it?

68
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,708
I mean what are you
supposed to do with it?

69
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,916
[SHIDO] You really don't know?

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,041
Okay, this is a--

71
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,041
[ORIGAMI] Military.
Zapped. Ultimate.

72
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,416
Grind. Instrument.
MI-ZU-GI for short.

73
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,000
It's a new anti-Spirit
annihilation suit.

74
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,875
When it's activated,
the built-in Realizer

75
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,291
starts the critical driving
force and the warhead

76
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,583
is broken into its molecular
components and discharged.

77
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,750
It easily cuts
through Spirit armor

78
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,833
and it destroys
the target's body

79
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:15,416
so that it can never be
returned to its original state.

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,250
What's wrong with you?

81
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,291
Oh, look. Hermit.

82
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,666
What are you doing here?

83
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,500
What do you want
from us? Is it true?

84
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,000
Did you bring us here to
buy us annihilation suits?

85
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,625
No, she's making that up.

86
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,166
No, I'm not. He knows all about
the Mi-Zu-Gi and he's afraid.

87
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,625
He wants to destroy you.
That's why you're here.

88
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,458
He was only trying
to distract you

89
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,666
so it would be easier
to make his attack.

90
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't believe you!

91
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,708
Shido would never do
something like that to us!

92
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,416
[YOSHINO] I don't
think he would either.

93
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,375
She's lying!
Right, Shido?

94
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,041
[ORIGAMI (deep voice)] No,
Origami is telling the truth.

95
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,625
I've been trying to
figure out an easy way

96
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,166
to kill you guys
for weeks now.

97
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,666
[TOHKA] But-- Why,
I don't understand!

98
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,875
I didn't say that. She did.

99
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,541
Why, you little coward! Shido
wasn't saying those things!

100
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,250
You were just playing
a trick on me!

101
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,333
I have no clue what
you're talking about.

102
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,416
Kind of a
weird coincidence

103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,208
running into you here.

104
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,583
Oh hey,
how's your injury?

105
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:14,833
Oh, I'm alright. However.
It's not a coincidence.

106
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,875
I'm glad I got to
see you, Shido.

107
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,916
But Tohka's actually the one
I'm here to talk to today.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,208
Talk about what?

109
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,458
Some stuff.

110
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,250
Do you remember the
Spirit wearing flames

111
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,875
that came down from
the sky yesterday?

112
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,333
I know you saw her.

113
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,875
I would like you to tell
me what you remember.

114
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,333
[TOHKA] Hmph. Even if
I did know something,

115
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,750
you're the last person
I would tell!

116
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,333
Pretty please
with cherries?

117
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,375
Ah!

118
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,416
[TOHKA] Stop that!

119
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,833
What do you think
you're trying to do?

120
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:42,958
I want you to tell me

121
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,833
what you know about
the Flame Spirit.

122
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,583
Pretty please?

123
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,416
Alright! I'll tell you but
you have to pick your head up.

124
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,458
It's confusing.

125
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:55,250
Yes. I did see
the Flame Spirit.

126
00:06:55,333 --> 00:07:00,833
She was-- I don't
know. Very red.

127
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,375
[ORIGAMI] Anything else?

128
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:06,458
Let me think. She was
also very strong?

129
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,500
[ORIGAMI] And is that it?

130
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,625
[TOHKA] Um I was like,
"wah!' when I saw her.

131
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,250
That doesn't help me.

132
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,333
Oh really?

133
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,875
You're bothering me
for an explanation,

134
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,375
and now it's not
good enough for you?

135
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,916
[ORIGAMI] By the way, Shido.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,750
I just realized the
only swimsuit I have

137
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,500
is the one from the
school swim team.

138
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,291
And what that means is it will
become quite problematic later

139
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,541
if we decide to go to
the beach or the pool.

140
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,791
[SHIDO] Oh. Okay.
Well, why don't you just

141
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,125
buy one while you're here?
Problem solved.

142
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,583
I could but it's very important
to get a second opinion

143
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,083
when choosing such things.

144
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,625
Having a male opinion
is especially helpful.

145
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,833
[SHIDO] Huh?

146
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,041
I said, having a male
opinion is helpful.

147
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,000
[SHIDO] Oh, well--

148
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,541
[ORIGAMI] Very helpful.

149
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,708
[SHIDO] So, are you just trying
to get me to check you out?

150
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,375
[TOHKA] Now listen up, Origami!

151
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,000
If you want to
play that way, fine.

152
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,125
Then whoever excites Shido the
most will win a date with him!

153
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,166
[ORIGAMI] Do you really
want to waste your time?

154
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,166
I'll never let you go on a
date with him. I will win.

155
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,666
What's happening?

156
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,208
Why am I suddenly in the middle
of a wet t-shirt contest?

157
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,583
[REINE] Just go with it.

158
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,583
This will be a good
training exercise for you.

159
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,916
[AI] Omigosh, is that Shido?

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,291
[MAI] Uh.

161
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,541
Why is he hanging out in
the girls' swimwear section?

162
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,708
That is so lame.

163
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,625
[SHIDO] And so it begins.

164
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,208
[AI] I hate it.
Let's look for something else.

165
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,958
[MAI] We could try
the school swimsuits.

166
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,666
[MII] That's so lame.

167
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,291
Wow. Your heart
rate's through the roof.

168
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,791
Record breaking numbers.

169
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,458
Looks like those
girls won the date.

170
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,291
Hey that is not funny!
I'm trying!

171
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,791
[TOHKA] I'm sorry
to keep you waiting!

172
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,833
Yes! Wonderful choice!

173
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,500
The simple design
beautifully highlights

174
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,833
Tohka's wholesome curves,

175
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,416
making her unwittingly
arousing. Good girl!

176
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,708
So what do you
think? Tell me.

177
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,208
Does it excite you at all?

178
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,791
[SHIDO] What? Yeah?

179
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,625
Yay! I'll try
something else then!

180
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,833
This was just a warm-up.
It gets better!

181
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,625
[ORIGAMI] How's this?

182
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,833
What destructive
power she has!

183
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,708
Lovely contrast of
dark fabric on pearl skin!

184
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,625
An up-do with a string halter
is always a sassy choice.

185
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,125
Fierce! Ha ha!

186
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,916
So what do you think?

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,750
[SHIDO] Me? Right.
I think--It fits?

188
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,041
It looks nice on you.

189
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,625
Well, what's 'nice'
got to do with it?

190
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,666
What do you think
about this one?

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,500
Yes! That is what
I'm screaming about!

192
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,083
A naughty body combined
with a bashful modesty!

193
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,541
Irresistible!

194
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,333
[ORIGAMI] Over here.

195
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,916
[KANNAZUKI] Oh no!
What is she thinking?

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,625
Ha! Does this mean
you're giving up?

197
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,166
I don't blame you.

198
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,208
Huh? Huh?!

199
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,375
Take it off me.

200
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,708
[SHIDO] What?

201
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm pretty sure you're
not playing by the rules!

202
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,041
[KANNAZUKI] And the game
just took a surprising turn!

203
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,291
Origami is stimulating him
with the art of teasing!

204
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,833
Less is more!

205
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,125
One glimpse and his heart rate
has gone through the roof!

206
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,208
Imagination for the win!

207
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,208
So what? I still have more
in me! This isn't over yet!

208
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,041
[YOSHINO] Um, Shido.
Will you come here?

209
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,833
I--um-- I need your help.

210
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,000
[SHIDO] I'm here! I'm coming in.

211
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:42,083
You're not hurt, are you?

212
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,250
[YOSHINO] I was trying
to get it on by myself.

213
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,458
But it's hard to do
with just one hand.

214
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,875
[REINE] Looks like
we have a winner.

215
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,458
Game over.

216
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,291
[SHIDO] Crap.

217
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,416
I don't ever want to
go through that again.

218
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,208
I can't say I understand.

219
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,000
But at least you had some
entertaining commentary, right?

220
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,500
Did it help?

221
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,000
Much better to see those girls
there than during a date.

222
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,541
So do you feel like
you could handle it now?

223
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,708
[SHIDO] For sure.

224
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,250
I'm completely focused
on saving Kotori.

225
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,750
Tomorrow, it's on.
I won't let her down.

226
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,625
It's just that--
I wish I could remember.

227
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,875
You know--what
happened five years ago.

228
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,083
How did I do it?

229
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,541
If I knew how
I sealed her powers,

230
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,208
maybe this would be easier.

231
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,083
There is one thing we might
do to jog your memory.

232
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,291
Would you like to look
at the footage of the fire?

233
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,458
From five years ago?

234
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,916
[SHIDO] You have that?

235
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,875
[FEMALE REPORTER A] The
flames are spreading quickly.

236
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,083
Hot winds are
blowing upward! Ah!

237
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,458
This is lost aerial footage
from one of the networks.

238
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,541
It was never aired.

239
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,541
Ratatoskr covered
it up pretty well.

240
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,458
Okay, yes. Here it is.

241
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,541
[SHIDO] That's me
and Kotori. Wow.

242
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,958
Now pay close attention.

243
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,458
[SHIDO] Pause it!

244
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,833
Wait. Why, what did you see?

245
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,583
Is there something I'm missing?
I don't see any movement.

246
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,000
[SHIDO] Over there!

247
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,375
Who is that? Or what is that?

248
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,666
On screen? What are
you talking about?

249
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,208
Behind her!

250
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,583
It's so blurry.

251
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,291
Strange that I can still
see a person through all that.

252
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,708
[KANNAZUKI] Hey!
What's wrong? Are you okay?

253
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,375
[KANNAZUKI]
Sorry about last night.

254
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,583
Clearly I did more
harm than good

255
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,125
by showing you that footage.

256
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,625
Oh, don't worry about it!

257
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,875
I want to find out
what that image was,

258
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,625
but another time.
I gotta focus on this date.

259
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,833
[KANNAZUKI] Understood.

260
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,458
We're ready to help
any time you need it.

261
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,333
So have faith
in yourself today.

262
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,166
I have to say I've never
seen a more talented playboy.

263
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,458
No Spirit stands a chance
against your charms.

264
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,833
[SHIDO] Heh, heh. Thanks.

265
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,500
Alright. Kotori has just
been sent to the ground.

266
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,750
She should be
arriving very soon.

267
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,750
You got this.

268
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,875
Roger that.

269
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,791
Hey! There you are!

270
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,750
[KOTORI] Yep.
Sorry for the wait.

271
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,875
Isn't there something else
you'd like to say to me?

272
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,333
Like, about the outfit?

273
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,541
I'm pretty sure that's the
first thing we taught you.

274
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,791
Yes, you did.

275
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,791
You look great. Is that for me?

276
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,333
Oh. Well, not completely.

277
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,958
I mean, it's not unusual for
me to dress up to go out,

278
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,375
but I also had to do something

279
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,041
that would let you feel
like it's an actual date.

280
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,125
And compliments are nice
every once in awhile.

281
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,958
Alright. Come on. Let's get
this date thing started.

282
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:41,625
'Kay.

283
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,208
[TOHKA] Yeah, let's!

284
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,500
Oh boy!

285
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,500
We're gonna
have so much fun!

286
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,750
[SHIDO] What's going on?
What are you guys doing here?

287
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,375
Oh! Guess I
forgot to tell you.

288
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,333
The girls will be accompanying
you two on your date.

289
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,291
We decided that would be
a better plan in the long run.

290
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,083
So. Group Date, huh?

291
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,583
I love surprises.
How very brave.

292
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,666
I can't wait to see
how this turns out.

293
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,916
Shido, look!

294
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,541
I brought the swimsuit
you bought yesterday.

295
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,708
The one you loved so much!

296
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,291
Yeah, I brought
mine, too.

297
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:14,583
[KOTORI] Hmm. You all went
swimsuit shopping. How sweet.

298
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,583
[TOHKA squeals]

299
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,666
This is so amazing!

300
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,500
I can't believe they
actually have a mountain

301
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,416
and a lake inside the building!

302
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,000
There's a lot
of water here.

303
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,875
I'm so excited!
I can't wait to swim!

304
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:35,958
[TOHKA] Look! Another lake!

305
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,708
Can we go swim in
that one? Please?

306
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,416
Sure. But stay close.

307
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,541
I can't wait!
Let's go, Yoshino!

308
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,500
[YOSHINO] Okay.

309
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,958
[KOTORI] They sure
have a lot of energy.

310
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,291
[KOTORI] So what's
the deal here?

311
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,583
You're checking out
your sister now?

312
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,250
Of course not!
Don't be gross!

313
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,666
You're about to
compliment her, right?

314
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,916
She dressed up for you today.

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,416
[coughs]

316
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,250
[SHIDO] Kotori?

317
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,583
That's my name.

318
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,666
[SHIDO] So yeah,
that swimsuit it uh--

319
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,083
it looks very nice on you.
I mean, you look cute.

320
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,083
Right on schedule.
Thank you, Shido.

321
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,666
Was it Reine or Kannazuki
who told you to say that?

322
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,458
[SHIDO] Neither! I mean it!

323
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,500
Yeah? Well, then
I'm flattered.

324
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,166
And I'd love to know

325
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,583
what you like the
most about my look.

326
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,000
Everyone! Your options are
there in front of you.

327
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,625
So make your picks!

328
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,166
[KANNAZUKI] Hmm.
Those are all fairly reasonable.

329
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,000
[MINOWA] Option One is a given.
You can't go wrong there.

330
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,458
[NAKATSUGAWA] Not Number Two
because that sounds like

331
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,250
it's all about
the suit and not her,

332
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,958
and Three is just asking for it.

333
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,750
You're right about that.
Good point.

334
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,458
Option Three. Quick!

335
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,500
[gasps]

336
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,750
[SHIDO] I really love the way
your boobs fill out the top.

337
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,291
What did you
just say to me?

338
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,250
Nothing! I said you're
built like a mop!

339
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,541
What the hell?
Why is everyone freaked out?

340
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,833
Oh, so suddenly it's wrong
to have a great rack?

341
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,416
[NAKATSUGAWA]
Can you hear yourself?

342
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,375
[SHIIZAKI] It's like you want
to dig for hot springs again!

343
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:32,291
Hey Shido!
Let's go on that!

344
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,750
You wanna try
the water slide?

345
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,416
[TOHKA] Yeah! I bet all four
of us could ride together!

346
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,875
[YOSHINO] Uh, it's okay.

347
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,708
I don't want Yoshinon
to get wet again.

348
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,583
[KOTORI] And I'm way too
busy being not five, so I'm out.

349
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,000
[TOHKA] Oh darn.

350
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,666
Guess it's just
you and me, then.

351
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,625
This'll be so fun!

352
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:55,625
You're right. I changed
my mind. I want to go.

353
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,083
That's much better.
Thank you, Tohka.

354
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,875
I wish Kotori would relax
and have fun on the date,

355
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,125
but this doesn't surprise me.

356
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,291
Is there another
way to ride?

357
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,916
I mean. Are you sure
we're, you know, safe?

358
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,541
Not really, so
hold on tight!

359
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,875
[SHIDO and KOTORI scream]

360
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,000
[TOHKA giggles]

361
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,375
That was the best ride ever!

362
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,916
Oh, Big bro.

363
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
[SHIDO] You okay? What's wrong?

364
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:40,458
Look. Over there.
Can you get my ribbons?

365
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:44,708
[TOHKA] It was like woo!
And then whoa! And then--

366
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,208
[TOHKA laughs]

367
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,375
Ugh. You are way
too wild for me.

368
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,791
Your ribbons are black.

369
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,916
I just noticed that.
There any special reason?

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
[KOTORI] Why?
Do they look that bad?

371
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,333
Of course not!
I was just curious.

372
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,250
[KOTORI] Fine.
I'll tell you. Nosey.

373
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,041
White is a vulnerable color.

374
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,791
And today, I needed
to be strong.

375
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,000
Black is strong.

376
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,083
[TOHKA] Yum! This is so good!

377
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,416
Yes it is, thank you.

378
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,708
[SHIDO] You're welcome.
Glad you like it.

379
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,041
Hey, Reine.

380
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,250
What's the reading on
Kotori's happiness meter?

381
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,791
She looks pissed.

382
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,291
[REINE] It's not going down,
but it's not going up either.

383
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,000
There's been no change.

384
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,083
[SHIDO] So that means
she hasn't had any fun at all.

385
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,083
No way I can seal
her powers like this.

386
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,541
[coughs]

387
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,750
Are you okay?

388
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,875
Yeah. Just went down
the wrong pipe, I guess.

389
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,875
Hold on a sec.
Where are you going?

390
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,791
I'm going to use
the restroom, Mother.

391
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,666
Not that it's any
of your business.

392
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,333
Any other girl would've
killed you for asking.

393
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,916
[sighs]

394
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,416
[SHIDO] What'd I do?

395
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,041
I just. I thought you and
Kotori were getting along again.

396
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,458
Are you guys in a fight?

397
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,250
It seemed like
she was mad at you.

398
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,083
You looked so relieved when
she stormed out of here.

399
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,083
It's funny how easy
to read you are.

400
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,666
Huh? I'm that obvious?

401
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,000
[BOTH]
Mm-Hmm.

402
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,166
I need the restroom, too.

403
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,416
Reine, can you tell
how freaked out I am?

404
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,416
What are my mental
readings right now?

405
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,250
Am I that easy to read?

406
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,791
[KANNAZUKI] Hey Shido, it's me.

407
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,666
I'm sorry, but Reine isn't
here to do the analysis.

408
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,958
That's weird.
Where did she go?

409
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,791
[KANNAZUKI] No.
Don't go over there.

410
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,333
[REINE] Does that
feel any better?

411
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,875
[KOTORI] Yes.
Much better. Thank you.

412
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,041
That was a close one, wasn't it?

413
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,250
One more, please?

414
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,125
I don't want to
risk injecting more.

415
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,083
I already gave you fifty
times the normal dosage.

416
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,791
I don't want to kill you.

417
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,083
You really think something
like that could kill me?

418
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,458
Drugs don't have a very strong
effect in Spirit mode.

419
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,875
But it would help
the date with Shido.

420
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,625
I mean with Big Bro.

421
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,250
Please Reine. I know it's risky,

422
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,916
but this might be my
last chance to see him.

423
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,125
If it fails, I won't be
myself anymore after today.

424
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,083
But no matter how it turns out,

425
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,041
I want to be able to
finish my date with him.

426
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,041
[SHIDO] Be honest with me.

427
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,833
How long has Kotori
been in that state?

428
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,458
[REINE] Since the moment she
got her Spirit powers back.

429
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,500
Why didn't you tell me?

430
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,041
[REINE] Kotori
wanted it that way.

431
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,875
She asked me not to say
anything to you about it.

432
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:39,000
She didn't want you to spend
your date feeling sorry for her.

433
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,458
If you want to help,

434
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,208
pretend that you
didn't see any of this.

435
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,666
Kotori will appreciate it.

436
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,833
Yeah, I will. Thank you.

437
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,000
[KOTORI] Hey.

438
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,458
Where'd the girls go?

439
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,416
I don't know. But I think
you and I should get dressed

440
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,750
and go to the amusement park.

441
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,291
[KOTORI] Huh?

442
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,708
You got orders from
Fraxinus, didn't you?

443
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,458
"It's not going well out
there so you might want

444
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,375
to take her to ride some
rides indoors." Whatever.

445
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,166
Not like it'll make
any difference.

446
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,125
You're wrong.

447
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,458
[KOTORI] Wha--
Why'd you do that?

448
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,625
[SHIDO] I just like
the amusement park

449
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,416
better than the pool
and I'm ready to leave.

450
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,750
Really?

451
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,791
[SHIDO] We don't have
to take Tohka and Yoshino.

452
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:22,000
They're having a blast
on the jungle cruise.

453
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,708
Are you ready? You haven't
been here in awhile.

454
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,291
So prepare to have
your mind blown.

455
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,958
[ORIGAMI] This is the equipment?

456
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,166
[RYOKO] That's right.

457
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,916
It's an experimental
annihilation suit DW029,

458
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,541
or "White Licorice."
It has the firepower

459
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:41,041
of an entire AST troop
in one monstrous unit.

460
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,166
All it would take is one shot.

461
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,250
Do you think it
would be possible

462
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,208
to even defeat Ifrit using this?

463
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,041
Well, if our simulations
are accurate,

464
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,625
this baby holds enough
power to take down a Spirit.

465
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,916
But that doesn't mean
that you're allowed to use it.

466
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,333
You don't have the ability
or the authorization.

467
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,791
A specialist Wizard
from DEM was crippled

468
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,291
after using it on full power

469
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,666

470
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,000
Wait, why are you
talking about Ifrit?

471
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,583
Oh. I get it.

472
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,166
The Spirit in the
footage was her, right?

473
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,166
It's true there were flames.

474
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,875
What footage?

00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,250
Kotori.
I knew it was you.
