1
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,291
[SHIDO]
Hey! Tohka!

2
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,791
Will you let me in?

3
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,916
Please, just hear me out!

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,041
[TOHKA] Why don't you go
talk to your little girlfriend?

5
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,416
I have nothing more
to say about it,

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,291
you dummy dumb dumb dumb!

7
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,000
[NARRATOR]
Rain. It's just like a girl.

8
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,666
Sometimes kind.
Sometimes fickle.

9
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,625
Pouring down heavily.
Or not falling at all.

10
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,625
It is the source of all life.

11
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,041
And tonight.

12
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,875
The rain is a little cold.

13
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,666
[REINE] I'll get right
to the point here, Tohka.

14
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,958
You've been really
irritated lately.

15
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,250
Please, just tell
me what's going on.

16
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,833
Though if I had to
take a wild guess,

17
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,166
I'd say this is about
Shido and that girl.

18
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,500
No.

19
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,500
No, you're wrong; this has
nothing to do with him.

20
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,708
Oh. I just assumed he
was the cause of it.

21
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,625
I don't know what's wrong.

22
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,250
I'm in the worst mood ever and
I'm not even sure I know why.

23
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,458
Uh, Yoshinon?

24
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,833
Wait, hold on a second!

25
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,500
Don't run away!

26
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,041
Oh hey, what happened
to your puppet?

27
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,000
[SHIDO]
Oh, I see.

28
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,875
That's what you're looking for?

29
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,041
Shido can do
whatever he wants;

30
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,458
it's really none
of my business

31
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,833
who he dates or kisses or
spends his free time with.

32
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:51,625
But when I saw that, it just--
I felt awful all of a sudden.

33
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,166
Then, when I heard the rabbit
say Shido cared more about

34
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,375
that other girl than me,
it was like I was empty inside.

35
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,375
Like I was all alone.

36
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,416
Sad. That's what it made me
feel more than anything else.

37
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,083
Scared, too.

38
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm really worried there might
be something wrong with me.

39
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,291
[SHIDO]
Gotcha.

40
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,708
So you lost it while you were
fighting the AST yesterday?

41
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,833
Kotori. Do you copy that?

42
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,208
[KOTORI] Yeah, we're
analyzing the video now.

43
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,458
You take the lead on the search

44
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,250
and we'll support you
as much as we can,

45
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,333
but we're gonna take
a back seat on this one.

46
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,000
It'll be better if all
her attention is on you.

47
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,875
Yoshinon. We're ready
to start whenever you are.

48
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:36,666
Uh. See, the thing is, my
name is-- It's not Yoshinon.

49
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,458
It's Yoshino, and Yoshinon is
the puppet we're looking for.

50
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,083
And my friend.

51
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,166
Yoshino. I gotcha.

52
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,541
Wait a sec!

53
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,708
Please.

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,375
Take it, you could catch a bad
cold in a rainstorm like this.

55
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,833
Oh. Don't worry,
I'll be alright.

56
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,083
Really, I want you to have it.

57
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,375
Um. That's very kind of you.

58
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,541
Sure.

59
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,750
There is absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

60
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,041
But listen,

61
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,250
I think we should definitely
clear a few things up.

62
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,750
Like what?

63
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:20,916
Well, you should know that kiss
was an accident. Completely.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,833
And it's not remotely
true that Shido cares

65
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:26,000
more about that other girl
than he does about you.

66
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,916
Yes but Shido was--

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,666
Just think about it, he
risked his life to save you.

68
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,625
Do you seriously believe
he would've put himself

69
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,958
in danger like that if
he didn't care one bit?

70
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,541
[SHIDO]
Watch out!

71
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,708
[stomach growls]

72
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,083
Yoshino? Are you hungry?

73
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,791
[stomach growls]

74
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,708
[KOTORI]
Why don't you two take a break

75
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,083
and get something to eat?

76
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,750
Might give you a chance to ask
her some questions.

77
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,458
Yeah, good call.

78
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,625
But it looks like the fighting

79
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,666
put these restaurants
out of commission.

80
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,333
Let's go to my house.
We can eat there.

81
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,166
[SHIDO] You sure love
that puppet, don't ya?

82
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,916
Most people would just give
up and go buy a new one.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,375
She must be really
important to you, huh?

84
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,541
She is.

85
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,875
Yoshinon's my friend.
My best friend.

86
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,416
And she's my hero, too.

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Your hero?

88
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,541
Oh, yes!

89
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,333
See, Yoshinon is the greatest.

90
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:33,666
She's who I want to be.
She's just so brave. So strong.

91
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,541
She's not pathetic like I am.

92
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,375
If I could be more like
her I would be so happy.

93
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,125
But I'm not. And I'll never be.

94
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,333
Well, I don't know
about all that.

95
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,583
As a matter of fact, I like
you just the way you are.

96
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,250
Hey. Something wrong?

97
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,416
Uh, well. No one's
ever said that before.

98
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,083
Thank you. It's nice.

99
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,750
Did you rehearse that line or
did it just come to you?

100
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,083
[SHIZAKI]
Commander.

101
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,250
Here's the analysis of
the puppet in the videos.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,500
[SHIDO]
Yoshino.

103
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:09,041
Why don't you ever try and fight
back when the AST attacks you?

104
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,791
There's gotta be
a reason for it.

105
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,750
Yes, there is.

106
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,208
The thing is I don't like pain.

107
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,750
Or being scared.
I can't stand it.

108
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,791
I bet everyone hates
those things though.

109
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,000
How could they not?

110
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,541
Any creature that feels
has to despise them.

111
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,791
Don't you think so?

112
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,875
Yeah, maybe.
One would hope.

113
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,416
Then again, I'm just
a big scaredy-cat.

114
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,583
When I'm scared, I freeze up.

115
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,833
I can't think.
Or move. Or speak.

116
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,166
I'm so afraid. It's like
I can't do anything at all.

117
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,416
Except stand there, hoping
someone will save me.

118
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,916
It's awful.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,125
If I wasn't such a coward,
I might be able to fight back.

120
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,208
But, I am, always have been.

121
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,458
The truth is, I'm
nothing like Yoshinon.

122
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:55,500
When I'm in danger, she's right
there by my side. Always.

123
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,166
She gives me the courage
I don't have on my own.

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,041
She's strong, brave,
and fearless.

125
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,416
She's my hero.

126
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,625
So you see? That's it.
That's why I won't fight.

127
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,791
Why are you petting me?

128
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,791
Come on. I'm here
to protect you.

129
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,916
And I'll make sure
we find Yoshinon.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,625
But, you don't hafta rely on
her to protect you anymore,

131
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,958
cuz I'm gonna be your hero now.

132
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,208
[SHIDO]
That's right.

133
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,708
It doesn't matter
if she's a Spirit.

134
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,666
A girl as kind as she is
deserves nothing less!

135
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,250
Uh. Thanks so much
for your kindness.

136
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,875
Sure.

137
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,041
So, look. I'm sorry
about what happened.

138
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,250
Kissing you out of
the blue and everything.

139
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,125
Kissing?

140
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,541
Yeah. You know.

141
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,250
A kiss is when you
get really close

142
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,875
and touch each other's
lips. Just like this.

143
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,958
Shido! I'm so sorry that I--

144
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,791
Uh...

145
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,250
[KOTORI]
Shido!

146
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,708
Sorry to bother you
at a time like this,

147
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,041
but we figured out
where Yoshinon is.

148
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,583
Great! Awesome work!
Tell me where!

149
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,875
[KOTORI] Actually, that's
kind of the awkward part.

150
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,541
[TOHKA] There's that
feeling again. It's awful.

151
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,791
I just want it to go away!

152
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,000
[dinging]

153
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:36,833
[ORIGAMI]
Who's there?

154
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,375
It's Shido. Can I com--?

155
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,500
[SHIDO]
This is crazy.

156
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,750
Are you positive I'm
in the right place?

157
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,333
[KOTORI] According to the
analysis, there's no question.

158
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,291
We were able to confirm
beyond a shadow of a doubt

159
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,833
that Origami took
Yoshinon from the scene.

160
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,250
[SHIDO] That doesn't
make me feel any better

161
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,000
about having to
act like a thief.

162
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,000
[KOTORI] Well, it's too
late to back out now.

163
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,041
We'll do our best to
support you on our end--

164
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,458
[distorted] get in there--
do what you have to.

165
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,041
--Hello? Are you there?
--We're breaking up! Dammit!

166
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,958
Uh. Hi there, Tobiichi.

167
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,291
Hello.

168
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,958
[SHIDO]
Thanks for letting me come over.

169
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,875
I know it's really
short notice and all.

170
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,166
I appreciate it.

171
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,250
You're very welcome.

172
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,625
Here you go.

173
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,958
Oh, uh-- Thank you.

174
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,083
Wait. Tobiichi! What is this?

175
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,083
Just drink it.

176
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,916
Come on! You gotta
be kidding me!

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,250
Drink it!

178
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,541
Of course,
I would love to.

179
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,583
I'm dying! Ahh!

180
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,458
Hey! What in the heck
do you think you're doing?

181
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,708
Do you like that?

182
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:04,083
Well. Uh. I would
say no. Not really.

183
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,708
I'll get off you if you agree
to grant me one request.

184
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,000
No 'if's', 'and's', or 'but's'.
Do we have a deal or not?

185
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,375
It depends on what it is.

186
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,541
I am completely over you
calling me by my last name,

187
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,958
you got that?

188
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,916
I hear you call everybody
else by their first names.

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,125
But I'm still just
Tobiichi to you.

190
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:20,750
Huh?

191
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,208
My name's Origami.

192
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,750
That is what I prefer
to be called. Deal?

193
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,083
That seems like a
reasonable proposition.

194
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,708
Consider it done.

195
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,375
Yeah. Origami.

196
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:39,708
We good?

197
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,666
Uh. Totally, sure.

198
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,708
Wait, where are you going?

199
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,791
The shower.

200
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,000
Seems like a weird
time to do that.

201
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,208
Oh! I forgot! The puppet!

202
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,500
No use. I can't
find it. Damn it.

203
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,125
These not so subtle pillow
messages are freaking me out!

204
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh wow, that was pretty fast.

205
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,791
What's wrong?

206
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,333
Oh. Nothing is wrong. Why?

207
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:53,875
Are you okay?

208
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,666
Dude. How can
you ask me that?

209
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,875
[KOTORI] We still
haven't been able

210
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,208
to reestablish the connection?

211
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,500
No, not yet,

212
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,333
there's some sort of
powerful jamming signal there.

213
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,125
And it's far stronger
than the signal at AST.

214
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,291
Origami. What is her deal?

215
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,458
[ORIGAMI] There's
something I want to ask you.

216
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:14,250
During one of my missions.
I was sure you'd been-

217
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,083
I want to know what you are.

218
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,583
Look. Have you ever
talked to a Spirit before?

219
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,250
What are you trying to say?

220
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,833
I'm saying I've talked to them.

221
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,000
And not just Tohka either.
I've talked with Yoshino.

222
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,666
She's the Spirit they
call the 'Hermit.'

223
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,500
That's too dangerous.
You shouldn't do that.

224
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,791
It's really not.
You should give it a try.

225
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,666
I think you'll be surprised.

226
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,000
Look, you're right,

227
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,208
there probably are a ton
of bad Spirits out there.

228
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,291
But they're not all bad!

229
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,416
I know this might
sound a little bit nuts.

230
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,208
But you gotta
believe me, it's true.

231
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,041
Tohka and Yoshino
are good Spirits.

232
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,083
I have to help Yoshino.

233
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,000
And no matter what,
I'll never deny Tohka.

234
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,625
You asked something of me.

235
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,833
Now I'm gonna demand
something of you.

236
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,208
Promise me something.

237
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,750
Promise you'll stop
hurting good people.

238
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,375
You're a good person, too.

239
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,041
And they're no
different than you are.

240
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,750
So tell me: why the hell did
it have to turn out this way?

241
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,416
Look, I don't know.
But it just can't be helped.

242
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,291
Even if you are
right about them.

243
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,833
And even if that Hermit
isn't looking for a fight.

244
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,583
There's still the problem
of the spatial quakes.

245
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,958
[buzzing]

246
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,208
It's them.

247
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,666
We're being deployed.

248
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,750
Origami!

249
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,041
Let me ask you one more thing.

250
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,500
If Hermit's Spirit powers
give out like Tohka's did,

251
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,666
you'll stop attacking,
won't you?

252
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,875
That would be the
right thing to do.

253
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,000
It isn't about being right
or wrong. Good or bad.

254
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,791
It's about following my orders.

255
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,375
Regardless of whatever
I might want to do.

256
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,958
All right, Origami.
Goodbye. I'll see you soon.

257
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,958
Yes! We've got her
right where we want her!

258
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,416
Zadkiel!

259
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,166
Did we get her?

260
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,041
Whoa! What is it?

261
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,583
It's an Angel.

262
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,000
[roars]

263
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,208
This can't be real!

264
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,291
Move! Let's go!

265
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,666
[SHIDO]
Yoshino!

266
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,291
It's me, I'm here!

267
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,500
He-- He came.

268
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,083
Yoshino! I came here
to give you something!

269
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,833
[RYOKO]
What do you think you're doing?

270
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,875
It's not safe over there!

271
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,666
No! No!

272
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,583
Shido! Oh no! This is not good!

273
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,750
Sandalphon!
Sandalphon! Sandalphon!

274
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,916
Come out! Please, Sandalphon!

275
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,041
[SHIDO]
Oh man. Sandalphon!

276
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,750
[TOHKA]
Are you okay?

277
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,291
[SHIDO]
Tohka? You saved me.

278
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,708
Oh, Shido. I owe you an
apology for lots of things.

279
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,208
I got mad at you
about some stuff

280
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,666
I didn't really know about.

281
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,166
I hope you can find it in
your heart to forgive me.

282
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,291
Thank you.

283
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,208
But I'm the one who
should apologize.

284
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:45,000
Tohka, I need your power.
To save Yoshino!

285
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,041
I--

286
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,500
[TOHKA] Yoshino. She's the
girl you kissed.

287
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,958
I see.

288
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,000
She is more important
to you than I am.

289
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,500
I understand.

290
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,125
No! That's not how it is at all!

291
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:03,916
Yoshino. She's--She's
a Spirit just like you!

292
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,041
I made a promise that
I'd do everything I could

293
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,500
to protect her! But I
can't do it on my own!

294
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,666
I'm begging you. Please.
Lend me your power!

295
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,750
[TOHKA]
His heart is so... good.

296
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:25,750
How can I turn my back on him?
The man who saved me?

297
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,833
I have to do the right thing.

298
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,041
Tohka?

299
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,500
Get on. There's not much time.

300
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,750
[RYOKO] Ugh. This is
definitely not a good sign.

301
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,958
It looks like the blizzard
is taking the magical power

302
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,791
from our Realizers and using
it to strengthen its defenses.

303
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,833
And there's no way we can lower
the Territory and go in there.

304
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,083
We won't be able to
withstand the ice bullets!

305
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,958
They'll rip us all to shreds!

306
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,875
Besides, if we only
use physical attacks

307
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,541
we won't be able to do
anything about the Spirit!

308
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,625
Origami!

309
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,125
[RYOKO]
Wait, what is this?

310
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,125
What are you doing?

311
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,625
[ORIGAMI]
I'll use sheer force.

312
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,708
Attack at the exact
moment the barrier falls.

313
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,083
Heh. Excellent dodge.

314
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,083
Tohka Yatogami.

315
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,958
Why don't you just give
up while you still can?

316
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,000
[RYOKO] Troops! Switch
your target to Princess!

317
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,416
[KOTORI]
Shido, hold on!

318
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,833
Please don't go in
there on your own.

319
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,583
With no protection,
this is too much,

320
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,750
even with your
regeneration abilities!

321
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,791
Wait a sec. Am I going crazy,

322
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,208
or do I detect just a hint
of concern in your voice?

323
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,791
[KOTORI] This is no time
to joke around, Shido.

324
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,791
Last time, a single
bullet hit you.

325
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,833
Trust me, this is gonna be
a completely different story.

326
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,083
It'll be like trying to
dodge machine gun fire.

327
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,833
If your Spirit power's detected
you won't be able to heal!

328
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,125
[SHIDO]
Spirit power. Oh wow.

329
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,791
So my regeneration ability,
it's a Spirit power then?

330
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,000
[KOTORI]
Shido! Don't do this! Please!

331
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,250
Don't go in there, Big Bro!

332
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,375
[YOSHINO]
Yoshinon.

333
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,916
[YOHINON]
Have no fear, Yoshinon's here.

334
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,916
[KOTORI]
It's-- It's really you, Shido.

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
In the flesh.

336
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,583
I made it. Just in
the nick of time.

337
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:02,583
Here's your puppet.
See, I told ya I'd find it.

338
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,125
Oh, no! What's wrong?

339
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,791
Hey. Please don't cry.

340
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,250
Everything is
gonna be all right.

341
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:14,916
Thank you.
You're just so nice.

342
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,958
Thanks for saving her.
She-- She's my best friend.

343
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,291
This means so much to me.

344
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,333
[SHIDO] Glad to do it. But now
it's your turn to be saved.

345
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,125
But first uh-- Ya see.

346
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,458
The thing is,
in order to save you,

347
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,416
there's something
we have to do.

348
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,625
We have to
kiss first. So...

349
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,416
Oh. Uh.

350
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,375
Well, not really.

351
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,083
I was just kidding around.

352
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,416
We don't actually have to
do that if you don't, uh--

353
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,000
Was that okay
with you?

354
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,625
Yeah. Yeah,
it was awesome.

355
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,708
Sure was. I'm glad.

356
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,166
Cause if you
think it's awesome,

357
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,208
then it's awesome
to me, too.

358
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,208
Whoa. What's happening?

359
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,458
Oh, Shido.

360
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,291
[YOSHINO]
Beautiful.

361
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,333
Hey. What the heck is this?

362
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,500
[KOTORI] I told you we'd
make a special housing unit

363
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,750
just for Spirits.

364
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,583
Tohka will move out
today and live here.

365
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,375
If you listened to me
you'd already know that.

366
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,500
And not just Tohka, either.

367
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,958
Uh. Hi, Yoshino.

368
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:39,000
Hi. From now on,
I'll be by your side.

369
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,583
Right. The same goes for me.

370
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,291
This isn't the end; it's just
the beginning, folks!

371
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,750
To be continued!
