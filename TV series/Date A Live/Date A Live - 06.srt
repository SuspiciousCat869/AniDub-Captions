[AST GIRL 2]
Something's interfering

00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:41,875
with the transmission!

00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,375
[AST GIRL 3]
Medic! I need a medic!

00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,291
[RYOKO]
What's going on?

5
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,625
How is this happening?

6
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,708
[NARRATOR]
Hot springs.

7
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,250
Warm water that wells from
the center of the earth.

8
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,625
They have enchanted
humans for ages.

9
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,166
People flock from all over

10
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,458
to soak their aching bodies in
nature's scalding hot baths.

11
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,291
Healing, relaxing,
and revitalizing;

12
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,208
no one can resist their charms.

00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,500
[KOTORI]
Hot springs?

14
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,208
Yeah. Tohka and the others

15
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,375
decided they wanted check
it out sometime today.

16
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,583
Oh. Well, I guess that's okay.

17
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,250
It sounds kinda fun, actually.

18
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,208
And I mean, we want the
Spirits to make discoveries

19
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,791
and think for themselves;
so I'll make the arrangements.

20
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,708
Besides, we want
them happy, right?

21
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,083
No one likes an angry Spirit.

22
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:52,916
[SHIDO]
Right.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,875
So, where are you going?

24
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,416
I was thinking Tengu
Paradise since it's co-ed.

25
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,458
[KANNAZUKI]
Yes! That's a great one.

26
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,041
Hey, listen. You should join
them, give yourself a break.

27
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,416
I can take care of
everything for you here.

28
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,541
You must think I'm crazy.

29
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,125
I absolutely do not.

30
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,458
I think you're
working too hard

31
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,458
and we can't function if
our commander is exhausted!

32
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,166
So do us all a favor.
Go to the hot springs?

33
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,833
What are you
really after?

34
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,333
I have no idea what you mean.

35
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,666
I have no desire to install

36
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,666
several surveillance
cameras there.

37
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,000
Would someone like me actually
fill a hot spring with lenses

38
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,416
so that I could stare
at every inch of that

Especially the backside?

No! No, not the internment camp!

Please forgive me, Commander!

[KOTORI]
Listen up, Kannazuki.

45
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,666
When you get to the camp,
you are to start digging a hole

46
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,291
and not stop for the entire day.

47
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,875
And after that, you'll
fill the hole back up,

48
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,625
and repeat for a whole week.

49
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,333
Woohoo!

50
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,583
The hot springs with
my Big Brother. Huh.

51
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,875
[MALE SUPERIOR OFFICER A] We've
had word from headquarters.

52
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,125
It's come to my attention
that supplementary personnel

53
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,708
are currently being
deployed from DEM.

54
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,291
And unlike you and your platoon,

55
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,500
they've managed to figure out
a way to use magic correctly.

56
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,833
Not that I think for a moment

57
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,625
you would lose to civilian
transfers. Far from it.

58
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,125
But there's nothing wrong
with observing their technique.

59
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,791
Right?

60
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,458
Roger that, Sir!

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,916
Um, excuse me, Captain?

What is it?

63
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,958
I wanted to ask about the
company trip this weekend.

Oh! You mean the "Thirteen
Secret Hot Springs Tour"?

With all-you-can-eat delicacies
from different regions?

00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,125
Yeah, about that.

67
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,875
So you know how more Spirits
have been turning up lately?

68
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:45,125
Well, our alert levels
have increased a tiny bit.

What are you saying?

00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:53,958
Well, I'm sorry but the
trip has been cancelled!

--Please, let me finish!
--Huh?

I know it won't
replace the trip,

but the troops and
I were thinking.

Why don't we send you to
Tengu Paradise Hot Springs?

You deserve some kind of break!

I think a day of relaxation is
exactly what you need right now.

161
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,458
Does that mean
you're not mad anymore?

162
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,916
No, I'm not mad at all.

163
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,583
[NAKATSUGAWA] Several unknowns
are turning up on the radar.

164
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,375
Confirmation needed.

165
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,875
[MIKIMOTO] They have been
matched. It's the AST.

166
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,833
[SHIZAKI] The AST?
What are they doing here?

167
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,083
That's strange. Maybe it's
because of the Spirits?

168
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,333
I highly doubt it.

169
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,000
They aren't even able
to detect Spirit waves

170
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,500
from Tohka and the
others right now.

171
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,166
Don't worry about why.

172
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,250
Any contact we make now
could interfere with the plan.

173
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,833
Sound the emergency code.

174
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,875
[NAKATSUGAWA] We should wait.
The commander's out on business.

175
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,291
And our second in command
is busy with his punishment.

176
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,583
Enough!

177
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,875
According to Article
Twenty-Two, Clause Three.

178
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,958
If there's an emergency we have
the right to transfer command.

179
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:33,875
If at least five crewmembers
agree, we can sound the code.

180
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,250
Show of hands on
sounding the code!

181
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,166
Confirmed! I, Bad
Marriage Kawagoe,

182
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,208
temporarily accept the
role of Deputy Commander!

183
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:50,583
Yes! Deputy Commander.
I like the sound of that.

184
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,333
Activate the code!

185
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,666
Form the absolute defense
line, and prepare to attack!

186
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,500
Block the advance of the AST!

187
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,916
[GROUP] Roger!

188
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,166
Yep, I was right.

189
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,833
This is much different
from the map.

190
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,250
That street doesn't
look familiar.

191
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,250
Captain!

192
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,833
There's a dead end up ahead.

193
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,541
The right flank
is also a dead end.

194
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,208
There is a shopping arcade
five hundred miles

195
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,583
straight ahead of us.

196
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,791
Behind us. The street
has been destroyed.

197
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,833
We can't help that.
Hey, Origami?

198
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,625
Ma'am.

199
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,791
Keep watch from up above.

200
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,333
Roger that.

201
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,250
Checking.

202
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,208
There is no shopping
arcade over to the left,

203
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,833
but I do see a side road
a short distance ahead.

204
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,166
Looks like it connects
to the main road

205
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,916
after about a quarter of a mile.

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,333
That'll work.
Troops, forward march!

207
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,416
[SHIDO] 
Kotori? What are you doing here?

208
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,375
Hi! It's so good to see you!

209
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,750
Hello. Is there
something wrong?

210
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,041
No, not at all.

211
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,833
I was just--
I wanted to make sure

212
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,416
that Shido was doing his job.

213
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
What? You can do all
that from the ship. Be real.

214
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,416
You just wanted to come with
us to the hot springs, right?

215
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,791
Don't be ridiculous!

216
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,166
Look, it's okay.
Why don't we all go together?

217
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,583
It'll be a lotta fun.

218
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,083
Well, I guess if
you insist. Let's go.

219
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,916
[alarm sounds]

220
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,375
What in the world is going on?

221
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,083
So. If you need anything
just let me know, okay?

222
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,583
Thanks I guess,
but what about you?

223
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,375
I said I'm fine, gah!
I'll catch up with you later.

224
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,666
'Kay.

225
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,958
Oh, man. Why did something
have to happen now?

226
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,416
This is starting
to get ridiculous!

227
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,375
There was definitely
a path plot here.

228
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,541
No reaction here.

229
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,500
Vibration and
infrared sensor fail.

230
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,000
No reaction from the
acoustic sensor, either,

231
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,208
and no humans detected
within five hundred meters.

232
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,750
The walls around here
are a minimum of

233
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,208
fifty centimeters thick and are
heavily enforced with rebar.

234
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,791
Like that'll stop me?

235
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:09,708
Bring it here.

236
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,708
Right.

237
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,541
[VOICES]
Woo hoo!

238
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,875
Troops! Attention, please!

239
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,833
About face!

240
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,625
[AST GIRLS]
Forward, March!

241
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,000
[AST GIRLS]
What just happened here?

242
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,041
Uh oh. What's that?
Did I do something just now?

243
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,541
No. You did nothing.

244
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,458
The wall exploded
all by itself.

245
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,833
Oh, no!
That's so scary!

246
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,666
[KOTORI]
Crap. It figures.

247
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,125
Looks like the damn AST
decided to meddle again.

248
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,333
Switch to Date Town
Type Two in combat mode.

249
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,083
And use whatever firearms
you feel are necessary!

250
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,250
[MIKIMOTO] Commander?
What are you doing out there?

251
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,125
Site inspection!
Don't worry about me.

252
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,458
Confirm your orders!

253
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,791
[MIKIMOTO]
Right!

254
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,625
Transitioning to Date Town
Type Two in combat mode.

255
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,708
Eliminating the AST.

256
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,833
What is this?

257
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,666
[AST GIRL 1]
Gross! What happened?

258
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,250
[AST GIRL 2]
It's so cold!

259
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,125
Move carefully.
This doesn't feel right.

260
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,708
Look alive, ladies!
And hurry!

261
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,208
[MIKIMOTO]
The commander is watching.

262
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,166
Do whatever it
takes to stop them!

263
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,583
[GROUP] Roger!

264
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,041
What's this?

265
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,750
A mobility inhibition system.

266
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,333
It spills a special
liquid on the ground

267
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,458
to lower friction coefficient
to below Point Zero One.

268
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,458
Meant to prevent the
progression of the target.

269
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,541
Damn. What about
the one over there?

270
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,125
[ORIGAMI] Probably some
kind of hypnotic gas.

271
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,375
Helpful for when the enemy wants
to stop us without killing us.

272
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,833
[RYOKO]
Well played, whoever you are.

273
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,083
Listen up! Use the
suppression equipment!

274
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,000
Attack immediately!

275
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,541

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,583
Wh-- Where's Yoshinon?

277
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,416
Hey. It's gonna
be all right.

278
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,791
You're not helping.

279
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,541
The only method that's going
to calm her down right now

280
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,916
is finding Yoshinon.

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,166
Huh?

282
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,708
Look.

283
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,125
You and Yoshinon are going to
be together again very soon.

284
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,791
[TOHKA]
Shido! Please be careful!

285
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,125
[SHIZAKI]
Target is City barrier.

286
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,541
We're breaking through
with Labyrinth!

287
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,625
The target is
rapidly approaching.

288
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,833
Look out!

289
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,583
Type Two Combat Mode
won't work to stop them.

290
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,791
So, what's our next tactic?

291
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,375
Do we know if our enemy's
put up a Territory yet?

292
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,291
That has been confirmed, yes.

293
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,833
All right. Well, then this
next move won't kill them.

294
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,125
You have permission
to use Destroy Mode!

295
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,291
Roger that!

296
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,875
Permission to fire
free on Date Town!

Do whatever you must
to stop the AST!

299
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,208
[RYOKO] I'm exhausted,
pissed, and covered in sweat.

300
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,750
I was supposed to be bathing
in the hot springs by now!

301
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,208
How the hell did this happen?

302
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,666
Oh that's right.

303
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,708
The Lieutenant Commander
stresses me out.

304
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,291
The troops said we should
go to the hot springs

305
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,416
while we're still young.

306
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,708
It's all work and no play.

307
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,875
I'm gonna go there today
even if it kills me!

308
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,416
They think they can
do whatever they want

309
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,375
and we won't retaliate!

310
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,291
Those food cannon pieces
of junk are pathetic.

311
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,333
The AST will not be defeated!

312
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,458
You should do yourselves
a favor and repent!

313
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,333
All right, ladies;
give 'em hell!

314
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,750
Just because it's a work day

315
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,916
doesn't mean we can't
have a little fun!

316
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,291
So go ahead!

317
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,666
Annihilate, slaughter,
eradicate, eliminate, kill,

318
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,708
and destroy those
pieces of trash!

00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,500
If any of you have bullets
left when this is over,

320
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,583
that ammunition will be
shoved down your throat!

321
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,500
Use it all!

322
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,666
Fun, isn't it? I can't hear you!

323
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,250
Aren't we all having fun?

324
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,625
[SHIDO]
What is happening?

325
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,583
There aren't any
Spirits anywhere.

326
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,625
I don't get it.

327
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,083
Always trying to
pick fights with me!

328
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,250
Is this what you
wanted, you swine?

329
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,916
You think it's easy to do
all this against a Spirit?

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,250
Then why don't you try it?

331
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,791
If you're lucky,
you might even be left

332
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,916
with a bone or two
in your pathetic body!

333
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,708
You're not going to
stay young forever!

334
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,083
I'm busting my ass over
here to keep my skin young

335
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,750
despite the stress and
lack of sleep you cause!

336
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,833
Never underestimate
a woman at her peak!

337
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,750
I'm only twenty-seven, damn it!

338
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,416
What is up with that voice?
Frickin' creepy.

339
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,541
Look out, you guys.
I can't move.

340
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,875
Disarm the Territory,
or you'll freeze to death!

341
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,458
I got it, thanks!

342
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,291
Are you okay?

343
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,166
She's alright.
Just some scratches.

344
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,333
Huh?

345
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,083
Yoshinon! Here you are.

346
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,291
Stop!

347
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,416
Do you hear me? Stop the attack!

348
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,875
[ORIGAMI]
Shido! No!

349
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,333
Radio interference!

350
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,500
Analyzing ground zero.
Here's the video.

351
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,208
You're safe now.
How are you feeling?

352
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,625
I'm good. Thank you.

353
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,625
What is that?

354
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,833
Do you think it
could be Princess?

355
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,875
Hey, Captain? Princess
showed up. Now what?

356
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,916
She probably
can't hear us.

357
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,125
I've got this.

358
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,833
But-- but your
attack power?

359
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,833
I don't care. I'll make it work.

360
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,041
We're gonna live.

361
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,208
So uh. Where did
Princess come from anyway?

362
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,541
Do you think it
means that everything

363
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,708
that happened today was
because of the Spirits?

364
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,458
I had no idea they
could do all this.

365
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,458
We can never let our guard down.

366
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,375
Yes! I feel so much better!

367
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,375
[AST GIRLS]
Freaky. She's so weird.

368
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,375
Guess we finally made it, huh?

369
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,041
We did. Today sure was hard.

370
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,791
[splash]

371

[gasps]

372
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,458
It's been quite a
journey, hasn't it?

373
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,375
We can finally let loose.

374
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,291
All right, left face.

375
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,708
And forward, charge!

376
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,541
[AST GIRLS] Woo!

377
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,666
Huh. Did Shido leave?

378
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,791
[KOTORI] Gonna be tough
to relax like that.

379
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,166
Commander. Is now a good time?

380
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,708
Kannazuki? Where
did you come from?

381
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,583
Here. I was minding
my own business

382
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,416
and digging the hole
as ordered when suddenly,

383
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,041
I dug up a hot spring!

384
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,958
[TOHKA]
How is it? Does it feel good?

385
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,708
Do you feel less tired now?

386
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,166
It's supposed to relax
sore muscles, too.

387
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,416
We're sorry about today.

388
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,125
Yeah. It was all my fault

389
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,000
you had to deal with
that crazy stuff.

390
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,000
Hey, did you guys
do this on purpose?

391
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,208
[KOTORI] Maybe.

392
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,916
I will say that I'm
glad you're recharging.

393
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,250
I've got a lot of work
for you to do later.

394
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,958
[SHIDO] Gotcha.

395
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,750
What a great night!
