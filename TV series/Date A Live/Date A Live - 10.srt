1
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,500
No way. It can't be.

2
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,750
If you think
your flames

3
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,666
are gonna scare me,
you're wrong!

4
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,000
Cause you're not the
only one with a cool toy!

5
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,833
[NARRATOR] Spirits
are not human beings.

6
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,916
And human beings are
certainly not Spirits.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,833
Even though they
have some similarities,

8
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,416
their differences
abound. Poor Shido.

9
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,083
He's far more than
slightly confused.

10
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,166
[KURUMI laughs]

11
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,208
Now then.
How about you and I engage

12
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,750
in a little bit of
Spirited competition?

13
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,166
Is this really
the best you can do?

14
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,875
I have to say, I'm unimpressed!

15
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,041
You can call forth an Angel,
and command flames,

16
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,125
surely you can beat
little ole me, can't you?

17
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,583
Oh well, I guess not!

18
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,208
Why don't you
keep your mouth shut?

19
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,000
You're a lot cuter
when you're not talking!

20
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,958
Well, I happen to think
you would be a lot cuter

21
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,083
with your pretty little
head mounted on my wall!

22
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,208
Zaphkiel! Zayin!

23
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,166
Guys, stop it! Please!

24
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,541
It must really suck
to be you right now.

25
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,250
Frozen in time and
completely surrounded.

26
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh well.
Bye-bye, flame girl.

27
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,666
[KURUMI] A pointblank
shot to the noggin'.

28
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,666
That'll sure dampen
your Spirit, eh?

29
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,750
It really is too bad,

30
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,958
I was actually
starting to enjoy her.

31
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,666
And now she's dead.

32
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,125
[KURUMI] Now
that that's settled,

33
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,208
you're on deck, Shido.

34
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,375
Let's have a little fun--

35
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,875
[KOTORI] Monologue-ing
always gets

36
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,791
the bad guy in trouble.

37
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,958
Not part of your plan?

38
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,541
If you'd rather tuck your
tail between your legs

39
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,708
and run home to mommy,

40
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,625
I'd completely understand.

41
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,500
Ha! Not in your wildest
dreams, flame girl!

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,291
Aleph!

43
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,583
What are you doing?

44
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,500
[KOTORI] Cut her
to pieces! Camael!

45
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,041
[KURUMI] Damn you!

46
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,208
Come, Zaphkiel! Daletto!

47
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,666
[KOTORI] Ah, come on,
don't give up on me already.

48
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,125
You can't quit just
when your opponent

49
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,250
is warmed up, it's bad form!

50
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,625
[KURUMI] I promise you this:

51
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,666
You'll be sorry you ever
decided to mess with me!

52
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,875
Zaphkiel!

53
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,708
Hmph. Yeah!
Show me what you got!

54
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,208
[KOTORI] What's happening?

55
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,875
Kotori!

56
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,916
[KURUMI] It looks like
your devil's luck has run out!

57
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,583
[SHIDO] Kotori!
Are you all right?

58
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,791
Camael. Megiddo!

59
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,333
Rally to me immediately!

60
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:59,000
Turn them all to ashes!
Do it, Camael!

61
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,791
[KOTORI] Pick up your weapon.

62
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,583
This fight's
not over yet.

63
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,833
And the war's not
over yet, either!

64
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,875
Well? Come on then.

65
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,208
Let's have some more

66
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,916
of that destruction
you love so much!

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,458
This is the fight you wanted!

68
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,791
This is the war
you wanted, isn't it?

69
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,291
[KOTORI] If you can't
face the muzzle

70
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,333
of a gun anymore it's over.

71
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,875
Time for you to die.

72
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,250
Kotori!

73
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,958
If you keep pushing
like this, she will die!

74
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,416
[SHIDO] Isn't the
point of Ratatoskr

75
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,041
to resolve conflicts
without killing Spirits?

76
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,250
You have to stop!

77
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,375
[SHIDO] Stay back!

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,833
No. Don't. Please.

79
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,000
Big Brother, look out!

80
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:23,791
[quiet sobbing sounds]

81
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,625
Huh?

82
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:30,208
Big Brother! Big Brother!

83
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,041
[YOSHINON] Would you
like me to operate?

84
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,666
[YOSHINO] Yes, please.
Thank you, Doctor.

85
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,125
All righty then.

86
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,708
Nurse, please
hand me my scalpel!

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,291
Oh. I was playing
doctor. Sorry.

88
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,333
You're fine.

89
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,708
[SHIDO] Tohka. She's here, too?

90
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,333
Why am I in a sick bay?

91
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,416
[REINE] Well.
You're awake. That's good.

92
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,791
Looks like the
anesthesia didn't work.

93
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,000
Good thing you woke up
before I cut you open.

94
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,583
I really am sorry.
I hope I didn't scare you.

95
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,791
Please. I'm fine, really.

96
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,250
Hey, Reine. Tell me.
What am I doing in here?

97
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,791
The thing is you
were knocked out

98
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,458
in the battle with Kurumi,

99
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,250
so we brought you here
just to be on the safe side.

100
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

101
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,125
But I don't know what
happened after that!

102
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,125
What about Tohka?

103
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,583
She's just sleeping, isn't she?

104
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,875
Hey. Where is Kotori?
What was that power?

105
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,750
You need to
calm down, Shin.

106
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,916
No, I'm not
gonna calm down!

107
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,625
Wait, what about Kurumi?

108
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,416
And Mana, is she all right?

109
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,791
And everyone from school?

110
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,541
Everything'll
be just fine.

111
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,208
Do you feel better now?

112
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,791
Yeah.

113
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,833
Everybody is doing okay,
and no one was killed.

114
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,541
All things considered,
it could've been much worse.

115
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,791
[REINE] As far as
Origami. And Mana.

116
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,416
They were both taken
by members of the AST.

117
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,916
We can't be certain yet,

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,708
but our best guess is they were
brought to Tengu Hospital.

119
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,208
Kurumi ran off
while she had the chance.

120
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,625
And as you can see,
Tohka is sleeping.

121
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,416
Even though she's hurt,
she wanted to be by your side.

122
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,666
Tohka cares more about you
than she does her own recovery.

123
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,166
Not to worry though,
she's gonna be fine.

124
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,750
That's good, but
this isn't the end, is it?

125
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,500
Of course not.

126
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,541
Kotori. Can I see her?

127
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,708
[REINE] She can't hear or see
us through the protective wall.

128
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,500
[REINE] You're going to
be on your own in there.

129
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,625
[KOTORI] Hey you.

130
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,291
I didn't expect to
see you up and about.

131
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,416
How are you feeling?

132
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,666
Better. I guess.

133
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,291
What about you?

134
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you feeling okay?

135
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,541
I feel like my normal
super cute self.

136
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,125
Not sure it's normal
to call yourself cute.

137
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,291
You don't
think I'm cute?

138
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,791
No. You're right,
I guess you're kinda cute.

139
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,875
But Kotori, tell me the truth,
are you really a Spirit?

140
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:43,083
[SHIDO] Answer me.
Are you a Spirit or not?

141
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,041
[KOTORI] Well, if I told
you that I wasn't a Spirit,

142
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,500
would you believe me?

143
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,791
Of course. If you
said so, then I would.

144
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,958
Is that right?

145
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,208
You'd believe what someone says

146
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,375
even when you've seen
the contrary to be true.

147
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,833
If you want my two cents,

148
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,000
that seems like a fast way
to make a fool of yourself.

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,291
If I can't even
trust my little sis,

150
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,708
what kinda brother
would that make me?

151
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,375
Look, I said I'd believe you.

152
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,958
I always will, no matter what.

153
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,458
I think
I'm a human being.

154
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,833
I mean I wouldn't
call myself a Spirit.

155
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,708
Although, the
observation equipment

156
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,666
might beg to differ.

157
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,208
I have no doubt the machine
says I'm lying to you.

158
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,666
[SHIDO] Wait, what do you mean?

159
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,666
I was born into
the Itsuka family,

160
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,833
and that much I know for sure.

161
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,416
But five years ago.

162
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,333
Somehow, I became
a Flame Spirit.

163
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,791
[KOTORI] That may not
be the best way to put it.

164
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,458
I guess it's more
accurate to say I became

165
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,916
a person who
possesses Spirit powers.

166
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,791
[SHIDO] Seriously?

167
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,291
[SHIDO] This might sound nuts,
but I knew about this.

168
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,166
That's impossible!
I never said anything to you!

169
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,625
No. No, that's
not what I'm saying.

170
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,833
I had this dream.

171
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,833
[YOUNG SHIDO] Kotori! No!

172
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,583
[YOUNG KOTORI] Big brother!
Big Brother, no!

173
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:12,291
[quiet sobbing]

174
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:16,666
[YOUNG KOTORI] Big Brother.
I'm sorry Brother!

175
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,583
[KOTORI] I have to say,
I'm not sure I agree

176
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,166
with the part where
I was screaming out

177
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,416
for you and crying
like a big baby.

178
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,458
But more or less,

179
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,083
that's the way
I remember it, too.

180
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,458
It's possible it may
have flowed to yo

181
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,041
through the path
when the Spirit powers

182
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,208
returned to me.

183
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,000
I see. But I still
don't get it.

184
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,625
What happened? How did
you become a Spirit?

185
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,458
I wish I could tell you;

186
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,541
but the truth is,
I don't remember.

187
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,708
[SHIDO] Huh?

188
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:46,916
[KOTORI] I mean,
obviously I know something

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,625
must've happened back then.

190
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,791
But for the life of me,
I don't know what.

191
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,583
I remember becoming a Spirit
but I don't know how.

192
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,375
Or even why for that matter.

193
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,916
[SHIDO] How can you forget
something so important?

194
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,208
Look who's talking.

195
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,666
You're in no position
to pass judgment

196
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,583
on the forgetful front, Big Bro.

197
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,125
[KOTORI] But then again,
you're right.

198
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,541
It's kinda weird
that neither one of us

199
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,541
has any memory of it at all.

200
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,166
You'd think we would
remember everything.

201
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,208
Who knows?

202
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,625
Maybe somebody
erased our memories

203
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,500
for some reason.

204
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,500
Well, it's a theory anyway.

205
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,458
After that, I was
discovered by Ratatoskr.

206
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,375
Then I found out
the truth about

207
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,625
what was going on
behind the scenes.

208
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,500
And I decided I wanted
to save the Spirits.

209
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,875
[SHIDO] But once you
got past that big fire,

210
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,916
you lived a pretty typical life.

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,625
How were you able to blend
in with the regular kids?

212
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,083
[KOTORI] What, you don't
remember that part either?

213
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,500
I was able to be a normal girl

214
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,041
because you sealed
away my Spirit powers.

215
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:44,875
[SHIDO] Really?

216
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,333
Wait, are you serious?

217
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,333
Yeah. Didn't
I tell you yesterday?

218
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,583
[KOTORI] Don't let me forget
to give this back to you, Shido.

219
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,916
I don't fully
understand why.

220
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,583
But for some
inexplicable reason,

221
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,416
you're able to seal
away a Spirit's power,

222
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
and that's why you were chosen

223
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,916
by Ratatoskr to
talk to the Spirits.

224
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,333
You're special, Shido.

225
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,333
[SHIDO] So my regeneration
ability came from--?

226
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,625
Ugh, yes, your ability
came from mine.

227
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,750
Now. Listen up.

228
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,125
Come over here and stand
right in front of me.

229
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,791
[SHIDO] Why should I do that?

230
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,750
Cause I said so.

231
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,250
[SHIDO] Fine.

232
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,208
I told ya to be
careful, didn't I?

233
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,666
But you didn't listen to me.

234
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,875
If I hadn't
come to my senses,

235
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,625
you'd be dead meat.
You're very lucky.

236
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,541
What the heck were you
thinking anyway, you idiot,

237
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,666
running out in front of
my line of fire like that?

238
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,708
[SHIDO] You scared me.
I thought you'd lost it.

239
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,750
And I was right.
You weren't yourself.

240
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,875
Yeah.

241
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,041
When the Spirit
powers returned to me,

242
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,625
I lost control.

243
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,083
All I wanted to do
was break something.

244
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,791
Or better yet, kill someone
if I got the chance.

245
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,083
I was scared.

246
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,833
It was like I was
a different person.

247
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,875
Who knows what
other awful things

248
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,625
I've done that
I have no memory of.

249
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,125
There's no telling.

250
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,958
If it's that easy for me to
lose control over myself,

251
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:04,958
I wouldn't be shocked

252
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,083
if I already have
killed someone!

253
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,208
[SHIDO] Stop
talking like that!

254
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,958
Just ignore me.

255
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,375
I don't even know
what I'm talking about.

256
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,541
But I do think I know why

257
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,500
I snapped out
of it yesterday.

258
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,958
It's because you
stepped in front of me.

259
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,500
Thanks for saving
the day, big bro.

260
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:24,208
About your Spirit power,
will it come back to me?

261
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,791
I don't really know.

262
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,208
Unfortunately, Spirit stuff
isn't always easy to understand.

263
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,083
All I know for sure is this:

264
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,500
you'll have to seal it
just like you did before.

265
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,250
But to seal it away,
I'd have to--

266
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,875
[KOTORI] Yes, take me on a
date and make me fall in love.

267
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,291
The same way you did with Tohka.

268
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,750
And Yoshino. You have to.

269
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,333
[SHIDO] Hey. Kotori!
Are you all right?

270
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,708
Can you stand?

271
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,833
Yeah, I'm okay.

272
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,291
You don't need
to worry about me.

273
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,125
Please. Talk to me.

274
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,291
Shin. That's enough
for today, all right?

275
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,583
You go ahead, I'll
handle things from here.

276
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,083
No, I can't.

277
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,208
[REINE] We'll have
lots to discuss later.

278
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,833
But for now, go on.

279
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,041
Okay.

280
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,125
[TOHKA] Shido! I've
been looking everywhere!

281
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,833
I was worried 'cause when
I woke up you were gone.

282
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,000
But you're awake.

283
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,666
So does this mean
you're feeling better?

284
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,541
I don't know.

285
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,208
Do you mind
if we talk later?

286
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,041
Eh.. Yeah, okay.

287
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,375
[REINE] I give her two days.

288
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,500
I doubt she'll last
much longer than that.

289
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,833
Eventually, her
Spirit power will be

290
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,041
too much for her to handle.

291
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,666
[SHIDO] Whaddya mean by that?

292
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,666
[REINE] Once the power
overtakes her completely,

293
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,958
Kotori will no longer
be anything like

294
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,750
the little sister you
once knew and loved.

295
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,708
In just under forty-eight hours,

296
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,291
we'll have you go
on a date with her.

297
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,750
That'll be your best
chance to make sure

298
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,750
she doesn't slip away forever.

299
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,750
[FEMALE RECEPTIONIST A]
Sorry sir,

300
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,041
but you're not
allowed to see her.

301
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,458
Not even her family
can do that yet.

302
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,583
I do apologize,
but I'm afraid I don't know

303
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,625
when she's going to
be allowed visitors.

304
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,333
[SHIDO] But why?
Is it really that bad?

305
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,916
[FEMALE RECEPTIONIST A]
I wish I could help.

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,291
But unfortunately, at this time,

307
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,375
I can't discuss her
condition with you.

308
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,458
Ma'am, please.

309
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,291
[ORIGAMI] Shido.

310
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,708
[SHIDO] Origami.

311
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,333
[ORIGAMI] I'm glad
you're safe. Is Tohka okay?

312
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,000
Uh. Yeah.
She's uh-- She's good.

313
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,541
[ORIGAMI] Never mind.

314
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:39,166
So. You came here
to see Mana, huh?

315
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,333
Yeah, well.

316
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,875
I tried to but the
nurse wouldn't allow it.

317
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,416
I can't go into
specifics but--

318
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,916
For Mana's recovery,

319
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,041
they're using some highly
classified equipment on her.

320
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,291
So until she's moved
to the general ward,

321
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,000
there's no way they'll
let anyone see her.

322
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,250
[ORIGAMI] And if you
try to force your way in.

323
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,250
It won't end well.

324
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,083
[ORIGAMI] I know
that's why you're here.

325
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:01,916
[SHIDO] Huh?

326
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,416
To see Mana and nobody else.

327
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh. Well obviously,
I came to visit you, too!

328
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,708
[ORIGAMI] Uh huh.

329
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,916
[SHIDO] Yeah,
I'd better get a move on.

330
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,291
I'm sure you're really busy.

331
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,666
I bet you have lots
of doctors' appointments

332
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,791
and stuff like that. Later!

333
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,041
[thud]

334
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,666
[SHIDO] Origami!
Are you all right?

335
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,416
I can't make it back
to my room on my own.

336
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,916
Will you please carry me?

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,916
[SHIDO] I should get a nurse.

338
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,333
Carry me, right now.

339
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,125
[SHIDO] Come on,
who needs a nurse?

340
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,083
Can you walk?

341
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,416
No, I can't.

342
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,000
[SHIDO] What you
need is a wheel chair.

343
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,333
I'll get one.

344
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,125
No, please stop,
I can't handle that.

345
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,708
I'll vomit from
motion sickness.

346
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,458
What do you expect
me to do about it?

347
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,500
Piggyback me.

348
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,625
Huh?

349
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,416
[ORIGAMI] You heard me.

350
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,625
Right.

351
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,875
[SHIDO] Hey, Origami.

352
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,625
Don't you think you're
holding on a little tight there?

353
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,541
[ORIGAMI] Um, no.

354
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,083
You're in room
'three-oh-five' all the way

355
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,125
in the west wing, aren't you?

356
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,916
[SHIDO] Okay, that tickles!
Please! Don't!

357
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,583
[ORIGAMI] Man up.

358
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,041
[SHIDO] Uh, Origami, stop.

359
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,125
[ORIGAMI pants]

360
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,916
[SHIDO grunts] Oh boy.

361
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,958
All right, that's enough!

362
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,333
Hey! Licking is
crossing the line, okay?

363
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,666
[SHIDO] Well then.

364
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,541
I'm just gonna go ahead and go.

365
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,041
Peel it.

366
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,541
Uh. Well, I suppose
I could make that happen.

367
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,208
Now feed it to me.

368
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,625
Don't you think this
is getting a little crazy?

369
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,625
You wanna see crazy,
try not feeding me.

370
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,416
Now put it in my mouth.

371
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,916
Fine, here!

372
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,916
[moans and slurps]

373
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,375
Um. Please stop.
Wait, don't stop. No, do.

374
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,916
It's gross. And awesome, too.
Oh god. Too much!

375
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,916
Delicious.

376
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,083
Great. I'm glad to
hear you liked it.

377
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,041
So anyway,
I'm gonna take off now.

378
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,958
[ORIGAMI] But what
about my temperature?

379
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,583
I'm gonna need your help.

380
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,250
Sticking it in my mouth.

381
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,041
Oh, all right! Fine!

382
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,916
[SHIDO] Why am I sitting down
to take your temperature?

383
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,833
This is inappropriate!

384
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,583
What the heck is going on?

385
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Well, you seemed

386
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,250
to get excited by
Kurumi's behavior.

387
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,791
Since you like
that sort of thing,

388
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,125
I thought I'd turn up the
volume and get more aggressive.

389
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,750
Here are the
rules, big boy.

390
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,000
If you look, you have to touch.

391
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,041
[SHIDO] Goodbye, Origami.
I'm really leaving this time.

392
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,000
[ORIGAMI] Can I ask
you one more thing?

393
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,791
[ORIGAMI] It's important.

394
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,208
I want you to tell
me what happened

395
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,166
after the fight with
Kurumi Tokisaki yesterday.

396
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,875
Because I thought
I saw another Spirit,

397
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,666
floating in the sky.

398
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,750
She was surrounded
by flames.

399
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,958
Flames she could control.

400
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,500
[ORIGAMI] Then
I must've passed out.

401
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,916
The next thing I knew,
I woke up in here,

402
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,250
so I want you to
tell me what I missed.

403
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,583
No matter how
insignificant the details.

404
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,375
I want to know
everything that happened,

405
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,916
and everything you know
about this Flame Spirit.

406
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,791
Oh. Well uh...

407
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,416
I got knocked out, too,
so I don't know much.

408
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,541
Why do you ask?

409
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,208
[ORIGAMI] Just curious.

410
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,333
[SHIDO] Well, do you know her?

411
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,125
The Flame Spirit, I mean?

412
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,291
[ORIGAMI] Yes, I do.

413
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:33,125
Five years ago there was a
massive fire in Tengu City.

414
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,166
It mainly broke out in
a small neighborhood

415
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,916
called Nankou, and
that's when I first saw her.

416
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,458
The day she burned
my parents alive.

417
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,750
[YOUNG KOTORI] Big Brother!

418
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,875
[ORIGAMI] Ever since
she killed my family,

419
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:49,250
I've spent every waking
moment searching for her.

420
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,500
[ORIGAMI] No one
should ever have

421
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,458
to feel the way I felt that day.

422
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,000
She's the reason
I joined the AST.

423
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,458
The reason I trained
as hard as I could.

424
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,625
She's why I get out
of bed in the morning

425
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,375
and she's what I think
about when I go to sleep.

426
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,791
I promised myself back then that

427
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,625
when I had the chance,
I wouldn't hesitate.

428
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,125
I'd wrap my hands
around her throat,

429
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,791
look her in the eyes,

430
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:13,458
and crush every last
bit of remaining life.

431
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,708
And now my opportunity
is right in front of me.

432
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,875
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

433
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,750
[ORIGAMI] I swear to you.

434
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,125
I will kill the Flame Spirit.
