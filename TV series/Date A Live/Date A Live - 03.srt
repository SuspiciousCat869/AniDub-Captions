1
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,000
[TOHKA]
Shido! What's in here?

2
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,500
Is it a date?

3
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,750
Tell me!

4
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,208
[NARRATOR]
Upon Tohka's arrival

5
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,208
in this strange new world,

6
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,833
she was immediately
faced with a challenge.

7
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,000
She could choose
to fight against

8
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,541
the appetite of her
growing curiosity,

9
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,708
or feed it generously with love.

10
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:56,833
And today, Shido's wallet is
also feeling conflicted.

11
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,708
[FEMALE CLERK]
Thank you! Please come again!

12
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,083
[SHIDO]
Here you go.

13
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,083
Ooohhh...

14
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,666
Is this a test?
Am I about to fail?

15
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,416
Uh, no. It's for you.
Stop drooling.

16
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,625
Wow!

17
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,625
[TOHKA chewing]

18
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,791
Is this one of
those date things?

19
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,250
[SHIDO]
No, it's bread.

20
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,416
Okay.

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,125
Is that another name for "date"?

22
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,833
I don't understand how
something so delicious

23
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,083
can't be called a date.

24
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,250
You can call it
one if you want to.

25
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,583
Fascinating. Even though
this was delicious,

26
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,875
it's still not good enough
to be called a date.

27
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,750
And so the mystery continues.

28
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,166
There's one!

29
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,541
[SHIDO] Not quite!

30
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,666
All these persons.
Where'd they come from?

31
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,458
Is this war?

32
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,916
If that's the case,

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,833
I better attack before the
Mecha-Mecha Squad gets here.

34
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,500
No, wait! You don't
want to do that!

35
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,375
[TOHKA] Why are you stopping
me from saving us?

36
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,500
[SHIDO] I'm not!
There's nothing to save us from.

37
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,500
No one is trying to hurt us!

38
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,166
[BOY]
Look, Mama.

39
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,708
See? I threw it in
the trash all by myself!

40
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,333
[MOTHER] Wow!
What a good boy you are!

41
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,041
[TOHKA giggles]

42
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,333
[TOHKA] What about right now?
This moment? Is this a date?

43
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,791
[SHIDO] Not really.
But you're getting closer.

44
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,208
[TOHKA] Dates are
complicated matters.

45
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,791
Ah! Look! That thing
over there looks yummy!

46
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,416
How in the world are
you still hungry?

47
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,916
Am I cray or is that
Shido with a new girl?

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,416
Omigosh does that mean
he's cheating on Tonomachi?

49
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,958
That's so lame.

50
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,250
[ORIGAMI] That woman.
I know she's a Spirit.

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,500
But there's no spatial quake.

52
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,583
Sergeant Origami reporting.

53
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:17,000
A-0613. Need an observation
device immediately.

54
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,458
Outrageous!

55
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,625
I can't believe humans each
such amazingly delicious things!

56
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,666
Heh, heh. Oh hey, Tohka.

57
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,708
What happened after
you left yesterday?

58
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,375
Same thing as usual.

59
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,875
I swing my sword around some.
I blast the artillery.

60
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,041
In the end, my body disappeared
naturally like it always does.

61
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,416
[SHIDO]
Disappeared?

62
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,666
[TOHKA] Yes, I go to a world
different from this one.

63
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,250
It's a dark space.

64
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,541
Once I get there,
I just fall asleep.

65
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,083
So you mean, when you
wake up, you come here?

66
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,250
[TOHKA] Well, I don't
wake up on my own.

67
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,125
It's more like by force.

68
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,500
And it has nothing to
do with what I want.

69
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm just pulled here.
Usually, anyway.

70
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,625
[SHIDO] By force?

71
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,000
Then Spirits don't cause
spatial quakes on purpose.

72
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,291
They must just be accidents.

73
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,416
By "usually" you mean
today was different?

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,916
How would I know?

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Please tell me.

76
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,625
Look, that might
actually be the reason

77
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,208
there wasn't a
spatial quake today.

78
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,750
You're too persistent.

79
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,083
Besides, I have important things
to do, like find more food!

80
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,416
Tohka, come on. Wait!

81
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,083
I should've brought more money.

82
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:26,333
[RYOKO] It looks like
she's a 98.5 percent match.

83
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,625
That's way too high to be
a coincidence, of course.

84
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,416
But why is she here?

85
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,625
She isn't wearing her
Spirit armor right now.

86
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,666
If we want to attack,
this is it.

87
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,166
[RYOKO]
Think about where you are.

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,791
You know we can't
afford to be reckless.

89
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,041
[TOHKA] What kind
of place is this?

90
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,208
[SHIDO]
Uh, an expensive one.

91
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,500
I don't know what that means.

92
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,333
I'm going in.

93
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,458
No! Wait, hold on!

94
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,083
[TONOMACHI]
Well, if it isn't Shido!

95
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,000
[SHIDO]
Tonomachi?

96
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,125
[TONOMACHI]
Hmm...

97
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,583
What do we have here?

98
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,125
That's some hot action.

99
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,958
How did you manage to
pull that kind of tail

100
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,000
without me knowing
about it, huh?

101
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,416
I'm a little jealous.

102
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,375
Yeah, a lot has happened
lately, I guess.

103
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,125
[TONOMACHI] Whoa! And straight
off the top of the shelf!

104
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,458
It's cool, man.

105
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,875
My lady's got some pretty
expensive taste, too.

106
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:12,958
Check it out!

107
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,875
[SHIDO] Right.
His virtual girlfriend.

108
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,416
[TONOMACHI]
Listen, I want to help you.

109
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,125
Someone gave me these
tickets but I think they'll

110
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,958
impress your fancy new girlie
and help you score later.

111
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,250
You're welcome in advance!

112
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,833
Let me know how it goes.

113
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,666
See you later, bud!

114
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,625
[GIRL]
How are you today?

115
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,250
[SHIDO] Reine?
What? Wha--? How--?

116
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,833
What are you doing here?

117
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,208
Checking on Princess.

118
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,375
We have to make sure we're not

119
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,541
at risk of another
spatial quake.

120
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,833
She's been waiting for
you right over there.

121
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,208
Over here, Shido!

122
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,166
Why are you so late?

123
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,791
Sorry.

124
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,083
[GIRL] What's up, Kittens?
You ready to order?

125
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,291
Kotori?! What? Wh--

126
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,625
[clang]

127
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,625
Hmm... This looks so good;
but so does that one.

128
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,875
I wonder which of
these two is the date.

129
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,541
Hey, if you guys can't decide,
I have a suggestion for you.

130
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,750
The "How 'Bout This?"

131
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,708
[BOTH]
What does that one come with?

132
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,250
Whoa. Should be called
'What's With All This?'

133
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,791
Yum! Thank you!
It tastes so outrageous!

134
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,708
It must be a date!

135
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,541
What are you trying
to pull here, Kotori?

136
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,833
"Thank you,"
works, too.

137
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,458
We're pulling out all the
stops to help you score,

138
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,666
'cause I'm awesome.

139
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,875
But we also have some
business to discuss.

140
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,041
As soon as you guys leave,

141
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,708
I need you to head
south of the station.

142
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,708
But what for? That's
just a residential area.

143
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:39,333
Okay then!
I trust you've got this!

144
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,583
Now. Let's get
this date started.

145
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,333
[KANNAZUKI]
Checking AI analysis.

146
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,625
Use shop-type E-5963.

147
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,583
[MALE CREW MEMBER]
E-5963. Roger.

148
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,916
Open the main gate!

149
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,875
[TOHKA]
What's that?

150
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's eat it!
It looks so yummy!

151
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,333
[SHIDO]
No, you can't eat them!

152
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,250
Well, you can; but not those.

153
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,166
[TOHKA] Wow!
They even have red ones!

154
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,500
They're so fast!

155
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,208
[SHIDO] Yeah, the red ones
are three times as fast

156
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,625
as the others.

157
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,583
Don't know why they'd
be here, though.

158
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,958
Uh--

159
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,875
What the heck is all that?

160
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,416
[KAWAGOE]
Congratulations!

161
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:25,958
What is going on here?

162
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,666
You two are this
shopping arcade's

163
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,541
one hundred thousandth visitors!

164
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,083
So we have a special
gift for both of you.

165
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,125
Everything you eat here
today will be free!

166
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,166
[GROUP]
Congratulations!

167
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,166
Thanks, but I don't get it.

168
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,083
I've never seen
one of those before!

169
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,791
Hey, wait, Tohka!
Come back here!

170
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,791
[NAKATSUGAWA]
Nice work, Kawagoe.

171
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:45,875
[KANNAZUKI] All right.

172
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,416
Fried food team,
get ready for service.

173
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,000
Fish cake and shaved ice team,
approach customers.

174
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,458
Noodle team, why was
the delivery late?

175
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,041
Do you think we're
going to be okay?

176
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,708
Shin and Tohka are moving in.

177
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,416
Glad to see we're all ready
and prepared for action.

178
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,250
[REINE]
Speak for yourself.

179
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,833
[ORIGAMI]
The signal's jammed.

180
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,625
[RYOKO]
Origami, can you hear me?

181
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,375
I've managed to squeeze
mobilization orders

182
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,791
from the higher ups.

183
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,583
Meet us at point
one hundred and one.

184
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,083
[ORIGAMI]
Roger that.

185
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,041
[TOHKA] Yummy! I can't
get over this food!

186
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,458
What's that? It looks amazing!

187
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,291
Oh, so does this!

188
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,291
Gimmie!

189
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,666
[SHIDO]
Slow down! Don't rush.

190
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,041
Eat as much as you
want. It's free.

191
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,583
How the hell did this happen?

192
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,750
[TOHKA] Shido?

193
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,833
I'm having fun. Are you?

194
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,125
Huh?

195
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,541
This has been such a great day

196
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,500
and I'm having a
wonderful time here.

197
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,958
But I'm worried
I'm the only one.

198
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,750
You seem upset.
Are you mad at me?

199
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,166
No way! Of course
I'm not mad at you!

200
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,875
[TOHKA]
Are you sure?

201
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,125
I'm positive.

202
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,666
In fact I'm in a great mood!

203
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,583
I've just had a lot
on my mind is all.

204
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,458
Promise you're
having a good time?

205
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,583
Best time ever!

206
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,083
I really hope you're
telling the truth.

207
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,666
I am. I swear.

208
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,208
I'm glad we came here today.

209
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,250
[gasps]

210
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,250
There's so much food
we have to try!

211
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,416
Let's get the most we
can out of this date!

212
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,708
Yeah. Let's.

213
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,041
--Great, come on!
--'Kay!

214
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,458
[SHIDO] Wherever you need
me to go, I'll follow!

215
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,000
Congratulations, you two!

216
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,416
You won the grand prize!

217
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,458
Two tickets to Dream Park,
redeemable any time! Woo!

218
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,708
I don't know what that means!
But it sounds like fun!

219
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,083
[SHIIZAKI] It's the most
fun you'll ever have!

220
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,791
What's this?
You've never been?

221
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,125
That's unheard of, you've
got to take her right now!

222
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,166
[SHIDO]
Dream Park?

223
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,416
[CROWD] Hey! Wow!

224
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
[SHIDO] Whoa!

225
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,000
[TOHKA] Look how
beautiful this place is!

226
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,166
What an adventure!

227
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,041
What kind of things
can we do in here?

228
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,000
[SHIDO]
Well, I don't know.

229
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,416
Do it! Do it! Do it!

230
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,458
Hey, I have an idea!
Let's not go in there! 'Kay?

231
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,916
I don't agree.

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,750
You told me that we could
go wherever I wanted today.

233
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,291
Shido.

234
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,875
Do you think I'll learn what
a date is behind those doors?

235
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,916
Something tells me
that's very possible.

236
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,875
But I don't think it's
a good idea today.

237
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,833
--Besides, we're not legal.
--I'm not ready to go yet.

238
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,291
How am I supposed to learn

239
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,083
if you won't let me
experience these things?

240
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,500
[RYOKO]
Origami, where are you?

241
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,791
What's happening?
The time to meet has passed.

242
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,875
[ORIGAMI] Currently surveying
the movements of the target.

243
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,250
Send an emergency arming device

244
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,625
to point zero eighty-eight,
one hundred seven.

245
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,541
[KAWAGOE] I can't
believe I'm seeing this.

246
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,791
Why didn't he bring
her in to do the deed?

247
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,375
[KOTORI] This isn't the
first time you've failed

248
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,541
with that tactic, is it Kawagoe?

249
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,791
[SHIIZAKI] Fact established,
and acknowledged.

250
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,291
Classic Shido.

251
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,208
He always insists on doing
everything in a proper order.

252
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,291
What's that? Rain?

253
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,541
[REINE] Strange.

254
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,500
There weren't any rain
clouds in the vicinity.

255
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,583
[KOTORI] Oh, well.
Maybe it's for the best.

256
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,583
[gasps]

257
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,458
Where did you bring me?

258
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,041
Is this the secret base
of the Mecha-Mecha Squad?

259
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,208
[SHIDO]
Of course not. Don't worry.

260
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,583
[TOHKA] Why can't I get you,
you unruly chicken!

261
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,666
Shido! Tell this
thing to cooperate!

262
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,208
I told you. This
is a really tough one.

263
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,958
You have to
have a strategy,

264
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,000
and yelling through
the glass doesn't work.

265
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,250
Fine! Then how?

266
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,458
[SHIDO]
This one should be easy.

267
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,875
It's sticking up.

268
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,500
That's not the one I want.
I want the chicken.

269
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,916
Okay. Well, maybe there's
another one like it somewhere.

270
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,666
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

271
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,708
I can get you whichever
prize you want!

272
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,125
Come on! Pick one!

273
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,791
[SHIDO]
Maybe that one.

274
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,125
I've got it!

275
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,333
Listen closely. I'll
use this button over here.

276
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,708
You use the one on
your side there.

277
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,000
Let go when I give the signal.

278
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,541
It's worth a shot.

279
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,666
[SHIDO]
Wait for it. Wait for it.

280
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,333
Wait for it.

281
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,541
Now!

282
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,333
Let it go, Tohka!

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,958
Chicken!

284
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,291
Hold on! It still
hasn't dropped yet!

285
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,500
[SHIDO] I'm so sorry;
that was totally my fault.

286
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,708
I didn't give good instructions.

287
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,916
Drop the chicken!

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,458
Please drop it! Why
won't you listen to me?

289
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,500
Shido and I worked
so hard on this.

290
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,750
Drop it! Please!

291
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36,833
It's okay.

292
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,083
I'm begging you!
Drop it, you have to!

293
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,666
Please!

294
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,333
[chuckles]

295
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,250
[BOTH]
We did it!

296
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,333
[TOHKA] Question. What method
do those use to transform?

297
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,708
[SHIDO] Actually,
trains don't transform.

298
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,791
[TOHKA] What?
So they use fusion?

299
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,875
[SHIDO] Well, they do
connect to each other.

300
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,500
[TOHKA]
Oh, wow!

301
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,500
Thank you. I had
so much fun today.

302
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,583
[SHIDO] Good. Me too.
Thanks for coming.

303
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,083
[TOHKA] I am a
little disappointed

304
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,375
that we didn't get to
explore Dream Park.

305
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,250
[SHIDO] Oh, it's
totally overrated!

306
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,583
[TOHKA]
If you say so. But Shido?

307
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,750
The day is almost over and
I still didn't see a date.

308
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,750
Can you tell me
what one is like?

309
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,500
[SHIDO] A date is just
when a girl and a boy

310
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,625
go out and have a
good time together.

311
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,375
You can't actually see one.

312
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,958
[TOHKA]
Oh, that makes sense!

313
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,375
Well in that case, I would say
we had a wonderful date today!

314
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,791
[SHIDO]
Uh, sure.

315
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,541
[TOHKA]
I like dates. They're nice.

316
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,208
Not good. I can't
believe I'm seeing this.

317
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,333
A Spirit shows up
without a spatial quake

318
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,458
and then connects
with a human boy.

319
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,875
Permission to shoot, Miss?

320
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,416
[RYOKO] Not yet. Still
waiting to hear from the top.

321
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,916
This is a very
unusual situation.

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,208
No one's been evacuated.
We'll just have to wait and see.

323
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,958
Point Alpha here.

324
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,708
What happened?

325
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,375
What?

326
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,166
We've got permission to shoot?

327
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,833
[TOHKA] All the humans
were very kind today.

328
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,916
[SHIDO] No one tried
to kill you, did they?

329
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,833
I knew you'd be okay.

330
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,208
[TOHKA]
Yeah. You're right.

331
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,583
I never knew the
world was so kind,

332
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:29,000
so much fun, and so beautiful.

333
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,958
I love it here.

334
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:35,500
And now, I understand why the
Mecha-Mecha Squad is after me.

335
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,458
Because whenever I
appear in this world,

336
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,916
something bad happens.

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I ruin something beautiful.
I ruin your world.

338
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,750
[SHIDO]
That's not true.

339
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,666
So listen, I've been thinking

340
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,250
and it's better if I
don't exist anymore.

341
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,500
[SHIDO]
Don't say that!

342
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,708
We're fine!

343
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,500
There was no spatial
quake today, was there?

344
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,458
You didn't ruin anything!

345
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,375
[TOHKA]
Yes, but that doesn't mean

346
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,000
there won't be one
the next time I appear.

347
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,958
Once I go back and fall asleep,

348
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,000
I won't be able
to control myself.

349
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,125
[SHIDO] Fine! Then I guess
you just can't go back!

350
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,208
--Huh?
--Have you ever even tried?

351
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,458
Just once. Just
try staying here!

352
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,875
[TOHKA] Even if I did,
there are so many things

353
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,291
I don't know about this world.

354
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,041
[SHIDO] I'll teach you
whatever you don't know!

355
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,791
[TOHKA] Then I'd need food
and a place to sleep.

356
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,916
What if something happens
we're not prepared for?

357
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,583
[SHIDO] I'm going
to take care of you!

358
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,541
If something comes up
that we need to deal with,

359
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,000
we'll deal with it.

360
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,333
[TOHKA]
Are you sure?

361
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,583
Am I even allowed to be here?

362
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,875
Is it okay for me to be
alive in this world?

363
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,041
[SHIDO]
Yes! It is!

364
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,666
[TOHKA] You're the only one
who would say that to me.

365
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,958
Humans like the
Mecha-Mecha Squad,

366
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,625
they don't want to risk it.

367
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,166
They don't want something
as dangerous as me nearby.

368
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,666
[SHIDO]
I don't care about them!

369
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,916
Even if everyone
else rejects you,

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,166
it doesn't change the
fact that I accept you

371
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,875
and I don't want you to leave!

372
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,291
Take my hand.

373
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,208
That's the only job
you have right now.

374
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,708
[RYOKO] Distance:
Five hundred twelve, fifteen.

375
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,583
Wind direction:
Forty-point-eight.

376
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,541
Wind speed: zero-point-four.

377
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,458
Temperature:
twenty-four degrees,

378
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,833
RH: fifty-two point eight.
We're all clear.

379
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:16,458
[gunshot]

380
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,291
[SHIDO] Tohka!

381
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,041
[TOHKA yells]

382
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,708
What are you doing?

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,625
[thud]

384
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,208
[RYOKO]
Origami? Origami, come in!

385
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,041
Origami?

386
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,250
Shido.

387
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,833
I thought maybe if you were
here for me it would be okay.

388
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:07,333
Might be hard, but I'd be able
to do it with you by my side.

389
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,833
I can get through anything
when I'm with you.

390
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,208
But it doesn't matter.

391
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,500
It's no use!
You're gone now!

392
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,125
I'm on my own.

393
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,750
This world has rejected me!

394
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,541
Adonai Merek!

395
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,458
Sandalphon!

396
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,541
Halvanhelv!

397
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,041
How dare you!

398
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,291
How dare you reject me!

399
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,833
[RYOKO] No way.

400
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,000
Origami, retreat immediately!

401
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,958
Support troops, where are you?

402
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,500
Origami? Do you read me?

403
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,166
So it was you.

404
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,791
You're the one who did it.
You killed my only friend.

405
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,541
And with him, my soul.
Just admit it.

406
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,333
[ORIGAMI] Yes.
I killed Shido Itsuka.

407
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,708
[TOHKA] Kill her.

408
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,041
She must pay for
what she's done.

409
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,083
She must die.

410
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,083
[SHIIZAKI] It doesn't look
like a pulse or heart rate

411
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,500
is registering for Shido.

412
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,708
[NAKATSUGAWA] The spatial
quake alarm is going off.

413
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,208
This can't be good.

414
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,625
[MIKIMOTO] Resident evacuation
is still at seven percent.

415
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,958
[KOTORI] We're lucky there
aren't many houses nearby,

416
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,458
but at this rate, the whole town

417
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,500
will be decimated
within minutes.

418
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,166
If she were a knight, she would
have earned a passing grade,

419
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,416
but if she gets herself
killed as a princess,

420
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
then she's obviously not
worth our concern. Hm?

421
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,625
[KAWAGOE] Excuse me, Commander.
What have we heard about Shido?

422
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,708
[KOTORI] Oh, I wouldn't
worry too much about him.

423
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,125
My brother won't be finished
off by something like that.

424
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,333
[GROUP] Huh?

425
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,875
There it is.

426
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,125
[SHIDO] Hot! Hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

427
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,333
Huh?

428
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,750
Where am I?

429
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,708
[MINOWA] Commander,
what-- What do we do now?

430
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,166
[KOTORI]
I already told you.

431
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,958
Even if Shido dies, he'll be
able to start a new game.

432
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,875
So what the heck are
you dragging ass for?

433
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,708
Get down there and
recover him immediately.

434
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,625
No one else is able to stop her.

435
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,291
It has to be him.

436
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,916
That's right. With the method
we decided to save for last.

437
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,791
[ORIGAMI] I did it.

438
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,791
I killed someone.

439
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:16,041
[TOHKA screams]

440
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,250
[ORIGAMI]
I'm like them. The Spirits.

441
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,666
We're the same.

442
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,000
[TOHKA screams]

443
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,458
[ORIGAMI yells]

444
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,666
We must end this.

445
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,375
[ORIGAMI]
Dad? Mom?

446
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,583
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,666
Shido. I promise to avenge you.

448
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,833
[SHIDO screams]

449
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,833
What? He's alive!

450
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,375
Shido? Is it really you?

451
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,708
Yeah. Yeah, I think it is!

452
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:03,791
Thank you!

453
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,833
Thank you for coming back!

454
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,208
Don't cry.
Everything's okay now.

455
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,333
Tohka! What the heck is that?

456
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,708
[TOHKA] I accidentally
unsheathed Halvanhelv.

457
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,458
I have to find
somewhere to release it!

458
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,666
[SHIDO] No! Hold on!
You definitely can't do that!

459
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,250
[TOHKA]
Then what should I do?

460
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,000
It's already reached
its critical state!

461
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,500
[KOTORI]
Shido, can you hear me?

462
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,333
Now is the time to use that
method I taught you earlier.

463
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,000
It's the only way you'll
be able to save her.

464
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,250
All right, Tohka, listen to me.

465
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,458
--We have to kiss now, okay?
--We what?

466
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,000
Uh, never mind.
Forget it, I'm sorry.

467
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,083
There has to be another way.

468
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,041
No, I just don't
know what a kiss is.

469
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,833
--Huh?
--Teach me and I'll do it!

470
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:46,458
Um, 'kay. It's where we put
our lips together and then we--

471
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,208
I'm so sorry!

472
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,583
They told me this was the
only way I could reverse it!

473
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,458
Just don't let me go.

474
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,625
I'm not ready for you
to see me naked yet.

475
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,375
Shido?

476
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,958
[SHIDO] Uh huh?

477
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:25,458
[TOHKA] Will you um-- take me
out on another date sometime?

478
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,916
Of course.
Any time you want to.

479
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:10,791
Kids? I'd like to introduce
you to our new transfer student!

480
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,416
[TOHKA]
I'm Tohka Yatogami.

481
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,958
I'm so excited to
meet all of you!
