1
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,833
[MANA] That was
pretty close, Shido.

2
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,083
Are you okay?

3
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,083
[SHIDO] Mana? I--

4
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,583
Right.

5
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,708
This is probably a
little shocking, huh?

6
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,125
[KURUMI] Excuse me.

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,083
But we were in the
middle of a lovely date,

8
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,333
and I find it terribly rude of
you to interrupt us like this.

9
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,041
Gimmie just a
minute, big brother.

10
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,000
This won't take very long.

11
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,625
Kurumi!

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,291
[SHIDO] Stop it! Don't kill her!

13
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:13,125
I knew it. You really
are good, Shido.

14
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,208
Mana. Why?

15
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,083
[SHIDO] How can you stand
there like nothing happened?

16
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,916
You just killed a person.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,166
[MANA] I just killed a Spirit.

18
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:31,166
Besides, I do this all the time.

19
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,333
[NARRATOR] "It" is something
all things are given.

20
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,750
It cannot be bought,
and it cannot be sold.

21
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:47,750
People often waste it, hold
it dear, and chase after it.

22
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,000
If only we knew what "it" was.

23
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,500
[MANA] It seems you've
already heard a few things

24
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,416
from Master Sergeant Tobiichi.

25
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, you should
probably pretend

26
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,416
this was all a bad dream.

27
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,708
Just forget it ever happened.

28
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,833
How could I forget it?

29
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,708
She won't stay dead.

30
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:30,416
Kurumi Tokisaki, or
"Nightmare" is a special Spirit.

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,916
No matter how many
times she's killed,

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,916
or how she's killed,
this Spirit appears again

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,625
and kills more people,

34
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,041
as if she's on a
mission for murder.

35
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,250
So, I kill her
over and over again.

36
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,583
And I will continue to kill her.

37
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,750
Over and over and over--.

38
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,000
[SHIDO] Will you shut up!

39
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,625
Please, don't tell me
you're used to killing.

40
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,166
I don't want to hear
you talk like that.

41
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,750
[MANA] This job is one
that can only be done by me.

42
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,083
[SHIDO] Mana, wait!

43
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,791
Damn it!

44
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,416
[cat meows]

45
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,000
Mana. Why?

46
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,708
I don't know. Why?

47
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,583
[KOTORI]
The plan's been aborted.

48
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,500
We'll pick you up with Fraxinus.

49
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,666
Shido, can you hear me?

50
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,750
[TOHKA] Shido!

51
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,791
What happened?

52
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,791
We've been looking for you.

53
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,916
Spill it.
What's going on?

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,333
[TOHKA] Oh no, you've been hurt!

55
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,791
I'm so sorry.
Did I make it worse?

56
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,958
No. Uh-- Sorry.

57
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,750
[TOHKA and ORIGAMI]
Shido!

58
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,416
[SHIDO] Hey.

59
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,083
Hey. Is your arm
feeling any better?

60
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,250
[SHIDO] Yeah.

61
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,583
Good. We can go, then!

62
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,916
Wait, go where exactly?

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,333
[TOHKA] We're
continuing our date, silly.

64
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,041
[TOHKA] Can I have
some bread, please?

65
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,958
Corn dogs! Steamed
pork buns! Here.

66
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,583
Thanks. That was sweet.

67
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,625
Come on, let's go!

68
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,916
Hold on!

69
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,541
Tohka. I don't have
much money on me.

70
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,083
Don't worry about money.

71
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,666
Reine let me borrow
her magic buy things card!

72
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,375
You mean credit card?

73
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,000
[TOHKA] She also
told me about you.

74
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,041
And Kurumi and Mana.

75
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,416
[SHIDO] I see.

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,333
Then, you know
I have to stop Kurumi

77
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,208
from killing more people.

78
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,458
[TOHKA] Yeah.

79
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,833
[SHIDO] I'm just-- I'm not sure

80
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,416
how I should go
about it with her.

81
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,625
I mean, Kurumi's a Spirit,

82
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,416
but she's different
from you or Yoshino.

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,083
Now that isn't true
at all, and you know it.

84
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:05,125
Kurumi and I are
the same. We are.

85
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,250
Remember that I
had you here for me.

86
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,875
You saved me.

87
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,250
I didn't even know
I needed you, but I did.

88
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,333
Then, you asked me out
on a date, like today,

89
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,708
and showed me how amazing

90
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,666
and beautiful this
world really is.

91
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,708
If it weren't
for you, Shido,

92
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,208
I most likely would have
ended up just like Kurumi.

93
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,625
There's only one difference
between the two of us.

94
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,166
And that--

95
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,041
--is having someone close
who's reaching out his hand.

96
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,750
Tohka. Thank you.

97
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,083
You've helped me
realize what's important.

98
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,083
Yeah?

99
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,541
Does that mean
you aren't scared?

100
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,083
No, not quite.

101
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,166
Don't worry.

102
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,833
I'll be here to protect you.

103
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,625
Well, thanks, that
makes me feel better.

104
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,208
I know, right?

105
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:00,583
Shido, can we stay like
this for a while longer?

106
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:01,916
[SHIDO] Sure.

107
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,333
[KURUMI] Well,
good morning, Shido.

108
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,083
How are you today?

109
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,250
I'm fine.

110
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,541
You are so dead, dude.

111
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,416
How dare you show
your face around here!

112
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,041
That is, I dunno, lame!

113
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,708
[TOHKA] Hold it!
Please, leave Shido alone.

114
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,708
Let's just go this way.

115
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,000
[KURUMI] I have to admit,
I'm a little surprised.

116
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,416
I thought for sure you wouldn't
want to come to school today,

117
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,708
you know, after all
that crazy drama.

118
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,708
[SHIDO] Kurumi.

119
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,750
That's me.

120
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,541
So you know,
I've made the decision

121
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,708
that I need to save you.

122
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,375
Well, that's kind of
a strange thing to say.

123
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,250
I will not let you
kill anyone else.

124
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,083
I will also not
let Mana kill you.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,041
How very big of you.

126
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,791
Little Shido.

127
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,833
I've made the decision
I need to test you

128
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,500
and see if you're really
telling me the truth.

129
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,041
[MANA] Ratatoskr, huh?

130
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,541
I can't believe you
and my big brother

131
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,291
are a part of that
twisted organization.

132
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,875
I'm surprised you
found that out.

133
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,000
Now, what do you want?

134
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,875
It's about Shido.

135
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,250
You're negligent, at best.

136
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,333
How could you send him unarmed

137
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,750
to go meet with
dangerous Spirits?

138
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,166
You're a failure
as a little sister.

139
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,750
So I'm going to take over
that role from now on.

140
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,583
Oh, you have
gotta be kidding me.

141
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,791
And let a corrupt company

142
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,875
like Deus Ex Machina
get their hands on him?

143
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,583
I don't think so, Mana.

144
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,791
How did you know?

145
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,916
You should stop
underestimating me.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,833
I know that except
for Ratatoskr,

147
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,833
your little group supplies
all the military forces

148
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,291
around the world with Realizers.

149
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,750
And you, you're one
of their employees

150
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,208
who was sent to the AST.

151
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:24,166
[bell rings]

152
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,666
[sighs]

153
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,625
Here goes!

154
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,583
[REINE] Kurumi has not been seen
leaving the school as of yet.

155
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,750
Still though, our real
problem is whether or not

156
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,750
she'll listen to
what we have to say.

157
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,500
Hey, where's Kotori?

158
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,250
Something just came up.

159
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,500
She'll be back soon,

160
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,416
but this time I'll have
to be your Navigator.

161
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,416
Okay, got it.
Let's do this.

162
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,916
[SHIDO] What happened? Reine!

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,166
We're analyzing right now.

164
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,250
I'm not going to stand here

165
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,000
and listen to you
call us corrupt.

166
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,958
You know nothing about DEM.

167
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,416
That place gave me a reason to
live after I lost my memory.

168
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,250
I can't thank them
enough for their help.

169
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,166
Really?

170
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,708
Even after what
they did to you?

171
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,041
What are you
talking about?

172
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,000
I've discovered
something terrible

173
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,000
from Mana Takamiya's cup.

174
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,833
What they've
done is wrong.

175
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,666
Her body has been implanted
with far too much magical power.

176
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,833
Sadly, she's not likely to
live more than ten years.

177
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,041
You don't know?

178
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,500
They haven't told you?

179
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,416
[cell phone rings]

180
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,833
It's Kotori.
What's up?

181
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,041
[KANNAZUKI] Commander,
there's an intense

182
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,000
Spirit wave reaction
at Shido's High School.

183
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,833
It's coming from
Kurumi Tokisaki.

184
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,291
[KOTORI] Understood.

185
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,708
[REINE] It's a
wide area barrier.

186
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,916
The kind of barrier meant

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,166
to debilitate everyone
within its range.

188
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,916
She did this. But why?

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,125
[TOHKA] Hey, Shido.

190
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,583
[SHIDO] Tohka!
Are you all right?

191
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,541
Well, my body feels
heavy for some reason.

192
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,833
Why am I the only one
who's not affected?

193
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,125
[REINE] Since you've
sealed the powers

194
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,333
of both Tohka and Yoshino,

195
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,208
it's like you've received
their divine protection.

196
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,875
Given these conditions,

197
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,583
you're the only one
who can move normally.

198
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,125
[KURUMI] Shido, darling.
Can you hear me?

199
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,666
If you need anything at all,

200
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,791
feel free to join
me on the roof.

201
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,250
Something tells
me you might want

202
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,916
to get here as soon
as possible, though.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,125
[KURUMI laughs]

204
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,250
Listen to me.
Stay right here, okay?

205
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,291
And don't worry!
I'm going to save her!

206
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,208
Be careful, Shido!

[KURUMI] Welcome, Shido.

00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,708
I'm glad you were so
eager to come see me.

211
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,000
[RYOKO] I'm showing you're
using the emergency uniform.

212
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,291
What's going on?

[ORIGAMI] Dangerous

Hello, Origami.

00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,958
You seem like you're in a rush.

Where might you be off to?

[ORIGAMI] I'm here to
protect Shido from you.

218
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,041
No, that doesn't
work for me.

219
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,875
Terribly sorry, but you'll
have to stay right here.

220
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,666
Oh, Shido. Don't go.

221
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:48,000
It's not safe to go
up there alone. Shido!

222
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,208
Come on. Get up. Move!

223
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,625
There you go, Tohka.
I can do it!

224
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,291
[gunshot]

225
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,708
Hey! Who did that?

226
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,750
Kurumi?

227
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,458
Good morning, Tohka.
Going anywhere?

228
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,625
Kurumi. What is
all of this about?

229
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:22,333
Isn't it pretty?
My Time-Eating Castle?

230
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,041
This barrier sucks up the time

231
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,708
from anyone who
steps on my shadow.

232
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,125
The time?
Your eye's a clock.

233
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,166
That's right;

234
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,916
what you're looking
at is my time.

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,125
Lovely thing.

236
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,625
I suppose you could
call it my life span.

237
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,916
My Angel has such
a wonderful power,

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,458
but unfortunately, it
does have that nasty habit

239
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,375
of eating up my time
whenever I use it.

240
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,000
So, I have to replenish it

241
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,791
with other peoples' time
every once in a while.

242
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,208
What?
Other peoples' time?

243
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,416
[KURUMI] Everyone is
my pitiful, adorable prey.

244
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,333
But you, you're
special, Shido,

245
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:03,666
and you don't even
realize it. Guess what.

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,750
You're the reason I'm here.

247
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,875
I came all this way just
so I could become one

248
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,541
with you in person
and see the look

249
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,375
on your face when I eat you.

250
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,250
Okay, fine.
I'm the one you want.

251
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,958
So don't hurt everyone else!

252
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,541
I'll think about
that option,

253
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,083
but first, I want
you to take back

254
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,750
what you said this morning.

255
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:26,083
Obviously, you're not going
to "save" me now, are you?

256
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,291
Come on, Shido.

257
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,833
Don't you think
I'm downright awful

258
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,750
to cause all this pain
for such a silly reason?

259
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,416
You can say it.

260
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,833
You hate me,
and it's clear to you

261
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,583
that I'm not someone
who deserves mercy.

262
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,125
I will eat you,
but first I'm giving you

263
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,958
the chance to take
your words back.

264

Do that, darling,
and I'll reward you

265
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,083

so those people won't die.

Better make your
decision quickly,

270
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,166
or there will be nothing
left for you to save.

00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,083
Take down the
barrier, Kurumi.

Do it. But I will
not give up on you.

you so stubborn?

what that sound means,

I possibly be doing?

If a spatial

It's seems almost as if

you're not gonna
follow through with it.

Damn it. That was
incredibly stupid!

I'm not as stupid
as you think,

because now I know I have
worth to you as a hostage.

If you could go ahead and stop

that'd be great.

320
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:12,958
I know it.

321
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,208
If that wasn't an option,

322
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,333
you wouldn't have had
so much fun on our date.

323
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,916
You're wrong.
It's too late.

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,625
It's not too late.
I can help you!

325
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, you'll have to live

326
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,833
with what you've done
for the rest of your life.

327
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,666
But still, Kurumi, it doesn't
matter how terrible you've been.

328
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,750
Nothing will ever give me
a reason not to save you.

329
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,041
What? I--
I don't know.

330
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,166
Why are you so kind?

331
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,000
Am I worth it? Can I--

332
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,291
[squelching sounds]

333
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,583
[KURUMI B] It doesn't
really work for us

334
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,916
to have you fall for his
pretty words, you know.

335
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,875
[SHIDO gasps]

336
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,375
I-- Thank you
so much, Shido.

337
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,083
[KURUMI B] Well, that's that.

338
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,541
Why don't you go
take a rest now?

339
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,000
[KURUMI B] Goodness, me!

340
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,875
[SHIDO] What? Kurumi? But how?

341
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,291
[KURUMI B] It seems
the me I chose

342
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,041
for this endeavor might have
been a little too young.

343
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:21,500
Now, why don't we put a stop
to this tediousness, already?

344
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,541
[SHIDO] Mana!

345
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,291
Hi. Are you ever not
in trouble, big brother?

346
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,833
[KURUMI B laughs]

347
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,500
[KURUMI B]
Right on time, like usual.

348
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,333
You've always had
the strange ability

349
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,833
to cut my Spirit
armor so easily.

350
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,833
This time, though.

351
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,916
Things have changed,
so you might as well accept

352
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,166
that I won't die
and you won't live.

353
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,708
Hear me, Zaphkiel.
Come to me, now!

354
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,333
Daletto!

355
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,833
Your talent for
healing is impressive.

356
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,958
[KURUMI B laughs]

357
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,791
I'm not healing
in the least.

358
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,416
I'm simply turning
back the clock.

359
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,708
Come. Fight.
Let the fun begin!

360
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,041
Sure, bring it on!

361
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,458
I'll just kill you
like a normally do.

362
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,291
[laughs]

363
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,750
[KURUMI B] You still
don't get it, do you?

364
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,750
Try as much as you like,

365
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,166
but there's no way
you'll ever be able

366
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
to get rid of me completely!

367
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,333
We'll see about that.
Get ready to die!

368
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,708
[KURUMI B] Aleph!

369
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,708
[SHIDO] Mana!

370
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:43,291
[MANA] Ahh!

371
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,875
Zayin!

372
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,875
But how?

373
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,708
Mana, no!

374
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,875
[gunshots]

375
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,458
[SHIDO] Kurumi?

376
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,833
She's alive!

377
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,916
[MANA] Please,
don't come any closer.

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,541
[TOHKA and ORIGAMI]
Shido!

379
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,875
[SHIDO] You're here!

380
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,500
Oh, how sweet. Looks
like everyone made it!

381
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,708
Kurumi.

382
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,500
You're gonna pay for
what you're doing here!

383
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,958
You can't run from us.

384
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,083
Wow; I'm positively terrified.

385
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:19,500
To attack poor little Kurumi
with so many people all at once.

386
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,000
Lucky for me, though.

387
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,333
I'm playing for keeps today.

388
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,833
[KURUMI B]
Isn't that right, ladies?

389
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,958
[SHIDO] What the
hell is all this?

390
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,916
[KURUMI B] This is
my past, my dear Shido.

391
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,333
My history. They're
beautiful, aren't they?

392
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:44,708
Now do you understand why
I can never fully be killed?

393
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,416
Where did they
all come from?

394
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,583
Time. Now, we need
to finish this.

395
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,833
[KURUMI B laughs]

396
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,250
[KURUMI B] After you're
gone, I can be free.

397
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,791
There you go.

398
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,916
You should really stop getting
your hopes up for me, Shido.

399
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I've taken some precautions

400
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,958
to make sure you
can't seduce me again.

401
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:05,666
[alarm sounds]

402
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,041
[SHIDO] No! You can't!

403
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,666
Prepare to be surrounded
by so much death,

404
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,750
the last thing you'll
want to save is me.

405
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,125
Please, no!

406
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:24,625
[KURUMI B laughs maniacally]

407
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,041
What is the
meaning of this?

408
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,583
You mean you didn't know?

409
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,000
Surprise, surprise.

410
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,458
Spatial quakes
can be neutralized

411
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,000
if they run into a tremor
of equal force at the onset.

412
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,875
[ORIGAMI] It's her.

413
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,708
What? Sis?

414
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,666
Don't let me forget to give
this back to you, Shido.

415
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,083
Burn, Camael!

416
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,791
Bro. What do you say?

417
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,958
Are you about ready
to begin our date?
