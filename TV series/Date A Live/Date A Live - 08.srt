1
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:33,916
[school bell]

2
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,625
Tomorrow, as in
like tomorrow?

3
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,333
Tomorrow! If you
have time, of course.

4
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,250
I thought I could
show you around town.

5
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,916
That sounds fun.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Wait, are you asking
me out on a date?

7
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,833
Uh. I guess
you can say that.

8
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,291
Whaddya say?

9
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,833
All right. I'll go
on a date with you.

10
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,083
That's awesome.
Is ten-thirty okay?

11
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,916
We can meet by
the station gates.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,750
I'll see you there.
Looking forward to it.

13
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:11,416
Mana Takamiya supposedly
killed Kurumi Tokisaki.

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,250
We don't know why
she's still alive.

15
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,083
[KOTORI] Well, as long
as she is still alive,

16
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,250
we're sticking with the plan.

17
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,083
Tomorrow is a holiday,
so there's no school.

18
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,583
Shido, we need you to
ask Kurumi on a date.

19
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,875
What? Even after what
already happened?

20
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,958
It's because of what
already happened!

21
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,583
There's no guarantee
that she'll be revived

22
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,333
if she gets killed again.

23
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,500
And let's not forget
about Origami Tobiichi.

24
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,625
She will have told the AST.

25
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,041
So they'll know that
Kurumi didn't die,

26
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,708
which means Mana knows, as well.

27
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,000
Alright, then.
I understand.

28
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,750
I'll get her to fall
for me. I swear it.

29
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,125
You swear what, exactly?

30
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,625
[NARRATOR] Dating
everyone at the same time.

31
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,583
It should be paradise.

32
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,916
This girl, that girl,

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,208
and the girl over
there could be yours.

34
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:12,041
Unfortunately, life doesn't
always go the way we want.

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,041
[ORIGAMI] I'm going
to ask you one more time.

36
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,708
You're swearing what
with Kurumi Tokisaki?

37
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,083
[SHIDO] Uh, nothing.

38
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,333
I don't know what you mean.

39
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,458
[ORIGAMI] Just answer.

40
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,500
Trust me. This
is very important.

41
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,541
[SHIDO] Yeah, um, sorry.
Gotta go; Tohka's waiting.

42
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,958
I'll see ya later!

43
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,416
Oh, Origami.

44
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,291
I must say,
you look delicious, too.

45
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,833
[KURUMI] Yes, very delicious.

46
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,958
[KURUMI] But I think
I might save you for later.

47
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,250
Instead, I'll devour you
once I'm finished with Shido.

48
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,125
Oh, Shido.

49
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,291
[SHIDO] I'm sorry
about lunch, Tohka.

50
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,750
But you got a
chance to eat, right?

51
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,291
Yeah. I got to eat.

52
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,958
[TOHKA] Where is he?

53
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,250
Boo, we only won two

54
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,125
of these tickets
instead of three.

55
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,041
Wanna split the
cost of one more?

56
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,708
Oh. Hey, it's Tohka.

57
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,375
Why haven't
you eaten lunch yet?

58
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,083
Oh, no; what's wrong?

59
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,541
Tell us everything!
Who did what?

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,208
Shido isn't here.

61
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,250
And then I started
thinking about how--

62
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,583
Well, I started
thinking about how

63
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,166
we haven't really talked
that much today.

64
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,500
And then I uh--For some reason.

65
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,583
I just got sad.

66
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,250
Girl, you do not have
to say another word.

67
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,375
Shido's a jerk!

68
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,833
And he's taking you for granted!

69
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,125
That is just so lame!

70
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,333
No, really; he didn't
do anything wrong.

71
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,291
No, no, of course not.

72
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,333
But still, you don't
have to be sad,

73
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,958
and we can help!

74
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,291
[SHIDO] We've got
some time before dinner.

75
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,458
Don't you wanna go home first?

76
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,125
Hey, Tohka?
Are you okay?

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,958
Huh?

78
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,166
[SHIDO] What?

79
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,458
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait,

80
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,833
hold on a second!

81
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,500
I am very confused!

82
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,666
Okay. What's going on?

83
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,750
[TOHKA] Shoot,
this isn't working.

84
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,875
[TOHKA] What's next?

85
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,250
[TOHKA] Shido.
I have a question for you.

86
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,833
[SHIDO] Yeah?

87
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,250
[TOHKA] Tomorrow.

88
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,666
Will you go on a
date with me, please?

89
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,791
What? A date, huh?

90
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,375
[TOHKA] Pretty please?

91
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,500
[SHIDO] Yeah. Sure thing.

92
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,583
How wonderful!

93
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,041
Those girls were
right about everything!

94
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:45,791
Now, then.

95
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:46,958
Meet me by the statue

96
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,500
in front of the
station at ten a.m.!

97
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,416
And don't forget!

98
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,333
[SHIDO] What's this?

99
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:59,208
[phone buzz]

100
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,041
It's Origami.

101
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,875
Hey there, Origami.
What's up? Are you okay?

102
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,083
[ORIGAMI] I'm fine,

103
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,708
but you shouldn't be
left alone right now.

104
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,750
I will be waiting for
you at the fountain in front

105
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,375
of the station tomorrow
at exactly eleven a.m.

106
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,291
Wait! But I--

107
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,541
[ORIGAMI] Be there.

108
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,583
[SHIDO] Crap!

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,541
[KOTORI] Test, test.
Can you hear me?

110
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,125
I can't believe
you're triple booked

111
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,958
on such an unbelievably
important day!

112
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,791
You dirty little dog.

113
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,166
Hey, don't be mean.

114
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,208
Remember, you're the one
who kept me from cancelling.

115
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,041
[KOTORI] If you don't keep
promises you make to Tohka,

116
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,125
her happiness
meter will go down.

117
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,500
And if you cancel with Origami,

118
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,458
she'll be even more suspicious
than she already is.

119
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,333
Stop worrying.
You're not by yourself.

120
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,583
We'll be supporting you

121
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,791
with everything we've got.

122
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,208
All you have to do
is follow the schedule

123
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,500
and go with the flow.

124
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,208
Commander.
The plan will commence shortly.

125
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,500
Countdown is
beginning now.

126
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,166
[SHIDO] First I'm going to
the aquarium with Tohka, right?

127
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,958
I know you
can do it, Shido!

128
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,833
It's dangerous
so don't get hurt!

129
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,125
[SHIDO] Right.

130
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,916
[KOTORI] Now, let's
start our date, shall we?

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,958
[SHIIZAKI] The date has begun.

132
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,541
[TOHKA] Shido!

133
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,708
Great. She's here.

134
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,458
I chose her outfit.
Not too bad, huh?

135
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,625
You all right?

136
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,583
Those clothes, they um--
They look really cute.

137
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,958
[TOHKA] Who cares
about stupid clothes?

138
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,250
Can we just go now?

139
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,166
Sure. But do you even
know where we're going?

140
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,541
[KOTORI] Not the best start,
but it could've been worse.

141
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,791
[MINOWA] Commander, look.

142
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,291
[KOTORI] It's Origami.

143
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,583
I thought she wasn't supposed
to get here until eleven.

144
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,708
[REINE] Apparently,
she's impatient.

145
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,166
[TOHKA] So I've been wondering,
what is this aquarium thing?

146
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,708
Wait, you don't know?

147
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,666
Why'd you want to come here
if you didn't know what it was?

148
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,333
Don't get
the wrong idea.

149
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,291
I just wanted to go
out on a date with you.

150
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,291
It didn't matter what it was.

151
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,000
An aquarium's a place
that has lots of fish

152
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,708
and stuff that lives in water.

153
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,708
Really?

154
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,666
Do you think they'll
have fried fish?

155
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,458
No.

156
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,541
What about boiled fish?

157
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,541
Or poached fish?
Or steamed fish?

158
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,458
The only thing you ever
think about is food!

159
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,916
[SHIDO] You'll know
it when you see it.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,666
[NAKATSUGAWA]
The main target has appeared.

161
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,750
[KOTORI] Well, at least this
one's just ten minutes early.

162
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,541
[TOHKA] I can't believe
this place is real!

163
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,000
[SHIDO] Try to use
your inside voice.

164
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,750
[TOHKA] Right. Sorry.

165
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:32,416
I can't help myself.
This is the neatest thing ever.

166
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,916
[TOHKA] Those are really
real fish out there?

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,791
[SHIDO] Yeah.
More than just fish.

168
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,416
[TOHKA] Wow.
It's all so beautiful.

169
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,416
Come with me!
I wanna go see the rest!

170
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,625
[KOTORI] Hey, Shido.

171
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,458
It's almost time for you
to meet with Kurumi.

172
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,666
[SHIDO] What? Already?

173
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,958
[KOTORI] We'll pick
you up using Fraxinus,

174
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,166
so go outside and find somewhere

175
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,708
with no one around.

176
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,500
Are you coming?
'Cuz you haven't moved a bit.

177
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,416
Ow! Oh, ow, ow!

178
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,333
Oh no! What's
wrong with you?

179
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,375
It's nothing.
Only my stomach.

180
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,791
I'm gonna head
to the bathroom,

181
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,541
keep looking at
the fish for a while.

182
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,625
What? But are you
going to be okay?

183
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,125
I need to find a place
where no one's around!

184
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,375
[KOTORI] Retrieval.

185
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,208
[KOTORI] Move him to the gates
in front of the station, now!

186
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,875
Hold on, already?

187
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,458
[SHIDO] Sorry I'm late.

188
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,833
[KURUMI] Don't worry.

189
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,583
I actually only got here
around a minute ago, myself.

190
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,208
So, where
shall we go first?

191
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,458
[SHIDO] Let me think.

192
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,333
[KOTORI] This is where
the real game begins.

193
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,000
Alright everyone!
Make your selections.

194
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,416
I think it should
be number two.

195
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,333
And then their hands can touch
during a romantic movie moment.

196
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,708
That would be so sweet.

197
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,500
Option one is the
obvious choice.

198
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,541
All girls' love shopping,

199
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,375
so he really can't go wrong.

200
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,916
Neither one of those
are technically bad.

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,625
Except they are both
attached to the station.

202
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,708
And the aquarium
is attached as well.

203
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,458
So the risk of running into
another girl is pretty low.

204
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,833
But I always say
there's no reason

205
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,458
to go looking for trouble.

206
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,375
[KOTORI] Really? So a
lingerie store is our best bet?

207
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,708
Well, the other day
Shido asked her

208
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,000
to show her panties.

209
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,208
She didn't seem to
have a problem with it.

210
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,333
[SHIDO] What?
A lingerie store, for real?

211
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,000
[KOTORI] Quit being
so loud, pervert!

212
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,333
[SHIDO] Doh!

213
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,416
If that's what you want.

214
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,166
I don't mind going
to one of those stores.

215
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,333
She took the bait
and ran with it!

216
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,208
[YOSHINO] She's so bold.

217
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,666
Then, let's go!

218
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,750
It'll be your
job to help me

219
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,875
choose
something cute.

220
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,958
[KURUMI] Wow. There's so
much here for me to try on.

221
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,416
Which one do you think
would look best on me?

222
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,958
[KOTORI] Selections, everyone!

223
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,583
[NAKATSUGAWA]
This is the time to attack!

224
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,666
Extreme flattery is sure

225
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,958
to reduce any
resistance to the kiss!

226
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,500
[KOTORI] Yeah, I mean she
was okay going to the store.

227
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,541
So it's probably a good call
to go for it, okay, Shido?

228
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,000
[gulps]

229
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,208
I uh-- They're
both really pretty.

230
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:22,875
But uh-- I like
that style over there.

231
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,291
You like the black one?

232
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,083
And you think it's
better than these two?

233
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,250
Yeah, uh, just
because, you know,

234
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,083
I think you'd look great in it!

235
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,041
Well, that's very
sweet of you to say.

236
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,541
I'll try it on, so
we'll know for sure.

237
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,458
Cool, that sounds great.

238
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,625
Just make it quick, okay?

239
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,916
[KURUMI] So how do I look?

240
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,875
[AI] What do you think
you're doing, Mister?

241
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,500
[MIKIMOTO] We have an emergency!

242
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,916
Why is this
loser with Kurumi?

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,333
Good question.
And what's with the lingerie?

244
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,791
That's so lame.

245
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,416
[KOTORI] Okay, Shido. It's time.

246
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,666
Get out of there, now.

247
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,708
But make sure you don't
leave Kurumi hanging.

248
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,208
[SHIDO] Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, my stomach.

249
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,666
Kurumi, I'm going
to the restroom.

250
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,125
I'll catch up with
you in a bit, okay?

251
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,375
Also, you look
in-freaking-credible!

252
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,291
Well.

253
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,250
Hey, where are you going?

254
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,333
Get back here, right now!

255
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,375
You are so lame!

256
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,666
[KOTORI] Make revisions
to the schedule.

257
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,541
Oh Shido, this is
just the beginning.

258
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,458
[SHIDO] Sorry. I'm late. Sorry.

259
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,000
[ORIGAMI] Don't worry about it.

260
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,083
I just got here myself.

261
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,625
You look kinda sleepy.

262
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,291
No, no,
I'm not tired at all.

263
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,083
So, where did, uh--
Where did you wanna go?

264
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,083
To the movies.

265
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,791
[gasps]

266
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,166
[SHIDO] But you don't wanna
go to the one here, right?

267
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,166
[ORIGAMI] Of course, silly.

268
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,333
We have to go to this one.

269
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,250
I've already picked up tickets.

270
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,458
[KANNAZUKI] This isn't good.

271
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,416
[YOSHINON]
That one's not any better.

272
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,791
[WAITRESS A] Okay.
I'll be back in just a bit.

273
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,375
Lunch?

274
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,833
[ORIGAMI] We have just enough
time to eat before the movie.

275
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,916
I figured now would be
as good a time as any.

276
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
[SHIDO] Sure. Let's eat, then.

277
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,083
Hey, Origami.

278
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,541
Why did you ask me
out on a date today?

279
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,458
I just didn't want
you to be by yourself.

280
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,541
Once the movie's over,
come back to my place.

281
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,375
Uh, your place. What for?

282
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,791
Look. You should stay
with me for a while.

283
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,958
I'm very serious.

284
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,541
[WAITRESS A] Here you go, guys!

285
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,500
There's something
so weird about her.

286
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,458
[MIKIMOTO] Commander.
It's Tohka!

287
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,166
[KOTORI] Aw, shoot!

288
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,625
[SHIDO coughs]

289
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,833
Want me to
Heimlich you?

290
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,666
[SHIDO] No thanks.
I'll be right back.

291
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,125
[SHIDO] Hey, Tohka!

292
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,166
There you are!

293
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,583
I was getting
really worried.

294
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,833
Yeah, me, too.

295
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,208
[stomach growls]

296
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,250
Do you wanna get
something to eat?

297
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,625
Yes, that sounds
perfect; I'm so hungry!

298
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,958
Man, that sure
is a lot of sushi.

299
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,291
'Specially after an aquarium.

300
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,208
More please!
Pickled mackerel!

301
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,583
[SHIDO] Crap.

302
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,750
You really bought it?

303
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,291
That lacy underwear?

304
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,541
Well, after you
told me I looked

305
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,250
in-freaking-credible
in it, I kinda had to.

306
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,916
Yeah.

307
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,500
[TOHKA] Shido! It's ramen!

308
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,750
[SHIDO] Please, stop!

309
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,666
[TOHKA]
Don't you understand? Ramen!

310
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,833
[TOHKA] Walk away!

311
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,250
Which room should we get?

312
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,041
They'll be seen!

313
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,500
Ow. Hey, that hurt.

314
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,666
I'm so sorry.

315
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,625
[AI] No, it's fine!

316
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,166
[MAI] Don't worry
about us. Are you okay?

317
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,500
[MII] You're so cute, it's lame.

318
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,833
[YOSHINON] Yeah!

319
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,791
Get 'em, Yoshino.

320
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,916
[REINE] Looks
like it's nap time.

321
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,541
You worked pretty hard.

322
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,750
[SHIDO] Sorry, Kurumi. Bathroom!

323
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,166
[sighs]

324
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,041
What is wrong
with that kid?

325
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,708
He's hardly making
this a stellar date.

326
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,083
I wonder where he keeps
rushing off to, anyway.

327
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,125
Oh well, it doesn't
matter, I suppose.

328
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:39,250
After all, I'm sure little Shido
will be mine soon enough.

329
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,791
Heh. I get warm and tingly
just thinking about it.

330
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,583
Not long, and then
he will be mine.

331
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:55,375
[cat meows]

332
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,041
[THUG A] Oh, this
guy's a feisty one.

333
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,708
[THUG A] Man, this is so sweet.

334
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,958
[THUG D] Look how close it is!

335
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,375
Oh, trying to get away now?
How 'bout that!

336
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,541
Oh, look at you.

337
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,041
It seems like I've
found a few boys

338
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,583
who are up to
something interesting.

339
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,041
Calm down.
Don't worry about me.

340
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,333
I'd like to get in on this
sweet action, if that's okay.

341
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,791
Believe it or not,
I've been known

342
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,125
to be fairly decent
with a gun, myself.

343
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,625
[THUG A] What should we do?

344
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,000
[THUG B] Heh, heh.
Have at it, sweetheart.

345
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,583
Wow, thanks so much
for your permission.

346
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,791
I certainly didn't expect
that eager welcome,

347
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,583
so it is appreciated.

348
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,666
But I have a small suggestion.

349
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,166
Why don't we change
the rules for fun?

350
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,833
It's not that complicated.

351
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,541
We'll just switch targets
for a little while.

352
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,375
Hey, what happened?

353
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,000
Is it broken?
Get that thing fixed!

354
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,291
[KOTORI] What are we missing?

355
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,041
Oh. I'm sorry.

356
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,333
No, it was my fault.

357
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,083
I should've been
paying attention.

358
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,541
It's you,
stupid Origami!

359
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,041
What the heck
are you doing here?

360
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,916
Well, stupid Tohka.

361
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,375
What I do is none
of your business.

362
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,083
That's fine.

363
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,166
I don't have time to waste

364
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,125
on a loser like
you anyway, so there.

365
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,500
Good, cuz neither do I.

366
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,333
[BOTH] Because I'm actually
on my way to find Shido.

367
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,416
Whatever. I'm out on
a date with Shido right now,

368
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,958
so you need to
stop telling lies!

369
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,041
You're lying!

370
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,125
Shido happens to
be on a date with me!

371
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,916
[ORIGAMI] Oh no.
This could be bad.

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,166
Who is he with right now?

373
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,500
Hey! Come back here.

374
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,916
I'm not done yelling at you yet!

375
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,625
[SHIDO breathes heavily]

376
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,916
[KOTORI] Shido, bad news.
We've lost Kurumi.

377
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,083
How could you lose her?

378
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,166
Alert! Spirit wave
reaction nearby!

379
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,083
[KANNAZUKI] It's in the woods
by the park's east exit.

380
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,208
[SHIDO screams]

381
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,083
[KOTORI] Shido!
Calm down! Shido!

382
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,750
[SHIDO retches]

383
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,375
[KURUMI] Oh my.

384
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,833
Hello, Shido.

385
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,416
I'm so glad you
finally decided to join us.

386
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,833
Help. Please.

387
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,500
She's a monster.
You have to help me.

388
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,291
Don't let her kill me!

389
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,625
[KURUMI] You tried
to kill something

390
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,166
without being ready
to be killed yourself.

391
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,166
Doesn't that seem odd to you?

392
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,166
It was helpless,
and now you are helpless.

393
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,458
How do you like looking
down the barrel of a gun?

394
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,666
Oh no, my finger
must've slipped.

395
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,583
[KOTORI] Shido,
get out of there!

396
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,250
Where do you think
you're going, Shido?

397
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,083
Let go of me.

398
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,458
Oh woe is me.

399
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,625
I can't believe it,

400
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,041
I've completely
messed things up.

401
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,041
I was having such
a wonderful time

402
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,208
on our date together,

403
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,666
I wanted it to last
a little longer.

404
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,791
Oh well. That can't
be helped now.

405
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,875
[MANA] Are you all
right, big brother?

406
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,333
[SHIDO] Mana?
