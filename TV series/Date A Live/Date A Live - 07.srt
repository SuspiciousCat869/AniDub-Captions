1
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,958
[MANA]
You still want more?

2
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,500
I can respect that. Let's go!

3
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,041
Gathering Clouds Sword Style!

4
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,458
Now.

5
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,791
Is that all?

6
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,041
Woo! Almost! Too bad.

7
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,791
[FEMALE VOICE]
Time's up. Mana Takamiya wins.

8
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,916
[RYOKO]
How did she win ten-against-one?

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,291
Then again, I probably
shouldn't be too surprised.

10
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,916
That girl did kill a spirit.

11
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,041
[NARRATOR]
Real sister. Adopted sister.

12
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,958
Does a single word make
all the difference

13
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:37,000
in determining the kind
of love one receives?

14
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:40,583
What is appropriate,
and what is forbidden?

15
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,083
Who can say?

16
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,208
All right, please
introduce yourself again.

17
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,416
I'm Second Lieutenant
Mana Takamiya.

18
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,291
Pleased to fight
alongside all of you.

19
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:18,291
Well, we've got that
out of the way now.

20
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,875
Ugh... Seriously.
What's the big idea

21
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,208
destroying valuable equipment
in a practice match?

22
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,458
-Oh. Sorry, Captain.
-It won't happen again, Captain.

23
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,083
I heard she's the best fighter
the ground force has got.

24
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,625
Don't let it happen again, okay?

25
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,208
We're about to go over the
fight with the "Hermit" Spirit.

26
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,625
So have a seat and join us.

27
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,041
Yes. Of course, ma'am.

28
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,333
The Captain is kind of
hardheaded, isn't she?

29
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,750
Being stubborn strategically
will play right into

30
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,000
the Spirits' hands if
she's not more careful.

31
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,083
[ORIGAMI]
I agree.

32
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,750
[MANA]
Glad, I'm not the only one.

33
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,416
All everyone has
been talking about

34
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,125
is how you've killed
a Spirit before.

35
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,041
Would you mind if I
asked you how you did it?

36
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,583
Wow, word sure travels
fast around here.

37
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,541
Well, no two Spirits are alike.

38
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,000
So if you wanna
fight effectively,

39
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,625
it's important to remember

40
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,333
you can't deal with
them all the same way.

41
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,708
[ORIGAMI]
Huh...

42
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,458
[MANA] Yeah, with how hectic
things have been lately,

43
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,916
I think you'll figure out
what I mean soon enough.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,875
That's why I've been
assigned here, after all.

45
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,250
Brother!

46
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,625
Huh?

47
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,000
[AST GIRL C] We got absolutely
destroyed in today's match.

48
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,291
Well, that's the life
of a backup, I guess.

49
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,583
We might as well get used to it.

50
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,416
Care to explain yourself?

51
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,375
Shido never mentioned he
had another little sister.

52
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,958
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you a friend of his?

53
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,833
We're not friends.

54
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,625
We're together.

55
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,875
Huh?

56
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:43,958
[TAMAE]
Good morning everyone!

57
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,708
May I have your attention?

58
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,666
[chuckles]

59
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,583
Are you ready for a surprise?

60
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,083
A transfer student is
joining our class today!

61
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,500
[CLASS murmurs excitedly]

62
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,750
[SHIDO] Didn't Tohka
transfer a while ago?

63
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,625
[TAMAE]
Okay, come on in!

64
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,458
Hello guys; my name
is Kurumi Tokisaki.

65
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:21,291
Just so you know,
I'm actually a Spirit.

66
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,708
Um. Let's move on.

67
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,250
Well! That's one of the
more unique introductions

68
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,625
this class has had!

69
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,250
Go ahead and take
a seat anywhere.

70
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,666
Before I sit, could someone
do me a quick favor?

71
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,458
Oh. Do you
need something?

72
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,541
Since I'm new,
I'm afraid I don't know

73
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,333
my way around the
school that well.

74
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,666
Would anyone be so kind
as to show me around?

75
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,125
I'm really sorry to trouble you,

76
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,208
but I promise I'll make
it worth your while.

77
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,625
Yeah, you betcha I'll do it!

78
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,125
Not you, but thanks.

79
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,708
Oh...

80
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,916
Would you be interested
in helping me?

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's Shido, right?

82
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,583
Huh? Uh. Yeah, okay.

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,833
So you're completely sure?
Without a doubt?

84
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,166
I am.

85
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,375
[RYOKO] The Spirit
transferred to the high school.

86
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,458
We'll give her credit
for being creative.

87
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,708
[MANA]
She's not your typical Spirit.

88
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,750
To start with, she's deadlier
than all the others.

89
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,750
Over ten thousand people
have died by her hands.

90
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,666
The number's even bigger
when you take into account

91
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,458
all the spatial quake deaths.

92
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,458
[RYOKO]
Are you kidding me?

93
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,166
[KOTORI] It's been
confirmed on our end, too.

94
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,416
I didn't think she'd turn
out to be an actual Spirit.

95
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,750
But this could definitely
work in our favor.

96
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,375
So I want you to try
to work your charm

97
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,666
and make her fall in love with
you before the AST attacks.

98
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,041
[KURUMI]
Hi, Shido.

99
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,125
Are you ready to
show me a good time?

100
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,875
[SHIDO]
Uh, sure.

101
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,750
Which romantic getaway
should we head to first?

102
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,416
Ummm.

103
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,666
Make your choices quick, team!
He's on the spot!

104
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,541
Huh. The roof looks
awfully popular.

105
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,583
But which of you went
with number three?

106
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,875
That was me.

107
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,125
And how did you
arrive at that answer?

108
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,083
Through process of elimination.

109
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,125
The school nurse
is in her office.

110
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,416
And as for the roof,

111
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,083
it's a much lovelier
view to witness at sunset.

112
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,833
Just my two cents.

113
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,250
Who knew you were
such a romantic!

114
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,958
Hey, Shido! You get all that?

115
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,583
Why don't we start with the
cafeteria and student store?

116
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,041
Okay.

117
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,125
What does she think
she's trying to pull?

118
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,166
No one else is going to
get between Shido and me.

119
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,375
A lot of people like Yakisoba.

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,083
It's a cafeteria classic.

121
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,458
How interesting.

122
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,500
I'll give you my
personal recommendation.

123
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,583
It's this one! The Durian bread.

124
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,791
But you'll have to brush
your teeth after eating it.

125
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,166
[KURUMI]
How interesting.

126
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,666
Are you even listening?

127
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,708
Uh. Are you okay?

128
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,625
Yeah, just zoned
out for a second.

129
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,791
It's hard to concentrate

130
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,083
with such a handsome
man in front of me.

131
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,541
Excuse me?

132
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,916
[KOTORI] It won't do us any
good if you fall for her.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,541
Right. Sorry.

134
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,000
She's different
from the ones

135
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,208
we've faced
in the past.

136
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,958
Hopefully Shido can
keep his act together

137
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,666
and get more info on her for us.

138
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,958
Hmm?

139
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,083
[KOTORI] Right on cue,
the next set of options!

140
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,500
I say number three.

141
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,666
And why is that?

142
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,791
I'm interested in
seeing her panties,

143
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,250
and that's pretty much it.

144
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,125
[snaps]

145
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:29,166
No wait! Have mercy! Have mercy!

146
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,166
Like I'm the only one
that thinks these things?

147
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,583
[KOTORI] "Kurumi, what kind
of panties are you wearing?"

148
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,958
How did that pervy
choice sneak in there?

149
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,000
Hey, question.

150
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,875
Uh, Kurumi? What kind of
panties are you wearing?

151
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,041
Panties? Like, right now?

152
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,166
[SHIDO]
Numbskull!

153
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,958
Those weren't your
instructions, dummy!

154
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,750
You were supposed to ask
her about being a Spirit!

155
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,625
Whatever! Just change the
subject or something, moron!

156
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,208
Ease up. It was
an honest mistake.

157
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,291
[KURUMI] Would you like
to take a peek at them?

158
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,125
Yeah. I don't mind.
As long as it's you.

159
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,041
[SHIDO]
Stop!

160
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,041
That's good
enough, thanks!

161
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,041
You're so cute
when you're shy.

162
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,375
Moving on.

163
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,500
What did you
mean earlier today?

164
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,250
You said you were a Spirit.

165
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,583
[KURUMI] You don't have to
play dumb with me, silly!

166
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:45,041
Besides, I already know that
you know all about the Spirits,

167
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,708
inside and out.

168
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,958
But how do you know
so much about me?

169
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,208
That's my little secret.

170
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,583
There's only one thing
I can tell you about myself.

171
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,458
Ever since I first
found out about you,

172
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,250
I've been crazy in love
and hoping you'd notice me.

173
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,958
I'm so happy the two
of us are finally alone.

174
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,291
It's exactly how I
dreamed it would be.

175
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,833
Hey. Are you still listening?

176
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,708
Now that I've got
your attention,

177
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,916
I need you to do a favor for me.

178
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,250
If you think you can
handle it, of course.

179
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,166
Uh.

180
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,625
Uh-huh.

181
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,625
[TOHKA] Ahh!

182
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,416
Tohka! Origami!

183
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,916
This is awkward!

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,125
What exactly are the two of
you doing barging in on us?

185
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,083
Uh. I was just looking
for Shido, that's all!

186
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,541
Students are not supposed
to hold hands at school.

187
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,500
Let go of him right now.

188
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,416
I'm sorry, but I can't.

189
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,666
I have a crippling
case of anemia!

190
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,916
Shido was kind enough to offer
his body so that if I faint,

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,750
I'll simply land
in his waiting arms!

192
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,375
My anemia.

193
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,041
[SHIDO] U-Uhh...

194
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,666
I can't believe how
pathetic you two are.

195
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,208
Ah! Uh-oh!

196
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,666
I think my anemone's
kicking in, too!

197
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,666
Your what?

198
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,291
It makes me sway back and forth

199
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,791
until fish are attracted
by my cuteness!

200
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,125
She said her anemia,
not sea anemone!

201
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,208
[AI] Whoa.

202
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,583
Looks like they're
fighting over him.

203
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,083
This is intense!

204
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,958
Is he already trying to hook up
with the transfer student?

205
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,375
It hasn't even been a day yet!

206
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,250
[MII]
That's so lame.

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,791
Thank you so much for showing
me around the school today.

208
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:35,458
I would've been lost
without you. So thank you.

209
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:39,250
That being said, next time I
want to do it with you alone.

210
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,791
[SHIDO chuckles]

211
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:45,041
Alrighty then. I guess I'll see
you two in class tomorrow.

212
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,875
[SHIDO] Maybe it
was a good thing

213
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,333
Tohka and
Origami were there.

214
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,000
Otherwise, who knows
what would've happened?

215
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,708
Oh hey. Where did Origami go?

216
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,000
Beats me, she probably
already went home without us.

217
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,750
[KURUMI hums]

218
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,541
Shido, tasty Shido!

219
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,750
Ah! Easy, girl! Don't
get excited just yet!

220
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,083
You'll need a little
more patience than that.

221
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,125
I'll be sure to save
the best for last.

222
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,666
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.
I guess I didn't see you there.

223
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,791
[THUG A]
Yeah. What was that for, bitch?

224
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,000
You gotta do a lot more for me

225
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,125
than just say sorry
if you wanna go free.

226
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,541
[THUG B] Damn, this one's
looking hella fine.

227
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,250
Give us your name
before we get down.

228
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,041
Don't worry, we don't
bite that hard.

229
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,875
Fellas, hold on a sec!

230
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,708
Oh, wow. Sorry about the bump.

231
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,000
Maybe I can make it up to you

232
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,750
with a different
kind of bumping.

233
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,458
Hot damn, you really
are a slut! Awesome!

234
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,750
We're gonna treat that
pretty face real nice.

235
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,250
We're taking turns,
and I get to go first!

236
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,666
Come now. There's
plenty to go around.

237
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,625
Follow me and see for yourself
how I like to have fun.

238
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,083
If you dare.

239
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,333
[THUG B chuckles]
Why don't you guys hold her

240
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,291
while I get this party started?

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,666
[THUG B]
Wh-What the hell? Help!

242
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,375
[THUGS scream]

243
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,958
Thanks for the snack, boys.

244
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,666
[MANA]
Did I arrive too late?

245
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,041
Well hello. You just
missed all the fun.

246
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,250
You really ought to learn how
to clean up after you eat.

247
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,000
Right, Nightmare?

248
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,541
Burgers. Tonight I'm in
the mood for some burgers!

249
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,333
[KOTORI] Oooh, that
sounds good! Go with that!

250
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,708
[SHIDO chuckles]

251
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,375
[SHIDO]
Hmm. I guess we'll have to see.

252
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,666
I don't believe it.
It's really you.

253
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,958
Origami was telling
the truth after all.

254
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,333
Do you know this girl?

255
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,916
No, I don't.

256
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,541
Hi!

257
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,375
Eh?

258
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,375
[KOTORI]
Who's that?

259
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,708
Big brother!

260
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,458
Huh?!

261
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,541
[MANA] This is such a
nice place you got here.

262
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,625
I can't wait to see it!

263
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,500
It's nice to meet you!

264
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,083
I never thought my brother would
be living with so many women!

265
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,666
Everyone's so pretty, too!

266
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,041
Thanks for keeping
an eye on him!

267
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,666
Well, this was unexpected.

268
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,250
How many more sisters do you
think Shido's hiding from us?

269
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:14,083
Who knows, he's a true man
of mystery! Juicy, juicy!

270
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,541
It's not like I actually
knew she even existed!

271
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,250
Wait a minute, what are Yoshino
and Yoshinon doing here, too?

272
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,083
Uh, um. Sorry.
Please forgive us.

273
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,791
Oh no. It's really not
that big a deal to me.

274
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,416
[YOSHINON]
Look at them!

275
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,791
They're so super-alike
it's crazy!

276
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,791
That's no surprise!
We are related, after all.

277
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,625
Yeah, it's funny you
should mention that.

278
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,083
I've been his little sister for
as long as I can remember.

279
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,583
Wow, what a coincidence.

280
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,875
Does that make
you my big sister?

281
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,416
No, of course not!

282
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,291
We were both still little kids
when my family adopted Shido,

283
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,250
so we're as close to
siblings as we can be!

284
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,625
You mean except for
actually being siblings.

285
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,458
Hey Mana. Little sis.
I've got a question for you.

286
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,541
Oh? Go ahead and
ask away, then!

287
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,416
Hmph!

288
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,750
Well, uh. It's just that...

289
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,708
Now, no offense, but uh...
I don't remember you.

290
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,375
That doesn't surprise me.

291
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,125
It's weird.
The past is such a blank

292
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,291
that sometimes I think
my memory's been erased!

293
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,125
Huh?!

294
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,541
You've gotta be kidding me!

295
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,833
What the heck do you mean,
your memory's been erased?

296
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,041
I remember the past
two or three years okay,

297
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,541
but anything before
that is a complete blur.

298
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,041
Crazy. So you don't
remember mom, either?

299
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,750
[MANA]
No. No, I'm afraid I don't.

300
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,583
Then how do you know for
sure that you and Shido

301
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,041
are actually related
to each other?

302
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,000
[SHIDO]
Is that me?

303
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,083
[KOTORI] A lot of
little boys look alike.

304
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,916
[MANA] No, this
is definitely Shido.

305
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,625
Like I said, my memory's
pretty fuzzy.

306
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,875
But I do remember my older
brother going off somewhere.

307
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,458
I was so devastated.

308
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,458
But more than that, I spent
every day worrying about him.

309
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,291
That's why I'm so happy.

310
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,291
And now you're sitting
right in front of me.

311
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,750
I can't explain! I'm ecstatic!

312
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,000
[SHIDO]
Mana.

313
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,500
I love you, brother!

314
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,375
[KOTORI]
Get away from her, you jerk!

What do you think you're doing?

316
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,000
[SHIDO]
What the hell was that for?

317
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,041
[KOTORI]
Shido is my family.

318
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,875
I'm not going to let
you or anyone else

319
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,125
take him away from me.

320
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,333
[MANA] I wasn't
planning on doing that!

321
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,875
You weren't?

322
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,333
I just haven't gotten to
see him in such a long time.

323
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,333
I'm relieved he's doing well.

324
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,791
And even now,

325
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,833
he's still got a cute little
sister looking after him!

326
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,333
Oh. Thank you.

327
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,666
You should've opened your
mouth before I kicked him.

328
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,500
[MANA] Besides,
at the end of the day

329
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,458
there's no beating
the real sister.

330
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,666
[KOTORI] Funny.
You are joking, right?

331
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,791
Nope! I'm only stating facts.

332
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,916
There's no bond stronger
than blood that I know of!

333
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,458
I think you mean,

334
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,875
"Better is a neighbor who is
near than a sister far away."

335
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,083
No no.

336
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,583
An adopted sister's
practically a stranger!

337
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,291
A real sister will
always be closer

338
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,333
because she shares
the same blood.

339
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,125
What's the point of
emphasizing the blood part?

340
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,208
Adopted. Or real?
What does all of this mean?

341
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,708
Do you have any idea?

342
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,875
Wake up, you two!

343
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,125
Everyone knows a sister
can drive a man wild

344
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,250
like forbidden fruit!

345
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,333
Sweet with just the
right amount of tangy!

346
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,916
Really? Then sisters
drive me wild, too!

347
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,666
I want some forbidden fruit!

348
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,458
Quit putting ideas
into Tohka's head!

349
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,291
Just how much is
your blood worth?

350
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,958
Big whoop, it's not like a
real sister could marry him!

351
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,333
What?

352
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,291
Um. Never mind! Point is
his only sister is me!

353
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,833
I don't think you
make a very good one.

354
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,708
You're not as strong as
his real little sister.

355
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,500
That has nothing to do with
being a sister, ya jerk face!

356
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,583
Hey girls. Let's
try to stay calm.

357
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,416
Shido. Which do you like more?

358
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
An actual blood sister?
Or a stupid adopted sister?

359
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,541
Whoa! I'll pass. Yeah.

360
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,250
I mean talk about
awkward, right?

361
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,083
Um, do you live by
yourself nowadays?

362
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,875
If someone out there's
taking care of you,

363
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,416
then I ought to at least meet
them and tell them thanks.

364
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,083
That's not a good idea.

365
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,541
How come?

366
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,708
Is there something wrong with
where you're living or what?

367
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,250
I wouldn't say that.

368
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,541
See, the thing is, it's
kind of a special dorm

369
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,000
for people I sort
of work with.

Wait, work with? Hold on,
you already have a job?

371
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:58,083
Oh, um. I can't really
explain it all that well. Heh.

She's gone?

Wow. I can't believe it.

She's not here.

Kurumi Tokisaki will no longer
be attending this school.

387
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,750
[TAMAE]
I told her to contact us

in case something
like this ever came up.

[TAMAE] Miss Tokisaki,
you're very late.

Yeah, sorry about that, teach.

394
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,375
I felt a little
queasy on my way here

00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,208
so I decided to
take a quick nap.

[TAMAE] Oh, do you
feel better now?

That's good.

Kurumi and Mana?

Origami and the AST.

Why?

412
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,083
They wouldn't show up unless
there was a Spirit around.

[REINE]
The facts.

416
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,541
Yesterday, Kurumi Tokisaki
was killed by the AST.

417
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,833
And Mana was the one
who took her out.

418
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,500
So you can see,
video doesn't lie.

419
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,000
Kurumi Tokisaki
should be dead.

But how? No. It can't be.

Kurumi came to class,
she's alive.

Yes, I do.

I don't have an explanation.

Hello, Origami.

You wanted to see
me about something?

Oh, but first,
I haven't eaten lunch.

Would you like to
grab a bite with me?

You were supposed to
have died yesterday.

I was? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I remember.

around with Mana

What are you
going to do to me?

Oh, you'll see.

445
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,125
You could say I wanted
to try out school.

446
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,958
And I even admit it has
been a fun experience.

00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,333
But no. That's not why I'm here.

I'm here for the
same reason you are.

It's for Shido.
I think you know him.

You crave him too, after all.

00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,666
But unfortunately for you,
he means much more to me.

So much more.

what's good for you,

454
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,375
get out of my way and
never talk to Shido again.

He is absolutely a delight.

And he makes me feel amazing.

457

He also looks delicious.

I yearn for little Shido.

I long for that boy.
I want him so badly!

he has inside.

And I know what it'll
take in order to have him.
