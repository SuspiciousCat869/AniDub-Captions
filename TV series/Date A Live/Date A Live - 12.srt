1
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,625
[ORIGAMI] Kotori Itsuka.

2
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,416
[KOTORI] Um. Is it
too late to get off?

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
I want off.

4
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,083
Oh, it's way too late.

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,833
[KOTORI] Ahhh!

6
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,750
[NARRATOR] More often than not,

7
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,291
feelings have a way of
complicating things.

8
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,750
The red flame has
forgotten the truth,

9
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,416
while the white flame
has discovered it.

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,833
And when these two flames meet,

11
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,666
everything will burn to ash.

12
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,458
These rides
are so stupid.

13
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,458
[SHIDO giggles]

14
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,458
[KOTORI screams]

15
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,791
Yeah.

16
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,291
I wonder if Shido will
survive this. She's mad.

17
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,166
[REINE] Actually,
this might end up

18
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,208
being exactly
what Kotori needed.

19
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,083
[REINE sighs]

20
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,666
I think he just made
the perfect call.

21
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,333
We've blown this date
out of proportion

22
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,041
instead of letting it be.

23
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,833
[KANNAZUKI] I hope you're right.

24
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,708
[SHIDO laughs]

25
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,333
Are you scared?
Gimmie your hand.

26
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,625
[KOTORI] What for?

27
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,750
I'm not some frightened kid,
you know!

28
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,916
Unless, you're the one
who's actually freaking out.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,875
You scared?

30
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,208
Yes, that's it.

31
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,416
Please hold hands with me;
I'm so scared!

32
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,333
Stop acting
like a weirdo.

33
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,125
Please, Kotori!
Hold my hand; I'm so scared!

34
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,041
Fine, if you'll
shut up!

35
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,166
[KANNAZUKI] Ah! Shido, no!
What a waste!

36
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,916
If you hugged the Commander,

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,833
you could legitimately
enjoy her soft, supple body.

38
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,541
You just lost the
perfect opportunity

39
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,125
to get a foot planted
right into your face!

40
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,125
[KANNAZUKI] Why? Why are
you riding together?

41
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,583
You should let the
Commander drive the car

42
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,541
by herself, you idiot.

43
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,333
That way, you could be
running in front of her

44
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,208
as a personal target!

45
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,208
Imagine the gradually
shrinking distance

46
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,083
as the Commander
smiles sadistically,

47
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,625
trying to run you down
and crush your dreams! Oh!

48
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:04,166
Mercy, my sweet Commander!
Have mercy! Oh, have mercy!

49
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,250
[SHIIZAKI] Shido was right.

50
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,416
Throwing out his headset
was a good call.

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,833
[TOHKA] Wow!

52
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,541
This jungle cruise is everything
Shido said it would be!

53
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,500
Yes, it is. I'm having fun.

54
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,500
Feels good to relax!

55
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,041
Don't you think
it would be even more fun

56
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,041
if Shido and Kotori
were with us, though?

57
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,333
Why didn't they
wanna come, too?

58
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,625
Wait. Why don't
we go get them?

59
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,500
[YOSHINO] You
can't do that, Tohka!

60
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,791
[TOHKA] Why not?

61
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,625
We should all be having
a good time together!

62
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,333
Yeah, but--
but that's not it.

63
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,000
[YOSHINON] We might
have overheard

64
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,791
something kind of major.

65
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,875
Kotori's really a Spirit?

66
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,583
Shido's trying to save her.

67
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,333
He's going to seal
her power away

68
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,125
like he did with both of us.
He needs this time.

69
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,875
So, we shouldn't interrupt him.

70
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,208
We've gotta let him
do what he needs to.

71
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,416
[YOSHINON] We heard
that if he fails,

72
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,625
they don't know what
will happen to Kotori.

73
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,416
Chances are it's not good.
We need to stay away, Tohka.

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Yeah, okay,
I guess you're right.

75
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,708
But I do wish
there was something

76
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,333
we could do to help them.

77
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,000
I owe Kotori so much
for what she's given me.

78
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,916
It's hard to just sit here.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,583
Besides, I like Kotori a lot.

80
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,875
Don't you think she has the
same kind of smell as Shido?

81
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,083
[YOSHINON] That's probably

82
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,833
because they use
the same shampoo!

83
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,041
[YOSHINO] We have to
let Shido handle this.

84
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,750
It's the best thing for Kotori.

85
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,333
[MALE OPERATOR A]
We've got an emergency, here!

86
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,791
DW029 has disappeared!

87
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,333
[MALE OPERATOR B] There's no
evidence of a transport vehicle.

88
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,625
The White Licorice battle
suit has been stolen.

89
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,583
Whoever has it took all
the ammunition as well.

90
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,416
It isn't ready
for field use yet.

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,333
The deployment inspection
made that very clear.

92
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,541
[ORIGAMI] Do you think
it would be possible

93
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,000
to even defeat
Ifrit using this?

94
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,416
[RYOKO] Origami.

95
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,333
[KOTORI sighs]

96
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,375
Man. I underestimated
this theme park.

97
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,916
Talk about a good time!

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,333
Hah. You are so immature.

99
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,250
Maybe try to get out of those
diapers before you graduate.

100
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,833
This from the girl
who was freaking out

101
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,166
about a water slide?

102
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,958
You mean death trap!

103
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:14,583
Well, whatev.
I'm over it. And besides.

104
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,500
At least it wasn't
totally boring, you know?

105
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,333
[SHIDO] Yep. That's true.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,166
It's been a long time, right?

107
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,583
Since we've been to
a theme park like this.

108
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,291
I can't remember, though.
Do you know?

109
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,625
Yeah, five years.

110
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,583
[SHIDO] Really? That long?

111
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,416
Spirits killed my parents.
They burned them.

112
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,041
[KOTORI] Five years ago,
somehow I became a Flame Spirit.

113
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,208
[KOTORI] What is it?

114
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,041
[KOTORI]
Oh, is it happening now?

115
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,041
[SHIDO] Kotori.

116
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,708
Yeah. What is it?
Uh, look, Shido.

117
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,875
I-- I think-- well, this is
just as good of a time as any,

118
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,375
but I just um-- I wanna go
somewhere with fewer people

119
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,208
because I'm really embarrassed.

120
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:00,916
[SHIDO] Why?

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,250
Uh. It's not obvious?

122
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,041
We'll be okay right here.
I promise you.

123
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,791
Now, listen. Kotori.

124
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,750
[KOTORI] Yeah, what?

125
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,458
[SHIDO] I have a question.

126
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:20,833
You can't just ask me like
that; it's super awkward.

127
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,000
Wait...

128
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,125
No, never mind; ignore me.

129
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm all right, so please, just
hurry up and ask your question!

130
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,916
[SHIDO] Yeah. Okay. So, listen.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,208
About five years ago--

132
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,833
Kotori!

133
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,208
[ORIGAMI] Shido,
it's dangerous here.

134
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,875
You need to leave.

135
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,250
Origami?

136
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,333
[SHIDO] Origami! Why?

137
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,708
Do you have any idea
what you just did?

138
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,500
Yes, Kotori is dead.
I killed her.

139
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,041
[KOTORI] Hah! You killed me?

140
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,333
You don't make it sound like
it was that big of a deal.

141
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,375
I'm disappointed.

142
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,958
I thought you were
smarter than that,

143
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,708
but apparently I was giving
you far too much credit.

144
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,500
Who knew you would get
ahold of a missile.

145
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,083
And who knew you were
crazy enough to use it.

146
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,416
Especially when you consider

147
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,250
how many innocent
people are around us.

148
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,083
[SHIDO] No!

149
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,666
Elohim Qiball!

150
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,833
Camael.

151
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,333
I found you. Finally!

152
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,041
Kotori! Origami! Stop!

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,333
You have to stop this!
Please stop!

154
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,083
[YOSHINO] It feels weird.

155
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:38,500
[TOHKA] I know.
Come on. Let's go.

156
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,083
Hey. What are you
doing, Yoshinon?

157
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,708
[YOSHINON] You can't go, Tohka!

158
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,541
Remember, your powers are
sealed inside Shido right now,

159
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,541
so you might not even
be able to protect yourself!

160
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,291
Whoever that is has
to be pretty strong

161
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,916
to create such a big explosion!

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,583
If you go, there's no guarantee
you'll come back alive!

163
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,416
I appreciate the warning,

164
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,166
but I'm not making
Shido face that alone.

165
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,916
[YOSHINON] But Tohka.

166
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,833
[TOHKA] Shido is trying
to save my friend, Kotori.

167
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,500
He won't give up on her.

168
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,416
Me neither. Let's go.

169
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,833
Hey, Yoshinon.
I um--well-- Can I go?

170
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,166
[YOSHINON] If you feel that
strongly about it,

171
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,375
I won't stop you.

172
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,375
Why on Earth would
you choose to use

173
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,666
such an ill-behaving weapon?

174
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,875
[ORIGAMI] Deploying Territory.
Locking coordinates.

175
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,416
Shockingly, not too bad.

176
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:09,625
I haven't seen that suit before.
It must be a new one.

177
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,791
[KOTORI] No. I've used
too much power.

178
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:13,833
[SHIDO] Kotori!

179
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:19,125
Cleave Leaf, ready! Fire!

180
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,166
[ORIGAMI] Deploying Territory.

181
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,125
Blast Arc ready!
Annihilate her!

182
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,125
Kotori!

183
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,166
[ORIGAMI] Protect Territory!
Deploy!

184
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:44,250
[KOTORI] Oh no.
Where did all your power go?

185
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,791
You're going to beat me, right?
You're going to shoot me, right?

186
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,000
You're going to kill me, right?

187
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,875
Then stop stalling.

188
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,416
Go on, take aim
before it's too late.

189
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,833
[KOTORI] Otherwise.

190
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,083
[KOTORI giggle]

191
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,375
You'll be dead before
you know what hit you.

192
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,208
[SHIDO] Kotori, stop it!

193
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,166
[KOTORI] What, finished already?

194
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,625
That's no fun at all.

195
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,958
Camael. Megiddo.

196
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,583
Do something.
Because if you don't.

197
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,125
I have absolutely
no use for you.

198
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,500
[SHIDO] I said knock it off!

199
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,708
Damn you, Ifrit.

200
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,458
Sounds practically
dreadful, don't you think?

201
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,833
Where did you hear about
my little nickname?

202
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,583
[ORIGAMI] This is how
you did it, isn't it?

203
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:39,166
This is how you murdered
my parents five years ago!

204
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,458
[KOTORI] What do you mean?

205
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,916
Five years ago,

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,958
my parents were brutally
killed by a flame Spirit.

207
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,291
I watched as you murdered them.

208
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,208
I remember everything.

209
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,541
How could I forget
that, though?

210
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,333
How could anyone?
Now, you'll pay!

211
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,000
This is where you die!

212
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,083
And I'm the one who's
going to kill you!

213
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,833
No. I don't...
You're lying.

214
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:08,291
This time, I won't miss!

215
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,458
Kotori, no!

216
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,791
[ORIGAMI] Territory. Condense.

217
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,666
White Licorice.
Critical driving force!

218
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,291
Origami, please stop!
You can't do this!

219
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,625
[ORIGAMI] Shido,
get out of my way.

220
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,541
[SHIDO] Like hell I will!

221
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,458
[ORIGAMI] I told you,
since they died,

222
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,958
my only purpose in life has
been to avenge my parents.

223
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,958
Killing Ifrit, killing Kotori,

224
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,958
is the only reason
I have for living.

225
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:37,083
[SHIDO] You can't!
You can't kill my sister!

226
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:41,458
If you pull that trigger,
there's no going back!

227
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,375
[MANA] I do this all the time.

228
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,208
I don't want to see
you end up like Mana.

229
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,125
I don't care what you want.

230
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,291
My goal is to kill Ifrit
with my own hands.

231
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,916
[SHIDO] Origami,
just answer one thing.

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,333
You're only after Ifrit, right?
You want the Flame Spirit.

233
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,541
You're not after my
little sister at all.

234
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,333
You don't want to kill
Kotori Itsuka, do you?

235
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,125
What are you talking about?

236
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,791
[SHIDO] Just answer me!

237
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,041
You're after the Flame Spirit,

238
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,500
and my little sister has
nothing to do with it,

239
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,000
isn't that right?

240
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,333
[ORIGAMI] You're not
making any sense, Shido.

241
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,208
Yes, I am after Ifrit,
the Flame Spirit.

242
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,708
But your little
sister is a Spirit.

243
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,166
No matter what you say,
that is a fact.

244
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,333
So please, get out of my way.

245
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:28,208
Just wait! Origami. I need
you to give me some time.

246
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,583
[ORIGAMI] No. This is my best
chance to take her down,

247
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,666
and I'm not throwing that away.

248
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,833
Listen to me!

249
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,750
I know it sounds like an excuse,

250
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,125
but I'm not about
to just sit here

251
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,166
while you murder
my little sister!

252
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,541
And on top of that,
I can't do nothing

253
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,833
while my friend
is in so much pain!

254
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,083
Yes, even so.

255
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,625
[SHIDO] Origami!

256
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,041
[SHIDO] Tohka? Yoshino?

257
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,791
We're here. Are you okay?

258
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,708
[YOSHINON] Wahoo! Saved you!

259
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,958
Don't worry;
you can thank us later.

260
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,041
Yoshinon, not now.

261
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,541
Move!

262
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,666
Shido! Take Kotori
and get out of here.

263
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,000
We can take care of this.

264
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,041
[SHIDO] Wait. Are you sure?

265
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,333
[TOHKA] Yes, now go!

266
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,333
Hurry, I can't
last much longer.

267
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,875
[SHIDO] Thank you!

268
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,541
I don't have time to
screw around with you two!

269
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,166
Come on, Origami.
You have to stop this.

270
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,083
There's no point
in killing Kotori!

271
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,875
You don't know what
you're talking about!

272
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, I do!
Don't you remember?

273
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,333
You shot Shido!

274
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,208
We both thought
you had killed him!

275
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,875
It was so painful.

276
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,041
I'd never felt that sad before!

277
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,291
I felt broken, and
more alone than ever!

278
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,416
Isn't that how you felt
when you lost your parents?

279
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you really want
to put Shido through

280
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,125
that kind of pain
because that's not fair!

281
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,666
You're being selfish!

282
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,375
Why would you want to hurt
such wonderful people?

283
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,708
[SHIDO] Promise me something.

284
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,125
Promise you'll stop
hurting good people.

285
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,916
[ORIGAMI screams]

286
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,750
Shido, I'm so
sorry about this.

287
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,625
[SHIDO] Don't worry about it.
I'll figure something out.

288
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,833
Look, Sis.

289
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,375
[KOTORI] Yeah?

290
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,666
[SHIDO] How am I supposed to
confirm Kotori's happiness meter

291
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,458
without getting
in touch with Reine?

292
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:42,041
I have to seal her power,
and I have to do it now.

293
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,166
[ORIGAMI] Ifrit!

294
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,375
Focus on me.

295
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,166
Kotori! The truth is, well--

296
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,541
you'll always be my
favorite little sister.

297
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,250
I'm prouder of you than
you will ever understand!

298
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,583
I adore everything about you!

299
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,500
And I-- I love you!

300
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,666
[KOTORI] Really?

301
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,375
What about you?
How do you feel about me?

302
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,166
Um. Isn't this kind of
an awkward time to ask?

303
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,583
[SHIDO] Kotori!

304
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,000
[KOTORI] I feel the same way!
I love you, too!

305
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:19,500
I've always loved you! I love
you more than anything!

306
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,708
Do you remember now?

307
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:53,791
Five years ago. I saw her.
There was someone else.

308
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,291
[SHIDO yells]

309
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,041
Shido!

310
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,500
What just happened?

311
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,708
[SHIDO] Origami,
you said it yourself.

312
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,041
You're after Ifrit.

313
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,750
The Flame Spirit is
the one you want.

314
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,666
You don't want
to hurt my sister.

315
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,416
She's not a Spirit anymore.
She's human.

316
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,250
So come on, change your aim.

317
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,083
I'm Ifrit now, target me!

318
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,750
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

319
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,916
[SHIDO] I remember.

320
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,916
I know what really
happened five years ago.

321
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,916
I know what we did.

322
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,375
[ORIGAMI] But Ifrit
killed my parents!

323
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:45,000
[SHIDO] You are right that Ifrit
was the reason the fire started.

324
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,750
But understand, Kotori
didn't kill anyone.

325
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,375
[ORIGAMI] No, that can't be!

326
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,666
I know I saw a Spirit that day!

327
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,875
[SHIDO] Yes,
there was one there!

328
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,583
It's the same Spirit
that made Kotori

329
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,750
suffer through all of this.

330
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,333
Do you really expect
me to believe you?

331
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,541
[SHIDO] Yeah.

332
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:07,750
[ORIGAMI] I want to.
But I-- I just can't.

333
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,208
If that's the case, then
you don't have a choice.

334
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,458
Shoot me. Kill Ifrit.

335
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,041
C'mon, you've said
it before, right?

336
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,541
[ORIGAMI] No one should
ever have to feel

337
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,958
the way I felt that day.

338
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,666
[ORIGAMI winces]

339
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,541
Activation limit.

340
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,250
No. I won't be stopped now!

341
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,708
Put the gun down!

342
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,000
You can't take
Kotori away from me!

343
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,791
She saved my life!

344
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,708
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be here!

345
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,291
Believe me! Please,
you have to believe me!

346
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,833
[ORIGAMI] No, I can't let go.

347
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:08,500
Well, that's not going
to be nearly enough.

348
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,833
[REINE] Shin. I'm so sorry.

349
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,750
I'm entirely responsible
for what happened today.

350
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,208
[SHIDO] You mean
because you had Tohka

351
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,666
and Yoshino go on the date?
That wasn't all that bad.

352
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,625
No, I should never
have sent you

353
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,916
out on that date
in the first place.

354
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,583
Instead, I should have
had you seal her powers

355
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,000
as soon as you
woke up yesterday.

356
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,500
But Kotori was so
excited about the date.

357
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,916
I don't know, I just couldn't
take that away from her.

358
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,541
Oh. But, even so,
that was impossible, right?

359
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,833
Her happiness meter,
it wasn't even full.

360
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,083
What is this?

361
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,666
[REINE] These are all
the changes we recorded

362
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,875
in Kotori's feelings towards you
since we measured her yesterday.

363
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,750
As you can see, they
haven't changed in the least.

364
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,875
They've been maxed
out the whole time.

365
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,500
She told you as much
herself, didn't she?

366
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,625
Kotori loves her big
brother more than anything.

367
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,000
[SHIDO] Ahh!

368
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,750
[KOTORI] Something
must be broken.

369
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,250
There's no way those stupid
measurements are right!

370
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,750
[REINE] Not true.

371
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,541
There is nothing wrong
with the measurements.

372
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,333
[KOTORI] Say the numbers are off
or buy me a dozen cream puffs!

373
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,791
My apologies, Shin.
The measurements are wrong.

374
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,458
[SHIDO] Fine. Whatever.

375
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,375
Anyway, you sure
you're all right?

376
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,708
Shouldn't you be resting
or not kicking me?

377
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,500
Don't have that kind of time.

378
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,083
I have a long report
to write, you know.

379
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,000
We finally got
our memories back.

380
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,041
But they could always
be erased again.

381
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,500
If we want to make
sure we can remember

382
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,458
what really happened
to us five years ago,

383
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,333
then it would probably be
smart to record the truth

384
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,958
somewhere other than either one
of our two heads.

385
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,416
[SHIDO] Understood.
Don't work too hard.

386
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,416
[KOTORI] I won't.

387
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,750
Oh, Shido...

388
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,583
You know what you said before
you sealed my Spirit power?

389
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,583
Was that true?

390
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,916
Well, yeah;
of course it was.

391
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,916
I do love you. I always will.

392
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,166
Uh. I was wondering,
'cause no reason.

393
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,833
[SHIDO] As a sister, of course.

394
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,875
That's what you meant?

395
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:02,500
[SHIDO] Kotori.

396
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,916
What do you want?

397
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,583
[SHIDO] I really like how
those ribbons look on you.

398
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:10,083
[KOTORI] Oh. Well,
thanks, Big Bro.

399
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,750
[SHIDO] Hey.
Thanks for saving me.

400
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,750
If you and Yoshino hadn't come,

401
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't know what would
have happened to Kotori,

402
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,333
or Origami for that matter.

403
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,416
[TOHKA] I just responded
to your feelings.

404
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,250
I'm sure it was the
same for Yoshino.

405
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,833
I hope you'll keep saving any
other Spirits that might appear.

406
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:57,708
Like you saved me, and
Yoshino, and Kotori, too.

407
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,833
[SHIDO] Sure. I promise.

408
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,875
But I wish you
wouldn't kiss them.

409
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,875
I don't know why,
but I don't like it

410
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,083
when I see you
kissing someone else.

411
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,625
What is that about?
It's such a weird feeling.

412
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,041
Well. Let's see.

413
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,208
I don't know if I can
explain it. It's complicated.

414
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,333
[TOHKA] I think you should
just shut up and kiss me!

415
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,625
Oh, do you?

416
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,833
[TOHKA] I do. I really do.

417
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,916
[KOTORI] Oh! Way to go, Shido!

418
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,166
[KOTORI] Don't mind us.

419
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,041
Just keep on doing what
you were about to do.

420
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,625
[SHIDO] Why are you guys
still watching me?

421
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:42,750
Ignore them.
I'm right here.

422
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,375
[KOTORI] Kiss her! Kiss her!

423
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:48,583
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

424
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,375
Kiss her! Kiss her!

425
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,041
[YOSHINON] Ha. To be continued!

426
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,625
Someday.
