1
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,125
I don't want to go just yet!

2
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,125
Before the shuttle launches
and I leave this world,

3
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,625
there's something I think
you outta know about me.

4
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,250
[SHIDO]
What is it, Ririko?

5
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,833
Everyone wants you to get really
good at flirting with Spirits

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,000
so you can make them
fall in love with you.

7
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,791
And you're supposed to get
better by practicing on me.

8
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,375
[SHIDO]
Yeah, that's the plan.

9
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,625
What about it?

10
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,750
[RIRIKO]
Oh, it's just that I'm afraid.

11
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:56,166
I'm afraid-- I might be
falling in love with you.

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,041
It's true.

13
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,375
We've known each other forever

14
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,541
and you've always treated
me like a little sister,

15
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,375
but do you think you
can start looking at me

16
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,458
as a woman instead?

17
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,291
This is the best day ever!

18
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,125
Don't you worry about a thing.

19
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,666
I'll even wave to
you from Jupiter,

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,500
it's not super far away!

21
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,916
Until next time, big brother!

22
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,791
[SHIDO] All right! Ha, ha!

23
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,291
I rock!

24
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,708
[NARRATOR] Spirits.

25
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,916
Mysterious girls appearing
from another world.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,500
Should we fight against
their pure strength

27
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,000
with weapons of war,

28
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,208
or should we address
them with love?

29
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,625
Now, mankind is faced with
the ultimate decision.

30
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,375
[YOUNG ORIGAMI]
Dad! Mom!

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,041
Origami!

32
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,083
Shin.

33
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,625
[SHIDO]
Uh, yes, Reine?

34
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,583
[KOTORI]
Are you daydreaming again?

35
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,750
It's time to implement
Stage 2 of your training,

36
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,291
so you better be ready.

37
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,666
[SHIDO] Huh?

38
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,208
This is training?

39
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,125
Good afternoon, Shido.

40
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,875
Is there something
I can help you with?

41
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,583
No, thank you.

42
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,458
[KOTORI]
What do you think you're doing?

43
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,125
Quit wasting everyone's time.

44
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,500
Hurry up and make her
fall in love with you.

45
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,791
[SHIDO]
Do I have to?

46
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,125
You ought to know by now

47
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,375
that seducing a Spirit
is easier said than done.

48
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,958
If you can't even
make a human love you,

49
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,750
how do you expect to
convince a Spirit to?

50
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,708
You're asking the wrong guy,
I'm not a stud.

51
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,125
[KOTORI] We know!

52
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,083
Just throw out a few compliments
and see what happens.

53
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:48,750
If she responds well, we'll
give you further instructions.

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,916
Um. Is there something
on your mind?

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
[SHIDO] Miss Okamine, that's
a cute outfit you're wearing!

56
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,041
What? Goodness, you
really think so?

57
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,208
Oh my, that is very
flattering of you.

58
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,750
Oh, yes! It really
does look good!

59
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,875
So does your hair!
And those sexy glasses!

60
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,750
Perfect shoes!
Perfect stockings!

61
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,625
Perfect attendance book! Heh.

62
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,375
Shido? Is everything all right?

63
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,250
[KOTORI] You got way too
into that. Stop being creepy!

64
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,791
[TAMAE] I'm kind of busy right
now, so I'll see you in class.

65
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,083
[SHIDO stammers]

66
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,666
[REINE]
This can be fixed.

67
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,791
All right.

68
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,250
Listen closely and
do exactly as I say.

69
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,416
[sighs]

70
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,666
Here's the truth.

71
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,916
I love homeroom.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,375
I look forward to
going to it every day.

73
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,833
Well that's nice to hear!
I'm so glad that you like it.

74
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,083
[SHIDO]
The main reason is because

75
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,750
I get to see you all the time.

76
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,416
I can't help it.

77
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,958
I think I've fallen
in love with you.

78
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,041
Come on, don't say
such silly things!

79
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,375
Honestly, I'm flattered,

80
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,125
but students and teachers
can't love each other!

81
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,500
No. Don't tell me that.

82
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:50,083
I'm dead serious.
I want to marry you!

83
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:54,666
[TAMAE]
You want to marry me?

84
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,250
Is it true?

85
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,416
Once you're old enough to get
married, I'll be in my thirties.

86
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,958
Is that ok? You need
to meet my parents!

87
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,958
Daddy gets so protective
but I think he'll like you!

88
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,250
He might even give us the house!

89
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,625
Once you graduate
and get a decent job

90
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,625
I can retire and
start having babies!

91
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,875
Huh. We underestimated
the enthusiasm

92
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:11,166
of 29-year old single women.
They make for easy targets.

93
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,041
It'll be annoying if she gets
more involved than necessary.

94
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,416
Hey Shido, we're done here,

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,958
so make up some excuses and
get out of there pronto.

96
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,416
I'm really sorry Miss Okamine,

97
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,416
I don't think I'm ready for
that level of commitment!

98
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,208
We can start out in an
apartment and work our way up

99
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,250
to a three-bedroom
condo with a backyard!

100
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,625
And don't worry about
wedding planning!

101
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,291
I've been saving up
for fifteen years!

102
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,291
You can take care of
the DJ, I'll do the rest!

103
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,541
Let's wait till Valentines Day,
that'd make it extra special!

104
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,166
[KOTORI] You've found a
market with older women.

105
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,208
Good to know.

106
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,458
[SHIDO] Shut up!

107
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,250
How can you be so calm
when I'm about to-- Ahh!

108
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,750
Oh man. I'm sorry 'bout that.

109
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,083
I'm alright.

110
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,250
[KOTORI]
Perfect timing!

111
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,000
Why don't you practice
with her, too?

112
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,208
[SHIDO] Huh?!

113
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,333
[KOTORI] She's around
the same age as you,

114
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,458
so it'll be natural.

115
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,833
Plus, even though
she's not a Spirit,

116
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,875
she's a member of the AST.

117
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,125
Doesn't seem like the type
to spread rumors either.

118
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,666
Spread rumors
about what?

119
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,083
[KOTORI]
Just talk to her already!

120
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,958
[SHIDO] Ugh.

121
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,500
Uh... Hey Tobiichi!

122
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,916
Those clothes look nice on you!
Where'd you get 'em?

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,458
[ORIGAMI]
It's a uniform.

124
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,541
Come on, idiot, you have to
put in more effort than that.

125
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,041
Again, with more feeling!

126
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,208
[SHIDO]
I don't know how.

127
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,875
[REINE]
Shin, follow my lead.

128
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,250
To be honest,
I already know.

129
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,625
I've known all about you
for quite a while now.

130
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,625
I'm aware of that.

131
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,708
Oh, is that so? Nice.

132
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,916
I'm real glad we're in the
same class this semester.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,625
In fact I watch you all the time
during class when you study.

134
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,833
Yes, likewise.

135
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,791
Is that so? How random.

136
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,916
I also like sneaking into
your locker after school

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,541
to sniff your gym clothes.

138
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,708
Same here.

139
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,291
Okay. I wasn't expecting that.

140
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,375
And why not?

141
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,666
Who knew we'd have
so much in common.

142
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,541
So do you want
to go out with me?

143
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,000
That came out of nowhere!

144
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,166
Don't you think this
is a little sudden?

145
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,875
I wouldn't mind.

146
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,583
I wouldn't mind
going out with you.

147
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,458
[SHIDO]
Uh... Cool.

148
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,500
So you wanna, like, go somewhere
with me, something like that?

149
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,083
[ORIGAMI]
Like a movie?

150
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,208
I'm sorry, I assumed you were
asking me out on a date, Shido.

151
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,458
Am I wrong?

152
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,666
No, not at all, that's
exactly what I meant.

153
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,583
[ORIGAMI] Good.

154
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,708
[SHIDO] Dang it.

155
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,416
That's exactly what I meant?

156
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,041
How come Reine didn't bail me
out of that one? I'm screwed!

157
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,833
Uh... What's this?

158
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,958
[ORIGAMI] For you,
because you like my uniform.

Your attention, please.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,166
This is not a drill.

162
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,541
There have been precursory signs

163
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,291
of an impending spatial
quake in this vicinity.

164
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,458
Please evacuate...

165
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,833
[ORIGAMI]
Something just came up. Bye.

166
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,416
Hey! Wait a second!
Where are you going?

167
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,250
[KOTORI] A spatial quake
is about to happen.

168
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,708
Head back to the
Fraxinus for now.

169
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,375
[SHIDO]
Do you think it's a Spirit?

170
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,500
Yes. Princess.

171
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,958
She'll be appearing
at your exact location.

172
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,583

[alarm sounds]

175
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,083
They're on their way, now.

176
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,416
Roger that.

177
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,583
[FEMALE AST SOLDIER]
Here we go.

178
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,333
The quake has started.

179
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:40,875
[crumbling sounds]

180
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,750
[KOTORI] Consider
yourself lucky, Shido.

181
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,291
The AST's CR-units are deadly,

182
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,750
but they weren't built
for indoor combat.

183
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,791
As long as Princess
remains inside the school,

184
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,250
the AST will have a hard time

185
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,416
interfering with
whatever you do.

186
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,000
[SHIDO]
With what I do?

187
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,875
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

188
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,250
Relax, this is what you've been
training for the past week.

189
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,291
You're as ready
as you'll ever be.

190
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,041
You want to save the Spirit.

191
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,708
Or am I wrong?

192
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,250
[SHIDO] She's right.

193
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:16,166
I don't ever want to see that
sad look on her face again.

194
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,000
Kotori. You're absolutely
sure I can do this?

195
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,000
[KOTORI] Yes. Just
believe in yourself.

196
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,583
You represent a different way
of dealing with the Spirits,

197
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,083
a more intimate method.

198
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,666
Remember that.

199
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,583
Be friendly with them, use sweet
talk, and make them fall for me.

200
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,791
You're gonna do just fine.

201
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,166
Besides, the Fraxinus
has got your back.

Behold the pride of Ratatoskr,

ready to respond to
any circumstance!

With five marriages and five
divorces under his belt,

"Bad Marriage" Kawagoe!

00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,541
Hey there!

208
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,125
[KOTORI] It's the working girl's
favorite midnight client,

209
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,291
CEO Mikimoto!

210
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,541
Who doesn't love love?

211
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,291
[KOTORI] Go after this lady's
fella and you'll regret it!

212
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,041
Don't you dare piss her off.

"Nail Knocker" Shiizaki!

214

than a hundred wives.

A-okay!

[KOTORI] Lastly, a woman
whose love is so strong,

218
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,916
not even a silly restraining
order can keep her away.

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,833
"Deep Love" Minowa!

220
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,791
Fantastic,
I'm relying on perverts.

221
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,166
[REINE] Don't worry, everyone
is good at what they do.

222
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,833
And that's only a portion
of the troops on our side!

223
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,333
Just stay calm.

224
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,666
Even if you die once,

225
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,958
you can always start a new
game without a penalty.

226
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,875
[SHIDO] I'm pretty sure
this isn't a game.

[KOTORI] Have faith
in your little sister!

Wait just a minute!

I don't want to fight with you!

Please, listen to me.

00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,875
[PRINCESS]
What's your name?

236
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,208
And why are you following me?

237
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,041
Because--

238
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,125
[KOTORI]
Don't answer yet!

239
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,166
[MINOWA]
There has been a change

240
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,708
in the mental state
of the Spirit.

My name is Shido Itsuka.

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,125
I've come to save you!

245
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,583
I'm just a passerby.
Please don't kill me!

246
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,666
Before asking someone's name,
you should give your own.

247
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,875
[KOTORI]
Well, there they are.

248
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,666
Now everyone get to work!

249
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,250
[KOTORI]
No surprise here.

250
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,791
You guys went with
the same one I did.

251
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,208
The first choice is a
tried and true classic,

252
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,166
but it doesn't apply
in the situation.

253
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,083
And it does sound
a little cliché.

254
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,833
Option two is also out.

255
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,541
If he escapes, he can't
continue the conversation.

256
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,666
Number three it is.

257
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,875
I agree.

258
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,791
In this case, three
makes the most sense.

259
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,000
She'll let him live and
he'll get to know her better.

260
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,166
'Kay, Shido, we've
made up your mind!

261
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,625
Now listen closely and
then repeat after me.

262
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,125
[PRINCESS]
What are you waiting for?

263
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,583
Answer the question already!

264
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,666
Before asking for
someone's name,

265
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,083
you should really
give your own first!

266
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,916
I hate you, Kotori!

267
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,666
[KOTORI] Well,
that was unexpected!

268
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,958
Unexpected my ass,
I could've been dead!

269
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,541
No more time for games.

270
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,625
If you do not answer me,

271
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,750
I can only assume
you are my enemy.

272
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,333
[SHIDO]
My name is Shido Itsuka.

273
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:34,958
I'm a student at this school.
I've got no reason to fight you.

274
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,250
Hold on.

275
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,958
This isn't the first time
we've crossed paths.

276
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,125
No, it's not.

277
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,500
I saw you on the
tenth in the city.

278
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,500
That's right. I thought so.

279
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,833
I remember you saying
something odd to me that day.

280
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,208
[SHIDO winces]

281
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,750
You said you didn't
come to kill me,

282
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,375
and that you couldn't
kill anyone.

283
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:56,791
And now I know that was a lie.
Why else would you be here?

284
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:01,291
Your face. How come
you always look so sad?

285
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,166
I'm not trying to do anything.

286
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,291
And it's true. I really
have no reason to kill you.

287
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,625
[PRINCESS] Quit lying!

288
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,375
Every single human
is out to get me.

289
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,750
I haven't done a thing to
them yet they want me dead.

290
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,958
I swear, that's not true!

291
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,708
You never answered me.

292
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,458
You claim to have no
intention of killing anyone.

293
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,208
If that's really the truth,
tell my why it is you came here.

294
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,500
Her first reaction
wasn't all that pretty.

295
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,166
This time, option one's
probably the safest choice.

296
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,125
[SHIDO]
I-- I wanted to meet you!

297
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,750
To meet me?

298
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,500
Why would you want that?

299
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,083
[KOTORI]
Do you guys have any ideas?

300
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,833
[KAWAGOE] I recommend a
straightforward approach.

301
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,166
[NAKATSUGAWA]
Yeah, be clear and direct!

302
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,541
This girl's way too dense
to get anything subtle.

303
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,000
[KOTORI]
That's a good point.

304
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,333
We've already wasted enough time

305
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,541
answering all of
these questions.

306
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,000
Um. It's simple.

307
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,458
I came here because
I'm interested in you.

308
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,291
I'm in no mood to joke around.

309
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,875
I know, and neither am I.

310
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,250
You want to know the truth?

311
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,250
I came here so I
could talk to you.

312
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,416
I don't even care
what we talk about.

313
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,708
Not one bit!

314
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,208
You can ignore me
if you want to!

315
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:19,416
But know this, I'm not
like every other human.

316
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,541
Because--

317
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,750
[KOTORI] Stop it,
wait for our signal!

318
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,750
Because I'll never
let you down!

319
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,458
[PRINCESS] You said your
name was Shido, right?

320
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,375
And when you said you
were interested in me,

321
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,041
were you being serious?

322
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,666
[SHIDO]
Yes, I was.

323
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,375
But like
serious serious?

324
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,291
[SHIDO]
Serious serious.

325
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,041
[PRINCESS] One-hundred
percent serious serious?

326
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,666
[SHIDO] One-thousand
percent serious serious!

327
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,083
Jerk!

328
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,333
Who would seriously fall
for your amateur tricks?

329
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,750
Stupid, dummy!

330
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,833
But that was
from the heart!

331
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,166
Then again, this is different.

332
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,833
I still don't know what
your intentions are.

333
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,833
But you are the only
human I've ever had

334
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,166
a normal conversation with.

335
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,583
You know this world,
which could serve me well.

336
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,166
It might just work.

337
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,666
Yep, it's settled.

338
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,666
This should prove
your usefulness.

339
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,791
Uh, thanks I guess.

340
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,041
Um. Oh yeah, what was
your name again?

341
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,000
My name? I've never
had one of those.

342
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,125
But I suppose I will need
one if I want to find out

343
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,333
why humans are so awful.

344
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,375
Okay. Why don't you come up
with something you can call me?

345
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,250
Well she's certainly putting
the Fraxinus to work, isn't she?

346
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,375
All right crew, we need to
think of a name, on the double!

347
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,083
The few suggestions we have
aren't gonna be enough.

348
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,375
Do you want to call in the
troops from around the world?

349
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,000
One step ahead of you!

350
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,208
[phone beeps]

351
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,708
Gosh, now what does she want?

352
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,083
Heh, heh, heh.

353
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,625
Your wish is my command,
my digital darling!

354
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,166
Isn't that that
fool Tonomachi?

355
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,666
He's probably sending
a dirty text to Shido!

356
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,666
That's so lame.

357
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,666
Come on man, we're
not naming Princess

358
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,250
after one of your ex-wives!

359
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,125
I don't even know how to
pronounce that gibberish!

360
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,250
[MIKIMOTO]
It's Clare-ah-bell.

361
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,750
[KOTORI]
The nineteen twenties are over!

362
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,666
Can't anyone here think of
a halfway decent girl's name?

363
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,000
What about Tome?

364
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,041
Tome!

365
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,875
Tome sounds kinda neat, right?

366
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,791
Wow, she's mad.
Was Tome that bad?

367
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,166
Don't think I can't
tell when a human

368
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,416
is attempting to make
fun of me. You got it?

369
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,291
[SHIDO]
Okay, just a minute!

370
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,875
Apologies to anyone named Tome,

371
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,500
but I don't think
I know a single girl

372
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,958
that would like that name.

373
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,541
Think, Shido!

374
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,166
There has to be a
perfect name for her!

375
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,291
How about Tohka?

376
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,458
Tohka. Yeah,
I guess that'll work.

377
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,541
Is this how it's written?

378
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,791
It is.

379
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,833
[TOHKA] Huh...

380
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,166
Tohka.

381
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,916
Now I have a name!

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,416
I think I like it.

383
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,375
Thank you.

384
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,666
Yeah. Yeah, you're welcome.

385
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,000
Tohka just means "tenth,"
as in the day we met.

386
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,708
But hey, it's not like
she'll ever need to know that.

387
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,208
Get down and take cover!

388
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:29,083
[gunfire]

389
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,000
[AST GIRL 2-1] Are you sure
this is okay, Captain?

390
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,875
[RYOKO] We have permission
to smoke them out.

391
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,125
Once we've done our job,

392
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,250
the reinforcements can
take care of the rest.

393
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,625
[SHIDO]
Are you all right?

394
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,666
Hurry up and leave
while you still can.

395
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,000
I'd love to continue our talk,

396
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,708
but the last thing I want
is for you to get hurt.

397
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,791
Don't just stand there.
Get going before they open fire!

398
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,416
I'm staying right here!

399
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,333
Sit down. I wanna
talk some more!

400
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,166
You want to know about
this world, don't you?

401
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,500
So have a seat!

402
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,500
Pretend they're not even there!

403
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,000
[TOHKA] Alright.

404
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:15,208
[gunfire]

405
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,416
[SHIDO]
I'm curious.

406
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,958
If you're not human,
what exactly are you?

407
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,291
[TOHKA]
I don't know.

408
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,916
I don't remember
how long ago it was

409
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,041
when I appeared out of nowhere.

410
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,666
That's all I can recall.

411
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,750
Most of my oldest memories
are fuzzy and distorted.

412
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,208
I honestly don't know
what kind of being I am.

413
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,333
[SHIDO]
That's awful!

414
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,791
[TOHKA]
I suppose so.

415
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,875
My birth was sudden
and inexplicable,

416
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,791
and the Mecha-Mecha Squad was
already in the air when I awoke.

417
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,916
[SHIDO]
Mecha-Mecha huh?

418
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,458
[TOHKA] Them.
The noisy flying people.

419
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,833
[SHIDO] Interesting.

420
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,291
[KOTORI]
Here's your chance!

421
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,750
Her happiness meter
is over seventy.

422
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,250
Now's as good a time
as any to make a move.

423
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,708
[SHIDO]
What do you want me to do?

424
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,791
[KOTORI] For starters you
could ask her out on a date.

425
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:54,625
Uh...!

426
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,625
[TOHKA]
Hm? What's wrong?

427
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,125
Uh, nothing,
I'm just itchy.

428
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,666
You've been muttering under
your breath for a while.

429
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,500
Are you hiding
something from me?

430
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,041
[SHIDO] No, no,
you're overreacting!

431
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,916
Then tell me what you
were saying just now.

432
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,375
[SHIDO] I... forgot?

433
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,416
Come on. Cut to the
chase and ask her out.

434
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,041
Ask her out! Ask her out!

435
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,583
[GROUP] Ask her out!
Ask her out! Ask her out!

436
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:18,166
Ask her out! Ask her out!
Ask her out! Ask her out!

437
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,291
All right already!
Shut up! I'll do it!

438
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,458
Tohka, I wanna
ask you something.

439
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,333
Um but it's-- Well,
it's kind of abrupt.

440
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,125
But, will you go out
on a date with me?

441
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,291
[gunfire]

442
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,666
Have we received any
new orders, Origami?

443
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,000
That's a negative, ma'am.

444
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,708
[RYOKO]
Even after all this?

445
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,041
Wait a minute.

446
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,250
Someone is down there
with the Spirit!

447
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,375
Hold on; hold your fire!

448
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,583
[gasps]

449
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,916
[RYOKO]
Origami, get back here!

450
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,041
What exactly is a date?

451
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:52,875
[SHIDO]
You don't know?

452
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,458
[KOTORI]
Look out! The AST!

453
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,916
Ahh!

454
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,083
[TOHKA]
How rude!

455
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,291
What? Tobiichi?

456
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,333
Stand back.

457
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,208
Well, if it isn't you again.

458
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,041
He's not your shield, you scum.

459
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,291
[SHIDO]
You've got it all wrong!

460
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,875
[RYOKO]
What are you doing, Origami?

461
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,750
We don't have orders
to break in on foot!

462
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,291
[TOHKA]
Sandalphon!

463
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,458
[KOTORI]
Shido, get out of there now!

464
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,541
The Fraxinus will
come to retrieve you.

465
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,375
And leave her here alone?

466
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,125
[ORIGAMI yells]

467
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,416
[helicopter sound]

468
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,208
[RYOKO] You could have
been killed out there!

469
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,791
Do you realize just how lucky
you are she became Lost?

470
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,166
Exercise some restraint. Okay?

471
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,125
You're a valuable
member of the AST.

472
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,958
So start acting like it!

473
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,208
[SHIDO] I was there
when everything happened.

474
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:04,000
Still, the massive destruction
just doesn't seem real.

475
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,750
But yesterday was real.

476
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,958
It wasn't a dream at all.

477
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,000
[TOHKA] Shido!

478
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,333
[SHIDO]
That's right.

479
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,000
I really did talk with
Tohka and give her a name.

480
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,750
--Crazy.
--Hey, Shido!

481
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,875
[TOHKA]
Quit ignoring me!

482
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,708
[SHIDO] Tohka!

483
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,583
You just now noticed me?

484
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,666
Wow, you are so dumb!

485
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,208
But how did you end
up back over here?

486
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,958
The spatial alarm
didn't even go off!

487
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,000
[TOHKA]
Why would it?

488
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,125
You were the one
who invited me back.

489
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,500
For a date I think?

490
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,791
Well guess what?
It's time for that date!

491
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,791
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

492
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,583
Okay! Just bring
it down a bit!

493
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,750
And you should probably
get out of that first.

494
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,166
Do you mind changing?

495
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,625
Right now? You want me to
undress in broad daylight?

496
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:51,125
No, that's not it!

497
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,791
Lemme show
you an example.

498
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,500
You think this outfit is better?

499
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,833
Why are you walking
around with this picture?

500
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,291
[SHIDO] Quit asking questions,
just change already!

501
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:02,625
Very well.

502
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,666
How does this look?

503
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,000
[SHIDO]
Um, good.

504
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,333
Glad you think so.
Time for our date!

505
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,750
[SHIDO]
Hey, stop walking so fast!

506
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,291
[TOHKA]
You're too slow, Shido!

507
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,708
Date time, date time!

508
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,958
[SHIDO] Oh, sure, just
announce it to the entire world!
