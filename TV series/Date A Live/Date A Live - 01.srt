As long as you're safe,

[MALE NEWSCASTER]
A spatial quake was recorded

53
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,583
early this morning near
the center of Tengu City.

54
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,166
There was only slight damage,

55
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,833
with no casualties among
residents in the area.

56
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,333
Investigations continue

57
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,000
as to the cause of
the spatial quakes...

58
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,250
[SHIDO]
Again? Sounded close, too.

59
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,666
[KOTORI] It was.

60
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,250
[SHIDO] Spatial quakes.

61
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,333
Widespread vibration phenomena.

62
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:08,125
An area randomly starts
vibrating, and no one knows why.

63
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,125
These quakes are
irrational, mysterious,

64
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,458
and unbelievably destructive.

65
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,166
After the massive
catastrophe thirty years ago,

66
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,041
spatial quakes continued
around the world

67
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,583
for six terrifying months.

68
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,416
In Japan, the Great
Southern Kantou Spatial Quake

69
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,958
completely flattened an area
not too far from our house.

70
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,250
It was total devastation.

71
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,250
In the twenty-five years
after that, nothing happened.

72
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,208
Nothing until five years
ago when a spatial quake

73
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,250
showed up in the
redeveloped Tengu City.

74
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,458
Not long after that,

75
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,916
we started hearing about
quakes all the time.

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,791
Most of which occurred
here, in Japan.

77
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,083
It's weird.

We don't serve that
dish at this restaurant.

Even if the place is taken over
by terrorists, we'll still eat!

I wish I knew,
but I have no idea.

166
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,333
[TONOMACHI]
Oh heck yeah! It's Tamae!

167
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,250
It's Miss Okamine, please!

168
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,583
Now quiet down.

169
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,208
I'll be your homeroom
teacher this year.

170
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,416
I hope you guys
are ready to learn!

[SHIDO]
Origami Tobiichi.

173
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,750
Why does she know who I am?

174
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,833
And why is she looking at me?

175
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,500
So weird.

176
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,083
What the heck is going on?

[bell rings]

178
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,666
[TONOMACHI] Hey Shido.
Wanna go home together?

179
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,625
[SHIDO]
Sorry. I've got plans.

180
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,666
Oh, yeah? Is it a girl?

181
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,833
[SHIDO]
Technically.

182
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,166
It's just Kotori, though.

183
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,500
Oh, I understand.

184
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,166
Besides, as far as I know,

185
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,750
there's not a girl
in this school

186
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,708
with a sensitive and kind enough
spirit to have lunch with you.

187
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,291
Thanks, but that
was not a compliment.

188
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,583
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Your attention, please.

189
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,708
This is not a drill.

190
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,083
A spatial quake!

191
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,291
Another one?

192
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,708
[SHIDO]
We need to evacuate.

193
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,875
The shelter near the school
should be safe enough.

194
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:23,916
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
I repeat,

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,916
there have been
precursory signs...

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
[SHIDO]
Where's she going?

[KANNAZUKI]
Ah... She's here.

201
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,333
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER] I repeat.
There have been precursory signs

202
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,833
of an impending spatial
quake in this vicinity.

203
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,333
Please evacuate to the
nearest shelter immediately.

204
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,541
This is not a drill.

205
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,625
I repeat. There have
been precursory signs

206
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,291
of an impending spatial
quake in this vicinity.

207
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,125
Please evacuate to the
nearest shelter immediately.

208
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,333
Ah! Everyone please calm down!
And don't forget your three D's.

209
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,291
Don't push, don't run,
don't walk-- wait.

210
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,291
You might wanna take
it down a scosche.

211
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,041
Of course.
You're right. I'm sorry.

212
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,208
[SHIDO] I hope Kotori is
evacuating like she should.

213
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,666
Surely she's not still gonna
try to meet me at the diner.

214
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,583
[KOTORI] I'll be here even
if a spatial quake happens!

215
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,833
[SHIDO] Come on.

216
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,375
Please don't be waiting
in front of that diner.

217
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,875
She has to have
gone to a shelter.

218
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,083
She's fine. She's gotta be fine.

219
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,125
I bet the shelter she's
in just has bad reception

220
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,416
or she has her phone
on silent or something.

221
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,000
Let me check her location.

222
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,500
Just in case.

223
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,500
No!

Hey. Wait! Shido!

00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,208
[KOTORI]
Okay, bro! I love you!

226
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:50,916
[SHIDO] Why?

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,166
[KOTORI]
Thank you so much, bro!

228
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,416
[SHIDO] Why?

229
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,666
Why did she not
just take shelter?

230
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,958
The city's about
to be destroyed,

231
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,541
and she's worried
about a promise?

232
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,541

[SHIDO] It's a girl.

237
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,666
What's she doing?

238
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,458
[GIRL]
Not you, too.

239
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,750
I see.

240
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,250
So it's true.

You came here to kill me.

Do not try denying you
are here to kill me.

243
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,416
I must deal with you
before the others arrive.

244
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,125
Wait!
Just wait! Please!

245
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,916
That's--that's not
why I came here!

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,791
What?

247
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,833
I-- I could never kill anybody.

248
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,083
Is that what you're here for?

Why do they not realize the
futility of their attacks?

[SHIDO]
This isn't just any girl.

252

why does she look so sad?

I won't ever let you go again.

I'm the Head Analyst here.

There's no reason
for you to freak out.

First Aid is hardly
out of my league.

That supposed to be reassuring?

00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,958
So, here's a question.

282
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,166
Where exactly am I?

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,541
You're resting in
Fraxinus's sickbay.

You were unconscious,

the best course of action.

to go find my sister!

She's waiting for me
in front of the diner!

What you need is to calm down.

Your sister is perfectly fine.

What? She is?

296
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,666
I'm assuming you want some
sort of explanation now?

297
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,291
Apologies, but that
isn't really my forte.

298
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,375
You should ask the Vice
Commander for more details.

299

I've brought him with me.

shut up for a second?

Don't be rude.

You should be on your
knees bowing in gratitude.

324
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,916
If you want, I certainly
wouldn't mind letting you

325
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,791
lick my boots while
you're down there.

326
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,375
What? Really, I can?

327
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,791
[KANNAZUKI groans]

328
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,541
Oh, yeah. Thank you
for that, Commander.

329
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,041
And uh-- you are Kotori?

330
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,375
[KOTORI]
Of course.

331
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,125
Have you forgotten what
my face looks like, Shido?

332
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,708
No bro?

333
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,750
[KOTORI] I knew your memory was
bad, but not Alzheimer's bad.

334
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,375
Well, I guess we'll
have to admit you

335
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,291
to a nursing home pretty soon.

336
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,541
So, uh. What's going
on? Where are we?

337
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,875
Quit freaking.

338
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,541
I'll explain the specifics
to you later, but first.

339
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,250
You need to remember the three
things I'm about to say.

340
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,166
One, that girl is a "Spirit."

341
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,375
She doesn't belong
in this world,

342
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,875
and simply appearing
on our planet

343
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,916
causes everything
around her to blow up

344
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,083
whether she wants it to or not.

345
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,750
Blow up? Why?

346
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,750
[KOTORI]
You are so dumb.

347
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,833
You know those things
we call "Spatial Quakes"?

348
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,708
Well, Spirits just like
that girl down there

349
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,041
are the ones responsible
for making them happen.

350
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,083
[SHIDO gasps]

351
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,375
[SHIDO] How could
one girl do all that?

352
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,500
Ready for two?

353
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,666
These are the ground
force's Anti-Spirits Team.

354
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,041
When a Spirit appears,

355
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,166
the AST fly to their location
and take care of it.

356
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,041
Meaning, they kill them.

357
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,208
What? Kill them?

358
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,250
It's true.

359
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,375
You came here to
kill me, didn't you?

360
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,625
And now for three.

361
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,458
There is another way to
deal with these Spirits

362
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,833
without having to
rely on the AST.

363
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,166
This is the reason you're here

364
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,916
and where your help
will be most needed.

365
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,708
Me? Help how?

366
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,125
We'll have to make sure you
start training tomorrow.

367
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,458
I'll leave the rest
of the details

368
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,250
up to the person in charge
of your development--

369
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,541
in the meantime, just go
back to school like normal.

370
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,416
Wait! Will you slow down?
Why would you train me?

371
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,041
I mean, seriously,
what could I possibly do?

372
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,291
[KANNAZUKI screams]

373
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,291
No one is asking your
opinion on the matter.

374
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,833
--Your only option is 'yes'.
--But.

375
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,708
[KOTORI]
Now I have a question.

376
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,250
What were you doing
down there, Shido?

377
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,958
Did you want to die?

378
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,250
[SHIDO] No, stupid!
I was looking for you!

379
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,875
Remember, you said
you'd be at the diner

380
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,291
even if there was a quake!

381
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,875
[KOTORI] I said that,
but how was I supposed to know

382
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,041
you'd follow through?

383
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,125
Look, Kotori. Besides
being dependable,

384
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,708
your phone's locator
showed me you were there!

385
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,125
You don't say?

386
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,125
Oh, yeah--I guess
that does make sense.

387
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,583
Although, technically
we're above the diner.

388
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,250
Huh?

389
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,000
Disable the filter.

390
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,291
[gasps]

391
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,750
We're currently fifteen thousand
meters above Tengu City.

392
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:12,125
You're onboard an
airship called Fraxinus.

393
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,791
[TAMAE] Is everyone enjoying
day two of the new semester?

394
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,333
Well, I am because today we have

395
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,166
a brand new assistant
homeroom teacher with us!

396
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,125
I'm Reine Murasame.

397
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,000
And I'm excited to be here.

398
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,958
Ahh!

399
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,333
[SHIDO] How did you get
to be one of my teachers?

400
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,041
Tell me what's going on!

401
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,791
Please, Miss Murasame.

402
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,625
[REINE]
You can just call me Reine.

403
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,291
'Kay, Shin?

404
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,166
[SHIDO]
My name is Shido.

405
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,708
Is that right? Wow.

406
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,541
Sorry Shin. My bad.

407
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,625
You can't be
serious! Come on!

408
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,333
You didn't even
try getting it right!

409
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,583
It's more convenient for
me to keep close to you

410
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,666
if I'm a member of the
school's teaching staff.

411
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,708
And you should have been able

412
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,458
to figure that much
out on your own.

413
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,416
Try not to be so stupid!

414
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,750
Hey, why don't you tell
me why you're even here?

415
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,083
Don't you have school?

416
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,333
[KOTORI] I got
permission to come today.

417
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,625
Fine.

418
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:40,916
So are you finally
gonna explain to me

419
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,916
what this training
is for, or what?

420
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,083
It'll start to
make more sense

421
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,166
once you start using
the training software.

422
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,250
Hit it, Reine!

423
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,500
[SHIDO] Huh?

424
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,500
This is a dating sim.

425
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:01,916
Tonomachi was playing it.

426
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,041
Um, no it's not.
Take another look.

427
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:11,458
[SHIDO]
My Little... Shido?

428
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,208
[ORIGAMI]
So, Shido.

429
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,541
About yesterday.

430
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,666
[SHIDO] Uh huh.

431
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,750
Please, just keep
that to yourself.

432
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,708
In fact, it would
be for the best

433
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:59,750
if you forgot about everything
you saw yesterday.

434
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,125
Would it?

435
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:05,166
You mean that girl, right?

436
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,250
Look, Tobiichi.

437
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,083
I, um.

438
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,041
I think she's might be--

439
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,333
She's a spirit.

440
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:13,625
That thing is an enemy
that I must defeat.

441
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,125
Why?

442
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,583
You really think
they're so evil?

443
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,375
Spirits killed my parents.

444
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,083
They burned them.

445
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,625
They are very evil.

446
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,333
And they will pay.
