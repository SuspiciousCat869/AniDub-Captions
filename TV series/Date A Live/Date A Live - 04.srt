1
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,375
[SHIDO] The weather forecast
has been really off lately.

2
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,791
So much for only a ten
percent chance of rain.

3
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,416
Hey, are you okay?

4
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Oh good.

5
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,791
You're not hurt?

6
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,375
Guess not, then.

7
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,875
[GIRL] Please.

8
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,708
Don't come any closer to me.

9
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,791
[SHIDO gasps]

10
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,708
[GIRL]
Don't hurt me.

11
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,541
Please, please don't hurt me.

12
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,583
[NARRATOR] The rain comes
from an unknown world,

13
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,083
washing the Earth
with its tears.

14
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,916
Is this new meeting
a temporary necessity,

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,250
or is it more likely to be
a contrived coincidence?

16
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:42,166
Because, as we all know,
there is more than one truth.

17
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,083
[TOHKA] Shido!

18
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,291
I made these things
called "cookies"!

19
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,083
We were supposed make
them during cooking class,

20
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,208
and the other students
taught me how!

21
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,583
So do you wanna try one?

22
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,250
[SHIDO]
Uh. Sure.

23
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,083
I'd love to; thanks!

24
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,458
Hey, Tobiichi.

25
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,875
Huh?

26
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,583
No way. You get out.

27
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,416
Be careful, Shido; that witch
is going to do more damage!

28
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,708
I'm so sorry.

29
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,000
[ORIGAMI] Although, I know
an apology is hardly enough.

30
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,791
[AI] Why is the Super
Genius apologizing to him?

31
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,208
What are we missing?

32
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,083
[MAI] Maybe he's
got some dirt on her.

33
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,291
[MII]
That's so lame.

34
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,083
Oh. It's fine.
You can stop bowing now.

35
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,708
Just don't worry about it. Kay?

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,125
Listen up. No more
cheating, okay?

37
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,041
Get your stinky hands off him!

38
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,333
The report said that you stayed.

39
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,041
Tell me what you're
still doing here.

40
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,916
[TOHKA] That's none
of your business!

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,416
Now focus, Shido.

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,541
Forget about the stupid, ugly
witch, and eat my cookies?

43
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:07,250
[ORIGAMI] And mine.
I baked cookies, too.

44
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,791
[TOHKA]
You need to stop copying me!

45
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,500
Actually, I baked mine first;
so you're copying me.

46
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,625
Wrong!

47
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,291
And besides, look at
your dumb cookies.

48
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,375
I bet they suck.

49
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,750
Oohhh...

50
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,916
Yeah. They're not all
that great, so here eat!

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,375
Quick, before she tries
to make you eat her junk.

52
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,625
No, you should try mine first.

53
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,708
[SHIDO]
Yum. They're both good.

54
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,916
Mine must be better;
he ate it much faster.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Incorrect. He ate mine point
two seconds faster than yours.

56
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,375
[TOHKA]
Excuse me?

57
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,666
Hey, some strange
little stranger

58
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,416
just gave me a whole
bag of cookies.

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,291
Do you want one, Shido?

60
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,625
I'd let her, but she's
watching her figure.

61
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,250
[SHIDO] Man, it wasn't
supposed to rain today, either!

62
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,541
Huh.

63
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,708
Hey, Kotori; I made it home.

64
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,458
I'm gonna go take a shower.

65
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,291
[gasps]

66
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,666
Get out of here right now!

67
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,500
[SHIDO]
Kotori, what's going on?

68
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,541
Why is Tohka here?

69
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,916
Hey! Welcome back home, bro!

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,625
[SHIDO]
Oh, thanks.

71
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,208
Don't change the subject!

72
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,625
Now, please tell me what
Tohka is doing in our house!

73
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,416
Well, I've decided she
should live with us--

74
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,833
you know, at least
for the time being.

75
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,208
Okay, do you mind
telling me why that is?

76
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,958
We have a good reason
for this. Chill.

77
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,458
[SHIDO] Reine?
What are you doing here?

78
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,583
Oh. Sorry.

79
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,750
Am I using too much sugar again?

80
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,500
[SHIDO] No. Well, yes but
I don't really care about that.

81
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,791
Tohka's aftercare?

82
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,083
That's right.

83
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,625
Fortunately,
when she kissed you,

84
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,000
her Spirit power was immediately
and effectively sealed.

85
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,791
And now, there is
an invisible road,

86
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,333
what we call a Path,
between the two of you.

87
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,416
[SHIDO] Okay, but what's
this thing about a seal?

88
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,875
I explained that to
you after it happened.

89
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,125
When you kissed Tohka after
raising her mood points,

90
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,125
you, in particular,
were able to absorb

91
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,000
her Spirit powers and seal them.

92
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,166
So why is it I have
that kind of power?

93
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,416
[KOTORI]
I'm not sure.

94
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,083
I just got lucky
and figured it out.

95
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,333
With Ratatoskr's help.

96
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,625
Can I continue with my point?

97
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:49,666
Now, if the Spirit's mental
condition becomes unstable,

98
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,458
there is a significant
probability that

99
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,541
the power sealed inside
you will return back to her.

100
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,583
Huh?

101
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,583
[REINE]
Our research is conclusive--

102
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,875
Tohka's numbers are the most
stable when she is near you.

103
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:04,000
Until the special housing unit
for Spirits is completed,

104
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,750
it would be best for
everyone if she stays here.

105
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,500
Right. Whatever.

106
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,916
This isn't a bad thing.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,833
Consider it a part
of your training.

108
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,625
[SHIDO] You mean
I wasn't finished?

109
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,416
Tohka's powers are
already sealed,

110
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
what else am I supposed to do?

111
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,583
Did I say Tohka was
the only Spirit around?

112
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,125
There are more out there.

113
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,833
[REINE]
A lot more, in fact.

114
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,208
Special designation
disaster beings.

115
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,916
Also known as Spirits.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,041
They come in all shapes
and sizes, just like us.

117
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,541
We want you to continue
speaking with them, Shin.

118
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,375
We need you to become even
better at dealing with women.

119
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,958
The world needs you to become

120
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,041
even better at
dealing with women.

121
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,000
Great. No pressure at all!

122
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,166
But I still don't get why
I have to live with Tohka!

123
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,291
I-I apologize, Shido.

124
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,416
I knew it. I shouldn't be here.

125
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,208
No. You're fine; I'm a jerk.

126
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,125
[SHIDO sighs]

127
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,958
This weird is never gonna end.

128
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,916
[KOTORI] Shido!
The light's out in the bathroom!

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,583
Go change it, immediately.

130
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,666
[SHIDO]
Of course.

131
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,750
Fine. I'm on it!

132
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,125
Why does she have to be so mean

133
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,750
when she's in her
"Commander" mode?

134
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,583
I'm normally the one to
do this stuff, but still.

135
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,125
[gasps]

136
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,875
Sorry; I'm so sorry!

137
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,375
I should have knocked.

138
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,458
[TOHKA]
Close the door, you creep!

139
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,333
[KOTORI]
Someone was in a rush.

140
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,875
Shame on Shido.

141
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,291
You did that
on purpose!

142
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,333
[KOTORI] I told you this
was training, didn't I?

143
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,125
You need to learn how
to face any situation

144
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,833
calm and collected.

145
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,500
[SHIDO]
Tohka. I'm sorry.

146
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,125
I didn't know you were in there.

147
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,791
It's fine; I forgive you.

148
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,958
Just hand that to me, please.

149
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,416
Shido, I got a bath
all ready for you.

150
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,375
You can go ahead and wash up.

151
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,000
Nah, I'm good. You go instead.

152
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,625
Oh, and here. You can
use these if you want.

153
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,875
Ah!

154
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,375
[SHIDO] Kotori has
never given up

155
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,500
first dibs when I've got these.

156
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,666
She should know not
to underestimate me.

157
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,833
I, Shido Itsuka, haven't grown
up in the same house as you

158
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,125
without learning a thing or two.

159
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,041
[KOTORI]
That's so nice.

160
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,083
But, uh-- why don't you
go ahead and use them.

161
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,083
Thanks, though.

[door opens]

163
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,375
[SHIDO]
Hey, Tohka.

164
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,333
You're not taking
a bath right now?

165
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,041
No, I'm standing in this door.

166
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,333
Maybe I was being
too suspicious.

167
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,791
Go figure there are
Spirits besides Tohka.

168
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,666
I wonder how many there are,

169
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,041
and will I be able
to save them all.

170
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,541
[TOHKA humming]

171
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,791
[SHIDO] Kotori,
I'm gonna kill you!

172
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,583
Not my fault you're dumb!

173
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh crap!

174
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,041
Charge!

175
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,458
Hmm?

176
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,833
Ahh!

177
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,416
Um... Hi.

178
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,708
Ahh!

179
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,208
[SHIDO]
Calm down, Tohka!

180
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,583
[TOHKA] You can't just pop
out at me like that, you know!

181
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,291
[SHIDO]
I didn't pop. I said "hi"!

182
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,666
And another fail.

183
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,500
This is supposed
to be my training?

184
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,625
[TOHKA] Shido!
It's time for lunch.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,750
Why are you here, witch?
You're not welcome.

186
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,375
I was going to say
the same thing.

187
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,875
Can't we all just eat together?

188
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,041
What? What is it?

189
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,041
Stare all you want;
I'm not sharing.

190
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,375
Excuse me.
What is that?

191
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,375
[SHIDO]
Oh. Um. The thing is--

192
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,875
this morning we bought our
bentos from the same place.

193
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,000
I bumped into Tohka
while she was there.

194
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,333
Liar.

195
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,541
You bought this one hundred
fifty-four days ago

196
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,458
at the discount store
in front of the station

197
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,916
for fifteen-eighty.

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,333
You've been using the
same container ever since.

199
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,875
This is not from
the bento shop.

200
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,500
And how, exactly,
do you know this?

201
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,333
That's not
really important.

202
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,208
Ugh. Don't leave me out of
the conversation like that;

203
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,291
it's rude.

204
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,875
Now, what are you
two talking about?

205
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,500
Hey! Shido.

206
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,666
My girlfriend wants me to
help her pick out clothes.

207
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,500
Do you think a
French Maid is best?

208
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,333
Shrine maiden,
nurse, maybe stripper?

209
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,875
Dude, this is
not the best time.

210
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,666
Who cares if she's a
maid or whatever else!

211
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,666
Maid it is! Thanks, man!

212

[alarm sounds]

213

[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Your attention, please.

214
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,166
This is not a drill. There
have been precursory signs

215
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,208
of an impending spatial
quake in this vicinity.

216
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,541
[SHIDO]
Not again.

217
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,500
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
...nearest shelter immediately.

218
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,708
I repeat, there have
been precursory signs

219
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,541
of an impending spatial...

220
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,291
Kids! Another quake alarm!

221
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,458
We have to evacuate immediately!

222
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,583
Move it or lose it, as they say!

223
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,625
Leave?

224
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,500
[SHIDO] Yeah.

225
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,375
You want me to leave her behind?

226
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,500
Yes.

227
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,125
Remember, her powers
have been sealed,

228
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,791
so she's the same as
a normal human being.

229
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,375
Besides. We can't afford for
her stress levels to go up.

230
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,125
Watching a fight
might trigger that.

231
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,166
[SHIDO]
That's true.

Shido, Tohka, Miss Murasame,

233
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,250
why are you dawdling back there?

234
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,708
If you don't hurry
up and evacuate,

235
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:17,083
you're gonna be in serious
trouble and serious danger!

236
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,250
[SHIDO] Miss Okamine,
will you watch Tohka for me?

237
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,500
Huh? What?

238
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,750
Of course. I'll keep
an eye on her.

Shido.

240

Hey, Tohka. I need to
leave you here, okay?

Something just came up.

I have to go, but
I'll be right back.

Now? It's dangerous.

I'll be fine! I promise!

Where do you think you're going?

Oh, Shido.

Hey, you made it.

Well, for the aftermath, anyway.

It's smaller than
usual this time.

252

[KANNAZUKI] I'd like to
say this was a good sign,

253
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,708
but this is about
average for Hermit.

254
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,208
[SHIDO] Hermit?

255
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,291
[KOTORI] The name of the Spirit
that's appeared this time.

256
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,791
She's known for
being more docile

257
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,250
than the other
Spirits we've seen.

258

Hold on.

260
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,208
I've seen this girl before.

261
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,333
Where and when?

262
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,833
I met her at the shrine.
Two nights ago.

263
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,500
We were already
tracking her by then,

264
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,750
but we saw no disruption

265
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,750
of her main spirit wave
numbers at that time.

266
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,125
So, it's the same
as it was for Tohka.

267
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,708

How can they fire
on a little girl?

271
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,000
What she looks like
doesn't matter to the AST.

[SHIDO]
She's trying to run away!

273
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,708
What they're doing is wrong!

274
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,625
Don't feel sorry for her, Shido.

275
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,208
That behavior will
only make you weak.

Okay. I think it's about
time we go on another date.

entered the building.

hold your positions

until the target has moved.

287
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,958
[SHIDO] So, you think Hermit
is really going to come here?

288
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:14,291
[KOTORI] Yes. Based on the
analysis, there's no doubt.

289
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:18,208
The AST probably won't be able
to make a move for a while.

290
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,333
Don't tell me you're here
to bully Yoshinon, too.

Go with Two!

299
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,458
[SHIIZAKI] Isn't that
risky if you don't know

300
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,458
the other person's personality?

301
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,458
Seems One is our best bet.

302
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,916
[NAKATSUGAWA]
Hermit rarely attacks humans.

I'm gonna have to go
with Option Three.

Shido, go with Three.

Excuse me?

I don't know what you mean;
I'm just a wandering vagabond.

[laughs]

312
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,166
You're trying to make
me laugh, aren't you?

313
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,250
Nobody talks like
that seriously.

314

Heh, heh. Well, I'm glad
you liked my joke.

So my name's Shido. You are?

Oh, I'm sorry;
how embarrassing.

to introduce myself to you.

00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,875
Idn'it cute? Idn'it cute?

320
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,166
Uh, yeah. Sure. It's cute.

321
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,000
So is that your name. Or is
it the name of the puppet?

322
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,291
Do you guys share a name?

323
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,291
[YOSHINON] Uh...

324
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,583
[KOTORI] Shido!

325
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,083
Her happiness meter just
went down dramatically!

326
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,666
What did you say to her?

327
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,500
What? Nothing; I swear.

328
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,666
I was just trying to find out

329
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,916
why she only talks
through ventriloquism.

330
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,666
[YOSHINON] I do not know what
you are talking about, Shido.

331
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,375
What is "ventriloquism"?

332
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,916
[KOTORI] Look, we'll figure
out the cause of this later.

333
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
For now just work on
making her happy again.

334
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,666
Right, yeah,
I get your point.

335
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,625
So, Yoshinon's
just Yoshinon?

336
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,750
[chuckles]

337
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,583
Oh, Shido, you're
one of those people

338
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,750
who jokes around a lot,
aren't you?

339
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,541
Why did you come here?

340
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,833
Oh, because--
Well, I know it's sudden.

341
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,958
But will-- will you
go on a date with me?

342
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,916
[YOSHINON] A date?

343
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,083
[TOHKA] Do you think it's really
all that dangerous outside?

344
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,166
[TAMAE] There's no telling
how dangerous it is,

345
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,333
but with a spatial quake,
it's not worth the risk.

346
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,458
Seriously?

347
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,625
Tohka doesn't know
about spatial quakes?

348
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,583
Maybe she's like a
spoiled, super rich girl.

349
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,333
That's so lame.

350
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,291
Miss Okamine,
why do you think

351
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,875
Shido would leave during
such a dangerous time?

352
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,500
Honestly.
I have no idea.

353
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,333
You don't?

354
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,125
She wants to save him.
She's totally brave.

355
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,916
I wanna be her
when I grow up.

356
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,666
That's so lame?

357
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,541
Well, I'm sure Shido
will be perfectly fine.

358
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,041
There's really nothing to
worry about, Tohka; you'll see.

359
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,625
Huh?

360
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,833
[ORIGAMI]
Permission to shoot?

361
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,083
[RYOKO] Not gonna
happen for a while.

362
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,333
We're talking about
weak little Hermit here.

363
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,375
She hasn't been that
much of a threat, yet.

364
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,333
Nothing worth city damage and
a call for support troops.

365
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,625
The conditions with
her are different

366
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,708
than those with Princess.

367
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,833
I still can't get over it.

368
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,000
A girl looking just like
Princess transfers into

369
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,916
your class without any
Spirit reactions detected.

370
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,291
There's seemingly nothing wrong

371
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,083
with her family
register, either.

372
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,375
I keep racking my brain
trying to figure it out,

373
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,208
but, to tell you the
truth, I got nothing.

374
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,291
[YOSHINON laughs]

375
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,541
[YOSHINON]
Tell me what you think!

376
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,583
Am I cool or am I
the coolest ever?

377
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,250
[SHIDO] Hey, wait;
that's not safe.

378
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,291
Hey, wait.

379
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,333
I asked if I was
cool or the coolest!

380
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,125
Ah, ah!

381
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,833
That-- that was, um--
I uh-- didn't mean.

382
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,916
[alarm sounds]

383
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,583
[SHIDO] Crap,
she's gonna be pissed.

384
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,750
Ow. Hahaha.
Sorry about that, Shido.

385
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,416
I wasn't paying
enough attention.

386
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,250
[KOTORI]
Shido, it's an emergency!

387
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,375
What? Emergency?

388
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,333
Tohka?

389
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,541
Shido, what were
you doing just then?

390
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,166
What do you mean?

391
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,625
So after you worried
me half to death,

392
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,000
you came here to
make out with her?

393
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,458
How dare you!

394
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,875
[KOTORI]
See what I mean.

395
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,166
You're looking at a rather
unstable mental condition.

396
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,166
Her Spirit powers are gradually
flowing back into her.

397
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,458
[SHIDO] Really?
What should I do?

398
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,833
How rude!

399
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,541
Why didn't you tell me this
"something that came up"

400
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,875
was meeting this weird
looking little girl!

401
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,750
[SHIDO]
No, um-- She's uh--

402
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,708
[YOSHINON]
Hello there, angry lady.

403
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,208
My name's Tohka!

404
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,541
[YOSHINON] I hate to be the
bearer of bad news, "Tohka,"

405
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,333
but it seems as though
Shido's gotten bored with you.

406
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,541
[gasps]

407
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,041
Based on what you've
already communicated,

408
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,833
Shido stood you up to come here

409
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,416
and hang out with me
instead, isn't that right?

410
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,708
I think that's
fairly conclusive.

411
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,666
No! What are
you talking a--

412
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,500
Shido, you shut your
mouth right now.

413
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,500
[SHIDO]
Okay.

414
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,250
[YOSHINON]
I do apologize, though.

415
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,833
Being second best is never
an easy thing, is it?

416
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,208
It's because I'm so charming,

417
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,833
not because there's anything
wrong with you, Tohka.

418
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,708
But, it's not like
you can blame Shido

419
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,333
for blowing you off so he
could come play with me.

420
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,625
I am pretty adorable.

421
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,041
No!

422
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,458
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

423
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,333
This can't be
happening! It can't!

424
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,458
[YOSHINON]
You can scream all you want.

425
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,500
But you're about to
hear the brutal truth.

426
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:03,875
Go on, Shido. Tell this poor
thing she's not wanted anymore.

427
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,166
I am too wanted!

428
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,750
You-- You don't know.

429
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,375
Shido is the one
who said it was okay

430
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,833
for me to stay here with him.

431
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,375
Why are you lying to
me and being so mean?

432
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,791
I won't take it anymore!

433
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,958
Say something!

434
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,125
C'mon, why aren't
you talking, now? Speak!

435
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,375
What's wrong? It won't talk.

436
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,541
Make it talk!

437
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,375
[HERMIT]
I was trying to talk.

438
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,291
Give it back, please.

439
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,000
[KOTORI] What are
you doing in there?

440
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,958
The Hermit's mental condition
is all over the place, too.

441
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,333
They need to calm down!

442
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,500
Hey. So, listen, Tohka?

443
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:38,916
Could you maybe give
that back to her, maybe?

444
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,583
Shido. She was right.

445
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,583
You really do like
her better than me.

446
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,291
[SHIDO]
No! It's not that at all.

447
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,583
Zadkiel!

448
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,500
[growls]

449
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,791
Uh. What's that?

450
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,500
[SHIDO yells]

451
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,625
[KOTORI] Oh no!
She's releasing her Angel!

452
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,625
This is bad.

453
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,125
You have to get
out of there now!

454
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,333
Her Angel?

455
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,291
[KOTORI] Did you forget
Tohka's Sandalphon?

456
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,833
[SHIDO]
Watch out!

457
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,291
[HERMIT yells]

458

[ZADKIEL growls]

460
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,291
[ORIGAMI]
We lost her.

461
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,291
[RYOKO]
Everyone, return to base.

462
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,458
[SHIDO] You okay, Tohka?
You're not hurt?

463
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,250
I'm alright.
Will you just get away?

464
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,458
[SHIDO]
But, why?

465
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,708
Don't touch me!

466
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,833
[SHIDO winces]

467
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,000
Ah!

468
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,500
You like that little girl
better than me, I know you do.

469
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,625
Admit it!

470
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,416
Wait. What?

471
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,791
That's perfect.

472
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,125
Looks like someone's
got trouble in paradise.
