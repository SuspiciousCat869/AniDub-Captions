00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:15.224
[SOUMA] There are six elements:
fire, water, earth, wind,

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.850
light, and darkness,

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:18.894
which make up the
magic of this world.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:24.024
Fire, water, earth, and wind.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.068
Each of these elements
have their own specific

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.486
magic attacks.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.655
While light is basically
used for healing.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.367
Darkness alone is unique.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:36.620
It isn't specifically magic
that manipulates the dark.

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:38.664
Any specialized magic
that doesn't fall under

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.874
the previous five elements
is included under

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:42.251
this umbrella term.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.297
After observing Liscia and
Aisha during their training,

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.259
I noticed something one
can impart whatever magic

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.263
they possess into their
weapons and attacks.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.390
Additionally, there are
a few who can create

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.893
more powerful magic
phenomena known as mages.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:02.062
When a mage is assigned
to the armed forces,

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:05.566
the branch they are sent to
depends on their element.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:09.695
Fire goes to the army, wind
elementals go to the air force,

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.488
and water to the navy.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.949
As for earth, they end up
in the Forbidden Army,

00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:15.409
which reports to the king.

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:21.039
Moreover, light elementals,
which serve as medics,

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.083
are assigned equally
to each branch.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.461
Luckily for us, the
earth‐elemental mages

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.130
are under my command.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.132
Currently, I have the majority
of the Forbidden Army

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.510
employed in some civil
engineering projects.

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:36.221
Incidentally, my "Living
Poltergeists" are treated

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.724
as part of the
"other" category.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.727
In other words, they fall under
the title of dark magic.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:45.230
Time to take it outside
the castle and use it

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.690
for a little adventure.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:22.536
So, uh...

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.831
You're an adventurer
who's joining our party

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.583
for the time being, that right?

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.836
Hey, do you think
that could actually be...

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.754
The famed explorer
in a mascot costume

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.589
that we've heard rumors about.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.049
Despite his appearance,
apparently,

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.801
he has considerable skill.

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.302
Are you sure this guy's
gonna have our backs

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:40.679
when we need him?

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.015
Well, today's adventure
is to explore the tunnels

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.477
beneath the capital, which is
just a beginner‐level quest.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.812
I don't see the harm!

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.689
He seems charming enough.

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:52.649
Ugh. Like that'll
help in a fight.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.984
[DECE coughs]

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.236
In any event, I look forward
to working with you.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.532
[SNAKE roars]

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.291
[BAT shrieks]

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:16.965
He's a lot more agile
than he looks.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.134
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.141
Can't believe we were
assigned such an easy task.

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:28.351
All we have to do is walk
the tunnels beneath Parnam

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.520
looking for blocked
passageways, and, of course,

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.814
find out what wildlife
calls this place home.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.358
Stay alert since we don't
know what we'll find next.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.693
Everybody, stop!

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.779
‐‐What is it?
‐‐[YUNO] Something's ahead.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.238
[growling]

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.199
And it's huge, whatever it is!

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:49.289
‐‐Is that a salamander?
‐‐No way!

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.374
I've never seen one
reach that size before!

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.797
[FEBRAL] Stay back! Salamander
fluids are highly acidic.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.049
Close‐combat is
extremely dangerous!

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.426
Fine. Then we'll just have
to rely on my magic!

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.095
Not if they're fire‐based
attacks, though.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.598
Salamanders are immune to those.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.141
One choice. Ready?

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.188
Everyone, retreat!

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.524
[yelling]

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.858
[yelling continues]

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:27.619
[DECE]
Ow!

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.580
You've gotta run faster! Its
spit does serious damage!

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.415
Don't let it splash on you!

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:33.834
Like I want it to!

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.754
[DECE]
Master Mascot!

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.089
Cover your eyes, quick!

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.302
Why aren't you getting up?

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:12.956
[FEBRAL sighs]

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:15.584
We... We should
be safe out here.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.544
Wasn't this quest supposed
to be a breeze?

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:19.087
That was too close.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.882
We made it out just barely,
but is Master Mascot all right?

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.717
It looked like he took
some major damage

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.844
from that salivating salamander.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:29.055
Honestly, of all the times
you could've tripped.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.807
I don't even want to imagine
what would've happened

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.601
if I didn't come to your rescue.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:33.852
[squeak]

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:34.769
Huh?

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:38.106
There's no reason for you to go
and beat yourself up over it.

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.065
You're welcome.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:43.820
Still I did get saved by you, so
I suppose that means we're even.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:44.863
[trill]

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.782
Uh, excuse me?

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.784
Are you saying that you're glad
it was you that got burned

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.536
by the acid instead of me?

00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:55.749
Ugh! Well, you shouldn't be.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.542
I'm an adventurer, after all.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.837
When it comes to picking up
scars, I'm no stranger.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.923
It's almost like she's
discovered a way of carrying on

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.883
a conversation with him.

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:08.345
Even though Master Mascot
didn't say a single word,

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.640
how's it possible for Yuno to
know what he's thinking?

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.016
[JULIA]
Hmm...

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:16.478
I have a theory.
Could it be the power of love?

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.729
No way.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.032
[SOUMA sighs]

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:32.702
It's a good thing I added acid
resistance to him, just in case.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:35.205
[LISCIA] Souma! What are
you up to in here?

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:38.959
Um...

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.835
Your friend's gotten a lot
bigger from the last time

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:41.836
I saw him.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:44.923
I commissioned a craftsman in
town to make a larger version.

00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:47.300
You've been moving him around
with your Poltergeist magic?

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.052
Of course.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.429
Don't tell me the mysterious
"mascot adventurer"

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.306
everyone's been
buzzing about is‐‐

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.767
Yeah.
One and the same is my guess.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.106
You had him join an
adventurer party and explore

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.274
the underground passages?

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.901
But why would you
go and do that?

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.070
Huh? There was something
I was mulling over,

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.738
and I wanted to actually
see what the tunnels

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.408
beneath the capital looked like.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.619
I can't even begin to imagine
what you've got planned there.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.538
Did you turn up anything good?

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.665
[SOUMA]
A thing or two.

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:21.501
Also, the adventure
was pretty fun.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.187
I couldn't be more proud
of these faces.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.773
Eyes sunken,
showing no signs of life.

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:46.276
Your gaunt faces look like
the spirits of the dead

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.111
haunting their own graves.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:51.156
For several days now, you have
eschewed your bedrooms

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.075
to work battled with numbers
from morning till night,

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.119
and ignoring your families'
pleas to stop coming

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.662
to the castle.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:00.707
To put it simply, you are this
kingdom's true treasure!

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:01.708
Take pride!

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.835
For all of the mental strain
you've endured was for the sake

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.713
of saving Elfrieden and
guaranteeing its future!

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.925
It's thanks to all of
your work just now

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.720
we've secured the capital
desperately needed.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:15.764
Which will allow us to
earnestly move forward

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.266
with the much anticipated
Project Venetinova.

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:19.642
[CLERKS gasp]

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.687
[LISCIA]
Venetinova?

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.397
[SOUMA] Yeah, that's
the name of a new city

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.024
we're going to put here.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.068
Since it's on the coast, does
that mean that you're building

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.652
‐‐a port?
‐‐Just wait.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.613
I'm planning on
making it the largest bay city

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:32.822
in all of Elfrieden.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.283
But Lagoon City in the Walter
Duchy already serves

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.952
as our main seaport,
so why do we need another?

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.873
Souma! You don't mean‐‐!

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.917
Uh‐‐ It's nothing like that!

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.086
I'm not trying to start a
conflict with Duchess Walter,

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.128
really!

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.422
Then what exactly is your
reasoning for needing

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.007
to build a second port?

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.717
While we construct
our new city here,

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.220
we'll start building
roads outward.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.639
If we maintain a transportation
network from the port

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.350
to other cities, we can
control both maritime

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.644
and overland shipping,
making the distribution

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:04.187
of goods much smoother.

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.980
Once the project
reaches completion,

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:09.025
Venetinova will end up becoming
the heart of this nation.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.402
And the roads branching
off will be blood vessels.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.529
That's the plan.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.322
The kingdom's heart and vessels?

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.242
I mean, is smoothing out
the distribution of goods

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.910
really that big of a deal?

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.328
Yeah, I'm underselling it!

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.412
[LISCIA]
Uh...

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:25.250
[SOUMA] Liscia, do you know
how prices are determined?

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.460
Items people want
are expensive or cheap,

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.546
depending on the
number available.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:31.297
At the very least,
I know that much.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.550
Right. The price of goods
are determined in relation

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:34.884
to supply and demand.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.928
If there's an absolute
shortage of something,

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.473
that's out of our hands, but if
distribution is done smoothly,

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.017
whatever material we
experience a shortage in

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.936
can be brought over from
someplace where there's

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.479
a surplus.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.565
Once the commodity
excess and deficiencies

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.192
are resolved and a balance
between supply and demand

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:54.988
is achieved, inflated costs
will gradually decline.

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:58.074
So, all throughout the kingdom,
prices will begin leveling out.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.243
Naturally, I think lower
prices are a good thing,

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.912
but how do we make them go down?

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.123
Tell me, Liscia, what do
you think is the most

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.125
in‐demand item in the country?

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.002
The thing that people are
seeking more than anything

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.378
right now?

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.005
Uh...

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:13.548
Oh, right, food!

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.175
Yeah, exactly.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.969
There's a fundamental reason
for the food shortage.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.888
That's because our domestic
production of food crops

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.307
is at an all‐time low,
and as a result,

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:25.810
supply shortages are driving
prices up, spurring things on.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:30.899
No matter how much food costs,
you can't afford to stop eating.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.693
When prices go up, it puts a
squeeze on household budgets,

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.029
leaving less money to
spend on other things.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.282
And that's the reason this
nation's economy is stagnant.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:42.160
While converting our staple crop
away from cotton is proceeding,

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.579
we'll have to wait to
produce actual results.

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:46.414
But as of now,
out of all the options,

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.791
this is the most effective
measure we can take to control

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.586
skyrocketing food prices.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.880
It's imperative we secure
the necessary funds,

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.216
no matter what it costs
to make that happen.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.554
Once this project
is at completion,

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.515
our revolutionary reforms
will take a huge leap forward.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:05.934
But we wouldn't have
reached this point

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.727
without you cutting
out wasteful spending

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.313
and finding the capital
to build the harbor.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.233
On behalf of the people,
I thank you!

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:16.611
And yes, it's true your names
may not go down in history.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:17.487
But!

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.697
Together, you have made
a monumental contribution

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:20.698
to history.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.660
More than any hero
on the battlefield!

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:28.289
And believe me, I, Souma Kazuya,
will remember that all my life.

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.500
[CLERKS gasp]

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:33.211
Men! Truly!
You are the nameless heroes!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.504
[CLERKS gasp]

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.839
[SOUMA] All of you have
done an exceptional job!

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.967
You deserve a special reward,

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.803
so starting tomorrow,
you'll have five days off!

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:43.846
[CLERKS cheer]

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.890
Ordinarily, I would at least
present you medals

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.559
for your hard work, but dipping
into the funds you spent

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.604
countless hours securing would
defeat the entire purpose!

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:54.274
And for that, I feel
deeply ashamed.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.566
So, in lieu of a medal,

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.569
instead each take one bottle of
wine from the castle's cellar.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.572
Toast yourselves, sell it for
cash, or whatever you please!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.242
[CLERKS cheer]

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:08.871
What was all that?

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.291
I understand that this is
a huge accomplishment,

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:12.792
but weren't you a little
too worked up?

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.085
[SOUMA]
When operating on zero sleep,

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.171
I do have a tendency of acting
slightly over‐dramatic.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.882
[LISCIA] Speaking of which, why
not give your mind a break?

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.135
I mean, with your Living
Poltergeists' ability,

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:24.387
you can let your consciousness
rest in shifts, right?

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:28.975
I suppose.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:30.518
But then again,
we were right on the cusp

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.937
of securing the budget necessary
to begin construction

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.522
and time was of the essence.

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.316
So I kinda needed each
consciousness running

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:38.568
at full strength.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:40.778
I realize this is important
for the kingdom,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.405
but don't make me worry.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:44.365
There's no one else who
can take your place.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:45.533
[SOUMA laughs]

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:47.493
If something happens,
you could always summon

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:50.330
a replacement hero, can't you?

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:52.206
For now, I need to
get a little sleep.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.542
Afterwards, let's go inspect
the planned construction site

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:55.877
for Venetinova.

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:57.462
[yawns]

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:58.838
Ludwin's there now.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.632
He and his men should
already be starting their work.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.596
I need to go check on that.

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:09.474
I'll prepare a coach.
In the meantime...

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:12.977
[SOUMA snoring]

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.812
He's already passed out.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.773
Must have been more
tired than he thought.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:21.986
It is true.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.821
We could always try
and summon another hero

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.490
if we really needed to,

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.950
but they would be
someone different.

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:31.579
And I want you, Souma Kazuya.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.963
[SOUMA grunts]

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.635
This is closer to Parnam
than I was expecting.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:47.637
The trip was so short,
I'm not even hungry.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.392
It's located near the
center of the kingdom,

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:55.520
and geographically, it's an
ideal place to build a port.

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.063
Kind of makes you
wonder why a location

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:59.607
this well‐suited went
unused for so long.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.567
[LUDWIN]
Your Majesty!

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.945
Thank you for making
the trip out here!

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:05.947
Good to see you, Princess.

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:09.117
I welcome you to the future
site of Venetinova.

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:10.868
[AISHA]
Ahem.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.662
Ah, and thank you
for safely escorting

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:14.247
His Majesty here, Aisha.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.959
Let's get right into it, Ludwin,

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.920
and hear an update on how
construction is progressing.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:23.464
[LUDWIN] We've already finished
marking off the territory.

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:26.467
As for construction,
it was on schedule.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.928
What happened?
You ran into trouble?

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.263
Yes, well...

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:33.850
Let's not discuss here. I'll
explain the details inside.

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:36.519
There are people who are
opposed to the construction?

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.063
Yes, sire. They live in
a small village located

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:41.315
a little farther inland
from this point.

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.985
They're led by an older
gentleman named Urup,

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:47.113
and insist we mustn't
build a town on this land.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.240
Did they say why they
were so against it?

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.700
Brace yourself.

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.743
Apparently this is
the Kaijin's domain,

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.371
and if we erect buildings,
we'll incur its wrath.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.664
The Kaijin?

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.416
That's what their
sea god is called,

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.460
according to the
village elder, anyway.

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.546
Kaijin, the destructive
god of the ocean.

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.339
So this world has sea gods, too?

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.300
But do they actually exist
or are they a myth?

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.135
There certainly are people
who think there's something

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:11.179
monstrous living deep
in the ocean,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.515
but if you ask me, I'm
doubtful this Kaijin exists.

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:17.435
I've never seen it myself,
either, sadly.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:21.022
More than likely, it's just
some sort of local superstition.

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.941
Whenever houses are built
on the sea god's sacred land,

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.568
an enormous monster appears,

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.238
emerging from the ocean and
swallows the buildings up whole.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.199
A giant beast that
comes out of the ocean

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.950
and swallows all the houses up.

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.787
Ludwin, I need to hear
what this old man has to say

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.581
in person!

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.041
Tell me where I can find him!

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:42.877
Th‐The village he lives
in is relatively close by.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.296
If you'd like, I could
take you there now.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:46.339
[knocking]

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.259
I had a feeling
I'd see you again.

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.012
How many times do I need
to tell you about the Kaijin?

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:56.015
Building a town down
there is a deathtrap.

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:59.268
Forgive me, old‐timer,
but regarding this Kaijin,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.479
would you mind telling me
a little bit more, please?

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.356
And who might you be?

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:06.776
Oh, I'm just the acting King of
Elfrieden, Souma Kazuya.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:07.818
Huh?

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.196
Your Majesty!

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.200
Please continue, Urup.

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:15.785
Tell me more about this sea god.

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:19.664
It's not my place to make
demands of his Majesty,

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.749
but I beg you to reconsider.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:24.460
No matter what's happened,
this land has always belonged

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:25.836
to the Kaijin.

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:28.089
Whenever us land‐dwellers
dared to build houses

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.382
on its territory,

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.133
we would awaken
the sea god's anger,

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:33.052
and he destroyed our hard work!

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.428
[crying]

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.098
This village, the next one over,
and the one after that

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:40.726
have suffered generations
under the Kaijin!

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:43.563
No one dares live in
its domain anymore!

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:46.649
[URUP crying]

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.236
[SOUMA] Urup, since you're an
expert on the Kaijin's sacred

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.862
land and where it reaches,

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.406
would you mind pointing
it out to for me?

00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.580
[HAKUYA] So, this is the
sea god's sacred land?

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.665
Don't tell me Your Majesty
believes this legend

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.792
about the Kaijin
destroying towns?

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.752
No, it's nothing but a legend.

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.923
However, since the folklore
has been passed down

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.718
for generations, I believe
there's a moral to the legend

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.845
their ancestors
wished to convey.

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:16.929
A warning.

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.807
So, in reality, the sea god's
wrath is a metaphor.

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:23.019
Yeah, and the story
has one crucial lesson:

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.938
"Don't build houses
in this specific place."

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.899
You ignore the warning, an
unbelievably large monster

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.193
will emerge from the
ocean and swallow up

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:33.654
the structures you've built.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:37.241
I suspect that this sea god's
wrath is really a tsunami.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.410
[LUDWIN]
But sire, as long as I've lived,

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.245
I've never heard any
tales about that area

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.164
being struck by a tsunami.

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.541
Most likely because the
intervals between storms

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.959
are so huge.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.045
A hundred, 200 years.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:52.590
Maybe longer, and we're
talking about a millennia.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.175
A thousand years?

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:56.844
[SOUMA] Before returning to
the castle, I visited the other

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.138
villages surrounding the
construction site and asked them

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.015
about the folklore passed down.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.975
I received a rough estimate
as how much area

00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:04.852
the tsunami would cover.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.937
[HAKUYA] Which is represented
by the slashed‐out portion

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.981
on this map, right?

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:11.400
[LUDWIN] It completely overlaps
the proposed construction site

00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:12.652
for Venetinova.

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:15.237
Yeah, and almost
impressively so.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.906
[HAKUYA]
Then, Your Majesty,

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:19.283
knowing this, do we
cancel building the city?

00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:25.331
The project will continue
moving forward.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.335
Except we're changing
the construction site.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:32.296
Change the site?
But this far in?

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:35.174
While this V‐shaped topography
is suited to being a harbor,

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.676
there's just one major problem:

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:40.388
Should a tsunami occur, people
are at risk of being harmed.

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.306
I'm thinking of moving the
planned construction site

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:43.933
to this side.

00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:46.435
There? That area did actually
come up as a possible

00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:48.521
replacement site for Venetinova.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:51.148
But sire, you're talking about
planning for a tsunami

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.234
that may not even come
for a thousand years.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:54.944
Aren't you being
overly cautious?

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:57.947
If there's a one‐in‐a‐millennium
chance it'll strike,

00:19:57.988 --> 00:20:00.991
who says it couldn't be
during our lifetimes?

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.493
As long as there's
a remote chance,

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:03.994
I'd like to make
Venetinova a city

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.663
that can withstand disaster.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.415
Wise decision,
in line with your motto:

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:09.166
"to provide is to prevent."

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.127
When I consulted the elders
about what preceded

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:13.337
the sea god's wrath,
every one of them mentioned

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:16.632
how the ground would suddenly
begin violently shaking.

00:20:16.674 --> 00:20:18.551
Meaning earthquakes?

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:19.635
[SOUMA]
Precisely.

00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:21.429
When a large undersea
quake happens,

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.473
the fault movement causes the
sea floor to rise up quickly

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:27.685
and then sink down, resulting
in the sea's surface‐‐

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.188
Well, never mind
the reasons why.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.691
What's important is that if
the ground starts shaking,

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.986
even just a little bit, there's
a risk a tsunami's on its way.

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:39.780
Very well.

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:43.367
To be safe, let's factor in a
storm hitting the shoreline.

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.202
Knowing that's a possibility,
how does that event

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.954
alter our current plans?

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.664
Short version, people
need to flee the coast

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:51.041
as fast as possible if
an earthquake occurs.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.878
Ideally, they need to seek
shelter on higher ground.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.838
It is imperative we spread
this information,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.674
especially to the people
residing near the coastline.

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:00.301
As you wish, sire.

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:03.262
May I also propose we consider
appropriate locations

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.556
for the citizenry to retreat to,
and prepare routes there

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.600
in the event of an earthquake?

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:08.809
[SOUMA]
Please do.

00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:11.854
Now, as far as changes are
concerned to the construction,

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:14.231
first of all, we need
to create a bank here

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:17.151
and elevate our proposed site.

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.653
It shall be done, but that
is going to require

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.071
some time to finish.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.073
I'll have the earth mages
in the Forbidden Army

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.784
make it a priority.

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:26.994
May affect the construction
schedules elsewhere,

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:28.954
but still, can't be helped.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.623
Here's a possibility
to consider.

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.541
What if we placed the
residential and commercial

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.293
districts further inland?

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:36.253
[HAKUYA] Best to do the
same for any consulates,

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.838
and other important facilities.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.924
[SOUMA] It begs the question,
what do we do around

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.217
the port facilities?

00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:42.927
I've never met anyone
as fired up about building

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.804
a port as His Majesty.

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:47.473
We both know how he worked
like crazy securing the budget

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.475
to get this project
off the ground.

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:51.477
Naturally, he would
be passionate.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.395
It's admirable just
how much His Majesty

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:55.523
really does care
about the kingdom.

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:58.609
Yes, Aisha. He really does.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.319
May I ask you a question?

00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:01.403
[AISHA]
What is it?

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:04.657
Do you have feelings for
Souma, as in like him?

00:22:04.698 --> 00:22:07.952
You bet! I have immense
respect for him!

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.745
That's how you feel?

00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:11.622
Then let's support him
in every way we can,

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:13.123
so he can stay happy.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.750
Oh, you better believe I will!
