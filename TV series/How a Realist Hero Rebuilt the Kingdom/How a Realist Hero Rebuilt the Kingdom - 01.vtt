00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:26.944
[GRANDFATHER]
Kazuya.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.487
Why do you think it
is that people start

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.030
their own families?

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.496
So they don't have to die alone.

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.331
It occurred to me while
I was taking care

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.750
of your grandmother.

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:45.504
We lost our son and your
mother much too early in life,

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.965
but you're still here with us.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.633
And it was because
of you that we found

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:52.094
a new sense of
fulfillment and purpose.

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:57.683
Because of me?

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.727
One of these days, I'll go off
and join your grandma.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.648
When that day comes,
you'll be without a family.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.400
Build your own.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.944
And once you have
them by your side,

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:10.320
no matter what comes your way,

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.282
you have to keep them safe,
you understand?

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.200
Do that, my boy,
and I can guarantee

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.702
when the end finally arrives,

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.496
you will consider your life
to have been well spent.

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:22.332
I'm getting on in years,
this may be the final wisdom

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.667
I leave you.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.755
[SOUMA]
When he said those words,

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.716
I thought they sounded
like a dying wish.

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:36.722
Time has passed since then,
and Grandpa has joined Grandma.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.148
But I'm still here. All alone.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:26.915
[ALBERT]
Hmm...

00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:28.709
Whatever shall we do?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.335
Your Majesty.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.045
I don't know what we can do.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.842
Surely, something
has to be done.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.723
My king. At this point,
I believe our only option

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.099
is to summon a hero.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.238
[CHIEF PRIEST] You understand
the procedure, correct?

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.781
Yes.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.700
All right, then we
will now proceed

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.577
with the Hero Rite of Summoning.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:36.359
Huh?

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:49.247
[SOUMA yelling]

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:52.667
[SOUMA yelling]

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.843
[yelling]

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.979
What the‐‐Huh?

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.898
Am I the only one surprised
the summoning

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.399
actually worked?

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.777
I guess everything is
worth trying at least once.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.779
[SOUMA]
Wait. Summoning?

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.880
[ALBERT]
Ah! Hero! Welcome!

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:42.008
Thank you for answering our
call in these desperate times!

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.385
I didn't answer anything.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:46.555
I was summoned to this
place against my will.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.848
Uhh...

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.808
Yes. I suppose so.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.393
I can see why from
your standpoint

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.311
it would seem that way.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.689
By chance, you aren't upset
we forced you here

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.898
against your will?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.900
Oh, I don't know!
Wouldn't you be?

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.026
[ALBERT gasps]

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.698
At the very least, could you
explain the situation?

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.908
Then I'll decide if
I should be mad.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.743
An... explanation.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.204
That would be helpful.

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:15.500
Well, uh, the predicament
is as follows:

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.086
[NARRATOR] This is the
supercontinent of Landia.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:22.007
Several races, including
humans, elves, dwarves,

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:25.093
and dragonewts have
made this land their home,

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:29.306
forming a number of
countries of various sizes.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.600
However, roughly ten years ago,

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.852
on the northernmost end
of the continent,

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:36.396
a void to the Demon World
dimension appeared

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:38.857
and a horde of
monsters poured out.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.359
With their appearance,
all hell broke loose across

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.653
the northern countries.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:46.072
Under the banner of
the Gran Chaos Empire,

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.575
which boasted the largest
territory on the continent,

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.994
all the nations united
to form a punitive force

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:54.122
and mounted an invasion
against the Demon World.

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:57.918
Unfortunately, those forces
were obliterated.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.755
After the battle, the nations
lost their main military assets.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.090
They no longer had the strength
to repel the monsters

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.675
from the Demon World.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.844
The enemy continued
laying waste,

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:10.388
and now occupy a third
of the continent.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.016
Presently, this territory
is known as

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.644
the Demon Lord's Domain.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.313
As their monster forces
increase and the battle lines

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:22.108
continue to rapidly expand,
the outlook is grim.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.736
The nations of mankind can
barely keep them in check,

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.655
much less drive them back.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.908
To this day, a deadlock
remains firmly in place.

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.078
Uh‐huh...

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.747
I hope I'm not supposed to fight
these monsters on my own.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:39.042
Well, perhaps Marx
could explain it better.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:40.085
Huh?

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:47.342
The issue is... a hero is truly
a rare commodity to come by.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.385
Huh?

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:56.226
[JEANNE] As of this moment,
the Demon Lord's Domain

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.894
remains mostly quiet.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.522
However, our forces are
stationed at his border,

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.984
and have been informed
to remain ever vigilant.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:06.319
The soldiers' morale is high
since they've been charged

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.238
with protecting
the world of men,

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.240
but the longer the
troops remain there,

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.825
the more money's required.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.284
It's becoming problematic.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.040
Also, there is the other matter.

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:20.250
Other matter?

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.253
The Elfrieden Kingdom.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.131
They've been asked to
contribute to the war effort.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.968
The deadline is approaching,
but they have yet to respond.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.845
You're going to turn
me over to the empire

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.555
in the place of financial aid?

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.474
[ALBERT]
I'm terribly sorry about this!

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.767
And hope you can forgive us!

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.437
Uh, you see, while the
Demon Lord's Domain

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:44.065
doesn't border our own kingdom,
it abuts the Gran Chaos Empire,

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:46.985
which happens to be the
largest country in all Landia.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.403
Because of their brave efforts,

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.947
we see many benefits
and few monster attacks.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.323
But it costs.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.035
The empire requires financial
assistance from countries

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.411
that do not share
the border with

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:59.122
the Demon Lord's Domain.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.292
[SOUMA] So the issue ultimately
comes down to money.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.127
If the empire's willing
to fight them,

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.670
you have to pay them.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:08.256
[ALBERT] We'd love to‐‐
the only problem is we can't.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.217
Right. Our country has been
experiencing a continuous

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.469
shortage of food.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.262
The expansion of the
Demon Lord's Domain

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.765
has sent us refugees who were
chased from their homes,

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.933
and the cost of feeding
them is astronomical.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.727
As things currently
stand, we are in

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.396
no position to supply
any financial assistance.

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:26.983
However, within the empire's
request for aid,

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:28.985
there is a clause that
states that if we cannot

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.361
contribute financially,

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.572
we may perform the Hero
Rite of Summoning.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.324
The sacred ritual of
bringing forth a hero

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:36.826
has been handed down in our
kingdom for generations.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.204
We can send you
instead of funds.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.121
That's tradition.

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.873
It's with the utmost
reluctance, we‐‐

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.000
You'd be more than willing to
sell off your own daughters

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.044
if it meant paying
your debts, right?

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.591
So, after handing
the empire a hero,

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.218
what will happen to me after?

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.054
Well, we're a little
murky on the subject.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:59.015
[SOUMA] All right, then what
makes a hero in the first place?

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.142
Legends says that
a hero is the one who

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.520
will lead the revolution
into a new age.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.604
[SOUMA]
The what?

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.318
No disrespect, but that's
more than a little vague.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.737
Eh, the thing is...
information is scarce.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.990
So the who and what of a "hero"
are shrouded in mystery.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.868
Seems like the empire has
an interest in them, though.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.662
I hope they don't want
you to hand me over

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:24.249
for dissection or anything
else equally as macabre.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.460
Not reassuring.

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.295
There isn't a chance in a
million that they would do

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:30.338
such a thing!

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.674
Yes, a million!
Well, a thousand.

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:34.717
Eh I'd put the odds
at about a hundred.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.636
[SOUMA] Why's the
possibility keep going up?

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.559
[SOUMA] Seems as though I'm
stuck here for the moment.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.019
My original life plan was
to become a civil servant,

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.689
but now here I am,
at risk of being dissected

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.691
in some fantasy adventure.

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:50.775
[ALBERT]
Uh...

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.154
[SOUMA] I could run, but without
any knowledge of the castle,

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.780
that's easier said than done.

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.574
Plus, if I screw up
and get captured,

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.118
this whole situation
will only get worse.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.370
Which basically means
the next thing I say

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:05.832
pretty much determines my fate.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:08.918
If I may, permit me
to ask one more thing?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.628
Uh, I suppose so.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.089
Are requests made by the
empire limited to this one,

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.883
or are you expecting some more?

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.885
Well, of course
they would need...

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:18.845
Actually, the way I see matters,

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.306
there's no end to these
requests in sight as long as

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.683
the monsters persist
in their attacks.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.268
I'm sure you're
right about that.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.353
So. I have another question.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.647
Going back to the rite
of hero summoning.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.649
As long as you perform
the full ritual,

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.443
would you be able to summon
however many people

00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:34.694
that you would need?

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.280
Oh, so, you see,
that's complicated.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.618
[MARX] Uh...
According to our records,

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.078
we did summon a hero
prior to you.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.955
Nearly 500 years ago.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:49.209
That took place only the once,
and at our nation's founding.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.128
There were of course several
failed attempts over the years.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.173
Assuming that's true,
this is significant.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:58.343
I'm pretty much the one card
this country has to play.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:11:59.928
Does that sound about right?

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.096
Um... Yes, I would say so.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.765
[SOUMA] In that case,
doesn't giving me up

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:07.143
to the empire right now
seem a little vacuous?

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.770
I‐‐ eh, come again?

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.897
As you know, dear,
"vacuous" means

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.358
something that's done
without any thought.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.527
Ah, yes, that vacuous,
of course.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.780
[SOUMA]
I think it might be working.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.907
And if we are truly
thinking ahead,

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.159
we should review
the country's finances.

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.203
And then adopt new policies.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.622
Ones that will help to increase
the Elfrieden Kingdom's

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:31.209
national strength so we can
reject imperial demands!

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:33.920
Enough influence and power
that we could say no to

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.797
even the Gran Chaos Empire?

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.131
Us? But how?

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.050
Accomplishing such a
feat would require‐‐

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.009
[SOUMA]
A hero?

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:43.179
Am I not supposed to lead the
revolution into a new age?

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.142
And this act is merely
the beginning.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:51.396
We might be able to bring
real change to this country.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.615
Change the country.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.284
That was the idea.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.619
Only problem was
I didn't have a plan.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.830
Still, all I need to do is
find a way of coming up

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.290
with the aid money.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:13.126
To start off, tell me about
all the country's finances.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.211
I want to hear everything
that's in place.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:18.006
I need to take a close look
at the budget reports,

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:21.217
data on agriculture, forestry,
fisheries, the economy,

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.927
infrastructure, and transport.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:25.972
Prime Minister, if you
would please be so kind?

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.140
At once.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.561
[NARRATOR] And so, a wide range
of topics were discussed.

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:34.022
The conference between the
Elfrieden king, Albert,

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:36.524
Prime Minister Marx,
and the hero, Souma,

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.192
went on longer than expected.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.194
Lasting for three days
and nights.

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.325
[ALBERT]
Hark and listen!

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:47.910
I request your
undivided attention.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.330
I, Albert Elfrieden,
the thirteenth King

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:54.292
of the Elfrieden nation,
being of sound mind and body,

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:57.879
hereby abdicate the throne
and transfer all of its powers

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.091
over to our summoned hero,
Souma Kazuya!

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.968
[SOUMA]
Uh... Wha‐‐?! Huh?!

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.554
Further,

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:09.557
I am pleased to announce the
engagement of my daughter,

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:13.478
Princess Liscia Elfrieden,
to heroic, newly appointed

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.812
King Souma!

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.481
[COUNCIL MEMBERS gasp]

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:17.648
[SOUMA]
Huh?!

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:22.403
[NARRATOR] April 1546 by
the Continental Calendar.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.405
The King of Elfrieden
hands the throne over

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.366
to Souma Kazuya.

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:28.326
This news quickly spreads,

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:31.204
reaching the Three Dukedoms:
a trio of rulers who head

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.247
the kingdom's armed forces,

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.958
creating a significant
stir among them.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.544
What?
Albert abdicated the throne?

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.797
[TOLMAN]
Yes, sir. And there is more.

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:43.174
He has ceded the
throne to Souma,

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.759
the hero they summoned.

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:55.103
That's certainly a bold move,
and coming from

00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:57.021
King Albert of all people.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.484
[GEORG]
When this news reaches her,

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.862
I'll bet Princess Liscia
will be beside herself.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.121
Father, Mother, hold on!

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.539
I'll rescue you!

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.042
[ALBERT]
Mm, hmm! Hmm...

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.919
Right there, right there.
That's the spot.

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.171
[door opens]

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:25.508
Father! Mother? You're fine?

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.551
It's absurd!

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:27.969
I heard that the throne
had been usurped

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.846
and came running to save you!

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:32.598
Only to find you two casually
carrying on like that!

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.144
As you can see, the throne
hasn't exactly been usurped.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:39.897
I abdicated it in favor of
Souma of my own free will.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.358
But why go and make
such a rash decision?

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.818
It was hardly rash.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.862
Though I've spent a short
amount of time with him,

00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:47.697
I'm convinced he will
make a better king

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:49.157
than I ever could.

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:51.993
It was a decision made
responsibly by the individual

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:53.870
in charge of this country.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.872
And I won't have any arguments!

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.332
But Father, how could you
declare my engagement

00:15:58.374 --> 00:15:59.959
without even asking me?

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.794
Concerning that matter,
it is ultimately

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.629
a discussion for the two of you.

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.007
While there is no denying
the marriage arrangement

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:07.842
was my idea originally,

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.427
if you don't want
to go through with it,

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.929
I highly doubt that
Souma will insist.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.098
Mother, is he being serious?

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.185
My dear, you should go
and meet Souma first,

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:19.604
then decide whether
or not he's for you.

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.939
We can't just force you
to love someone.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:28.613
[LISCIA] They can't expect
me to discuss the matter

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.072
civilly with him.

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:33.075
Obviously this Souma guy
is up to no good.

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:34.243
[LISCIA]
I'm coming in.

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.623
Hey, whoever you are,
gimme a hand.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.626
Uh... Pardon?

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.378
Hold up.
You are able to read, right?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.591
Please. I'm not some idiot!
I've had an extensive education!

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:49.884
Then what's three plus two?

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:50.760
[LISCIA]
Five.

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:51.928
And six times two?

00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:53.471
[LISCIA]
Twelve, obviously.

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:55.223
Forty‐two divided by seven?

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:58.100
Seven, or‐‐ I mean six!
I got confused!

00:16:58.142 --> 00:16:59.227
[SOUMA]
Good enough.

00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:01.854
Get over here and help
me with the budget.

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:03.022
What, help you?

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:05.441
Just who do you think
me to be, anyway?

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.610
Reserves to help me
with these finances.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:11.030
I am Liscia Elfrieden,
the king's‐‐I mean‐‐

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.865
Former King Albert
Elfrieden's daughter,

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.618
and you will show me respect!

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.870
Seriously? You're a princess?

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:18.955
[LISCIA]
Isn't it obvious?

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:20.289
Well, not really.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.250
That looks like
a military uniform.

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.169
[LISCIA] Because it is
a military uniform!

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.879
I'm stationed with the
army under the command

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.464
of Duke Carmine.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:31.008
I was out there performing
my patrol duties

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.760
then rushed home when
I heard the news.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:34.554
Now that you mention it...

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.055
Yeah, I should've known.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.140
There is something
princess‐y about you.

00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:41.269
Oh, right.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.854
Name's Souma,
and for better or worse,

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.314
I'm the new ruler here.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.485
And I used to be this
kingdom's princess.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:52.613
Before you came along, that is,
and stole the throne away.

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.699
I'm not quite sure
what I am now.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.325
[SOUMA]
Excuse me, stole?

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:57.868
If you'd been here,
you'd know the king

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.204
was more than happy
to push the crown on me.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.998
[LISCIA]
Perhaps you could explain that.

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.583
I realize you're the hero
they summoned

00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:06.252
to trade to the empire,
but you just arrived

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:09.088
and suddenly my father
makes you our sovereign?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.965
I'm just as confused as you.

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:12.758
I was just looking out
for my own safety,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.760
and suddenly I'm running things.

00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:15.803
Oh?

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.602
I do wonder whether
the two of them

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:24.562
will find common ground.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:27.023
[ELISHA]
They'll be fine, dear. Trust me.

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:29.984
[SOUMA] When I brought up
fiscal reforms, I knew

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.611
I might be put in charge
of the kingdom's

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:35.031
financial management
or something like that,

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:37.491
but I never expected
to be made its king.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.118
Uh, so listen.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.911
I'm sorry for how I acted.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.122
You have nothing
to apologize for.

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:44.915
Hey. You're the victim here.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.251
No one asked whether you
wanted to get engaged.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.295
Yeah. Concerning that, I‐‐

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:52.173
[SOUMA] Don't worry about
the whole betrothal thing.

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:54.967
I'm only keeping the throne
warm for a little while.

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:58.095
After a few years, I'll probably
retire from this king gig.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.513
Really?

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:02.016
All I want to do was
fill up your coffers.

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.768
It was the only way
I saw to keep myself

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.312
from being handed
over to the empire.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.481
Then again, now that
I've been given the throne,

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:10.107
you know, can't waste it.

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.984
Least I can do is get
this country's finances

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.402
back on track.

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:16.030
But, after it's on
the right track,

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.282
I'll let this country
handle the rest.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:20.910
Of course, you can cancel
our engagement.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:24.705
Such arrogance!

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:26.082
You say you're going
to quit being the king

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.958
after only a few years.

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.543
Can you really do
anything for the kingdom

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:31.128
in that short amount of time?

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.922
And before you answer,
let's start with

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.466
all the aid to the empire.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.009
Oh, that.

00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.387
I've already secured
the necessary funds.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:51.232
It looks like they found
someone to act as custodian.

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:54.110
We should be getting
the Elfrieden exports soon.

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:56.529
[SEBASTIAN] There is a great
demand among the wealthy

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.824
when it comes to jewelry
sourced from royal families.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.575
Investing funds in
order to snatch up

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.869
the standout pieces
was the right call,

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.705
Princess Roroa.

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:08.499
And as a result, we did
a fair bit of business.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.543
I must confess,
this new king of theirs

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:13.087
is certainly making
some bold new policy.

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.214
Elfrieden can't afford
to hold onto jewels

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.841
while its citizens starve.

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:19.635
They need to jumpstart
their economy.

00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:23.139
At first, I wasn't sure why they
made that hero their king,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.015
but based on what
I've seen so far,

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:27.226
he could be a
formidable opponent.

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:28.477
Yes.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.520
Huh?!

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.605
You sold off our
national treasures?

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:33.899
The national treasures belong
to the whole country!

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.651
You can't just give them away!

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:37.528
Come on, would you take it easy?

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.530
If they belong to
the whole country,

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:40.948
then it's fair to sell
them for the sake of

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.616
the nation's subjects, right?

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:43.993
Yeah, all right,
but there were numerous

00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:46.162
cultural and historical pieces!

00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:49.665
[SOUMA] True, which is why
I made sure not to sell those.

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:50.750
In Group A,

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:54.295
I placed national treasures that
have historic or cultural value.

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:57.131
Those with neither
went into Group B.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.133
The remainder were
put into Group C.

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.594
Only B was sold.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.804
When it comes to A's
fundraising potential,

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.890
they have more long‐term
value put on display

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:06.932
in a museum.

00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:09.185
It wouldn't make much
sense to sell them off.

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:11.061
It was smart of you
to categorize them,

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.064
but what about Group C?

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.983
[SOUMA]
Magical tools, which frankly,

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:17.651
I'm not sure how to handle.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.987
I would label those
more as weapons.

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.739
We can't put them on display

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.908
or risk the wrong
person buying them.

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:27.870
Speaking of, there is a full
set of antique hero gear.

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:31.123
If we find the right buyer,
it should fetch a ton of cash.

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:32.166
Sound good?

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.417
You wouldn't dare.

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:35.503
Just what kind of hero are you?

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:36.504
[SOUMA chuckles]

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:45.971
[EXCEL chuckles]

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.230
Despite his sudden
ascension to the throne,

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:57.441
the country appears quite
tranquil on the surface.

00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:00.319
The question is how
long will that last?

00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:02.112
Anyhow. Canaria.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.660
See this new hero‐turned‐king
with your own eyes.

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:09.912
Determine how capable he is.

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:12.623
[LISCIA] Putting a price on
all our national treasures.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.708
Not what I expected from a hero.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.044
[SOUMA] If I hadn't, they
would have handed me over

00:22:17.086 --> 00:22:18.671
to the empire.

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:20.548
That is true, but still.

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:24.051
Tell me. Have you already sent
the aid money to the empire?

00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:25.719
No, not yet.

00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:27.346
I told them to hold off
on paying until

00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:28.848
the last possible day.

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:30.933
Then how about instead of
giving it to the empire,

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:33.352
you redirect the funds
to the military?

00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:35.437
After all, your ultimate goal
is to get our kingdom

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.274
enough power to
resist them, is it not?

00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:40.901
At the military academy, they
taught us to spend heavily

00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:44.488
on defense, and nothing
when it came to tribute.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.283
So rather than offering payment
for a momentary peace,

00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:48.826
in the long run,
the wiser choice would be

00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:50.786
to invest in building
our military?

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.248
Allow me to chain your
adage and immediately

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:55.499
activate my own!

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:56.959
"Time equals money"!

00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:59.378
The financial assistance
takes on this card's effect,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.297
and by sacrificing it,
we gain time,

00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:03.716
which is what our country
needs most in this situation!

00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:05.593
What're you doing
with your voice?

00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:07.177
Never mind that.

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.930
Here's my point.
Say we build up our military.

00:23:09.972 --> 00:23:13.100
If we neglect our domestic
problems, it means nothing.

00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:16.312
Until we resolve our food
shortage and refugee crisis,

00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:18.939
we'll continue losing
the people's support.

00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:20.816
It wouldn't take much
work for an outside force

00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:22.776
to instigate an uprising.

00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:24.904
The country would be
in a vulnerable state.

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:26.030
A revolt?

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:28.741
Not the people of Elfrieden;
they love their country!

00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:29.950
They wouldn't dare!

00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.702
That's idealistic thinking.

00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:33.704
The fact is,
when people go hungry,

00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:36.248
morals and patriotism vanish.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.042
You can't show concern
for others if you have

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.210
no breathing room yourself.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.503
Agreed?

00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:44.298
It's true what they say.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.508
You really are a huge realist.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.593
Know what?

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:50.179
Perhaps I am.
