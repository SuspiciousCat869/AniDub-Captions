WEBVTT

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.075
[JUNA]
Your Majesty?

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.785
It's me, Juna Doma.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.996
[SOUMA]
Juna? Come in.

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:02.164
[JUNA]
Please, excuse me.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.305
I spoke with
the princess earlier.

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:20.974
She said you had not
been sleeping lately.

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.644
Don't get me wrong,
my body wants to,

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.604
but my mind's too active
going over things

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.105
to let me shut my eyes.

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:43.872
Would you lie down?

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.625
Just lie back for me, please.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.178
You really need
to get some rest.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.514
I realize you don't like
showing any vulnerability,

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.058
but I am on your side.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.851
I've noticed how you
do everything you can

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.813
to avoid looking miserable
in front of the princess.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.148
And the tremendous effort
you put into appearing

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.608
strong for her.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.485
But sire, when it gets
to be too much,

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:14.820
please call on me.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.084
You've nothing to fear.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.670
If the princess is responsible
for drawing out your strength,

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.880
then I'll be the one who
conceals your weakness.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.286
[CASTOR] If we plan to act
before opinion tips in Souma's

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.121
favor, is now not the time?

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.625
Then I assume you're still
planning on rebelling

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.711
against the king, Castor?

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:15.964
Absolutely! I could care
less if he's a hero!

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.007
And what about you?

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.759
You disliked the king,
which is why you refused

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.969
his request for assistance,
remember?

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.096
What comes first for me,
above all else,

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.807
is the peace and safety
of Lagoon City.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.684
We're acting as though
our neighboring countries

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.978
aren't waiting for their
opportunity to strike.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.480
Yet here we are quarreling.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:32.731
Preposterous.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.983
I assume you mean Amidonia.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.568
What about their offer:

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.445
"If you wish to dethrone
the false king,

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:40.739
we stand ready to
send reinforcements."

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.992
I'm sure they sent the same
offer to the king, as well.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:47.245
Obviously, they're hoping
we'll bring each other down.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.539
Care to tell us what you
have in mind, Georg?

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.628
Be specific.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.880
For one who claims to
be loyal to this country,

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.799
some might see your
decision to take action

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.426
against its new
ruler as peculiar.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.137
Questions of the king's
legitimacy aside, his reign

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.555
has been sound.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:08.266
Why would you deliberately
try to make waves?

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.686
I have determined that he cannot
govern this nation effectively.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:12.896
End of story.

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:14.022
[EXCEL]
And why is that?

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.399
He has overcome a number
of crises already.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.485
What do you find unsatisfactory?

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.030
[GEORG] He cast aside years
of tradition without even

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.406
a thought!

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.119
This upstart king was summoned
here from a different world.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.956
Thus, he does not hesitate
to abandon our customs,

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.500
but discards what
he finds inefficient,

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:37.379
such as our history and
traditions, or am I mistaken?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.880
[EXCEL]
Well, no, b‐‐

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:40.715
He did away with officials
who served the kingdom

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.551
faithfully for many years.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.594
Those who have ill will
towards him will be

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:48.473
effective pawns
in his overthrow.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.309
[EXCEL] So that you may ascend
to the throne yourself?

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.311
That is Duke Carmine.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.397
He has no intent
to usurp the throne.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.193
Clearly. After the usurper
is driven out,

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.320
I will have King Albert
reclaim the crown

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.738
and serve him again.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.874
Castor, in case anything
should happen to you,

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:17.210
it'd be prudent to sever ties
with Accela, Carla, and Carl.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:18.712
[CASTOR] You're implying
I'll be bested by that

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:19.838
lightweight child?

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.883
If you stand against the king,
you should make preparations

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.385
in case things don't turn
out the way you had hoped.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.392
[EXCEL]
Carla?

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:33.768
I've made my choice!

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.103
If Father is committed
to fighting,

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.230
I will stand beside
him in battle!

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.565
You will not!

00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:41.276
Do you intend to turn traitor
at such a young age?

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.445
After deposing King Albert
and trying to violate

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:46.656
my friend Liscia, Souma cannot
be allowed to continue ruling!

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.992
[EXCEL] You misunderstand the
situation! King Souma‐‐

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.744
You needn't be concerned for me.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:54.623
I, Carla, daughter of House
Vargas, will end his reign!

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.011
[JULIUS]
What do you have there, Father?

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:10.055
A message from Georg Carmine.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.182
It seems he's finally
taking a stand.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.440
About time he got off
his hindquarters.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.484
The years have taken their toll.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.402
Back in his prime, the Duke
would never have been

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.488
foolish enough to
accept any invitation

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.198
that we extended to him.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.532
[JULIUS]
That's for certain.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:35.622
[GAIUS] War has been declared,
and so we shall act.

00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:38.833
Reinforcements will be
sent to the kingdom.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.877
[JULIUS] And to whom will
we be sending them?

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.253
[GAIUS]
Whom, you ask?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.716
Why, to King Souma against
the Three Dukedoms,

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.259
and we'll send the
Three Dukedoms troops

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.387
to overthrow him, of course.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.138
You really are
the worst, father.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.770
[ROROA sighs]

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.773
Good grief. What am I going
to do with that old man

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.400
and my dumb brother?

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.652
As if Amidonia's strength
wasn't meager enough,

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.862
now they want to stretch
it even thinner!

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.407
Pardon me, best not
to speak of such things

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.534
so blithely, Roroa.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.453
On the other hand, the Elfrieden
Kingdom has it nice.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.081
A large population means tons
and tons of tax money

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.749
and operational capital.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.042
Seriously, though.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.628
How can I not be envious
of our neighbor's coffers?

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:26.506
Hold on.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.139
[HAKUYA] As the documents state,
we can look forward to

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.183
a plentiful harvest this fall.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.561
I think it's fair to say the
crisis with the food shortage

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.771
has been largely remedied.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.065
That's a relief to hear.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:47.736
Now that we've resolved that,
we can move on to the next step.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.239
So, then, we really have
to go through with it?

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.074
I see it weighs on you.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.285
[SOUMA] Well, yeah. I understand
that it's necessary,

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:56.327
but still.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.750
I mean, what other
choice do we have?

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.752
In Machiavelli's <i>The Prince</i>,

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:06.671
the famous political thinker
says the following:

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.257
[MACHIAVELLI] If a prince
must turn to acts of cruelty,

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.259
then his position,
even in peaceful times,

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.886
is in jeopardy.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.304
However, some rulers,

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.556
despite the length and
breadth of their cruelty,

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.600
live out long lives
in tranquility,

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.727
staving off domestic
uprisings and the threat

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.562
from external enemies.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:25.148
The difference depends entirely
on whether the ruler's

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.443
"cruelties" are used
effectively or poorly.

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.570
[SOUMA] They should be
viewed as a sword.

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:33.823
A last resort to cut
through all obstacles.

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:36.076
But if he relies too heavily
upon the blade,

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.953
then as the proverb goes,
"live by the sword,

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.246
die by the sword."

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.796
As I've said before,
I've made the determination

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.090
your plan will be one
of these "cruelties."

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.133
Indeed, I also remember
you saying that

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:55.136
if we must strike, then it
should be one decisive blow.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.227
[SOUMA'S GRANDFATHER]
One of these days, I'll go off

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.895
and join your grandma.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:07.732
When that day comes,
you'll be without a family.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:11.986
Build your own, and once you
have them by your side,

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.321
no matter what comes your way,

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:15.949
you have to keep them safe,
you understand?

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:20.912
[SOUMA]
Now's the time!

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.622
Let our subjugation begin!

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.057
Now's our time!

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.725
Assemble the troops!

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.186
As soon as Duke Carmine
begins his revolt,

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:48.606
we will commence our invasion
of the Elfrieden Kingdom!

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.192
Our target is the grain belt
in the southwest!

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:54.404
Fifty years ago, our land was
stolen from our forefathers.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:55.989
It's time we reclaimed it!

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.907
[COLBERT]
A moment, please! If I may.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.745
[GAIUS]
What is it, Colbert?

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.622
[COLBERT]
If I may humbly say so,

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.709
please reconsider invading
Elfrieden, Your Majesty.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.503
If you begin a war right now,
our people will starve.

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:27.312
You domestic affairs ministers
always say the same thing.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:30.857
"Now is not the time, focus
on matters at home."

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.193
And what do you have
to show for it?

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.904
Ever since Elfrieden's new king
ascended to the throne,

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:39.616
their national strength has
made a significant comeback!

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.659
I beg you to listen to reason.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.995
If you enter into Elfrieden,
our nation will be open

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.831
to censure from all of
the other countries!

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.500
Don't forget, we are signatories
under the empire's

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.169
Declaration of Mankind's
Common Front

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.004
Against the Demon Race!

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.924
The Mankind Declaration, huh?

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.051
[SOUMA]
Headed by the Gran Chaos Empire,

00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:00.053
the Declaration of Mankind's
Common Front

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.304
Against the Demon Race,

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.389
or "Mankind Declaration"
for short,

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.724
is the decree from the empire,

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.894
which has the largest
territory and military.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.979
It's an international
treaty that states owing

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.440
to the expansion of the
Demon Lord's Domain

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:15.860
all conflicts between mankind
must come to an immediate halt.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.612
In order to keep the demons
from encroaching

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:20.323
any farther south,
mankind must work together,

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.076
as a unified force to
push the enemy back.

00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:26.788
Its main points consist of
the following three articles:

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:28.831
Of the three, the first
article states that,

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:31.251
should there be any changes
within mankind's borders

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:34.379
as a result of conflict,
they will not be recognized.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.631
If we invade Elfrieden, we will
be courting intervention

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.425
from the empire and
our allies, Your Majesty!

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:41.135
I'm begging you to reconsider!

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:51.562
You're worrying over
trivial matters, Colbert.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.524
Unlike our great nation,
Elfrieden chose not to sign

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.526
the Mankind Declaration.

00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:00.196
Julius, sire,
that's just sophistry!

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.073
You should know when
it comes to diplomacy,

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.325
only signed treaties
carry any weight.

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.995
‐‐But sire!
‐‐Enough, you fool!

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:09.122
As of this moment, you are
removed from your position

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:10.832
as finance minister!

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.463
Oh, yoo‐hoo, Mister Colbert!

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.966
Why the glum expression
on such a beautiful day?

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.884
Princess!

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.095
[ROROA] By the looks of that
bruise, you and my old man

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.264
must have had a
difference of opinion.

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:27.557
Allow me to assure you,

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:29.600
I'm in perfect health
and spirits, Princess.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.643
Good to hear.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.270
Then go get ready to leave.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.314
[COLBERT]
Huh? I beg your pardon?

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.316
Just what exactly are
you planning to do?

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:37.567
Isn't it obvious?

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:39.736
We're both going to
drop out of sight.

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.487
Sebastian's already gathering
everything we need

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:42.989
for the trip.

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.532
So, for now, just come with me.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:47.368
Hey!

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.455
[LISCIA]
What is it, Souma?

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.457
I'm about to meet with
the Three Dukes.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.211
But before I do,
there's something I need

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.629
to ask you, Liscia.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:21.235
I think this is the first time
we've met face‐to‐face.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.821
Dukes, I am Souma Kazuya,
the interim king,

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.240
to whom King Albert, the
previous ruler of Elfrieden,

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.618
yielded the throne.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:32.038
Duke Castor Vargas,
general over the air force.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.040
At last, I may greet
our new king.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.541
It's a pleasure.

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:38.336
I am Excel Walter, Your Majesty.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:41.756
As you know, I'm Duke Georg
Carmine, Army General.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:44.926
Very well.

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:48.971
I am now issuing my ultimatum
to the Three Dukedoms.

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:52.183
If you three continue
to disobey my orders,

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.937
then I will have no choice but
to recognize you as traitors.

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:59.148
I'd like to hear your
thoughts on the matter.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.485
[EXCEL] And you will,
but first a question.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:03.611
[SOUMA]
Please, go ahead.

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:05.530
Kindly inform us what
you intend on doing

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.532
with the Three Duchies.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.742
[SOUMA] If you do as I command,
I have no intention

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.994
of taking action
against your territories.

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.288
What about our armed forces?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.457
I'll merge your forces into
the Forbidden Army,

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.793
creating a unified military.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.546
In doing so, it will abolish
your previous right

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.132
to maintain armed forces
within the Three Duchies.

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.176
Then it is just as I thought.

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:28.845
Even as an outsider,
you should know

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:32.265
what sort of chaos disbanding
our armies will allow!

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:36.936
When a despot becomes king
and asserts racial supremacy,

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:40.189
the other races will face
oppression under his rule.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.692
To prevent this,
our forefathers formed

00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:45.653
the three ducal armies,
checks and balances.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:48.197
This allows the Dukes to
support as well as watch over

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:51.075
the royal family, and,
if it becomes necessary,

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:53.494
to remove a tyrant should
he ascend the throne.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.829
What are your intentions?

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.706
To overturn the entire system?

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.500
It served the nation well
during times of peace,

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.670
but the state of this world
is unstable now.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:05.715
The Principality of Amidonia
wants vengeance against us,

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.593
and the Republic of Turgis
aims to expand northward.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:12.221
They seek an opening
to claim our territory.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:13.806
And don't forget the
Nine‐Headed Dragon

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:16.100
Archipelago Union and
their relentless disputes

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.186
over fishing rights.

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:20.313
During times of strife,
having a military

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.773
with multiple command
structures is futile.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.109
Now is the time to
centralize our power.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:29.238
And what if that consolidated
power becomes corrupt?

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.698
If that happens,
then you're free to come

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.241
and claim my head!

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:40.875
[EXCEL] Before we continue,
there's one more thing

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:41.959
I'd like to ask.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.878
I hear talk that you
are constructing a new

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.172
gulf coast city, Your Majesty.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.090
Once construction is complete,

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:50.843
what is to become
of Lagoon City?

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:53.804
[SOUMA] Venetinova. I plan for
it be used as a port of trade

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.556
as well as a tourist spot.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:58.267
As for Lagoon City, it will
likely continue to serve

00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:59.894
as our main naval port.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.023
I am greatly relieved
to hear that, my king.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:10.488
As of this moment,
I, Excel Walter,

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.907
along with the Elfrieden
Kingdom's Navy,

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:16.160
place ourselves under
Your Majesty's command.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.748
[SOUMA] I am grateful
for your wise decision.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.333
I look forward to working
together for the sake

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:23.376
of the kingdom.

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:26.587
The feeling is mutual, sire.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:27.964
Now, Duke Vargas,

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.549
will you extend your
hand and help me

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.425
for the good of our kingdom?

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.553
Unfortunately,
I have to decline.

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.556
I have defended Elfrieden.

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:38.975
Not only under Albert, but the
previous two generations

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.142
of kings.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:42.895
On that note, perhaps
you'd care to explain

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.273
why King Albert
abdicated the throne

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:47.942
without so much as a word
to the three of us.

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:48.985
Actually...

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.071
I'd like to know that, too.

00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:54.991
Princess Liscia.

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:56.826
Do you know the reason why?

00:17:56.867 --> 00:18:00.413
I am sorry, my father insists
I stay out of such things

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:01.789
to avoid suspicion.

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.624
But if he were here,
he would tell you Souma

00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.167
is your king now.

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:06.502
Is that so?

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:11.591
Here is my answer: I cannot
accept you as our king

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:12.675
after all.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.385
But Duke Vargas!

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:18.264
[CASTOR] I will instead
side with Duke Carmine.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:21.684
I see. And is that
your final decision?

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:25.688
[CASTOR] Yes. But it's one
I reached on my own.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.024
Duke Carmine will have
my support as well as

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:31.027
100 members from the
Red Dragon City knights.

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:33.029
The rest of the air force
will not be mustered

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.865
and will continue
to remain neutral.

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.491
Very well.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.744
[HAKUYA] Is Duke Vargas's
decision in consideration

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.621
of his possible defeat?

00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:43.414
How can this be?

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:46.917
[SOUMA] Now then, General of
the Army, Georg Carmine.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.962
I don't need to ask whether
or not you'll side with me.

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:51.589
The moment you gave
shelter to nobles

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.674
who were guilty of
corruption, it was evident

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:56.385
that you had no intention
of following me.

00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:58.512
So I would ask you one thing:

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.514
What is it that drove you
to take this stance?

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:06.395
It's my pride as a warrior.

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:08.689
After living for more
than 55 years,

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.274
my strength may have declined,

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:13.778
but I've gained an
extraordinary opportunity.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:18.199
Through my experience,
I'll determine Elfrieden's fate.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.535
But that's‐‐ You're being
a complete fool!

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:22.536
Naturally.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:25.581
One cannot be a warrior
without being a fool.

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:29.585
And you will bear witness
to the way that I live my life.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.171
Are you sure you don't
mean the way you'll die?

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:33.673
They are the same thing.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:35.466
Those who aim to live die,

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:38.010
and those who desire
death live on.

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:40.262
That is the way of the warrior.

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:43.349
You're just an old, rotten
trunk I need to step over.

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:49.897
Though I may be rotting, I am a
great tree with strong roots.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:51.482
It makes no difference!

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.697
Georg Carmine, Castor Vargas,

00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.365
I've one thing left to say:

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:03.703
before we head into battle,
I'd like to make a proposal.

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:06.288
I doubt any of us want
the fighting to drag on,

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.708
or for it to involve innocent
citizens of this kingdom,

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:10.167
am I correct?

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:12.128
So, I'd like to establish
a rule where if one of us

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.922
kills or captures the other, the
forces under their command

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.799
will immediately
switch allegiances.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:19.969
I agree.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.971
If somehow I am defeated,

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:24.306
take good care of my
men who survive me.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.355
And with that,
I will excuse myself.

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:32.481
Please, wait!

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:36.861
[GEORG]
Princess Liscia.

00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:40.239
Duke Carmine, watch.

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.308
Now you've witnessed my resolve.

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:10.352
I have chosen to stand
alongside Souma.

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:11.437
Ah.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:15.566
I've seen your courage, and I
acknowledge it, Princess.

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.165
I'm sorry.

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:34.043
I wasn't able to
change Castor's mind.

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.961
There was nothing you could do.

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:38.756
He made his choice and must
face the consequences.

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:41.884
Tell me, is she there
with you right now?

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.803
Juna? You're requested.

00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:47.807
[JUNA]
You called for me, Your Majesty?

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:53.020
[SOUMA] I wanted to thank
you for everything, Juna.

00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:55.314
Because of your connection
with Duchess Walter,

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:56.941
we were able to resolve
our differences

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.025
without going to war.

00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:00.861
I only did as ordered and
don't deserve your praise.

00:22:00.903 --> 00:22:03.614
Sending Juna to spy
on you was deceitful,

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:05.699
but I needed to show
caution and care‐‐

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.493
for that you have my apologies.

00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:09.954
It's all right.

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:12.748
If you hadn't, I doubt I'd
have you on my side now.

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:16.418
[LISCIA]
Souma.

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:20.673
Don't forget,
we have your back, too.
