WEBVTT

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:11.261
I came here to marry
you, obviously!

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:13.972
Oh, right, marry me, obviously.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.892
Wait, what?!

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:19.686
Excuse me? You're the princess
of Amidonia, aren't you?

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.146
So what are you talking about?

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:23.690
It's pretty obvious, Sis,
you did the same thing.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.442
What did you call me?

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.069
My sweet sister Liscia.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.071
Let's focus on your betrothal.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.448
After all, you used the
engagement to make Souma's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.866
rule legitimate.

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:35.244
I-- How could you
possibly know that?

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:38.080
Never underestimate
a merchant's network.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.582
Anyhow, the same applies to me.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.584
If Souma wisely decides
to marry me,

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:46.255
he gains legitimacy to govern
the Principality of Amidonia.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.548
That's a good thing.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.300
Yes, you're right,

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.427
but while I felt that way
about our engagement to start,

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.471
I now genuinely wish
to support his rule

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:55.973
as this nation's king.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:01:00.269
As time's gone by, I have even
developed feelings for him.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.436
It's not just me.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.480
Aisha and Juna have
chosen to stand by Souma

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:07.359
of our own will, and not
because it's strategic.

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.861
We are happy just to be
at His Majesty's side.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.530
Yes, of course.

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.616
[ROROA] Ah, sounds like
there's no problem, then.

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:17.578
You know, I'm quite
fond of Souma myself.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.038
I've seen him on the
Gemstone Broadcasts,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.416
and he's even better
looking in person.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.876
By the way, since
we're on that subject,

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.670
why not set aside time
on the broadcasts

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:29.089
where you promote local
wares for a small fee?

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:31.300
It's just a thought, but
I bet there are quite a few

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.385
merchants who'd be happy to pay.

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:35.345
Good idea.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:37.139
How did I miss that?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.974
Never in a million years
did I think someone

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:41.310
who's never seen a TV
would come up with the idea

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.186
of running commercials.

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.605
She's right, though.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.815
If it works out, the ads
could help cover the cost

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:48.358
of producing the programs.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.068
Based on what I've seen,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.987
I'm sure you can lead both
the Kingdom of Elfrieden

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.572
and Amidonia.

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.949
In the immediate future
and into a prosperous

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:57.367
new era as well.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.161
Not to mention,
it's always been my goal

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.371
to marry someone who's
as fascinating as you.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.792
And you're sure
you're okay with this?

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:09.630
I mean, I am responsible for
the death of your father, Gaius.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.057
If you're gonna bring that up,

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.434
then you should know
I'm the one who drove

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:46.518
my brother out.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.436
Sorry?

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.396
I told you, I have connections,

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:51.606
and together we arranged
for multiple uprisings

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:52.774
to break out.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.736
So those rebellions
that were happening

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.155
simultaneously we're
orchestrated by you?

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.948
You seriously didn't catch on?

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.907
[laughs]

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.451
Pretty crafty of me.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.452
[SOUMA]
Yeah.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:07.247
So don't worry about my old man,
'cause I betrayed my own family.

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.125
Although, it's not like
I feel absolutely no guilt

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.501
over it.

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.754
On the battlefield,
it's kill or be killed.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.630
Nothing you can do about that.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.883
Amidonia's a very poor country.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.635
While we have mineral
resources, that's about all.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.763
As for our food
self-sufficiency,

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.556
calling it low would be kind.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.058
Colbert and I worked desperately
to find more money.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.268
Right?

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.519
Indeed.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.396
Unfortunately, the funds
that the princess

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.690
and civil servants
raised were taken

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.443
and diverted into
military expenditures.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.737
[ROROA] Women were
forced to sell their bodies.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.448
families sold children
so they would have fewer

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.116
mouths to feed.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.619
It's the people who
end up suffering.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.412
Whenever I think back
on how shortsighted

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.915
my father and brother were
about Amidonia's future,

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.209
it gets me so damn frustrated!

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.795
What we needed
wasn't more weapons!

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.588
It was jobs and food!

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.798
I'm so sorry.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.341
[ROROA]
I don't want your pity.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.592
I know who supports me--

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:04.304
my family Grandpa Herman here
and my Big Brother Colbert.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:07.182
As well as all my aunts and
uncles in the principality.

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:10.393
Those are the people I'm
really trying to look out for.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.437
[SOUMA] Julius abandoned
Roroa because he thought

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.232
his sister might become
a political rival.

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:18.276
But she understands
the importance of family.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:22.364
And how it's not restricted
to who you share blood with.

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.533
Just one more question.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.077
There was another
uprising in the northwest.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.287
Julius managed to suppress it.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.122
Did you start that one,
too, Roroa?

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.625
There's no way I would
ever sink that low!

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.336
We all suffered greatly
because of that insurrection!

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.922
Then that particular riot
broke out on its own?

00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:40.465
That's not true, either.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.300
What is on the northwest
border where the violence

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.760
originally broke out?

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.305
The Lunarian Orthodox
Papal State?

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.141
When it comes to religion,
borders don't mean anything,

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.395
and there are tons of
Lunarian Orthodox up there.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:54.521
More than likely,

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:57.315
the Orthodox Papal State
incited the riot in the form

00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.277
of a papal decree to
all their adherents.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.195
In fact, they were probably
planning to send in

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.197
their forces under the
pretense of protecting

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.532
their faithful.

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:07.325
Leave it to the
black-robed minister!

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.827
See? He gets it.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:09.995
[clears throat]

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:13.331
But the northwest isn't exactly
a land of plenty, is it?

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.293
I don't see why the Orthodox
Papal State would capture it.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.753
You don't really get it,
do you, Souma?

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.089
It's not the land
that they're after.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.967
it's potential believers.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.219
All the oppressed citizens
complaining about living

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.638
under the thumb
of Amidonian lords.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.557
If they're taken into the
Orthodox Papal State,

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:31.933
watch what happens.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:33.810
No matter how difficult
their new life is,

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.645
there won't be
another complaint.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:37.814
They'll claim their hardship
is a trial put upon them

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.274
by God.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.234
That's about as bad as it gets.

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.528
Roroa, what are your
feelings on the Lunarian

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.988
Orthodox Church?

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.073
While I have no problem
with the religion,

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.326
what I absolutely loathe
are the ones who use it

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.953
line their pockets or
other shameless acts

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.413
in the name of faith.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.999
I could go through life never
having to witness that.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.959
You're not being realistic.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.503
It's not an issue of if their
nation will contact you,

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:01.463
but when.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:02.380
Why's that?

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.674
It's not like I'm
a religious man.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.426
Well they hate the Star
Dragon Mountain Range

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.220
as much as they hate
the Gran Chaos Empire.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.349
Huh? I can understand why
they would detest the latter.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.476
They're a country of
intelligent dragons,

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.062
and steadfast worshippers
of the Mother-Dragon faith.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:20.440
One of the two great religions,
besides Lunarian Orthodoxy.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.025
When different faiths
start bickering,

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.652
things can get real nasty.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.528
But why would the
Gran Chaos Empire be--

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.365
[JUNA] Your Majesty.
May I speak freely?

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.408
You've heard of Empress
Maria of the Gran Chaos

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.620
Empire's works--
how she's been called a saint.

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:36.039
However, in Lunarian Orthodoxy,

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.458
the certification of a
saint is expressly reserved

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.417
for the pope.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.586
Claiming to be one without
permission would be

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.296
unthinkable to them.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:46.091
Basically, in the eyes
of Orthodox Papal State.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.968
Maria is a woman
beyond redemption

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.761
who's posing as a saint.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:53.056
But the people are the ones
who started calling her that.

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.517
It's not as if Maria gave
that title to herself.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.978
As if that makes any
difference to them.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.563
If they admitted that saints
just spontaneously appeared,

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.440
it would reflect poorly
on their faith.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.734
Well, be that as it may,

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:06.403
I don't see why they
would be encouraged

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:07.696
to reach out to me.

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.864
You really don't have any
idea what you're worth,

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:10.991
do you?

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.034
You're the ruler of
Elfrieden and the annexed

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.786
Amidonia as well.

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:17.122
Not only that, you're the
one behind the kingdom's

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.207
phenomenal rise in power.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.834
Could you imagine what
would happen if the pope

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.877
gave you the title
of Saintly King?

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.005
In no time flat, we could
create the Holy Kingdom

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.173
of Elfrieden together,
and it would become

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:30.135
a powerful rival even
to the empire.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.304
[SOUMA] In order for a church to
make its authority unassailable,

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.182
it grants religious status
to those who are in power.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.934
Apparently, it happens
throughout history,

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.144
no matter the world.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.733
Well, that's enough talk about
the Orthodox Papal State.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.776
Let's get back to the
"marrying me" part.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:47.694
Gah...

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.405
Well, Souma?
You can be totally honest.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.365
Do you want me or don't you?

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.783
I do.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.952
After all, the benefits
are beyond great.

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.871
Marrying her would
give me the legitimacy

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.497
to rule Amidonia.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.625
She's also appealing
as a human resource.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.086
Not to mention she has
advanced economic thinking,

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.713
like coming up with ad revenue.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.506
I'll bet she put that network
of merchants together

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.133
on her own, too.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.718
[SOUMA]
And she has a heart.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.179
Not only did she raise
money for her people,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.432
but she had the courage
to cross her own brother.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:19.059
What are your thoughts, Liscia?

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.771
You should already know
whatever you deem necessary,

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.522
--I'm fine with.
--Huh?

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.609
What's that expression about?

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.153
From what I've seen,
this girl is quite competent.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.696
And I believe she would
be worth welcoming

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.907
as one of your line of queens.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.159
If you will make certain to
deal with succession issues,

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:37.452
I've no objections.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.788
That is my only stipulation.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.331
How about the two of you?

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:43.792
The more allies we
can have, the better.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.127
Whatever decision
His Majesty makes,

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.088
I have no intention of
speaking out against.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.674
Everyone, thank you.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.677
All I ask is that you make
sure to take care of us, too.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.012
You know I will.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:59.349
I do hate to interrupt this
beautiful little love-fest,

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.060
but concerning succession,
you don't have to worry.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.354
I'm not interested
in the throne.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:05.772
Are you serious?

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.649
Yep. Just one thing.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.859
I've a teensy favor
to ask, darling.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.319
Wait! "Darling"?

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:12.278
You see,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.405
I want to be in charge
of my own business.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.324
Don't get me wrong.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.327
I think your policies are
visionary and all, darling,

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.162
but you can't exactly
budget for everything

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.455
all the time, right?

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:23.748
Uh, well, I--

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.125
I suppose not.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.876
Implementing research
and development findings

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.253
always take some time.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.379
Told you, darling.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.589
Whenever you have a policy
that doesn't fit your budget,

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.882
just let me know.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:34.801
I'll give you exactly
what you need.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:35.677
Huh?

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:38.138
By using my own
talents to earn money,

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.056
I wanna see just how
much I can transform

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.224
this kingdom.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.434
I'm encouraged to
hear you say that,

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.811
but are you so certain?

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:47.397
To be blunt, if a queen
behaves like a merchant,

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:49.482
won't all the people
look down on her?

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:51.901
And I've given that a
great deal of thought.

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.987
I'll be working
behind the scenes.

00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.780
Sebastian, the owner
of the Silver Deer,

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:59.576
will be its face,
and nobody will be the wiser.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.077
The Silver Deer?

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.537
Oh, I remember.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.788
Oh, quite the opposite.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.250
One of them was a very charming,
albeit cunning little devil.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:09.085
So that charming
little devil of a client

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.587
he was talking about was you.

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.088
Why am I not surprised?

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.506
Little devil?

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:14.591
Just you wait.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.968
I'll strangle you
for that, Sebastian.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.638
Though the "charming" part
does fit me perfectly.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.140
[COLBERT]
Excuse me.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.517
Since I'm about to be
in charge of the treasury,

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.227
would it be all right
if I said something?

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.896
What's all this, Colbert?

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:30.607
You're already the
kingdom's finance minister?

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:34.444
If I may be so bold, Princess,
with that amount of capital,

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:36.279
I'd prefer you put it
in the treasury.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.822
Out of the question!

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.033
How come you're both on
the same page about this?

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:43.036
It's fine. These will be
my own personal assets.

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:44.787
If we have her budget,
we can carry out

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.956
our internal affairs
more easily.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:48.333
But Your Majesty...

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.919
It's a matter of
separating duties, isn't it?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.588
I'll make money,
darling uses it.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.590
Meanwhile Colbert
will rein us in.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.300
That works, doesn't it?

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.052
One more thing, Darling.

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.553
Once we have kids
together, lets agree

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:03.056
they'll take over
the family business.

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.432
The only answer
I still don't know

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.185
is how many children you want.
I say--

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.604
Getting a little ahead of
yourself, don't you think?

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.648
Stop invading Souma's
personal space!

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.983
No need to be stingy!
Come on.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.027
You two've been
getting it on like crazy.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.279
You've had your fun,
now it's my turn.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:19.530
No, we have not!

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.158
In fact, we've been so busy,
there's been no time for that!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.284
[yelps]

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.786
Surely you're joking, Sis.

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.371
Don't tell me you
and him haven't...

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:27.455
No, not yet!

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.918
[NARRATOR] And so, the
engagement of Souma Kazuya

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.796
and Roroa Amidonia
was officially announced.

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.507
Coinciding with this news,
the Kingdom of Elfrieden

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:40.051
annexed the Principality
of Amidonia,

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.345
creating a new state,
the United Kingdom

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:45.723
of Elfrieden and Amidonia,
otherwise known as

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.392
the Kingdom of Friedonia.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:00.822
I'm pleased we can finally meet.

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:02.657
I'm Maria Euphoria.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.409
[SOUMA]
I'm Souma Kazuya.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.536
It is an honor to meet you.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:08.121
As you can imagine,
I've been hoping to have

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.665
a nice long talk with
you at some point.

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.125
I feel the same.

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:14.627
Even here in the empire,
your remarkable

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:15.962
achievements are known.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.131
Well, I didn't do it on my own.

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.550
I'm also surrounded
by talented people.

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.302
Such a modest king.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:25.888
It's been said good retainers
follow a good ruler.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.682
Now, moving onto business.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.892
I wish to get right
to the issue, Souma.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:33.813
Tell me what you're thinking,
concerning the Amidonia matter.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:34.731
[SOUMA]
Right.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.607
In their eyes,
after the empire went through

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.152
all the trouble of
mediating our negotiations,

00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:41.696
annexing the country
feels like a betrayal.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.281
[MARIA sighs]

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.741
When Jeanne told me
how successfully

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:46.451
the negotiations went,

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:49.037
I was happy to learn how
harmonious our countries were,

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.414
and how we had
an ally in the east.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.207
Then again, perhaps that
was a misunderstanding

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.625
on my part.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.586
Yes, I'm aware that
the citizens of Van

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:59.589
asked you to reoccupy
them after Julius's return.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.759
Although, the annexation
of Amidonia as a whole

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.719
is a different matter.

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:07.680
As you're aware, the
Declaration doesn't recognize

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:09.474
changing borders.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.559
[SOUMA]
Are you absolutely sure?

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.644
Even though this
will be a long story,

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:16.147
please allow me to tell it.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:19.650
Once upon a time,
two gods, one over the east

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.819
and the other in the west.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.364
The God of the East
said the following:

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.699
"The world was created equally.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.369
Mankind, you shall all
work the fields together,

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.662
and shall distribute all
of the crops equally

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.623
amongst yourselves."

00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:35.083
On the other hand,
the God of the West

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.795
said the following:
"The world was created free.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:41.506
Mankind, you shall all
work the fields freely,

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.549
and shall take the crops
that you have harvested

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.718
for yourselves."

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.554
The God of the East said
to the God of the West:

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.473
"Your way of doing
things will make the rich

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:53.810
even richer, and those
who are poor even poorer.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:55.478
The gap between the
haves and have-nots

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.024
will only grow wider until
it's an impassable gorge."

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.276
In return, the God of the
West said the following

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.903
to the God of the East:

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.780
"If someone is allocated
the same share

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.573
no matter how hard they work,

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:09.992
then mankind will
lose their motivation.

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:11.994
And all of society
will grow poorer."

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.791
The conflict between
the two gods grew so large

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.543
it expanded to other
nations that believed in

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.211
entirely separate deities.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.588
And it wasn't before long,
the border countries

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.216
found themselves in peril.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.218
If the nations of the
Eastern and Western gods

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.263
were to ever start a war,
the people living nearby

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:33.057
would be the first ones
experiencing the harm.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.852
And so, together with
the other countries,

00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:38.688
they came up with three rules
to prevent catastrophe.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.407
And how does this
fable conclude?

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:52.076
The God of the East's
power continued declining,

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.870
and an all-out war
between the two camps

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.288
was avoided.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:57.999
Then everything turned
out all right in the end.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.542
[SOUMA]
For a brief moment, yes.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.878
But soon after, a group of
people staged an insurrection

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:05.173
for their independence
from the multi-ethnic state.

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.175
Unless their independence
is acknowledged,

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:09.343
the very principle of
ethnic self-determination

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:11.971
would be violated.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.599
The problem is if their
independence is recognized,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.267
then it would mean
allowing all the borders

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.727
to be altered.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:19.479
Therein lies the issue.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.939
The nations that made
these rules were ultimately

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.817
paralyzed by them.

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:27.195
So you're saying the fable
you told is no different

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.155
than what's happening
with Amidonia?

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:30.448
Yes.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.949
The Declaration is clear.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.327
It gives the right for ethnic
self-determination.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:38.247
[SOUMA] Signatory nations
have no choice.

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:40.666
If the Amidonian people
take such actions,

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:41.959
they must recognize them.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:44.337
And yet, we cannot
recognize the change

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:47.381
of the Amidonian border,
as stated in Article One.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.093
What a disaster.

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:53.387
So many inconsistencies.

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:54.931
You don't notice them.

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:57.600
Not until events make
the contradictions evident.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.685
Ah, so that is why
you did not sign onto

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:02.438
the Mankind Declaration
when you became king?

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.815
Yes. I just couldn't.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.901
It's a pitfall for any
multi-ethnic nation

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.027
such as ours.

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:11.739
It's sad to hear this news.

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:15.952
We're a multi-ethnic state,
the same as Elfrieden.

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.161
But the fact is...

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.621
I already know.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.249
Unfortunately, we cannot
afford to abandon

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.376
the Mankind Declaration
just yet.

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:26.504
See, even if the path may
lead to our destruction,

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.923
my wish is to stay
a symbol of strength,

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:30.967
and to continue
inspiring the people,

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:33.135
giving them a sense of hope.

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:35.846
It is infinitely clear that
mankind must be united

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.891
if we are to stand against
the Demon Lord's Domain.

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:41.435
If only for a short while,
the empire will keep

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:43.563
the banner aloft
to bind the hearts

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.940
of Landia's people together.

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.568
Now I can see the reason why
you're known as a saint.

00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:49.944
It's a worthy title.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.697
Now that you've explained,
I understand your thinking.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.740
As head of the Declaration,

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:57.743
I will not object to the
annexation of Amidonia.

00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:00.079
That is a promise.

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.873
I really appreciate
your understanding.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:06.377
Well? What kind of lady
is this Roroa Amidonia?

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.588
I'm not quite sure how
to answer that question,

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:11.299
but if anyone did come
out on top of this

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.552
whole affair, without a doubt,
it would have to be her.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:15.761
[MARIA laughs]

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.638
I guess things didn't
go exactly as planned

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.181
for you either, did they?

00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:21.726
[laughs]

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:22.977
Moving on to the machinations

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:26.272
by the Lunarian
Orthodox Papal State.

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:28.274
[SOUMA]
Based on what Roroa told me,

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:29.692
they're offended by
the title the people

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.319
have given you.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.945
That is true.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.823
We've received several
"complaints," we'll call them,

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.617
objecting to the fact
I have been referred to

00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:38.743
as a saint.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.119
That being said,

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.330
I did not take the
title upon myself,

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.040
so there is little I can do.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:46.083
It places you in
an awkward position.

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.376
Not like you can demand
that people to stop

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:48.586
calling you a saint.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:53.799
Basically, the Orthodox
Papal State will act.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:56.927
They'll probably remain a
potential enemy of the empire.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.513
And just like Roroa said,
they may approach me

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:01.057
to join forces.

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:04.644
When that time comes, do you
wish to curry their favor?

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.479
Do you wish for their influence?

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.439
I hope you didn't
get the wrong idea!

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.566
I don't want a thing to do
with their authority.

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:13.944
I understand your sentiments.

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:17.239
The Orthodox Papal State
can be a real headache.

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:19.325
[SOUMA] Let me guess,
you have many believers there

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:20.743
in the empire.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:21.702
Yes.

00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:24.497
In the eyes of their
devoted, the Declaration

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.165
means nothing to them.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.459
In fact, there's a chance
they may even attempt

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.545
to exploit the contradiction
you've discovered.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.631
If mankind is fighting
one another,

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:36.133
the Demon Lord's
Domain will win.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:37.760
As long as we're divided,

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:40.805
the Orthodox Papal
State knows this.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.807
[SOUMA]
I'm not entirely convinced.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.433
The more chaotic
the times become,

00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:47.561
the more powerful
religion becomes.

00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:49.689
That's because it provides
an answer to anxiety

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.273
and discontent.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.734
The possibility of "salvation."

00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:56.153
Now that the Demon Lord's
Domain has appeared,

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.406
the Orthodox Papal State
can feed on the people's

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:01.909
desperation and become an
incredibly powerful force.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.494
Something wrong?

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.912
[SOUMA]
Huh? Sorry about that.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.373
I kind of got lost in thought.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:08.749
Well, from what
I have been hearing,

00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:11.210
that's a somewhat regular
occurrence for you.

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:12.545
Trust me, Maria.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:16.549
As the ruler over Friedonia,
we will be your allies.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.134
As long as the empire
continues striving

00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:21.637
to unite mankind,
we will walk with you.

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.639
When it comes to
our two great nations,

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.975
I believe that they
complement each other

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.768
and can deal with anything.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.728
Yes.

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:31.397
I am hopeful this
pact we've made here

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.274
will last until the end of time.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:38.863
Your Majesty.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.573
How'd the conference go?

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:42.408
I'd say it was fruitful.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.701
You've had the chance
to speak with Jeanne

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:45.035
as well, right?

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.997
Yes. We had some very
practical discussions,

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:50.332
and I'm pleased to report
they've also borne fruit.

00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:51.333
I bet.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:52.918
And on that subject,
there's a mountain

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.880
of bilateral negotiation
paperwork in your office.

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:00.926
[SOUMA]
I want the empire.

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:03.721
No, I want Maria
to be mankind's hope.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:05.973
The people need
a beacon to follow.

00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:08.267
That way, they won't
lose heart even in

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:09.977
the darkest times.

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:12.313
And have to rely
on gods instead.

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:13.814
They'll have the strength
to get back up

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:14.982
on their own.

00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:23.574
[LISCIA] Just what do
you think you're doing?

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.284
This is too much, Your Majesty!

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.202
[SOUMA]
Huh?

00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:27.953
Oh, hey. Good morning.

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.497
I hope you two slept well.

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:31.248
Don't you dare
"good morning" us!

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:33.709
[SOUMA gasps]

00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:35.336
What is Roroa doing in my bed?

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:37.421
Someone explain what's going on!

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:39.590
We're the ones who deserve
an explanation, mister!

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:41.926
Aisha burst into my room
in tears, so naturally,

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.469
I asked her what's happening.

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.554
She said, "I went in
to wake His Grace,

00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:47.598
but then I found him
in bed with the princess

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.058
from Amidonia!"

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.434
What in the world
compelled you to make

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:53.729
a move on her before the
princess or myself, Majesty?

00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.439
Where's your sense of loyalty?

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.316
Take it easy! Look!

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.527
Me and Roroa are both
still in our clothes!

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.403
Which means what
you think happened

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.656
probably didn't, right?
Make sense?

00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:06.200
Why does it sound like
you're not completely sure?

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.661
Because I can't remember
what happened last night.

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:12.373
Wait! It's all coming
back to me!

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.542
I was discussing
the Amidonia tax system

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.001
following annexation.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.920
Roroa and Colbert both
joined in the conversation,

00:22:17.962 --> 00:22:19.755
and we must have
stayed up late talking.

00:22:19.797 --> 00:22:21.257
Hey, Roroa, wake up.

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:23.092
It's already morning.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:26.011
I'm awake.
What is it, my Darling?

00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:28.222
How come you're
sleeping in my bed?

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:29.056
Oh, yeah.

00:22:29.098 --> 00:22:32.184
I didn't have the strength
to go to my room last night.

00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:34.395
So I just slept in your
bed with you, sweetie.

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:37.273
Watch out-- floor.

00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:38.649
Would you be so kind
as to carry her

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:41.026
back to her own quarters, Aisha?

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:42.528
[AISHA]
Yes, as you wish.

00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:48.617
What a mess.

00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:50.452
You realize this only
happened because you keep

00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:52.079
a bed inside your office.

00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:54.290
I should smash it up.

00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:56.709
Meanwhile, Marx keeps hounding
us, saying we should hurry up

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.752
and produce an heir, you know?

00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:00.462
Wait just a little bit longer!

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:03.340
I've got other things that
need to be addressed first.

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:05.092
[LISCIA]
What, for example?

00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:06.677
Even though it took a while,

00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:09.305
the kingdom's internal
affairs are in order.

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:12.182
After annexing Amidonia,
we've only grown stronger,

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:14.852
and likely don't have to worry
about outside threats for now.

00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:16.270
[LISCIA]
I suppose.

00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:17.897
There's one other thing.

00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:20.065
It took me a while,
but I've finally been able

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:22.401
to convince myself
I should be the king.

00:23:22.443 --> 00:23:23.903
I'm glad to hear that,
but I'd rather you

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:25.654
came out and said it resolutely.

00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:28.407
There is no longer anything
standing in my way.

00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:29.325
It's time.

00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:32.036
There's no reason for me to
keep holding back, Liscia.

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.454
I didn't realize you were.

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:35.039
Surely you noticed.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.166
So far, all of my policies
were chosen to create

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:39.168
as little backlash as possible.

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:40.669
And even during the war,
we made do

00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:42.922
with what little we had.

00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:44.590
Would you mind explaining
what that has to do

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:47.718
with you keeping Aisha
and myself at arm's length?

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.845
Well, let's just say you'll
find that out soon enough.

00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:51.472
[LISCIA] Uh-huh,
and when exactly is that?

00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:53.307
"Soon enough" means
"soon enough," all right?
