WEBVTT

00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:12.054
[CARLA] From what I hear,
the issue of the second queen

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.056
and consort has been settled.

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.183
[LISCIA] Even though you're
locked down here in the dungeon,

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:18.060
somehow you stay caught up.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.811
[CARLA] The guards
have nothing better to do

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.481
than share the latest gossip.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.858
What I don't know is
how it makes you feel.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.735
I'll tell you what I told Aisha.

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:28.278
Souma's numbers of
queens and consorts

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.155
will only increase.

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.074
Once that happens,
the power dynamic

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.660
will keep becoming
even more complicated.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.411
These days,
having kindred s--

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.539
I didn't ask what
you thought, Liscia.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.958
I wanted you to tell me
how you felt about it.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.507
Just between us,
it stung a little in here.

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:55.722
Did you ever end up seeing
Duke Carmine before...

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.103
I didn't.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.188
When I found he
took his own life,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.275
I was taken aback at
how at peace I felt.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.443
It's not that I don't
feel sad he's gone.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.863
I mean, my heart is
broken in pieces.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.283
However, I had a feeling
things would turn out

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.743
the way they did.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.203
Is that right?

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.997
I guess you could
call it a hunch.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.165
Something told me Duke Carmine
would choose to perish

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:23.834
along with the darkness
that had pervaded

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.294
the kingdom.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:26.712
And because he's so stubborn,

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.422
Souma would have no
choice but to accept

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:29.590
his commitment.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:32.593
In the end, that's what
the two people I think

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.053
the world of decided on.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.390
So in spite of my pain
and my sadness,

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.225
I have to remain strong.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.353
Otherwise, it would be an
affront to their resolve.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:44.396
You're serious?

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:46.315
That's how far you're
prepared to go?

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.900
Then I should be
the one to tell you

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.987
there's no point coming
down here to see me.

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.739
That has nothing
to do with this!

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.408
You're still alive, aren't you?

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.369
This can go any number of ways!

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:02.456
"I'm behaving just
like a coward would."

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.291
That's what the king
said to me during

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.917
the Battle of Van.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.252
Huh?

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:10.589
The war may be over, but
he hasn't stopped fighting.

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.049
For you and his family.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.928
On the battlefield,
I was able to see firsthand

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.056
the weight of everything
he's carrying.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.223
What're you saying?

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.435
No matter how much
you want to intercede,

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.103
I won't let you.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.064
Don't do this
to yourself, Carla!

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.274
Duke Carmine has already
given his life to cast light

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.360
on the darkness
within our kingdom!

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.737
There's no point in making
a martyr of yourself!

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:37.366
It may look that way,
but that's not what I'm doing.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.911
I don't want to be a burden.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:41.953
Not anymore.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.873
While I live, I'll only be a
weight on all your shoulders.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.717
[LISCIA] Duchess Excel Walter,
for distinguishing yourself

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.804
in this recent war, your
appeal has been granted.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.556
The right to trial for Castor
Vargas and Carla Vargas

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.351
has been transferred from
the Royal Court of Elfrieden

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:07.437
and granted to Provisional
King Souma instead.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:08.480
Let's begin.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:12.317
This trial overseen by
the king is now in session.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.028
Prime Minister, before we
proceed any further,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.988
would you read the charges
against the accused?

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.952
Here are the indictments:

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.621
Former General Castor Vargas
and his daughter, Carla,

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:26.665
failed to recognize
His Majesty King Souma's

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:29.668
claim to the throne,
choosing to rebel.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.421
These actions warrant
the charge of treason.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.798
A fit punishment for
this crime is as follows:

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.467
"Forfeiture of territory,
property, and execution."

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:44.349
There is no denying that
these two have committed

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.101
some foolish actions.

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:48.353
It should be made perfectly
clear that they did not

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.397
plot to usurp the throne.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.566
Their loyalty to King Albert
and their friendship

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:55.152
with Georg Carmine
led to their belief

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:59.030
that the kingdom was in
peril and must be defended.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.991
The fact His Majesty's
throne was relinquished

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.535
by King Albert makes
your point moot.

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:07.289
For a retainer to harbor any
misgivings is just inexcusable.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.417
This change in leadership not
only threw off the Castors,

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.754
but left the people in
a state of confusion.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.089
I think that the fault lies
partly with Your Grace

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.717
for not addressing
their concerns.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.928
Let us not forget,
despite scale of operations,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.723
no lives were
lost in the assault.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.267
Majesty, it would be a shame
if you would sentence

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.060
the two of them to death now.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.400
Well, Castor, what do you
have to say in your defense?

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.363
I've only one thing.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.200
While I started the war,
Carla did nothing

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.826
but follow my orders.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:45.869
But Father!

00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:50.248
I will assume all punishment
for her onto myself.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.542
Therefore... Highness.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:56.296
I beseech you to take my life
and spare my daughter!

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:58.089
[CARLA]
You can't!

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.591
[SOUMA sighs]

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.719
[SOUMA] It's impossible to
overlook the fact that Carla

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.055
was the one who led
the air squadron.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:08.266
The truth is, she raised
the flag of rebellion.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:12.312
Surely she knew the
consequence of her actions.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:16.024
Carla, do you have anything
to say in your defense?

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.359
I do not.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.861
And you're absolutely
sure of that?

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.113
Very well, there is one thing.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.491
I apologize for
my lack of clarity.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.871
[SOUMA] Aren't you going
to beg for forgiveness?

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.748
No, I will not.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.875
Please, sentence me as you will.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:34.876
Very well.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.548
Now, as for the rest of you,

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.258
what do you think is
an appropriate judgment

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:42.551
for these two?

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.761
After all, you've heard
their words and I would like

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:47.222
to hear your
unreserved opinions.

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:49.724
Majesty! You make it sound as
though their guilt has already

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.935
been decided before
the trial has concluded!

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.605
Who is that man speaking?

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:59.359
Piltory Saracen.
Head of the House of Saracen.

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.570
I regard this as the setting
to determine the severity

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.196
of one's crimes.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:04.990
The accused made
their stance clear:

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.741
Yes, they have agreed
to submit to any form

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.034
of punishment.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.786
However, that should not
be taken as an admission

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:10.996
of their guilt!

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:14.749
[OWEN laughing]

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.126
Well said, indeed!

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.128
Young Saracen speaks truth!

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.840
That's Owen Jabana,
head of the House of Jabana.

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.258
Prime Minister, please.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.594
Duke Vargas has been
keeping the kingdom safe

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.637
for over a hundred years.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.764
Long before we were even born!

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.641
And I do believe that
fact should be taken

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.518
into consideration!

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.853
What are you arguing?

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:36.605
That we reduce his sentence?

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.023
Nothing of the sort.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.649
Duke Vargas is ruined.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.693
He has already lost
his status and honor,

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.862
and yet you're still
demanding more.

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:45.655
Some would call taking
his life and the life

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.741
of his daughter bloodthirsty.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:51.161
Don't you think the sentence
is a bit too severe?

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.371
So we're to forgive
the traitors.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.582
Is that what you're saying?

00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:57.959
[OWEN] I think it would
be regrettable not to.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.420
Duke Vargas could serve
the kingdom for another two

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:02.213
or three hundred years!

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.090
There is no one in the
kingdom better suited

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.384
to lead the air force
into battle than the man

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.510
here on trial.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.304
That's the point I wish to make.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:10.513
Your Majesty!

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:11.514
Like you said!

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.391
If one possesses an
aptitude, you'll find a way

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.185
to make use of it!

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.854
Are we prepared to lose
talent this hard to find?

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.773
Whatever your decision,
I stand by my fri--

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.571
Well? What do the
rest of you think?

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.323
The law is the law.

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.784
If we forgive this treason,
t'would set a poor example

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.535
for other retainers.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.996
Both of them were fools
to defy Your Majesty

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.332
and will be of no use
to you henceforth.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.501
These acts of treason are
a blot on the reputation

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.002
of the nobility.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.755
Your Majesty, please
pass your just decree.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:45.507
[NOBLEMEN chattering]

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:47.550
If I may!

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.427
Yes it's true,
the law is the law.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.764
Yet, if you apply it strictly,
it will work against you!

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:56.017
Are you prepared to lose
the hearts of the people?

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.395
As for myself, how strictly
the law is enforced

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.188
doesn't interest me.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.149
Sire, I was merely curious
about his character--

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.085
[SOUMA]
Kill them.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.591
[blade slicing]

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.771
[SOUMA]
Machiavelli's <i>The Prince</i>.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.190
It's been called
"the devil's book."

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.693
In the few hundred years
since it was first published,

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.696
it has come under attack
by the Christian church.

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:52.365
A section particularly
singled out for criticism

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.742
is chapter eight.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.952
It's entitled "Concerning
Those Who Have Obtained

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.912
a Principality By Wickedness."

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:03.918
Further along, in chapter 17,
Machiavelli asks the reader

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.254
"Whether It Is Better
to Be Loved than it is

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:07.714
to be Feared."

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.509
Chapter eight
poses the question:

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.845
How is it possible for a
person to take a country

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.556
by nefarious means
and subsequently live

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.850
a tranquil life without
the threat of insurrection

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.435
occurring?

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:23.104
The answer is: it is possible
because they were skilled

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:26.649
in employing cruelties,
which assured peace.

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.694
Furthermore, in
chapter 17 of the book,

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:33.156
it asserts the following: "It is
better for a ruler to be feared

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.491
than loved."

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:37.786
Also, this particular section
makes another point:

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.538
When leading an army,
one never needs to be concerned

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.958
with one's reputation,
especially for ruthlessness."

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.795
However, earlier
in chapter eight,

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.963
Machiavelli explains
how acts of cruelty

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.007
should be effectively used:

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:54.636
They are to be performed all
at once and never repeated.

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:58.014
Interestingly enough, he stops
short of giving examples

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.558
of specific acts or
how much ruthlessness

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.228
a leader should be
made to tolerate.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.772
It would be too simple
to merely say:

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.899
"Kill all of your enemies."

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.110
If you carefully read the
examples that Machiavelli

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.612
does give, you'll notice
the targets of these acts

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:13.738
of cruelty.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.573
They're not always adversaries,

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.118
but often one's own allies.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.495
According to the philosopher,
an apt ruler

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:23.123
must purge informers,
opportunists,

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.500
all treacherous insiders.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.419
And this act must be
carried out all at once.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.588
Even though it may
appear cruel to others,

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.049
it must be done
regardless of opinion.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:49.983
It's all right.

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:51.609
They're under my command.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.820
You could've told us!

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:54.863
Huh?

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:11.963
Carmi--

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.807
Aisha, put your sword away.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:23.975
But what about--

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:28.730
That's Kagetora.
Leader of the Black Cats,

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.191
an intelligence unit that
reports directly to me.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.990
Contact the Forbidden
Army members

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.284
stationed outside
their residences.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:44.370
Instruct them to seize
all relevant evidence.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:47.123
If they meet resistance,
have it put down.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.178
Majesty.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.804
I hope it's not too much to ask,

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.557
but could you explain
what just happened?

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.935
The traitors were executed.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.603
All 12 of them.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:12.106
They worked with Amidonia
and other nations.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.567
They were nothing more
than weathervanes, sadly,

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:17.237
pointing in the direction
of the strongest wind.

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.488
Yes.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.990
While people may
call my actions cruel,

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.909
it was necessary in my eyes.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.328
The disease needed
to be cut out.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.999
Even so, those 12 houses have
long served the royal family.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.043
Some have served the
kingdom for generations,

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:33.920
at least on the surface.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:36.339
But the reality is they
conspired with other countries

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:37.966
behind the king's back.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:39.926
When suspicions arose,
they'd sow discontent

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.929
to distract investigations
from themselves.

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.473
That was the true
nature of these people.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:50.228
All I know is if anything were
to happen to the ones I love,

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.689
Liscia, Aisha, and Juna,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.400
and they ended up
getting hurt as a result,

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.860
I would have regretted
not taking such measures

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.404
until my death.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.743
[SOUMA] Returning to
Machiavelli, he also says

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.955
the following in <i>The Prince</i>:
Fortune is a kind of force

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.833
that cannot be
completely governed by us.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:15.169
It rules over half the
actions in our lifetimes.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:18.006
However, one should
also be aware,

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:21.676
the other half rests entirely
within our own hands.

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:24.554
That while we can't prevent
sudden changes of fate,

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.639
if we could just
prepare ahead of time

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:29.767
and take necessary action,
then we could also be able

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.854
to mitigate our destiny.
Change its course.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:35.481
Look. I understand
your thinking, Souma.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.900
But what do we do about
House Saracen and Jabana?

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.905
We have uncovered
information regarding them.

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:45.491
The heads of the two
families you see before you

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.578
were also in league
with the other 12.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:51.331
Yes, but you've left out
one important detail.

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:54.667
However, that ended with
the current generation.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.919
Piltory and Owen have
proven themselves

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.839
by cutting all ties
with the traitors.

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.342
Piltory, despite his youth,
excels in the military

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.886
and literary arts, and Owen
is a man possessing

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.721
both honesty and passion.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.265
They'll serve the
kingdom with loyalty

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:10.933
and no ulterior motives.

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:15.063
We pledge absolute
fealty to Your Majesty.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.147
Please.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.358
I've never been
huge on formality.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.360
[laughs]

00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:22.070
I must say,
it is amusing.

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.072
Imagine if we had remained
silent or had sided

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:26.032
with the other 12 houses.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:27.784
Then our heads would
no longer be attached

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:29.869
to our necks either.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.079
Well, since you brought it up,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.497
if that was the course
you had chosen,

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:33.790
I was to provoke
the two of you--

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.917
to try to make you angry.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.377
Then, if you pandered
to His Majesty

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:40.213
like the other 12, he would
not have much use for you.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:42.548
I don't think it's necessary
to explain further.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.385
[laughs]
Why, certainly not!

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:48.012
Best left to the
imagination, I say.

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.056
You really thought
this through that far?

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.604
Majesty. It is time.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.526
I'm ready.

00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:15.623
First is Castor Vargas, for
rebelling against my ultimatum.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.625
You are guilty of treason.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:21.838
I committed this crime and the
entirety of it rests with me.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:25.716
I beg you, at least
show mercy to Carla!

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.177
You're not the one who
gets to decide her fate.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.347
I will judge you!

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:34.725
And frankly, there's no other
verdict that could be reached.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:38.020
However, certain
considerations must be made.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:40.231
You have defended the
kingdom for over a century.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.442
Your service is unparalleled.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:45.736
Therefore, I will
spare your life.

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:48.281
You will be remanded
over to Excel.

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:51.033
Also, your entry into
the former Duchy of Vargas

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:52.368
is forbidden.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.871
As is any further contact
with your son, Carl,

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.956
and his mother, Accela.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:16:00.918
Excel, it was your son-in-law
who committed this crime.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.545
I'd watch him closely.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.005
Sire, yes.

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.507
I shall abide by your
command without fail.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.055
[SOUMA] Carla, you are
equally as guilty.

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:16.184
You also lack your father's
distinguished history,

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:19.187
so your sentence
can't be reduced.

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:20.897
I expected not.

00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:23.274
If that's your judgment,
kill me!

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.193
My daughter's only crime
was turning against you

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.944
at her father's direction!

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.154
I beg you!

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:31.574
Strip away my merits
and give them to her!

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:32.909
Take him away.

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:37.830
Let me go!

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.832
Sire! I beg you!

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.792
At least spare
my daughter's life!

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.544
Let me die in her place!

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:44.837
Let her live!

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:55.223
There's no denying
your involvement.

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:58.768
But, given your role,
death would be unjust.

00:16:58.809 --> 00:16:59.602
Huh?

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.687
[SOUMA] While your life
will be spared, your status

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.814
will be reduced
to that of a slave.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.983
You'll be owned
by the royal family.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:09.070
Meaning, Liscia and myself.

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.071
Yes, sire.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.866
[SOUMA] Further
instructions will follow,

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.035
but for the time being,
I have one order

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.537
that cannot wait.

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:18.663
I'll carry it out.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.002
If I ever go astray,
do not hesitate.

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.797
You strike me down.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:31.384
The day that I become a tyrant,
it'll be your job, Carla.

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:34.220
You will have to
end to my reign.

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.347
That's a huge weight to bear.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.558
So why trust me?

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.476
Because Liscia and the
others might not be able

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.186
to do it.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:45.439
There may come a
time when I lose clarity,

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:48.359
growing increasingly
drunk on power.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.736
And it frightens me.

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:53.072
I'm worried whether or
not Liscia and the others

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.949
would stop me
in time, or at all.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:00.204
That's why, Carla,
you have to be the one.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:04.041
The person who takes my life
before I bring sorrow to myself,

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.876
as well as those dearest to me.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.255
You have my promise.

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.923
I shall abide by your command.

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:16.762
And with that, your
judgment has been decided!

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.187
[SOUMA sighs]

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:29.317
--Souma!
--Your Majesty!

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.068
It's nothing.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.820
I'm just a little tired,
I suppose.

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:33.946
But you almost--

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:36.198
I told you, I'm fine.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.159
I'd just like to be
left alone for a bit.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:49.128
To be honest, the way
His Majesty faltered,

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.006
it was like a soldier returning
from his first battle.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:54.592
After killing someone
for the first time.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.637
When Souma had those 12
noblemen executed in there,

00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:01.223
it was clear he
wasn't his usual self.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.725
Tell me, Aisha.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.518
How would you support
a soldier who has just

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.395
experienced killing someone?

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:08.356
Well, let me see.

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:09.982
I've never been a
part of the military,

00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:12.735
so I'm not an expert
in these matters.

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.779
But something I often
hear is you should try

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.781
and take their mind off of it.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:19.450
How would we do that, though?

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:20.743
Hmm.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.748
I just got an idea, but I'll
need your help pulling it off.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.554
[SOUMA] When you commit
your acts of cruelty,

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:43.057
do it all at once.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.893
A ruler never needs to be
concerned with his reputation

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.562
when it comes to ruthlessness.

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:53.984
He must dare to choose fighting
unless he wishes to perish.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.903
And when his time does come,

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:58.322
and he has regrets of what
he should have done,

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:00.616
it'll be too late.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:03.202
I understand what Machiavelli
was writing about,

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.663
but I'm having second
thoughts about my decision.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:06.747
Whether it was right.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:22.596
Huh?! Just what do you
two think you're doing?

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:25.558
I...

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:28.853
I'm sorry, but I thought
I told you I needed

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.354
to be left alone.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.316
[LISCIA] Just look at
the state you're in.

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:36.485
We can't leave you alone
when you're like this.

00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:40.489
[AISHA]
B-Beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:43.826
Could either one of you explain
what's going on right now?

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.245
Well, you know, we're helping.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.206
Helping you forget about
what happened earlier.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.166
Yeah?

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:52.376
Okay, look!

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:54.295
You're free to do whatever
you want with us, all right?

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:55.546
Whatever is fine!

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.798
But you should know
this is my first time

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.633
doing anything like this.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:02.636
Though I'm certain Your Majesty
will be most cordial!

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.764
This is a lot to lay on
someone all of a sudden,

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:05.806
don't you think?

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:07.349
I mean what're you suggesting?

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:12.855
[LISCIA] If you don't mind,
Souma, it's a bit cold.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.857
Can we get under
the covers with you?

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:23.741
Your hand is freezing.

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:31.415
I wanted to confess something.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.044
I thought that I knew
the kind of weight

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:37.213
you had to carry
on your shoulders.

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.799
At least I felt that,
until today.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.009
Every time you have a
difficult choice to make,

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:44.887
it's a painful experience
for you, isn't it?

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.263
But we're family.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.390
Isn't that what you called us?

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:50.684
We can't let you carry the
weight of that responsibility

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.436
all by yourself.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.480
Don't treat us like
strangers, Your Majesty.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:55.981
Why have a first queen
and second queen

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:58.442
if you'll only push us away?

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.237
I mean, I'm not officially
second queen yet, but...

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:03.197
You were always
there to support us.

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.699
To comfort and lift us up
during the hard times.

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:09.203
So let us return the favor
and do the same for you.

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:12.331
Listen, you two.

00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:13.791
Yes, Souma?

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.960
What is it?

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.253
[SOUMA]
This is nice.

00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:28.097
[ROROA] He actually agreed to
pay reparations to get back Van?

00:22:28.138 --> 00:22:30.391
Is my brother that
big of a moron?

00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:32.935
And where does he think
that money's coming from?

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:35.563
The elderly in town are
going to suffer the most!

00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:37.773
He could've just let
the kingdom have it.

00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:39.191
That way, Julius
would have avoided

00:22:39.233 --> 00:22:41.735
any post-war accountability.

00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:42.987
Possibly, yes.

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:45.823
Considering the principality
hadn't been entirely defeated,

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:48.075
if he had left the
territory the way it was,

00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:49.827
likely neither Elfrieden
nor the empire

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:52.454
would have put on
such a show of force.

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:53.914
Had he been more patient,

00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:56.458
we might have been able
to make an additional move.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.794
In theory, yes, but it
may not be as simple

00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:01.005
as you're making it out to be.

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.089
We'll never know.

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:06.886
You met Souma once,
isn't that right, Sebastian?

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:09.555
After seeing him up close,
what's your opinion?

00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:11.557
Well, let me think for a minute.

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.435
On the outside, he appeared
to be an ordinary young man,

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:16.729
one who openly lends
an ear to other's views

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.148
regardless of their position.

00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:21.275
What struck me upon
first meeting him

00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:23.152
was how he genuinely
seemed to care for those

00:23:23.193 --> 00:23:24.904
who were close to him.

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:26.572
He's the complete
opposite of everything

00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:28.991
my father represented.

00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:32.077
Which may provide us
with the perfect chance.

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:34.955
The ideal opponent to pull
off my greatest gamble!

00:23:34.997 --> 00:23:36.999
I have waited for this!

00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:40.419
But Princess, are you sure
you want to take that risk?

00:23:40.461 --> 00:23:42.963
This is how things
get back on track.

00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:45.341
From now on, no more letting
that idiot brother of mine

00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:47.009
or Souma run the show.

00:23:47.051 --> 00:23:49.094
We'll be the ones
who get the last laugh!

00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:53.015
There's no backing down now.
