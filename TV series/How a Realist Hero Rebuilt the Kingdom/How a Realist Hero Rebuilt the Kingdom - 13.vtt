00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:12.095
[NARRATOR] The Gran Chaos
Empire lies at the western end

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.347
of the continent.

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:16.141
In regard to Landia, it occupies
the greatest amount

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.476
of territory.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:21.063
Additionally, the empire's
population, military might,

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.941
technology, and affluence
is unmatched

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.443
by any other country
on the supercontinent.

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:29.154
Then, ten years ago,
an incident came about

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.989
which altered the situation,

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.867
the formation of the
Demon Lord's Domain.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.662
Faced with the sudden appearance
of a swarm of monsters,

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.705
all across the
nations of mankind,

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.958
a call for solidarity rang out.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.461
The Gran Chaos Empire,
with its unlimited resources,

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:46.964
heeded the call and
led the continent into war.

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:54.513
Currently, the head ruler over
the empire is Maria Euphoria.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.933
She was responsible for putting
forth the Mankind Declaration,

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:00.060
which was more than
just a coalition to battle

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:02.020
the Demon Lord's forces.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:05.649
It was a sublime pact, created
to put an end to warring

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:08.151
and stop ethnic discrimination.

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.904
Furthermore, owing to her
beautiful appearance,

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.490
as well as her kind
heartedness toward all races,

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:16.994
regardless of their financial
standing, at some point,

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.162
the people gave her
an adopted title.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:22.457
And she became known
as the Saint of the Empire.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.170
[knocking]

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.422
[MARIA]
Come in.

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.424
[JEANNE]
Please excuse me.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:31.633
It is I, sister.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.388
Jeanne Euphoria, reporting.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.890
I am off, leaving with
an army detachment,

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.685
departing for Van,
capital of Amidonia.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.270
Ah, that's right.

00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:46.148
You're going to meet with
the hero king in question?

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.357
[JEANNE]
Yes.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.235
While reluctant to be taken
advantage of by Amidonia,

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.738
I suppose my only option
is to negotiate.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.449
Van must be returned
at all costs.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.492
I realize the Principality
of Amidonia

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.119
is the one at fault here,

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:00.996
but we mustn't allow
the Mankind Declaration

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:01.997
to be broken.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.207
That would affect the
prestige of the empire.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.627
It's an agonizing decision.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.253
Please forgive me
for placing you

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.047
in such a difficult position.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:11.548
[JEANNE]
What are you talking about?

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.592
Sister, you are the one
who is most heartbroken

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:14.593
by all this.

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.554
I promise you, Julius Amidonia
may be free for now,

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:20.140
but he will receive his
just reward someday.

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:22.976
I hear that this new King Souma
of the Elfrieden Nation

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:25.312
is truly a brilliant man.

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:27.439
I believe that if you talk
things through with him,

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.483
he will prove reasonable.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.901
You really think so?

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:35.030
From what I've heard, I believe
you two are like oil and water.

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:37.240
[MARIA]
And what makes you say that?

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.200
Sister.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.118
To put it simply,
you're an idealist,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.079
while this king is a realist.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.206
I feel that you two see
the world from completely

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.791
different perspectives.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.389
[LISCIA] Why don't you get
a room of your own already?

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.100
[SOUMA] I'm buried in paperwork,
sunup to sundown.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:30.270
Even if I had my own room,
I'd only go there to sleep.

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.898
For heaven's sake, taking
over Van has only increased

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.775
my workload, tenfold.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.028
It's torture not having
a proper bureaucracy.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.446
Enough of your complaining.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.782
Here, the next documents.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:42.741
What?

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:45.452
Lemme guess, another
request to use the plaza?

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:47.829
[LISCIA] And we can expect
a lot more to go through.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:49.706
There's open‐air
concerts, right?

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.502
Plus plays, circuses,
and seed‐spitting contests.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.421
I can't help but feel like I've
opened up Pandora's Box here.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:57.631
I'm not sure what that is,

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.424
but since your musical
program broadcast,

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.176
the people of Van are
having an awakening

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:02.594
of self‐expression.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.930
That's just how
sensational it was.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.181
The harder one's oppressed,

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:07.933
the greater they bounce
back when freed.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.100
I've no doubt.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.519
This truly is a renaissance!

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.270
[LISCIA]
Huh?

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.522
Nothing, never mind.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.900
[CITIZENS chattering]

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.824
[ROROA] Folks are getting
down and dirty, huh?

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.450
Must be euphoric.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.285
Everything my old man
took away from them

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.079
has been given back.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.040
Bet my brother's hopes of
being reinstated are dashed.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:35.085
Pardon, Princess, but what
exactly did Prince Gaius

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.003
take away from the Amidonians?

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:40.882
Just a little something called
freedom, dear Colbert.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:42.175
It's a smart play.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.885
Souma's not losing any
money and the citizens

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.595
love him now.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.639
Also, if anyone tries
to take it away again,

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.099
there'll be a backlash.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.143
Freedom costs nothing, but
to the people it's priceless.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.979
As if Julius can do
anything when the country

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.230
is this prosperous.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:57.524
Almost like‐‐ are you saying
Souma had that in mind

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:58.942
when he made the broadcast?

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.861
Lowering taxes and
increasing distribution

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.280
wasn't bad either.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.407
In all my years of
being in Amidonia,

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.618
I've never seen fabric
this spectacular.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.161
But we have to hurry, though.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.455
There's not a moment
to waste, Colbert.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.166
It seems that Souma is moving
faster than we imagined.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.378
[ROROA]
After provoking us like that,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.922
I'm not letting you quit
while you're ahead.

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.967
Trust me, you're going to
answer for your actions, king.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.385
You better get ready.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.305
We have to be prepared, huh?

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.222
[HAKUYA]
Yes, sire.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:30.891
The empire has started
their march here,

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.934
with a force of 50,000.

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.520
How long do we have
before they reach Van?

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.647
[HAKUYA] While the main force
will take slightly longer,

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.401
we can expect the advance
party to arrive any time now.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:42.903
I understand.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:46.114
If there is any new activity,
report it to me at once.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.449
[HAKUYA]
As you wish.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:49.743
[SOUMA sighs]

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.119
[PONCHO]
E‐Excuse me, Your Majesty,

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.330
but if you're not busy,
can we talk?

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.539
[SOUMA]
Anything wrong?

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.540
N‐Not at all.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.876
In fact, I have something you
should be eager to see.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.212
[LISCIA] This is what you
wanted to show him?

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.213
Some flower?

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.131
I‐Indeed!

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:06.551
This flower is known
as a beguiling lily, yes.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.470
Ah, so I can see
that it's a lily,

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.348
but when does the "beguiling"
part come into play?

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.475
As it so happens,
this flower's pollen

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.477
has a powerful
hallucinatory effect,

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.520
so if you inhaled it, you
would end up behaving

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.147
like a sleepwalker.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.982
A what?!

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.485
Well, would you mind
getting it out of here then?

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.653
[PONCHO]
I‐It's all right!

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:28.198
The pollen has been
thoroughly removed, yes!

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.951
Besides, the flower itself
is mostly for show.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.328
This is what I wanted
Your Majesty to see:

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.121
the plant's rhizome.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.247
[SOUMA]
The lily's bulb?

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.582
Oh, lily root!

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.167
What's so exciting?

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.337
The plant's root is a
high‐value food product!

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.714
But I guess that doesn't
fully explain it, does it?

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:45.548
They're edible.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.967
Very much, and the root has no

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.678
hallucinatory effects
at all, yes.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:50.845
[SOUMA]
So, how's the flavor?

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:54.015
They are fluffy and absolutely
delicious when steamed.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.267
And as if things couldn't
be more in our favor,

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.937
the beguiling lilies grow in
clusters all over the mountains

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.063
of Amidonia.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:01.898
[SOUMA]
That's terrific news.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.192
I know lily root
is rich in carbs.

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:06.569
They can be a main dish,
like potatoes.

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.113
This could be just the
breakthrough we needed

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.156
to solve the principality's
food shortage.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.660
Oh, but you can't get near them
because of the pollen, right?

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:14.828
[PONCHO]
Yes, sire.

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:17.288
Also, you have to harvest them
when they're pollinating,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.124
otherwise their toxicity
will spread all the way

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.625
to the bulb.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.544
Well, I guess that
rules them out.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:25.755
If they can't be safely
harvested, there's no point.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:26.798
Wait a second,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.175
how did you get
this one here then?

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.136
As a matter of fact,
there are people who live

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.263
in the mountains of
the Gran Chaos Empire

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.598
that routinely gather beguiling
lilies and eat them

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.475
as a food staple, yes.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.644
Then there must be some
way to harvest them.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.521
[PONCHO] That's where
the orangutans factor in.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:42.939
The orangutans, huh?

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.025
Those monkeys that
like getting tipsy?

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:47.652
Yes, you see,
fortunately for us, sire,

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:50.822
they routinely eat the
rhizomes of beguiling lilies.

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.532
The people from
the mountain noticed.

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:54.284
So, they tamed the animals
to do the harvesting

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.910
of the flowers for them.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.245
[SOUMA]
I'm starting to get it.

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.289
So that's how they're
able to farm the plant.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.206
How ingenious.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.667
Do we have these
orangutans in Amidonia?

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:03.585
Oh, yes,

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.795
and to save time, I went
ahead and asked Tomoe

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.464
if she would
negotiate with them.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:10.842
As long as we regularly provide
saké barrels instead of wages,

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:13.803
I believe we'll have a more
than content workforce.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:16.222
Hmm. All right, Poncho.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.141
Start production
of lily root at once!

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.517
Y‐Yes, sire!

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.688
Lily stew rations
are served over here,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.065
come and get them, yes!

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.238
Oh, and over there are
lily root dumplings

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.491
that you can take
home with you, as well.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.201
Grab however many you need.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.827
The recipe is fairly simple,

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:41.331
so please try and make
them yourself, yes!

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:44.167
There is plenty to go around,
so remain calm.

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.336
Form a line and we'll
start handing them out!

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.719
[TOMOE] It's a beautiful day,
isn't it, Big Brother?

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.596
Sure is, Tomoe. Glorious.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.056
Oh, wow!

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.767
There sure are
a lot of shops, huh?

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.477
If you see any that
are interesting,

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.312
we can take a look inside.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.563
Yes, please!

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.400
[SOUMA] Is that all right
with you, Juna?

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:10.527
Of course!

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.157
Juna? Uh, what are you...

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:17.992
I can stop if it bothers you.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.912
It's not that I object
or anything, it's just‐‐

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:24.040
I thought you said that you were
going to keep me safe, covertly.

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.292
Did you really think
I meant me alone?

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.503
Look closer, you'll see there
are several elite marines

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.338
who are guarding us
from the shadows.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.511
I hope you don't dislike me
holding on to your arm,

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.637
Your Majesty.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.013
I don't have any
problem with it,

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.974
so go ahead and
knock yourself out.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:44.269
[laughs] Couldn't protect
you if I did.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.771
Right, uh well, considering
how there aren't really

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:50.525
any shops I'm dying to see,
you go ahead and lead the way.

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:51.776
What do you think
about getting some

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.279
nice clothes for
Tomoe as a present?

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.281
Since she is your
younger sister now,

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.449
you could call it a gift
from a family member.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:06.207
What sort of clothing may
I help you find today, sir?

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.500
[SOUMA]
Well, let me see.

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:08.710
Do you have anything
that would look nice

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.461
on my little sister?

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.131
Huh? Wait, you're buying
something for me?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.176
You see an outfit you like,
all you have to do is say so.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.761
[TOMOE]
Um, but I‐‐

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:19.721
Come on, now.

00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:22.348
Let me act like
a big brother today.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.017
We'll have a look around.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.102
‐‐Come on.
‐‐[TOMOE] Okay.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.395
[JUNA]
What do you think of this?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.355
[TOMOE]
Ah! I love it!

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.815
Or blue, if you prefer.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.234
Oh, wow, this one is adorable!

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.652
[JUNA chuckles]

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.993
[SEBASTIAN] Pardon me, sir,
if you don't mind,

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:45.371
I'd appreciate your viewpoint
on a question I have.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.623
[SOUMA]
What is it?

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:49.209
Suppose that on the battlefield,
all of your generals

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.377
were gathered together
for a war council,

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.338
and that the first plan
one of them put forward

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.006
had several merits.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.507
Would you not then
choose to implement

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.092
this strategy immediately?

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.846
No, I wouldn't.

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.557
I would wonder if perhaps there
was an even better tack.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.310
But now suppose that you
were one of the generals

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.395
and wanted your plan
to be adopted,

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:11.606
it would be a better approach
to withhold your thoughts

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:14.734
and propose your strategy
as the solution in the end.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.781
Another way to look at it is
that when it comes to

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.407
bargaining between
men and women,

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.284
it's just a different
kind of battle.

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:33.836
[SOUMA] While I believe these
would look good on Tomoe,

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:35.463
perhaps I should
wait a bit longer.

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:40.051
You're a magnificent
strategist, sir.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.012
And I am honored
by you saying so.

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.723
You used a war council
in your example.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.475
Was there some significance?

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:49.435
[SEBASTIAN]
I do beg your pardon, sir.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.604
Up until a few days ago,
I had been dealing with

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.898
some rather distinguished
individuals.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.942
[SOUMA] And these distinguished
people were military men,

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:56.985
I take it?

00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.194
Oh, quite the opposite.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.322
One of them was a very charming,
albeit cunning little devil.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:02.824
[ROROA sneezes]

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.701
Such a loud sneeze, Princess.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.078
A lady should refrain from
calling attention to herself.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.705
[ROROA]
Who even noticed?

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.331
One sneeze means you're
being talked about,

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:12.917
two means someone's
fallen for you.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.585
Still waiting on
the latter, though.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.131
[JUNA]
Kazuya.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.050
What do you think?

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.011
Wow.

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:27.432
[CITIZENS chattering]

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.350
Want me to carry those, Tomoe?

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:30.893
I'm okay, you bought
these for me,

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.104
so it's only right
that I carry them.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.648
Well, would you mind if
I at least carried these?

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.575
[TOMOE]
Wow. Thank you so much, brother.

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:46.951
You didn't have to.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.039
I'll treasure them always.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.335
Oh, and I'm hoping
you'll accept this, Juna.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:01.049
Huh? Is that a hairpin?

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.760
You've done so much to
help me and the kingdom.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:05.386
This is to say thank you.

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.471
[JUNA]
Oh, my.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:09.265
I don't think I'm worthy to
receive such a generous gift.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:15.980
[SOUMA] It looks incredible
on you, really.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:16.939
Your Majesty.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.817
if you intend on honoring us
with such lavish presents,

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.736
you should give something to
the princess and the others

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.029
as well.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:24.614
[SOUMA]
You're absolutely right,

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:27.158
but I have something already
prepared for Liscia and Aisha.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.619
By the way, Juna.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.079
[JUNA]
Yes, what is it?

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.955
It's Kazuya, not Your Majesty.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.252
You're far more spiteful
than I expected, Kazuya.

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.337
You think so?

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:42.590
[JUNA]
Yes.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:44.967
You also have quite
a knack for flirting, too.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.638
[TOMOE]
Big Brother, look!

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.932
There are so many little
shops opening up!

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.309
[SOUMA] Several in such
a short amount of time.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.645
[JUNA] This is the center
of entertainment, after all.

00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:56.646
Good day!

00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:58.773
How about a little something
for your wife, sir?

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.359
We have steamed lily
dumplings for sale!

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.861
I don't know about you,
but I could use a bite to eat!

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.280
All right, how about we
buy something here then?

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.448
Yes, please!

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.412
Oh, I've never had
anything so yummy!

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:15.248
These lily root croquettes
are also pretty tasty.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:17.917
If you think they're good,
wait till you try them fried.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.168
Though I might've
burnt my tongue

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.503
on the soft‐boiled center.

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.139
[CHRIS] Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.851
[JUNA] I wish days as peaceful
as this could go on forever.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:36.978
[CHRIS] Elfrieden and
Van will be sunny today,

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.272
perfect for washing clothes.

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:41.566
[JEANNE] I never expected to
see a Gemstone Broadcast

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.025
used in this manner.

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:07.341
I expected the empire,
but inside the capitol?

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.724
[JEANNE] I'd like to introduce
this system to my own nation.

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:16.434
I'll look into it once I return.

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:20.730
No need for that,
Songstress Juna.

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.231
I bear no ill will.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:24.400
[SOUMA]
Who are you?

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.736
I am Jeanne, the sister
of Maria Euphoria,

00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:28.946
Empress of the
Gran Chaos Empire.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.073
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:33.034
Kind of audacious of you
to just come strolling

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.953
right into the capital,
especially while I'm here.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.205
It was necessary.

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.499
I needed to see you
with my own two eyes.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.751
Rumors alone aren't enough
to ascertain the truth

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.794
about a person's character.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.213
[SOUMA]
Rumors?

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.465
[JEANNE] Certainly.
They say you are a wise ruler

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.800
who pulled a kingdom on the
precipice of bankruptcy

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.010
back from the brink.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.179
And rescued the people
from a food shortage

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:56.390
by preparing foods nobody
was accustomed to eating.

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:59.352
But also there've been a
number of salacious stories

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:00.728
that have reached my ears.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.563
Just a minute!
What do you mean?

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.524
I've heard you are
engaged to the former king's

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.359
beautiful daughter,
Princess Liscia,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.569
yet continue gathering
the kingdom's beauties,

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.488
expanding your selection
of consorts.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.907
I suppose I'm included
as one of those?

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.784
I was aware such stories
were making the rounds,

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.494
but hearing it aloud is...

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:17.870
You didn't tell me?

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.413
Alas, if the rumors are false,

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:21.874
then it rules out
my original strategy.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.042
[SOUMA]
Doing what, exactly?

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.961
If you were as
lascivious as they said,

00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:27.255
my beautiful sister could
welcome you and plead her case,

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.131
and it would not be
difficult to get you to cave

00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.133
and accept any terms we desired.

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:33.094
[SOUMA] Your plan was to try and
have the Saint of the Empire

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:34.262
seduce me?!

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:37.181
My sister does not seem to like
the title of Saint, personally,

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:40.184
but it does a little something
for the gentlemen.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:43.020
After all, you didn't hesitate
using it just now.

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.648
Well, I mean, it certainly
doesn't hurt her reputation,

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.649
so...

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:47.817
What about my title?

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:49.944
Does "songstress"
do anything for you?

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.363
I don't think now's the best
time to be discussing this.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.073
Uh, sorry, just wondering.

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:58.202
You are a more amusing
fellow than I'd imagined.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:17:59.912
[SOUMA] What you call amusing,
others might see

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:01.956
as unbelievably awkward.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:02.873
[JEANNE]
Not at all.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.251
A king being so close with
his officers is evidence

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.420
that the kingdom
is in good hands.

00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:09.338
Speaking of, in the empire,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.425
because my sister's a saint,
everyone stays distant.

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:14.969
Moreover, she is the empress,
but does her best

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.722
to treat everyone equally,
and yet she feels

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:20.600
she must be guarded
against everyone.

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.977
That goes for
this matter, as well.

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:24.604
We have nothing
to gain by assisting

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.522
the Principality of Amidonia,

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:30.318
not after they blatantly ignored
the Mankind Declaration.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:34.530
Hmm. We just met, but for being
sister to idealistic Maria,

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:37.408
your view of the world
certainly is quite realistic.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.118
When the elder has
her head in the clouds,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.413
the younger has to have her
feet firmly on the ground.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.457
Anyhow, I admire the
way you're implementing

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:46.542
the Gemstone Broadcast.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:47.918
Would it be all right
if I copied it

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.211
in my own country?

00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:50.588
[SOUMA]
Go right ahead.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.798
Not like I could stop you
even if I wanted to.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.966
[JEANNE]
Thank you very much.

00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:55.926
But I'm curious, how are
you able to think up

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.845
so many progressive ideas?

00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:59.472
Progressive, you say?

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:00.848
Back in the world
where I come from,

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.892
this is quite ordinary.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:06.354
The world you're from,
I completely forgot.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:09.690
On behalf of my sister, I
wish to apologize for that.

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:12.234
Tearing you away from
your home and family.

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.527
We had no right.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.365
For the hero summoning, I mean.

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:19.033
I beg your forgiveness.

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:22.078
What's done is done,
so please, don't bow to me.

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:23.204
[JEANNE]
All the same.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:26.499
The empire has no reason
to want a hero to interfere.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.958
Isn't that right?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.503
This was your way of
showing consideration.

00:19:30.544 --> 00:19:32.713
Toward a kingdom that couldn't
come up with financial aid

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.632
for the war effort?

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:35.800
Yes.

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.218
[SOUMA]
That's what I thought.

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:40.596
I was meant to be a human
sacrifice all along.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.723
Elfrieden's too far from the
Demon Lord's Domain

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:43.974
and can't provide aid.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:47.186
Also, they never signed the
Mankind Declaration.

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.896
In the member nations' view,

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:51.148
we were being protected
by the declaration,

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.110
despite the fact we weren't
contributing any support.

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.029
So you arranged for them to
perform the hero summoning

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:59.615
to create the appearance that
they were giving something back.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:01.992
[JUNA]
Wait.

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:04.829
Since we aren't even signatories
to the Mankind Declaration,

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.497
we had no obligation
to provide support

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.998
in the first place, did we?

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.376
But even so, we were
a direct beneficiary

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.837
of the bulwark
created by the treaty.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.672
It was imperative
we do our duty.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.591
Otherwise, we'd invite backlash
from the signatory nations.

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:18.843
Oh, my word.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:21.095
To placate the nations
that did sign on,

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:22.596
you also requested war subsidies

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:24.598
from the non‐signatory
countries,

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.183
or, if they could
not provide money,

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:28.394
some equivalent sacrifice.

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.688
I don't know what
I can tell you.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.314
Let's be honest with each other.

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:34.275
You didn't actually think
the hero summoning

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:36.527
would end up working, did you?

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:37.403
Didn't matter.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:40.322
The empire figured as long as
the ritual had been carried out,

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:43.743
that would be enough to
appease the signatory nations.

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:45.411
You are quite astute.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:47.788
However, somehow, you
ended up being summoned

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.207
into our world.

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:53.294
And after being called here
and then having the throne

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.504
yielded to you by King Albert,

00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:57.798
every single effort you've
made has been to turn

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.842
the country around.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.845
It's like I said before,
what's done is done.

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:06.098
I don't blame you, now that I
know all the circumstances.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.224
And besides.

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:13.689
If I wasn't summoned,
I wouldn't have found a family.

00:21:13.731 --> 00:21:16.150
Still, if it bothers you
enough that you'll accept

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.570
my jurisdiction over Van,
we could call it even.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.197
Sorry, but I can't.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:24.033
You're not the only one who
wants to protect their family.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.409
In that case,

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.745
I suppose we will
have to negotiate.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:28.579
[JEANNE]
Yes.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:31.207
And when we do,
I hope you'll go easy on me.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.174
I suspect it won't
be easy on me.

00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.763
Look at this beautiful dress!

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.224
Big Brother bought it for me
at the market today!

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:49.642
It's adorable!

00:21:49.683 --> 00:21:50.726
Oh, and Aisha.

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:52.770
I got something for you as well.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:54.522
Ah, Your Majesty!

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:56.065
I'm simply delighted you
went through the trouble

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:57.483
of buying me a present!

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:02.279
First, that dress, Aisha,
and now makeup?

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.031
If this keeps up, it could
cause me to turn over

00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:05.658
a new feminine leaf!

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:08.577
But no matter how I look, I will
defend His Majesty's life!

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.498
[SOUMA] And Liscia.
You didn't think I forgot you?

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.044
[LISCIA]
It's gorgeous, Souma!

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.594
Be honest, tell me how I look.

00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:27.972
[TOMOE]
Big Sister, you're so beautiful!

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:29.390
‐‐[JUNA] Truly.
‐‐[AISHA] Very nice, Princess.

00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:31.976
[SOUMA] Empire or not,
come whatever may,

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:34.478
I am going to keep
moving forward.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.022
To protect Liscia and the others

00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:39.733
and everybody I consider
part of my family.
