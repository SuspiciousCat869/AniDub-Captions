WEBVTT

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.720
[NARRATOR] Last we left,
an epic battle commenced

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:14.431
between Elfrieden,
led by Souma Kazuya

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:17.142
from modern day Japan,
against Amidonia.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:20.896
Fortunately, the conflict
came to a quick end,

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:24.608
bringing with it
a time of peace.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.279
However, this solace would
prove to be only temporary.

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:30.197
The reason?

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.075
The army of the Gran Chaos
Empire intervened,

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.993
history's greatest power.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.247
Their forces made their
way swiftly towards Van.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.601
The evening is quiet, isn't it?

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.811
Yes, it certainly is, dear.

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.980
With Liscia and our
future son-in-law away,

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:29.608
it's as if the spark's
gone out around here.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.985
But then again, this was
typically how the kingdom felt

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.904
when it was under my command.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.448
Yes, they're away, but our
ministers, Royal Guard,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.909
and even the maids are still
working with such intensity

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.327
these days.

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.745
Mmm.

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:43.747
But there's no denying
that out of all of them,

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.041
the acting king is pulling
more than his weight.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.794
I had no idea what was necessary
to be an effective monarch

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.088
for one's country.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.340
I continue to believe
abdicating the throne

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:56.176
so he could rule was
the wisest decision.

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:57.177
Yes.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.181
I wonder, though, if this is
what it will take to finally

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:02.641
change things.

00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:06.186
You must have faith.

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:07.854
It's unlike the other time.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:10.482
She had been here
from the very beginning.

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:12.317
[ALBERT]
Hmm.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.111
As long as they work as a pair,

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.280
I have no doubt the outcome
will be far different, my love.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.450
Besides, it's not as if they're
on their own, you know.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.369
The advisors he brought
on are making things

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:23.829
much livelier.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.206
Ho, ho, ho. Right you are.

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:29.751
And to think, we even have
ourselves another daughter now.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:33.130
Yes! A most adorable one named
Tomoe with wolf ears,

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.757
purple hair and
a soft, fluffy tail.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.758
[SOUMA grunts]

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:40.929
I don't know my own strength!

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:42.180
Please forgive me!

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.140
He's all right!

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.766
You were just lucky
that was only clay

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:47.352
and not a stone or a
dagger to the forehead.

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:52.065
No way around it.
I'm just no match for you.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:54.276
[AISHA]
I wouldn't go that far.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.237
Aisha. You're assessing
his combat potential.

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.030
Tell him how bad he is.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.033
The plan for an adventurer
party was a bust, too?

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.661
[AISHA] To have a full party,
you'd need a mage.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.788
If your shield had
reinforcement magic cast on it,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.040
it would have been
harder to get through it.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.793
Maybe so, but harder
doesn't mean impossible.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.296
Apparently, while I do fall
under the mage category,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.882
I guess I'm not a very good one.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.176
I do wonder, though,
if I got training somewhere,

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:22.095
would I be able to use elemental
or reinforcement magic?

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.430
Not a chance.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:24.598
Huh?

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.683
I've never heard of anyone
who could wield magic

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:30.020
outside of their own
attribute before.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.397
Plus, there aren't
many dark mages.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.233
As far as I recall,
I've only ever seen three.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.318
Wait, three?

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.489
There's Tomoe and myself,
but that leaves one more.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.657
My mother, supposedly.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.493
Good luck getting her to
tell you what kind of power

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:45.660
she has, though.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:46.870
Oh, yeah?

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.956
Then Lady Elisha can
also use dark magic?

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:52.292
Kinda disappointing how I
get these brand-new powers

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.544
and still can't
even defend myself.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.296
You have nothing to worry about!

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:58.215
As long as I'm by your
side, Your Majesty,

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.675
you will never be in harm's way!

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.470
Just seems like a hero should
be able to protect themself.

00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:04.763
No offense, Aisha.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.100
Pardon, sire, Hakuya
is looking for you.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:12.646
I believe he wishes to discuss
Van's redevelopment with you.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.481
The empire is coming, sire.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.401
An imperial force of 50,000.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.996
I've finished laying out
the improvements.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.665
Please look them over.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:32.707
Oh.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.877
--Hakuya...
--Sire?

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.004
Well, you overdid it.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.214
Apologies.

00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:42.092
There's too much of an
emphasis on efficiency.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.302
Look, if we're
renovating this much,

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.846
it'd be quicker to
scrap the whole city

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.849
and rebuild it from scratch.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.184
It's ambitious, but after
seeing how disordered

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:54.896
the original designs were, I
simply couldn't help myself.

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.190
Still, for the sake of
firefighting logistics,

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:59.484
I feel some rezoning
is in order.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.361
[SOUMA]
Regarding all other policies,

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.655
I'd like them to reflect
the will of the people.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:06.032
The will of the people,
Your Majesty?

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:09.077
I want the residents to have
a say about what kind of city

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.829
they'd prefer to live in.

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:13.164
If we end up making all
those choices for them,

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.916
expect some backlash.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.627
But, judging by the mood
of the city at the moment,

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.589
it's liable to become the
capital for avant-garde art.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.299
A destination for art, huh?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.010
Now that could be a bit
interesting, don't you think?

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.763
With all due respect, since Van
is the front line of Amidonia,

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.765
I would not recommend it.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.767
We'll have to make it more
comfortable to live in

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.478
while retaining its function
as a military town.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.564
What choice do we have?

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:39.107
Find us a decent compromise.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:42.736
As you wish, sire.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:45.864
Your Highness.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:49.159
Is redevelopment even
a top priority right now?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.120
And using the kingdom's
funding, no less.

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:55.999
As of this moment,
more than ever, Juna.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:59.085
Thing is, Van's economy
is stagnant right now.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.712
Their soldiers are out of work.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.465
First, we need to secure
employment for them.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.467
On the plus side, goods
are making their way back

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:06.635
on the streets.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.261
Not fast enough.

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.180
Think of it like when
someone's emaciated

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:13.725
and then finally gets the
opportunity to eat again.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.102
We need them to
get better, and fast.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.229
You mean the public works
are kind of the feast

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.357
that will help
make the city full?

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.524
That's right.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:24.152
What they're going to do
is help usher in new money,

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.988
which will further
stimulate the economy.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.199
Till that happens,
nothing will change.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.117
Doesn't matter how long we wait.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:35.497
Majesty, you're always
thinking three steps ahead.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.499
And the transportation network?

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.335
[LUDWIN] Sire, the military is
doing everything in its power

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:41.795
at the moment.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:44.756
Service to the main road
is already completed,

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.759
and we're repairing the ones
around and near the villages.

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.845
Also, we have successfully
installed eight bridges

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.555
over the rivers.

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.641
I sense a "but."

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.769
I realize maintaining
supply lines is important,

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.146
but won't all of this work be
in vain once we are forced

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.023
to return their territory?

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:03.650
You have a point.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.777
The thought of Julius taking
advantage of the bridges

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.321
we built grates on my nerves.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.740
[HAKUYA]
I doubt that will happen.

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:13.618
Even if Prince Julius
were to return to power,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.747
he will not allow any facilities
built by the kingdom to be used.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.375
It's a matter of pride
for him, sire.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.585
If I was in his shoes,
I'd use anything I could,

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.713
whether it was Amidonian or not.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.632
[chuckles] That doesn't
sound like you at all.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.218
Personally, I want to
rub it in his face.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.387
I'm afraid I don't understand.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.140
I'm talking about putting
our names on the bridges.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.725
Here, listen to this.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:40.020
We'll have the Souma Bridge,
and also one for Liscia.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.479
As well as Albert.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.897
There'll be Hakuya's.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.233
The Ludwin Bridge.
The Poncho Bridge.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.569
Then there's Aisha's and Juna's.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.404
Let's engrave a name on each.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.488
I get it.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.574
Even if the territory
does get returned,

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.118
they'll inherit the bridges
that we have built there.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.538
Soon after, the anti-kingdom
faction will come along

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.873
and destroy them.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.167
The residents will lose the
convenience of using them

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.836
and blame the
Amidonian government.

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.172
[SOUMA] The motion passes unless
there are any objections.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.214
[LUDWIN]
Sire.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.388
If there's nothing else,
we will excuse ourselves.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.106
I suppose it will be
rather difficult to refuse

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:28.318
the return of Van if
the empire requests it.

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.071
I am going to stand
by my policy,

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:34.407
but somehow I doubt I'll be
able to twist Jeanne's arm.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:37.994
And if we appear hostile,
it'll be a diplomatic failure.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.621
Then it must be true.

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.082
The hero summoning.
That was how they allowed us

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.500
to aid the cause.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:44.959
Sounds like it.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.128
Just how long have you known?

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.464
When I first heard
about Empress Maria.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.509
Her people refer to her
as a saint for a reason.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.844
Imagine one being cruel.
Unheard of.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.514
You're basing all of
your trust on her title?

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:00.266
It wasn't bestowed on her
out of pure convenience.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:03.478
Where a saint walks, others
follow in their footsteps.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.524
The world needs a banner,
one to unite all mankind

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.734
against their common threat.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.694
Whether she wants
to be that or not.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.866
When I met Jeanne,
that's when it hit me.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.868
The Gran Chaos Empire.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.662
They are nothing more
than a mere superpower

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:23.540
trying to maintain control.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.708
That's why we
have to stay alert.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.420
There's no room for carelessness
or ego when dealing with them.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.630
You're right.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.423
We have to go
into this steadfast.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.967
[knocking]

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.009
Enter!

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.893
What is it?

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.562
There's news, sire.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.355
The empire has arrived.

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:50.733
Also, they are accompanied
by the Prince of Amidonia.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.364
Here we go.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.543
[NARRATOR]
October 21st, 1546.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.087
It was on this day of
the Continental Calendar

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:14.007
that at least 50,000 of
the Gran Chaos Empire's

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:16.843
elite forces took up
positions a day's march

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.094
from Van.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.054
With this sizable
force at their back,

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:23.183
the Gran Chaos Empire's
general, Jeanne Euphoria,

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:24.309
entered the castle.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.811
Accompanying her
was Julius Amidonia,

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.688
the son of Gaius
the Eighth.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.607
Once next in line to the throne,

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.775
the current crown
prince of Amidonia

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.987
now had to bargain
for his homeland.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.739
How surprising.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.782
I had imagined this meeting
would be attended by

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.035
a large number of soldiers.

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:43.995
Hardly the way
to treat my guests.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.456
I doubted it would make
for productive talks.

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:47.665
Fully agreed.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.293
Quite the daring
gentlemen, aren't you?

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.754
Well, nothing compared to
a certain unnamed ruler

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:55.632
that ended up losing a war
then ran to the empire

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:56.925
for their assistance.

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:02.388
Calm down, Julius, or did you
not notice the dark elf?

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.641
Leave it to King Souma to
have such a skilled warrior

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:07.268
as a retainer.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.519
Why, thank you.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.775
Are you not worried that
you might be killed here?

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:17.528
Since I have arrived here
today as an envoy of peace,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.447
why should any harm befall me?

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.035
It's nice to finally meet you.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:25.662
My name is Souma Kazuya.

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.083
Julius, Crown Prince
of Amidonia.

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:32.418
State what your business is.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.213
I want Van returned
to me, at once!

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.465
So stop wasting my
time and step down!

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.050
What did I say?

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.427
The Principality of
Amidonia is a signatory

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.179
of the Mankind Declaration!

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.306
It clearly states that any
changes to the borders...

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.892
...due to military action
will not be recognized.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.436
And you believe we've
violated that article?

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.437
Of course!

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.273
And in accordance
with the Declaration.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.400
I demand you relinquish
control of Van

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.110
and its surrounding territories!

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.570
You've no right
to demand anything!

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.447
Or did you forget you were
the ones that invaded

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.283
the Kingdom of Elfrieden?

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.452
Only after you were defeated
did the treaty matter to you.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.246
And now you're seeking
your lost lands using

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.706
the empire's prestige.

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:13.543
The invasion of your country
was an arbitrary decision

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.503
made by my late father, Gaius.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:18.798
A campaign that you took part
in and share the blame for.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.634
On that note, before we
discuss the return of land,

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.846
you should apologize for
invading our territory.

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:25.763
To you?

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.391
The King's correct
in this instance.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.810
Our position is to request
that your territory be given

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:31.853
back to you.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.649
The decision to go to war
was a capricious one

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.359
made by my father.

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.987
I'm to blame for being
unable to stop him,

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.406
and yes, I will
apologize for that.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:47.910
However, presently, your country
is violating our borders!

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.288
I demand you give back our land!

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.707
Yes, we all know
what you think, Julius,

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.584
but what does the empire say?

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.252
We can't afford to
dismiss the requests

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.254
of our signatory nations.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:01.257
So in other words, you're
demanding the following:

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.468
The Kingdom of Elfrieden
must return all occupied

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:05.470
territories, including Van?

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.596
That is correct.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.099
My answer is no.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:11.559
You won't?

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.353
Are you out of your mind?

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.396
You would defy the Declaration?

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.398
I don't plan on
defying anything.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.233
Then you-- I--

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.652
As the ruler of this
country and its protector,

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.488
it is my duty to
liberate my people

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:25.490
from under your occupation!

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.492
To "liberate," them, huh?

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:30.203
By that token, surely you can
express what the residents

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:31.287
of Van desire.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:32.872
Meaning?

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:34.332
On your way here.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.584
I trust you were able to
observe how the streets of Van

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:37.919
have drastically altered.

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:42.131
I was born and
raised in this city.

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.467
I know it far better
than you ever will!

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.843
[SOUMA]
Is that so?

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:49.222
Then tell me what you think of
the new palette it's taken on.

00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:50.348
[JULIUS]
Palette?

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.935
I saw a number of houses
painted in horrendous colors.

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.770
[SOUMA] You may think so,
but why would people

00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.730
who are oppressed
under our occupation,

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.816
according to you, feel free
to make their roofs

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:01.901
and walls more colorful,
do you think?

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.362
Huh? Well, I...

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:07.407
When I first arrived in Van,
all I could see was gray.

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:10.118
Not a single shred
of individuality.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.120
Now, there's freedom
of expression.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.789
People can paint their homes,
choosing whatever color

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:15.957
they might prefer.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.045
Comparing how it looked
before with the Van

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.714
that's now under my control,
which do you think

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.967
is the more liberated city?

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:27.176
How dare you!

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.637
Stand down, Julius!

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.891
Remove your hand from
your sword, too, Aisha.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.186
Right.

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:38.521
King Souma.

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:41.858
I would ask that you refrain
from trying to rile Julius.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:44.152
[SOUMA]
I was only stating the facts.

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.863
If one wishes to lead,
they must govern the realm

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:50.241
effectively while also
saving its people.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.785
You taxed Van's
residents to death.

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:55.413
Oppressing them while
bolstering your military might.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.873
And whose fault is that?

00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:58.958
If the Elfrieden royal
family hadn't stolen

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.169
my grandfather's land from him--

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.422
That's you and your family's
favorite excuse, isn't it?

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.466
But the fact of the matter
is your country is the one

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:09.677
that's been continuously
doing harm to ours.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:10.678
Hakuya.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.804
Yes, Sire.

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:23.065
This is...?

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:24.942
A list of all the noblemen
from Elfrieden

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:29.322
who were incited to insurrection
by the Principality of Amidonia.

00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:31.616
They were the ones
who instigated a revolt,

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:34.911
encouraged fraud, and then
motivated these nobles

00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:38.080
to be uncooperative
toward the royal family.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.123
Incredible.

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:42.877
[HAKUYA]
It's shocking.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.630
But the fact is, they're
only pretending to abide

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:48.466
by the Declaration, while
secretly their country

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:50.426
interferes in foreign affairs.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.095
And yet even after all this,
they stand before us now,

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.805
speaking about vengeance.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.682
It's the Kingdom of
Elfrieden's fault your country

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:59.101
is so poor, our fault your
people are starving

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:01.938
and whatever direction you look,
there's endless suffering.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:04.023
Meanwhile you spend your
hard-earned tax money

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.817
on the military instead
of people and blame us.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.819
What're you saying?

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.446
It's awfully convenient.

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.156
As long as you beat
the drum of revenge,

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.825
you can conceal your own
mismanagement of the city,

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.744
and direct the anger
of the people unfairly

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:18.329
towards our country.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.497
Damn you!

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.831
What did I just say?

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.754
And I asked you to
stop aggravating him.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.382
I'm sorry, but my intention
was to make it clear

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:32.510
Elfrieden is also fed up with
the Principality of Amidonia's

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:33.594
poor conduct.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.349
I would like to make
you a proposal.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.226
Could I ask you to kindly
leave us the room,

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:41.394
please, Julius?

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.522
You have some nerve!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.732
You want me to sit out of
discussions about the return

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:48.526
of my own homeland?

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:50.278
You still don't understand?

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.196
There wasn't any point
for you to even show up

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:54.156
to these negotiations.

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:55.950
You arrogant--

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:58.202
It's the empire that's
seeking the return of land

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:00.580
against the backdrop
of military force.

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.206
You're powerless.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.000
Since that's the case,
discussion will take place

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:06.127
between Jeanne and myself.

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:07.545
The gall!

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.880
It's my territory and
you will deal with me!

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:14.719
Stand down, Julius, and allow
me to handle the negotiations.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.471
The empire does
have other business.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:21.642
With you here, this discussion
has reached total standstill.

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:24.228
From here on out,
I will do the talking.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.441
All due respect, isn't that a
bit of a one-sided argument?

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:30.610
Then the empire will withdraw.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.778
Feel free to bargain
as you like afterward.

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.450
I trust that you'll
do your best.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.419
Please forgive him.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.171
He's difficult today.

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:52.715
Only today, or all of the time?

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.259
[LISCIA] The two of them are
joking, but the mood's grown

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.802
more tense.

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:59.305
Let us start over, King Souma.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:01.390
As you know, I am
General Jeanne Euphoria

00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:03.643
of the Gran Chaos Empire.

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.102
In my sister's stead,

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:08.022
I am here representing
Maria Euphoria.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.149
I welcome you to Van, Jeanne.

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:13.903
I am Acting King of Elfrieden,
Souma Kazuya.

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.154
[JEANNE]
Princess Liscia.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.281
I am relieved to
find you are well.

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:20.660
I am equally pleased to see that
you're in good health, Jeanne.

00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:23.162
Hold on. You two
know each other?

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.121
That's right.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:26.207
We met once when
we were children.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.668
That was long before the Demon
Lord's Domain appeared.

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:29.877
Yes, it was.

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.879
During a conference
with the former King Albert,

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.589
if I remember right.

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.383
At an age where games
were more interesting

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:36.592
than politics.

00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:41.472
I would like us to have
a candid discussion.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.058
[SOUMA] As would I.
But before we begin,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.311
Liscia, would you go
and fetch Serina for me?

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:48.521
Right away.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:57.446
So, a minute ago, you
mentioned you and Liscia

00:19:57.488 --> 00:20:00.449
used to play games together
back when you were children.

00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:04.036
I guess royal families would
interact with each other often.

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:05.746
It depends on the nation.

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:07.707
When the foreign minister
visited Elfrieden,

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.209
I forced him to take me
along to meet the princess.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.836
Insistent of you.

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:14.630
It seems Liscia has grown into
an even stronger Princess

00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:15.923
than before.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.049
If you say so.

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:19.427
Fair warning, even back then,

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.470
I couldn't land a
single hit on her.

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:23.681
So when you said how you
used to play games together,

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:26.684
it was more like you two
were practicing combat.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.769
A couple of tomboys, huh?

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:32.773
Or are you only bringing it up
to try and keep me in check?

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:33.983
Maybe.

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:39.780
Sire, I have come here
as you have requested.

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:40.990
Your wish?

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.491
Here's the deal.

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:46.328
The Amidonian Prince
Julius is in the VIP suite.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.664
Please prepare a banquet
and see that he's entertained.

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:50.249
I'd be more than happy to.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:53.419
But to be clear, when you
say keep him entertained,

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.880
you want me to take
charge of him, correct?

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.965
A little formal, but yeah.

00:20:58.007 --> 00:20:59.884
That is exactly what I mean.

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:02.511
In that case, I would like
permission to open

00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:04.847
the bottle of vintage tequeur
in the castle's wine cellar,

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.098
Your Majesty.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.100
As long as we provide our
guests with the best level

00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:09.393
of hospitality.

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:12.188
Highness.

00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:14.440
I will personally make
sure Julius's chalice

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:16.400
never runs empty.

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:18.319
I guarantee he will be
more than pleased

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.447
with my hospitality, however
much he can remember.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.827
What's wrong? Am I
missing something?

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:27.828
Tell me.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:34.168
Souma.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.962
Tequeur is a hard liquor
renowned for its strength.

00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:39.215
It has such a pleasant flavor,
people end up drinking

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.926
too much of it and for someone
not accustomed to the effects,

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.720
they will be indisposed
for some time.

00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:48.224
So basically you're saying,
if she serves him a drink...

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:50.184
I guarantee you that
the banquet will be over

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.019
in less than ten minutes.

00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:53.646
That's not very hospitable!

00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:03.197
Just this once, I actually
feel a bit sorry for Julius.

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.993
This really is quite
the amusing country.

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.665
I suggest we relocate
and start negotiating.

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:14.708
Does that sound agreeable,
Jeanne Euphoria,

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.378
general of the Gran
Chaos Empire's forces?

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:18.754
Very much so.

00:22:18.796 --> 00:22:21.549
Provisional King Souma
Kazuya of Elfrieden.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.092
I'll let you lead the way.
