00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:10.219
[NARRATOR]
Refugees.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.095
One of the most difficult
challenges facing

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.472
modern society.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:16.433
Persecution, strife,
and violence.

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:18.602
These are just a few reasons
why people are forced

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:21.063
to flee the country
where they were born.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:24.399
In order to survive, they
escape to other nations.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.444
Some by foot, others by boat.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.363
Here in the
Kingdom of Friedonia,

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:32.324
the problem is very
much the same.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.160
There is a refugee camp
located just outside the walls

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.704
of the royal capital of Parnam.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.249
Within it are just under
a thousand people.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.169
Humans, elves,
beastmen, dwarves.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:46.672
Most have one thing in common:

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.757
they were driven from their
lands by the expansion

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.968
of the Demon Lord's Domain.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.097
However, compared
to other refugees,

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.975
those in the Kingdom of
Friedonia were more fortunate.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.310
Elsewhere, circumstances
for refugees

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.312
are considerably harsher.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.856
There are nations bordering
the Demon Lord's Domain

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.234
where refugees are
forcibly conscripted

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:09.611
and sent to fight
on the front lines.

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:11.780
Or, under the guise
of protecting them,

00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:14.491
they were employed as
cheap labor and exploited

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.159
to the point of slavery.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.789
Now that domestic affairs
had become settled

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:22.082
to some degree,

00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:25.294
Souma had finally resolved to
deal with this matter head-on.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.684
That's a rather large tent.

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.227
Not so much a tent.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.604
More like a Mongolian ger.

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.147
It's not important.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.816
The chief's expecting us.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:11.983
Let's meet him.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.910
[JIRUKOMA] Your Majesty,
Great King of Friedonia,

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:23.453
thank you for visiting with us.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:25.580
[SOUMA] First off, let's skip
this whole "Great King"

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.082
business.

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:28.500
Yes, as you wish.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.001
My name is Jirukoma.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.796
I have been put in charge
of this refugee camp.

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:35.632
Sitting here at my
side is my sister.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:36.758
My name's Komain.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.385
It is a pleasure, sire.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.387
And my name is Souma Kazuya.

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.431
Friedonia's king.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.516
I understand you helped
rescue some members

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:46.059
of the settlement earlier.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.062
I would like to offer
my sincerest thanks.

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:50.939
[SOUMA] It was the
adventurers working security

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.107
that saved them.

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:54.401
You can thank them if you wish.

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.570
I came here for another reason,

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.697
regarding a matter
that needs resolving.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.661
I'm here to help you
make an informed choice.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.247
My messengers told
you your options,

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.166
and now you must decide which.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.125
You can't!

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.376
Stop, Komain!

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.086
I will speak my mind!

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.130
Our words will determine
the course of action

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:17.716
for everyone residing
here in this camp.

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:19.134
We must remain calm.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:22.846
I'll hold my tongue, then.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.057
Souma.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.685
I think it's time you explained
to me what's going on.

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:29.853
You're right.

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:32.939
The refugee crisis has
gone on far too long.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.025
We need to find a resolution.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.194
So I asked them
to make a decision.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.779
Decide what?

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.572
Become subjects of
the kingdom and forsake

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:43.658
their home or tear down camp
and leave this country.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.207
I know what you want.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:51.625
Return to your homelands,
which are now

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.044
the Demon Lord's Domain,
where you'll resume

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.463
your old way of life.

00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:59.216
But presently, unless we
drive away the monsters,

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.634
that's impossible.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:05.096
Nor can anyone tell
when that will be possible.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.058
Just what do you intend
on doing in the meantime?

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.602
Remain here in a strange,
foreign land hoping

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.979
that you'll get the
chance to return,

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.732
living in limbo until then?

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:18.235
We can't have you
staying here unofficially.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.820
Under any other circumstances,

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.404
hunting and gathering
without permission

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.240
would be illegal.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.450
If these actions are
allowed to continue,

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.411
I guarantee you'll incur the
wrath of the kingdom's people.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:29.955
But we have all been
tolerant of them

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.707
for this long,
and even supported them.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.668
Yes, that's my point.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.212
The kingdom has several
problems to deal with,

00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:40.423
so I chose to stay on the
same course as Albert.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.592
But this, it's an issue
I can no longer simply

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.052
leave unaddressed.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.470
Well, isn't that a bit...

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:49.182
This land of ours, think of
it like a giant person.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:52.811
It is so easy for them to love
those who love them in return,

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.021
but when a group
doesn't reciprocate,

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.148
it's more difficult.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.318
If you insist on remaining
committed to your homelands

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.613
and feel no sense of
belonging to the kingdom...

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:04.781
Well, then.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.825
I'm afraid I will
have to expel you.

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:10.495
All that we want is to
return to where we were

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.247
forced out.

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.207
And I have no objection
if that sentiment

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.917
remains within your hearts.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.963
If the situation changes, and
you are able to return back,

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.507
then you are free
to venture home.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.719
But as long as you
reside in this country.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.929
I need you to feel
like you belong here.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.350
You have no idea what
we've gone through!

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.393
Don't, Komain!

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:36.438
No, Brother.
Enough. I will speak.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.065
You are the king over this
nation and yet you still

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.483
have your own country!

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.569
Sire. You don't know
what it's like to be torn

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:43.904
from your home and have to--

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:44.988
Yes, I do.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.034
You must have heard.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.704
How I was summoned to this world
from my own without any say?

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.497
I have no way of going back.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.834
Souma.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.302
Still.

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.471
I have Liscia and the others.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.432
Those by my side, supporting me.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.060
People who genuinely
care about me.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:18.980
I didn't want to let them down,
so I worked on end.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.523
And then eventually,

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:24.194
I realized I felt as though
I belonged here, too.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.154
If I'd lost this country,

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.156
I probably would've
grieved as much as I did

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.866
losing my original home.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:35.288
The fact is, you might
not be accepted right away.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.957
But you can't move
forward if you refuse

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.208
to take action.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.126
And just how accepting
will you be?

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.504
The same as the
Gran Chaos Empire?

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.716
Princess. I'm confused.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:49.010
The empire offers refugees land,

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.596
the undeveloped parcels
within their country.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.974
And If they settle it,
then it can be recognized

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.976
as their provisional residence.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.311
Oh, yeah? And what's the catch?

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:00.563
If they can be self-sufficient,
they aren't a drain

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.399
on the empire's coffers.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.361
And if they are able to return
to the northern territory later,

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.614
the land that they had just
cleared will remain behind.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.825
Either way, the
empire loses nothing.

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.078
Jirukoma.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.122
I'm sorry, but we can't
implement the same policy

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.873
as their country.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:19.916
Why not?

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.835
Because it's dangerous.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.920
Dangerous? How so?

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.672
You clear the land,
pour your blood,

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.674
sweat, and tears into it.

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.343
If so, you'd consider it
as your own, correct?

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.806
For the generation that
still wants to go home,

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.099
that's fine.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.768
But what about
the next one, after?

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.313
Ask yourself this: When
they're born on that land

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.483
without any context of
their parents' country,

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.902
will they view it as
a temporary lease,

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.988
or something more important?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.158
I'm curious, are you suggesting
that the empire's policy

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.367
is just wrong?

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.660
I'm not.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.079
We just differ in our thinking.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.248
Maria chose that policy
because she believed

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.543
it was the best, whereas
I fear for the worst,

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.795
and won't take
the same approach.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.130
And that's all there is.

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.923
If that's your stance,

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:12.093
I'd like to know just what your
grand solution could be.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.846
Giving up returning to our
homeland and become subjects

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.557
of the kingdom without
any land for clearing

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.517
or will we be thrown out?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.604
Just what exactly is it
that you expect us to do?

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.819
Master Owen.

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.696
--Sire?
--Show them.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.364
As you command, my lord.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.625
[SOUMA] This is Venetinova,
a gulf coast city we're

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.376
currently building.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:48.004
The residential and commercial
districts are constructed,

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:51.174
and we've established a
trading port at this point.

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:54.135
Later, we'll add even more
facilities and develop it

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.471
into a city that will be on
the cutting edge of culture

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:57.972
and life.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.516
As for the refugees,

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.768
I'm thinking of letting them
take up residence here.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.815
Become a resident of this
country and you will have

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.149
a home.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.110
There're plenty of jobs, too.

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.654
Don't believe me, just
ask the mystic wolves.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.739
They run distilleries in Parnam.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.825
I guarantee if you
become citizens,

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.119
as long as you work hard,
you will never go hungry

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.286
or cold.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.957
[overlapping chatter]

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.917
What are you talking
about, Brother?

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.627
He is pretty much
calling us strays

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.672
and throwing us scraps to
try and make us roll over!

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:31.548
Komain.

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.134
What his Majesty is offering
us is an actual chance

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.052
to establish roots here.

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:37.345
So that's it then?

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:40.098
Are we just gonna give up
on ever going back home?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.767
Don't tell me that doesn't
bother you at all!

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.520
I can't blame you for
having differing opinions.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.355
After looking at
my own proposal,

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.440
on one hand, it's enticing.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.359
While on the other hand,
I could see how it might seem

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.569
quite cruel.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.698
But this is the most I can
do for you right now.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:58.825
Everything else comes
down to your decision.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.831
There are those residing
here who will insist on

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.584
returning to their homelands,
no matter what.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.252
Just like Komain, right?

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:10.503
Oh, no.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:13.298
My sister, she is open-minded.

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:16.176
What she said before
was for all the others.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.470
She wishes to represent all
voices on the settlement.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.805
Despite her own views.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.682
B-Big brother...

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.517
It's true, is it not?

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.978
When you had said
it was terrible,

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.981
you were just speaking on
behalf of those who think that.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:33.026
Because you feel
the pain of others.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.490
Your Majesty, we thank you,
but I cannot make

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.618
this decision on my own.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.745
I would like to gather the
members of the settlement

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:45.955
before giving you an answer.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:48.374
I am here to help
you reach a decision,

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.751
as I've mentioned.

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.377
Yes, I understand.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.713
If possible, I'd like to
convince as many people

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:56.132
in the settlement as I can
to accept the hand

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.635
Your Majesty has
generously extended.

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:02.055
Even if it does mean
dividing all of the refugees.

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:03.806
[SOUMA]
"Dividing the refugees."

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.184
In other words, accept
the offer or be ostracized

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.394
even more than you already are.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.355
There isn't much time.

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.899
You can spend time
recruiting residents,

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.526
but the seasons don't
wait for anyone.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.153
You speak the truth.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.072
Winter is coming.

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:22.367
If we don't prepare,
our people could freeze.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:24.827
But please, give us
some more time.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.871
Good.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.250
I heard that you
were in here, Hilde.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:31.501
Brad, you creep!

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.336
Thanks for running off
and leaving me to handle

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:34.587
all your lectures!

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.508
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:41.135
You can air your
grievances a bit later.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.637
I need your help now.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.013
It's urgent.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:45.807
Who's the patient?

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:49.185
There's a woman.
Her water has just broken.

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:51.354
It's the baby's position.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.231
It's facing the wrong way,

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.441
with its head at the
top of the uterus.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.110
That's a problem.

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.404
Transverse presentations
are very rare.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.656
The midwife is at
a total loss, as well.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.658
Typically in these scenarios,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.286
only the mother or
the child can survive.

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:08.496
It'll be hard to save
both of them.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:09.664
All right.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.833
We'll just have to
cut her open then.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:13.418
Can you do it?

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.169
I understand the survival
rate for mothers

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.130
is less than 20%.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:20.091
The reason for it being so low
should be fairly obvious.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.426
Oh? Why is that?

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.304
The ones who operated
weren't as smart as us.

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:27.056
You make the
incredible sound simple.

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.391
It's the truth.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:31.477
Or more precisely,
because they lacked my skills,

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:34.314
as well as your three-eye
knowledge of pathogens.

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:37.317
I can bring the survival
rate up to 80% alone.

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:41.446
Hilde, if you're at my side,
keeping things sanitary,

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.197
together we can bring
the survival rate up

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.033
to nearly 100%.

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:47.076
Dammit, how can
I argue with that?

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.078
Well, King, you heard
what the man said:

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.913
we've got an emergency.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:52.957
I hate asking, but I need
you and your people's help

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.375
right now.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.002
[SOUMA]
Of course. You'll have it.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.256
I gave Hakuya my report of
the incident, Master Souma.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.090
Oh, good!

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.551
You arrived just in time
to help us, Dragonewt girl.

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.219
Wait. Help you with what?

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.055
Go to the medical lab in
the capital and bring me

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:10.016
my instruments and drugs
right here on the double.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.434
[CARLA]
Uh...

This is an emergency.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.479
Do exactly as she tells you.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.439
The king just gave you an order.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.440
Now listen.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.192
Ask for Hilde's black bag,
the researchers

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.069
will know what
you're talking about.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.945
I-- Yes, I understand!

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:25.907
You, refugee leader.

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:28.242
I would like to
borrow your tent.

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.829
For this procedure, we need the
most sanitary venue possible.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.374
I have no objections
if it will help you.

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:36.334
We're also going to
need blood transfusions,

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.961
so gather up as many
refugees as you can.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:40.171
[JIRUKOMA]
Understood.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.839
--As for you, King...
--Uh, yeah?

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.842
You know all about hygiene
where you come from, correct?

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.427
Explain the concept
to the leader here

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.888
and clean up this area
as much as you can.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.931
You got it.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.100
Well, let's start. Ready?

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:52.975
Right.

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.352
Lead the way, Majesty.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.271
Wait. Please allow me
to help out, too.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.190
All right, tell me everything
about the patient's

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.150
symptoms, Brad.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:03.694
We need lots of boiled water.

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:07.365
Once over 100 degrees,
it'll kill most pathogens.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:10.159
In order for this to
succeed, her tools need

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:11.494
to be sterilized!

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:27.427
I've heard about opening
a pregnant woman's belly,

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:28.970
but is it safe?

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.430
Oh, yes, without a doubt.

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:33.349
Cesarean sections are common
for difficult deliveries,

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:35.351
at least where I come from.

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:38.855
Your old home always sounds
like an amazing place, Souma.

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:41.607
I'm sure those two can pull
off a similar procedure.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.109
They're both pros.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.736
But then, we never had
access to light magic

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.155
in my world,

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:49.365
so the comparison
isn't so simple.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:50.700
Be that as it may,

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:53.077
I can't say I'm happy
about being stuck outside

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.496
while Carla's helping them.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.206
Jirukoma.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:16:00.042
Hilde and Brad
are skilled doctors.

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.670
I'm sure both mother
and baby will survive.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.547
So I want to bring this up.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:06.924
Yes, what is it?

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:10.470
When the child's born,
it'll be in the kingdom.

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:13.347
Not in their forefather's land.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:16.350
They will grow up here
and see it as home.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:20.396
Forcing newborns
to live as exiles

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:21.856
from a lost nation is...

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:24.025
There's no need to say any more.

00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:25.193
Big Brother.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.864
Listen, I have decided
what needs to be done.

Hope for the future has been
brought into this world!

How is the mother?

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.804
The operation was a success.

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:56.098
Both mother and child are fine.

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.020
Please stand up!

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.483
Great Sky Sun
who watches over us.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:07.151
For giving hope
to this settlement,

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:10.071
we humbly offer our gratitude.

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:13.616
Spirits of our ancestors,
who soar as elk in heaven,

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:17.787
please watch over this child
now, and for evermore.

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.497
I'm so glad.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.957
There aren't enough
words to thank you,

00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:22.291
Your Majesty.

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:24.293
Any you have should
be directed to them.

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:33.636
I'm stepping down as
leader of the settlement.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.596
--Komain will take over.
--Huh?

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:38.266
Are you saying that you're
going to leave us, Brother?

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.433
Good question.

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.726
What's your plan?

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:43.896
The people of this settlement.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:46.691
I know they are tired
of living like nomads.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:50.027
I'm certain, if they can make
this country their home,

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:53.030
it would be a wonderful
chance for them.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.240
And yet...

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.200
I know there are hardliners
who will never give up

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:57.827
on going home.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:18:01.998
That's why I will be heading
back north along with them.

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.584
I'll be keeping up
the fight for our nation

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.043
on the front lines.

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:09.171
Biding time until we
can take back our land.

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.007
Hold on a second!

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:14.010
You can't just run off when
the settlement needs you!

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:15.303
Don't forget.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:18.264
I said His Majesty's proposal
was cruel, didn't I?

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:20.099
I'm going north with you!

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.142
You can't.

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:23.769
You declined it out of
consideration for the others,

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:25.855
despite what you actually felt.

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:30.359
That heart of yours, it makes
you a better mediator than me.

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:33.112
There's a part of me,
some piece that can never

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.364
give up the thought
of going home.

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.450
When I was made chief,

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:40.578
I pushed my feelings aside
and had to keep them

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.872
buried in my heart until now.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:44.540
Big Brother.

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:45.625
Komain.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.585
It is for the best.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.920
His Majesty said if the
people of this settlement

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:53.132
love this country,
then he will be accepting them

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:56.594
as subjects of the kingdom.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.764
My role has come
to an end and I can let

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.099
my feelings soar now.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:05.853
Honestly, don't make
your sister cry, you jerk.

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:08.105
I don't know what else to say.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:11.359
Please look over Komain
and all of the others.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.820
I can promise you this:
I'll handle the paperwork.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:17.531
If there's anything that
can truly protect them,

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:19.659
it's the kingdom itself.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.618
All right.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.746
In that case, please make
sure the kingdom endures.

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:26.374
I will.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.845
Babies smell so lovely!

00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:42.014
He's not strong enough
to hold his head up yet.

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:43.808
Careful holding him.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.728
How are you feeling?

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:51.732
[MOTHER A] Fairly stable after
the operation, thank goodness.

00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:53.025
And my milk supply is good,

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.528
so I am able to nurse
him until he's full.

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:57.321
I'm relieved to hear that.

00:19:57.363 --> 00:19:59.407
When you said you were
splitting her belly open,

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:01.367
I was nervous at first.

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:02.785
Back where I'm from,

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:05.746
Cesarean sections have a
very high rate of success.

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:06.872
You little--

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.584
Don't make it sound so simple!

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.128
How would you like
to be cut open,

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.213
even if it's 100% successful?

00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:17.174
Did you see the infant?

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.884
Covered in blood and vernix?

00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:20.678
What about all the blood
spilled on the floor,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.680
and how much blood she
needed to have pumped back

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:23.889
into her?

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.141
Carla.

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:28.227
It doesn't matter how much
magic and medicine is used--

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.938
women still risk their
lives giving birth!

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.814
[baby crying]

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:34.775
There, there, please,
don't cry, little one.

00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:37.027
That's probably my cue
to give him back.

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.197
I'm sorry.

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.741
You're right.

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:44.076
I treated the
subject too lightly.

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:45.995
My apologies to you, too.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.747
Don't be ridiculous.

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:50.082
Without your help, I most
likely would not be here

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:51.625
holding my baby now.

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.586
If anyone should be bowing
their head in here,

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:55.296
it ought to be me.

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:58.257
As a man, it doesn't
affect me the same.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.426
I wish I could have
been of some use.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:02.136
In that case, I'd be
honored if you were

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.637
my son's godfather.

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:05.806
[SOUMA]
Huh? Who? Me?

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:06.807
Yes.

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:09.018
If Your Majesty were
to choose his name,

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:11.562
I'm sure this land would
provide him with good fortune

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.147
and health in return.

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:16.025
I'm honored, but you're
sure it should be me?

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:18.861
Even a man should
be able to handle that.

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.362
Well, all right.

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:22.531
A name, huh? Uh...

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:25.326
I've got it.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.952
What about "Fuku"?

00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:30.372
Back in my home world,
it means "happiness."

00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:31.415
"Fuku."

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:34.710
Sound good?

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:36.504
I don't know how to thank you.

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.839
With such a wonderful
name bestowed on him,

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:41.133
no doubt he will become
as tall and handsome

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:43.135
as an elk's antlers.

00:21:43.177 --> 00:21:45.679
Grow up to be
strong, little one.

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:47.515
Hi, Fuku!

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.892
[CARLA]
Boo!

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.936
[baby cooing]

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.813
Huh? What's wrong?

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:56.857
Other people's babies are cute,
but when they're your own,

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.901
they must be even more adorable.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.402
Yeah, I suppose so.

00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:07.576
Souma, um, how about
we start trying?

00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:10.329
Huh? You mean, like...
Oh. Yeah. Uh...

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:13.332
Well, actually, could we
wait a little while longer?

00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:16.001
Come on!
You're still not ready?

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.294
A-hem.

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:20.714
If you two don't mind,
save that talk for later.

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:22.800
Preferably when
I am very far away.
