WEBVTT

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.599
[SOUMA]
How is that matter coming along?

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.769
[HAKUYA] Sire, the plan is
making steady progress.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.356
One might even say
it's going quite smoothly.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.691
One might say you're
being a little evasive.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.360
Just tell me if there is
something we should be

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.111
worried about.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:31.490
[HAKUYA] To be honest, it may
be going a bit too smoothly.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:35.494
Almost as if there was some
other power at work here.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.871
In which case, it's conceivable
the outcome could take

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:40.499
an unexpected turn
at the last moment.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:43.043
[SOUMA] You know I'd like to
avoid unforeseen circumstances.

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:45.295
However, at this point,
we can't back out, either.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.588
Correct.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.132
Changing course is
now out of the question.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.552
All we can do is watch
out for adjustments

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.303
and keep moving forward.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:54.846
[HAKUYA]
Understood, sire.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.515
--[door opens]
--[LUDWIN] Your Majesty!

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.853
Something tells
me this can't wait.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.690
Excuse me, Prime Minister,
for interrupting your meeting.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:09.736
So, what's this
emergency, Ludwin?

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.280
[armor clangs]

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.533
[LUDWIN] I-It's an
acquaintance of mine, sire.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.661
They've gone and done
something truly outrageous!

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.204
We better discuss it at once.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.475
[LISCIA]
So this person,

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.560
they're a childhood friend
of Ludwin's, right?

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:09.189
Uh-huh. She's been called the
Forbidden Army's mad scientist.

00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:10.732
Is that so?

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.818
I almost feel like I've
heard of her before.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.780
[SOUMA]
Wait, a garage?

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.866
Uh, nothing, it's not important.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.285
Still, I'm confused by
what I'm looking at.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:23.495
[LUDWIN]
A dungeon entrance.

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:24.830
It's quite large inside.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.083
[SOUMA] Dungeon? You mean
as in a "dungeon" dungeon?

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.877
Is it supposed to
look this artificial?

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.671
[LISCIA]
There are many different types.

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:35.465
Some are merely caves,
while others are ancient

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.468
fortress basements,
paved with stone.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.470
There are even mysterious
spaces encased

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.139
completely in metal.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.558
[LUDWIN] As for this one,
this abandoned dungeon

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.768
was bequeathed by
the royal family,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.479
later converted into
a research facility,

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:53.108
and moved into by the
eccentric Maxwell family.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.110
Genia? It's Ludwin Arcs.

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:56.611
Can you open the door?

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.405
[crash]

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.157
Genia? Are you all right?

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.867
[GENIA]
Don't startle me like that, Lu.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.535
I accidentally knocked
over some material

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.871
I was experimenting with.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:06.788
Whew!

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.207
I'm just glad none of the
chemicals were dangerous.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.304
Some sort of metal...

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.265
Why are you so interested?

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:27.058
The staircase is glowing
and you don't find anything

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.019
about this that's peculiar?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.228
[LISCIA]
Must be magic.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.900
[SOUMA] I keep forgetting magic
makes the impossible real here.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:37.068
For Liscia and the
other inhabitants,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.112
something like this isn't
out of the ordinary.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.784
[LUDWIN] We've reached the
lowest level where Genia's

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.285
laboratory is located.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.837
This is a dungeon?
You're joking!

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.604
[LUDWIN]
Your Majesty. Welcome.

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.105
I'll introduce you to Genia.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.904
[GENIA] I hear you.
I'll be there in second, Lu.

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.075
Thanks for coming all
this way to see me.

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.328
So who are these two guys?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.579
Y--! Genia!

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.872
Manners, I beg you!

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.375
You do realize you're speaking
to His Majesty King Souma

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.793
and Princess Liscia?

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:38.004
Please, forgive her, she
doesn't receive many guests!

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.714
What do you know, it is him.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.174
As soon as I looked
a bit closer,

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.969
I recognized your face from
the Gemstone Broadcasts.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:48.098
It's an honor to make your
acquaintance, Your Majesty.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.850
I am Genia Maxwell.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.977
Please welcome to
my humble abode.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.479
I'm Souma Kazuya, the
provisional king of Elfrieden.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.273
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.358
Allow me to introduce
my fiancÃ©e.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.735
Liscia Elfrieden, a pleasure.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.654
[GENIA] I am well aware
of your engagement!

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.240
And I humbly offer you two
all the health and happiness

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:06.992
in the world!

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:10.495
That's very kind, but there's
no need to be so formal.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.248
We're the ones who are
dropping in on you, after all.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.333
Please, just speak
casually to us.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.626
Whew, thank you!

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.920
That's a deal, Mister King,
whatever you say.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.547
Hey! Not that informal!

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:21.464
It's fine.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.966
But sire, she--

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.886
Whatever she's done, I'm
sure we can address later.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.596
But for the time being,
I'm more interested

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.014
in learning about Genia.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.727
[GENIA] No point standing
outside all day.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.646
Come on in and I'll make
us some coffee. Eh?

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.617
Let's start from the beginning.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.077
Like I said, name's
Genia Maxwell.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.413
Proud owner of this dungeon
as well as a researcher,

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.415
scientist, and inventor.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.000
Actually, now that
I think about it,

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.336
I'm a mage in the
Forbidden Army, too.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.963
I was assigned to the weapons
development division,

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.674
but I did some things
that got me dismissed.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.092
What did you do?

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:08.845
She created something
quite scandalous.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.431
You know how war tears
up the countryside, right?

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.224
I invented these arrowheads
that were loaded

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.560
with seeds for
fast-growing plants.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.312
The idea was, wherever
there was a war,

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:20.065
there would be lots of greenery
on the battlefield leftover.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.233
[SOUMA]
T-Tree-planting during wartime?

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.319
The idea is a kind of
farfetched, isn't it?

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.946
[GENIA]
Mmm...

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:28.073
Listen, I'm not gonna
toot my own horn.

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.243
But I think it's a
brilliant concept.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.287
Then again, maybe I shouldn't
have enchanted them

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.705
with light magic.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.666
Though it did help accelerate
the plants' growth,

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:41.378
I may have stepped over the
line a little bit with that one.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.837
Now I remember!

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.507
You're that mad scientist
of the Forbidden Army!

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:48.718
That event was your
doing, wasn't it?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.428
I'm not sure I want to ask,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.722
but what event are
we talking about?

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.599
Well, you see, before
you were brought here

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.185
by the summoning ritual,
this one training ground

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:58.728
and the laboratory
attached to it were once

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.439
swallowed up by a
vast ocean of trees.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.413
[GENIA] Oh, yeah, sure, but it's
not like I ever expected them

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:17.914
to grow all at once.

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.126
[LUDWIN] Let's not dredge
up the past, Genia.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.669
Can't say I was fond
of the atmosphere

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.754
in the development
division, though.

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.548
It's weird to have all
those brilliant minds

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.259
and force them to work
on single projects.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.554
Don't you think a rigid
structure only stifles ideas?

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.265
Personally, I believe the most
superior inventions are born

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.435
when the freedom to create
is present in the laboratory.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.979
You sure have your hands
full with her, Ludwin.

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.605
What? No! I, uh...

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.442
[GENIA] By the way,
Mister King, are you aware

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.986
of what kind of lineage
the Maxwells have?

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.321
Their house is known for their
research of various artifacts

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:53.366
that adventurers have brought
back from exploring dungeons.

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.659
Indeed.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.327
My family has been
conducting research for

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.121
several generations.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:01.082
And after all those years of
research, patterns emerged.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:03.084
Until it reached a point
where we caught sight of

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.919
a vague something.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.671
And what is that?

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.548
You could call it natural law.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.925
Entirely separate from magic.

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.136
A separate natural law?

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.596
[GENIA]
Let me ask you something.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.890
You use Gemstones a
lot, right, Mister King?

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.725
But do you really
understand them?

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.810
What sort of things they are?

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:21.811
I do.

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:24.189
From what I've been told,
they are ancient artifacts

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.149
discovered deep within dungeons,

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.693
and they work by
utilizing two magics:

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.361
the first being the
Sylph wind spirits

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.156
and the other is the
Undine water spirits.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.365
According to all I've learned,

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.868
that's how they're able to
deliver picture and sound.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.620
[GENIA]
Well, I hate to contradict you,

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.997
but there's a couple things
wrong with your perception.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.624
Curious to hear what.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.751
And I'd be more than
happy to explain!

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.920
First is in regards to the
part about how the magic

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.172
of Sylph and Undine
spirits are intertwined

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:52.383
with the stones when there
has been no evidence.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.428
I mean, they are spirits,
aren't they?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.931
Well. I've never
seen one, myself.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.474
These Spirits are
the stuff of legend,

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:00.975
from our mythology.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.352
And I won't argue with that,

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:05.480
but mythology isn't enough
to prove they actually exist.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.440
Because the mysterious
power called magic

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.818
exists in our world,
the truth ends up being harder

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.236
for people to accept.

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.157
When we find
something unexplainable,

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.201
it's easier to categorize
the discovery as the power

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.829
of either magic or spirits.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.997
And as a result, many
phenomena are brushed off

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.916
as mythical forces at work.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.085
But the truth is far different.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.920
While we were busy
studying the Gemstones

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.506
that were found in the dungeons,
we accidentally discovered

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:34.008
that if you use water
and wind magic on them,

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.302
they would take in the
surrounding scenery.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.638
Allowing the image to
be projected by using

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.265
the accompanying receivers,

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.059
which were also discovered
alongside the Gemstones.

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:47.230
The whole business about
Sylph's and Undine's magics

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.606
being responsible--

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.900
that was just an explanation
someone came up with

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.986
later on about how
the spirits' blessings

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.362
made it possible.

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.781
[SOUMA] So you're saying there
aren't any spirits involved

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:57.866
in the process?

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.702
It'd be foolhardy of me
to say with any certainty.

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.121
Until it's ruled out,
it's always possible.

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.668
Moving on to your
second mistake:

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:12.589
The belief their true
purpose is to transfer

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.756
picture and sound.

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.508
That assumption is wrong.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.136
[SOUMA] But isn't that
what they're meant for?

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.721
[GENIA]
Mm-mm.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:21.848
As I've said time and again,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.474
when it comes to the
transmitting functions

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.559
of the Gemstones,

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.061
those were found by
accident during research.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.147
In other words, you're using
them to broadcast,

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.523
but in the grand
scheme of things,

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:32.734
that's only one
of their functions.

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.486
[SOUMA] Huh? So then, are you
saying the Gemstones have

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.405
some sort of other intended use?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.783
If that wasn't their
original purpose,

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.619
what exactly are they?

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.206
Based on my findings, they're
known as "dungeon cores."

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.457
[SOUMA]
Dungeon cores?

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.251
[GENIA]
Dungeon cores.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.838
In terms of
supporting a dungeon,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.049
they are said to be the
most important element.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:12:00.553
As long as they're present,
ferocious monsters

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:03.431
will continue to appear.

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:06.267
But if you destroy them, or
otherwise shut them down,

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.061
the monsters stop appearing,
and the dungeon

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:09.562
becomes abandoned.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.191
It's up to the adventurers
to go out and explore

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.401
these various chambers,
but ultimately,

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.946
they have one objective:
to seek out and shut down

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.072
the core.

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:22.242
If they manage
to bring one back,

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.285
they are able to earn a
huge amount of wealth

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:27.121
and honor from
the entire nation.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:30.625
In short, the objects we refer
to collectively as Gemstones

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.753
are actually in fact
destroyed dungeon cores.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.296
And unfortunately, as of now,

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.757
we can only study them
in their broken state.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.844
Despite our best efforts,

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.013
as of yet, nobody has
brought back a working

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:47.684
dungeon core to the surface for
us to thoroughly examine.

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.979
Don't we want to avoid more
monsters wandering around?

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.689
[GENIA]
Okay, fair point, but still,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.900
wouldn't you like to study one
that's in working order?

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.361
And find out what
secrets they hold?

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.738
[SOUMA] Aren't you able
to restart a dead one?

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.491
Believe me, I've tried but
haven't succeeded.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:04.909
The problem is
we don't even know how

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:07.996
they typically function.

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:09.914
The unknown can be frightening.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:15.420
[SOUMA] Which is why people
use magic to explain it away.

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.380
What exactly do you mean?

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.923
It's just human nature.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.009
We are surprisingly reasonable.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.719
But if we don't recognize
something that can't be

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.347
explained using a preexisting
system, then we fear it.

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.433
We force explanations
on new phenomena

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:29.892
in order to understand it.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.270
I knew you'd get
what I was driving at!

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.148
I can tell you and I are
gonna get along, Mister King.

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:37.900
Fun fact, so back in the
world where I originally

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.819
came from, we have what's called

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:41.654
the pursuit of "science,"
which is completely

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.197
different from magic.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.324
Oh, yeah?

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:45.783
When you have a moment,
I would sure like

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.077
to hear all about it.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.038
Similarly, the members
of House Maxwell

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:53.499
have a name for this kind
of study in natural law:

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:56.627
For convenience's sake,
we call it "over-science."

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.504
[SOUMA]
I'm not familiar with the term.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.006
Well, you should
know I practice it,

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:02.633
which makes me
an over-scientist.

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.011
On that note, it'll be
better if I show you

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.138
my latest creation in person.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.890
Surely an earnest supporter
of mine would love

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.308
to have a peek.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.657
I proudly present
my latest invention!

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.621
I have named it the
Little Susumu Mark Five!

00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:33.331
The name's kinda lame.

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.083
You know how the navy
relies on wind power

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.628
or dragons to propel large-scale
ships across the water?

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.463
Well the Little Susumu
Mark Five alone

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.298
can move a vessel
without having to depend on

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.467
any other source!

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.303
Oh. So it's some sort
of propulsion device?

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:48.388
[GENIA]
Exactly!

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:50.598
Allow me to explain further:

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.475
The loop atop the structure
sucks up whatever's

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.644
in front of it and
then expels it out

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.687
into the space behind!

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.981
[SOUMA] Huh. I can see how
it's applicable in terms of

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:00.191
the water.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.985
What would happen if we turned
it on in the laboratory?

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:04.570
Such a curious mind, King!

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.906
Despite location change,
the principle's the same.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.409
The ring sucks in air
and expels it.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.827
Care for a demonstration?

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.122
What? No! Wait a minute, Genia!

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.858
Majesty! Princess Liscia!

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:42.984
Are you all right?

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.027
--More or less.
--We're still alive.

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.404
[LUDWIN sighs]

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:49.449
[GENIA laughs]
Packs a wallop!

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.326
I had it pointing backwards.
[laughs]

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.286
Genia!

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:55.246
What if I wasn't here to stop it
and something happened

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.581
to His Majesty?

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.542
Now, now, no one was
hurt, and I saw it in action.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:00.960
I've got to hand it
to you, Genia,

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:02.378
it's an amazing invention!

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.504
Isn't it?

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.756
I'm sure you're dying to
know how it works, huh?

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:08.009
Basically, the loop part is
made from a special metal

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.927
that has a modified
spell engraved in it

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.762
which channels the energy.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.264
And so, by feeding it energy,

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.850
you get the Little
Susumu Mark Five.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.561
The first of its kind:
a machine which takes in

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.021
and expels magic.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:24.108
Just one of these can do the
work of a giant sea dragon!

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.860
What is your power source?

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.862
It would have to
be magic, right?

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.655
It has one of these installed.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.533
[SOUMA]
Huh?

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.744
That looks like a curse ore.

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:35.995
You know what they are?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.834
[LISCIA] Come to think of it, we
also use magic to mine ores.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.044
One problem.

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:45.588
Whenever there's a curse
ore somewhere nearby,

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.174
our magic stops working
for some reason.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.009
And if you try to
force it to work...

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.094
Ka-boom!

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.764
It explodes? Sounds dangerous.

00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:57.099
It's frustrating for miners,
since if you happen

00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:59.185
to run into one of these
ores while digging,

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.938
you can't really
proceed any further.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:04.398
Now you see why we
refer to it as cursed.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.901
It's a piece of stone
that's divinely jinxed.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.403
And unfortunately for us,
there's a large vein

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:11.948
running straight
underneath the kingdom.

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:15.535
No offense, Princess, but you
sound incredibly ridiculous.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.453
On the contrary,
one might say the fact

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.914
that there's so much of it
buried beneath the kingdom

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:22.667
shows that our country
is divinely blessed.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.168
The curse ore isn't jinxed.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.629
and doesn't prevent
the use of magic.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.172
Think about it for a minute.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.883
The material doesn't render
those powers unusable.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:34.095
In fact, using them near
one makes it explode.

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.138
So then, where does the
energy for that ka-boom

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.348
come from?

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.141
If I'm understanding right,
you mean to tell me

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:41.435
the curse ore can absorb magic?

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:43.479
Impressive, Mister King!

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:44.689
You're correct.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.233
Rather than repelling it,
the ore actually takes in

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.359
the energy.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.736
Then, after it exceeds
its tolerance level,

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:53.489
the stored energy is
suddenly released!

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.741
Quite dramatically, I might add.

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:57.868
In fact, after careful
experimentation,

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.705
I've managed to succeed in
retrieving the magic energy

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:04.333
that had been absorbed
into the curse ore.

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:08.379
Also, I'm using it as the power
source for this device.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:09.755
[SOUMA]
Sorry. You're what?

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:11.674
[GENIA squeaks]

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.635
[SOUMA] I don't think Genia
realizes how serious this is.

00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:18.514
If it's true, this thing is like
a rechargeable battery.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.850
Genia somehow managed
to develop the technology

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.184
to store energy.

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:26.147
Here in a reality where the
steam engine was never invented.

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.190
With this kind of
technology, the kingdom

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:30.067
could take a giant leap forward.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.325
However, once words gets
out that the power source

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:40.453
is a cursed stone,
it's bound to create religious

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.204
friction all across the world,

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:45.625
Moreover, according to Liscia,

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.127
there's a major vein of the
material spread throughout

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.545
the kingdom.

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:52.131
If we don't play this right,
a war with other nations

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.924
could start over our resources.

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:57.678
This technology
is revolutionary.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.430
On one hand, it has
the potential to make us

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:02.475
the greatest superpower
on the continent of Landia.

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:04.435
While on the other hand,
it's potentially dangerous

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.729
enough to destroy our country.

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.482
[LISCIA]
Souma, what's the matter?

00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.150
Oh, nothing much.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.402
Thinking of the high risk,
high reward of this situation

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:15.196
has got my brain
working overtime.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.786
[SOUMA] I didn't expect this,
but it turns out she's

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.372
as critical to us as Tomoe.

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:26.832
I'll explain it to you
in detail later.

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:29.043
But for right now,
what can we do to anchor

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:31.295
Genia here in Elfrieden?

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:33.089
Since she's of the
House of Maxwell,

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.675
I think that could be enough,

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:38.052
but if you want something
more concrete,

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.179
she could marry a person
you trust and raise

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.764
a family in the kingdom.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.891
Yeah, that could work.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.434
Judging by what
you've seen so far,

00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:47.895
do you think she has
feelings for Ludwin?

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:50.606
[LISCIA] Hmm... My fellow-female
intuition is telling me

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.525
there's about a 60% chance.

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:54.568
[SOUMA] Women confuse
me 100% of the time.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.612
And? What is your opinion
of Ludwin's feelings

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.531
towards her, Souma?

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:01.784
Oh, I'm 99% sure
he really likes her.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:04.120
We men aren't exactly
difficult to read.

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:05.371
Uh-huh.

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:08.499
[SOUMA]
Ahem.

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:12.545
If I may ask, do you have
feelings for Genia here?

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:14.422
Don't you think that's a rather
sudden and personal question,

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:15.673
Your Majesty?

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.508
[SOUMA] To be straightforward,
I want her to marry someone

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.968
I can trust.

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.845
Considering how she is
a key figure for our kingdom

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:21.762
and all.

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:25.349
Mmm... If I'm following
along, you want me

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:27.226
to be Lu's wife?

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:30.396
Well, Genia, would you
have any objections there?

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.648
Know what? I'd be fine with it.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:33.899
[LUDWIN gasps]

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.568
Despite my dedication
to research,

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.403
I suspected I would settle
down with a strong

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:38.696
warrior type.

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.990
I also calculated how you
would be a pretty good match

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.825
for that criteria, Lu.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.828
Huh? Going against His Majesty's
wishes is the last thing

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.371
I want, but if I were
to marry her,

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:50.249
that would surely mean the
end of the Maxwell family line!

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.042
If that's a real issue,
she can always go by

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.252
"Maxwell-Arcs."

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.170
[LUDWIN]
Huh?!

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:56.297
Also, you have my word--
the royal family

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:58.758
will pay for all
wedding expenses.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:00.634
Are there any other
issues to address?

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.178
But sire, I'm not sure.

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:04.555
Well, Ludwin?
The king asked you a question.

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.182
Oh, yes, of course!

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.187
Genia. Would you care
to be my wife?

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.564
Are you positive
you want me, Lu?

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:17.067
After all, I'm not exactly
noblewoman material.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.402
Yes, I'm aware.

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:21.739
But even so, I still
want you by my side.

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.783
You've odd taste, no offense.

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.951
But, uh... Yeah, I agree.

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:27.703
I look forward to
being with you.

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:33.209
I trust all parties are happy
with this arrangement?

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.753
[LUDWIN]
No. Not yet, Your Majesty.

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:37.963
I was so overwhelmed,
I forgot to mention the reason

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:39.757
why we even came down here.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.051
You see, she's the one who
committed the scandalous act

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.761
I mentioned.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.180
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:49.266
I got so caught up in her
invention, I forgot, too.

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:50.226
Right.

00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:52.561
[GENIA grunts]

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:54.146
Go easy, Lu!

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:56.315
Remember, I am a key
figure to the kingdom

00:21:56.357 --> 00:21:58.943
and these brains
are precious goods!

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:01.028
[LUDWIN] You idiot!
Look, you and I are going to

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.947
apologize to
His Majesty together!

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.659
On both our behalves,

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.868
I am sorry.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.079
There is no excuse
for her actions.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.665
[GENIA] Your grip's
a little too tight, Lu!

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:16.377
Sure. So, what is
it she did, exactly?

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:18.712
Don't be too harsh,
but the thing is,

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.422
she went and stole dragon bones.

00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:23.217
Kinda, yeah.
