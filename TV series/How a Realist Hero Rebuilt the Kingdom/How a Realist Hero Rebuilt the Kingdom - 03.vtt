WEBVTT

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.094
[SOUMA] The fact that I can
understand the language spoken

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:12.930
in this country, and similarly,

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.806
that people here understand
my native language

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.433
is not a coincidence.

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:20.437
Apparently, this is some strange
power imparted on heroes.

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:22.689
Not only that, I can read
and write the language

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.609
of both worlds.
Don't ask me how.

00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.402
It's like it automatically
gets translated

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.280
inside of my head,
and then I write it out.

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.574
On that note, it seems no matter
where you're from in this world,

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:35.619
the entire population
uses a single language.

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:37.621
Which is hard to believe,
given the diversity

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:40.707
of cultures that call
this world home.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.377
Out of everyone here, it looks
like I'm the only person

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.921
who has this
auto‐translate ability.

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:48.215
So it may be
exclusive to heroes.

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:49.299
For instance,

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.927
I can play recordings
saved on my phone.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.012
But when I do,
the only thing the people

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.848
of this world hear is an
incomprehensible language.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.977
It's all so strange.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:38.408
[SOUMA] Someday, Liscia, you'll
be the ruler of Elfrieden.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.537
What I want, most of all,

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.166
is to leave you with every tool
you'll need to succeed.

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:48.001
So after I've gone back home,

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.712
you'll be able to manage
all facets of this country.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.889
[SOUMA] But, after it's
on the right track,

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:02.724
I'll let this country
handle the rest.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.185
Of course, you can
cancel our engagement.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:07.354
[LISCIA] I know that's
what Souma promised,

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:08.939
but did he really mean it?

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:14.319
He wants to find more useful
personnel to advise him,

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.571
but most importantly,
what this country needs

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.658
right now is Souma's leadership.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.284
The place you're
originally from,

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:24.204
do you have family there
waiting for you to return?

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:26.248
Or, you know, friends,
girlfriends.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.166
Anything like that.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.876
[SOUMA]
There's no one.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.503
[LISCIA] He doesn't have
connections to the world

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:34.840
he's originally from,
so what if I become

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.591
a part of his family?

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.386
I wonder if that would
anchor him here.

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:40.262
Wait.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.931
If I create a fait accompli,
as his fiancÃ©e, then...

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:44.015
[knocking]

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.100
[LISCIA gasps]

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.269
[SERINA]
Princess, it's time to get up.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.354
[LISCIA]
Uh... I'm already awake.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.863
Princess? Is there
something wrong?

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.698
You're looking slightly flushed.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.116
Uh, nothing is the matter!

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.411
I was just thinking about...

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.623
[SERINA chuckles]

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.419
[SERINA]
Today is the day.

00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.755
His Majesty is going to
honor the five subjects

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.631
who proved to be
especially outstanding

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.258
among the recruited talent.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.801
[LISCIA]
Yes, I remember.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.053
The king wishes for you
to attend as well,

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.722
so please hurry and get ready.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.809
[LISCIA] I understand
numerous people responded

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.186
to his invitation.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.271
[SERINA]
Yes, so many.

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:32.856
The screeners were complaining,

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:36.026
grumbling how there was no
way they would ever finish.

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.487
I'll bet if Souma heard
that, he would say,

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.156
"if you have time to complain,
get back to work."

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.411
[HAKUYA]
What is with that expression?

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.749
Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts.

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.167
Uh... No.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.002
I've made it this far
thanks to my talent,

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.755
but am I nervous about
standing before the king

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.007
and having to prove it
can be of some use?

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.926
Yes.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.386
After all, my skill is
rather, well, you know.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.579
[LUDWIN] You are in the
presence of the king,

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.956
and you will bow your head.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.918
[AISHA]
This is not my people's custom.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.253
I ask your forbearance.

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:40.006
Respect must be deserved.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.801
Warriors from our tribe bow
to no one but our master.

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:45.220
What did you say?
Who if not the king is your‐‐

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.305
[SOUMA]
It's all right.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.932
I'm the one who asked
them for assistance

00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:50.392
to help the kingdom.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.477
We can allow some leeway.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.521
As Your Majesty requests.

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.815
The rest of you,
please stop bowing.

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.859
If anyone here ought to
be showing some gratitude,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.569
it's certainly me.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.695
Feel free to stand.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.536
[MARX]
By order of His Majesty,

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:11.955
the gifted and exemplary
citizens of the nation

00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:13.707
have gathered at the capital.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.585
Those present today have
shown they have rare abilities

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:19.629
that set them apart from their
peers across the land.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.633
We will now announce the
talents these people possess

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.219
and present them with
their promised awards.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:30.140
Aisha Udgard, dark elf from
the God‐Protected Forest,

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.600
if you would step forward.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.941
[SOUMA]
Time for a little research.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.487
"Dark elves.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.407
A minority race within
the Elfrieden Kingdom.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.119
Their people are known for their
elevated combat skills.

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.330
They live in the
God‐Protected Forest,

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.415
which is said to be
divinely guarded,

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.167
and are allowed autonomy
over these woods

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.210
as its caretakers.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.296
They have limited interaction
with other races

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.131
and are extremely territorial."

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:07.260
It's helpful being able to
read remotely like this.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:10.138
This "Living Poltergeists" thing
sure does come in handy.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.222
Pun intended.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.142
[MARX] Your Majesty, she
excels in the art of combat.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.061
It is fair to say that
her fighting abilities

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.938
are unmatched by anyone
in the kingdom,

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.773
and we commend her for that.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.359
The foremost military
prowess in the kingdom.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.777
I have high hopes for you.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.823
To be clear: you
wish to honor those

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.742
who can prove they are
an asset to the future

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.118
of this kingdom?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.913
That was my promise, and I
intend on keeping my word.

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:37.040
[AISHA] In that case,
I do not want the reward.

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.959
I ask you to hear
my request instead.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.798
Go ahead. Please tell me.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.258
My people are troubled,
for in the God‐Protected Forest,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.094
the mature trees are
weakening while the saplings

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.470
are failing to grow.

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.721
Please, sire!

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.640
I ask you to lend
my tribe your wisdom!

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.685
I'm not sure what to say.
Let's see.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:02.565
Just making sure, you are
thinning the forest properly?

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.404
Thinning? What exactly
do you mean by that?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.992
You should periodically cut down
a moderate number of trees

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.911
in order to maintain the
woodland and promote new growth.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.079
Everyone knows that.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.374
[SOUMA]
Then again, maybe they don't.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.712
If you allow the mature
trees to grow rampantly,

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.588
their foliage blocks
out sunlight,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.716
preventing younger
ones from flourishing.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.843
If the forest isn't managed
and is left alone,

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.928
all you're left with are
old trees that are thin

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.139
and weak like bean sprouts.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.807
Once that's allowed to happen,

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.560
the woods become vulnerable
to snow and wind.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.520
And without sunlight,
the undergrowth

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.980
begins to wither.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.773
The soil can't retain water,

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.692
making it susceptible
to landslides.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.488
[AISHA]
Your Majesty!

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.781
Yes? What'd I say?

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.158
[AISHA]
I humbly beg your forgiveness

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.618
for my rude behavior earlier!

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.745
[SOUMA]
Huh?

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.580
If you command me
to fight, then I will fight!

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.373
Command me to die, then I shall!

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:03.501
Order me to become your
concubine, consider it done!

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.295
Please, as soon as possible,

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:07.088
come to the
God‐Protected Forest.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.798
Once you're there,
teach my people about

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.216
the art of "thinning"!

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:13.928
Sure. You got it.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:32.113
[EXCEL] By the sounds of it,
things are getting interesting

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.656
over there.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.950
[MARX]
Juna Doma, you shall be next.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.869
Step forward.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:38.953
Yes, sir.

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:55.678
[LISCIA]
Ahem.

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.516
What? I haven't forgotten my
job, so stop giving me

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:00.934
that look.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.065
My king, this woman possesses
unparalleled beauty.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.150
In addition to this,
she has an incomparable

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.360
singing voice.

00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:12.487
She may rightly be called
the greatest songstress

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.613
of our time.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.658
[SOUMA] A beautiful
appearance and voice.

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:18.993
God does have
favorites after all.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.704
I don't deserve such praise,
your highness.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.790
[MARX] From the information
I've been provided,

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.376
the Doma family's
ancestors were loreleis.

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.419
So a talent for singing
most likely runs

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.255
through her blood.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.756
[SOUMA]
Loreleis?

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.342
Legend says they were
creatures from the deep

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:35.802
who beguiled sailors
with their beauty

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.345
and enchanting voices.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.305
The singing voice of a lorelei?

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.850
I would very much like
to hear a song.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.726
If that is what you wish.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.103
I know.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.188
All of Elfrieden is watching.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.773
Since the ceremony
is being transmitted

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.151
far and wide via the Gemstone,

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.610
could you sing us
something that will help

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.696
to energize the nation's people?

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.364
As in something lively?

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:57.907
Let's see.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.325
Several songs have
been passed down

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:03.705
in my family, but most of them
are melancholy in nature.

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.499
Honestly, I can't think of
any energizing songs.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:07.625
But if I were to hear one,

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.460
I'm sure I could
sing it right away.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.921
Huh. If you were
to hear one, huh?

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:14.841
Well, in that case...

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:31.024
[JUNA] My king, what manner of
device do you have there?

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.943
I guess you can think of it
as a pocket‐sized musician.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:35.278
Right. Are you ready?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.529
[JUNA]
Uh... Ready.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.629
[JUNA laughs]

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.632
The song I played you is
one from my homeland.

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:57.300
[JUNA] Does that mean
the language I just heard

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.969
is from a completely
different world?

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:00.887
Yeah.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.723
Since it's foreign to you,
it'll probably be hard to sing.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.558
No. I'll be fine.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.810
I remember the song
phonetically after hearing it,

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.063
so I should have
no trouble at all.

00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:12.899
You memorized the whole thing
after hearing it only one time?

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:13.942
Amazing.

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:16.194
Most kind of you.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:20.823
Very well. I will
sing for this land.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.713
[singing]

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.343
[cheering]

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.600
Thank you very
much for giving me

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.020
the chance to perform
for the whole kingdom!

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.105
I should be the
one thanking you.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.982
You have a wonderful
singing voice.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.358
[JUNA] I would love to
learn more songs from

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.485
Your Majesty's homeland,
if possible.

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:55.168
I see you are as intent
as ever on gathering

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:57.086
intelligence from all quarters.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.756
[ROROA] Valuable intelligence
is worth more than gold.

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:02.925
Information is the lifeline
of any good merchant.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.553
And has there been
any news of interest?

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.388
Apparently the king
of Elfrieden is doing

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.766
an overhaul of his advisors
and recruiting talent

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:11.267
across the country.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.895
Seems he didn't think those
musty dynastic retainers

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.189
could fulfill his new agenda.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.358
Certainly looks that way.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.401
Still, it's not like his
is the only nation

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.612
in desperate need of
some fresh blood.

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:23.654
[SEBASTIAN]
Hmm...

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:28.159
In the end, that entirely
depends on whether

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.495
the person hiring can
recognize a candidates'

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.372
true value.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.457
[HAKUYA] He displayed
ingenuity and generosity

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.876
in agreeing to the
dark elf's request.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.295
As for the Lorelei‐descended
songstress...

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.630
I look forward to
seeing how he will use

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.632
her skills to better
the kingdom.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.385
Overall, not a bad start.

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:49.305
However, the most challenging
trial is about to begin.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:51.349
[MARX] We shall continue
with Poncho Panacotta

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.559
from Potte Village.
Step forward.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.813
Right. That would be me,
your sirness. I...

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.483
[SOUMA]
Uh...

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.487
Oh. Uh, pardon my clumsiness!

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:11.077
This man's talent for eating
can be called legendary.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.413
While there were several
applicants who answered the call

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.581
claiming to have a true
gift for gluttony,

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:18.584
none could match this
man's insatiable appetite.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.754
Furthermore, his search for
food has been no ordinary one.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:24.006
He has traveled the world,
eating specialties

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.675
and rarities along the way.

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:27.844
According to him,
he has consumed just about

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:29.762
everything there is to eat.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.472
What? That's terrific news!

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.185
[SOUMA] Thank you so much
for answering my call!

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:38.604
I've been waiting for a person
with your expertise!

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.278
More than any of the other
talented people here.

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.029
I'm delighted that you
stepped forward!

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.576
Your Majesty...

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.661
...is delighted I'm here?

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:57.039
You know, everyone,
they called me fatso

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.333
and said I was a fool to
throw my money away

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.294
for the sake of eating.

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:02.503
They're wrong!

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:05.173
Your well‐honed gluttony
will save this kingdom!

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.550
So hold your head
proud and high.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:10.386
Are‐‐Are you sure about
that, my kingness?

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.304
[SOUMA]
Yes.

00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:13.306
Your insight from sampling
the specialties and rarities

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:17.477
from all over will be the key
to solving multiple hardships.

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:21.522
I need your help, Poncho!
Let me use your vast knowledge!

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.024
[PONCHO]
Yes, sire!

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:25.610
If I can be of any assistance
to you, by all means,

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.820
use my experience. Please!

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:33.326
Hey, Marx, if there's a
distinguished subject,

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.994
this country has a
tradition where the king

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:37.663
can grant them a specific
title, right?

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:40.249
Indeed. You are most
correct, my king.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:41.792
In that case, Poncho,

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:44.962
I will dub you with
the name "Ishizuka."

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:46.506
Back where I'm from,
it belongs to

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:49.967
an insatiable hunter
and master of cuisine.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:53.012
I trust you'll work hard
not to tarnish the name.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.181
[NARRATOR] When the sight of
King Souma receiving Poncho

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.601
was seen throughout the nation,
it encouraged the reluctant.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.436
There were still those
of exceptional talent

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:01.979
who had not stepped forward,

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.898
but after witnessing how
all manner of skills

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.691
were praised by the king,

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.777
they gathered themselves
to Elfrieden.

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.532
[MARX] Your Majesty, the
preceding three nominated

00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:15.952
themselves, but the next man was
recommended by someone else.

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.328
Huh?

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.540
[MARX] And now, Hakuya
Kwonmin, step forward.

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:21.541
Sir.

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:26.379
[MARX] This man has exhibited
a talent for intellect.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.506
It is believed that his
knowledge and memory

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.675
are unrivaled throughout
the kingdom.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.428
Who was it that suggested
your skills could help out

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.680
in some way?

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.598
It was the uncle
I live with, sire.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.809
He said I was old enough
to stop reading books

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.769
and should serve my country
in a meaningful way,

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.896
so he put my name forth.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.189
[SOUMA chuckles]

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.315
That's funny?

00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:48.693
[SOUMA] No. I was just
remembering how I used to

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.696
get that a lot myself,
believe it or not.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:55.032
So, then, what genre of books
do you tend to read?

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.076
[HAKUYA]
I do not prefer any one genre.

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:59.620
I read literature, of course,
as well as history,

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.372
law, and military tactics.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:02.873
Assimilating knowledge
unknown to me

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.875
is my reason for living.

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.086
Interesting.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.380
In that case, how would
you like to be a librarian

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.798
in the castle library?

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.258
You would have free
access to books

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.218
authorized to only catalogers.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.429
[HAKUYA]
Oh, that is most generous.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.931
And I graciously accept.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:19.890
Yes.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.977
I suppose that is what I would
have said just a moment ago.

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:24.770
But not anymore, I take it?

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.981
No. I have changed
my mind since.

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.566
Fine. Then what
would you prefer?

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:33.696
[HAKUYA] If you'll permit it:
Using my knowledge,

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.449
I would like to underpin
Your Majesty's hegemony.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.701
[SOUMA] Pretty bold to use
the word "hegemony."

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.786
And I wonder what he
means by "underpin."

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:42.830
Does he want to be
my military strategist?

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:48.002
And you believe you're
gifted enough to do that?

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:49.503
[HAKUYA]
I would like to think I am.

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:55.676
You said that you changed
your mind. Explain.

00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:58.179
Begging your pardon,
but since the ceremony began,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.722
I've been sizing
Your Majesty up,

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.183
judging whether you were
a ruler worth serving.

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:03.309
Seems I passed.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.935
What criteria were you
using to determine

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.228
if I was worthy?

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.900
It was dependent on whether
you appointed Poncho.

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.486
That was my litmus test.

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:16.072
Even if you had not immediately
recognized his value,

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:18.324
but had appointed him
for some future use,

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.910
you still would have
passed as a king.

00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:22.787
If you had judged Poncho's
talent as worthless

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.873
and rejected him,
you would have failed.

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:28.459
That was my line of reasoning.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.379
I never expected you
to welcome him as you did.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.048
I'm pleased that I
was wrong about you.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.091
There's no doubt‐‐

00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:36.759
your talent is sensing
what this country

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:39.387
desperately needs and
seeking it out at all costs.

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:43.933
I will echo those sentiments.

00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:45.851
I also believe I know
what this country needs

00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.978
during these trying times.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.647
But tell me, are you
the sort of advisor

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.649
who can help me
get the job done?

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.359
I believe His Majesty
must be the one

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.027
to judge that for himself.

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.076
[PONCHO whimpering]

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.828
[SOUMA]
All right then.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.663
Come to my chambers afterward.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.832
We'll converse, then I'll
determine how much talent

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.792
you have and how best to use it.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.461
As you command, grace.

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.965
[NARRATOR] And so concluded
the first meeting between

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:18.217
King Souma and Hakuya Kwonmin,

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.719
the man who would
later be known as

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.512
the "Prime Minister in Black."

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:24.140
That evening, after talking
late into the night,

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.768
King Souma acknowledged Hakuya
was a man of rare ingenuity,

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.146
and installed him as
his right‐hand man.

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:34.650
[MARX]
And lastly, we have Tomoe Inui,

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:35.943
of the mystic wolves.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.361
Would you step forward?

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:39.822
Uh... Right!

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.035
She's quite unique.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.246
This girl has the
unusual talent of being able

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.832
to commune with
both birds and beasts.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:50.833
Oh?

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:51.959
To verify this ability,

00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:54.336
we had her taken out
to the royal stables.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.088
There she revealed both
the health statuses

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.132
of the horses and
their histories.

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:00.384
According to her, she
ascertained the answers

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.720
from the animals directly,
making her gift

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:04.638
truly heaven‐sent.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.724
[SOUMA]
The land of the mystic wolves.

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.560
That's way to the north
of Elfrieden. Wow.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:10.394
Yes.

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:12.104
As far as I am aware,
there are no other

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:14.648
mystic wolves residing
in the kingdom.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:15.983
Which would mean that
there's a good chance

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:18.152
she's a refugee.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.195
[LISCIA]
Mm...

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:22.782
It doesn't make
any difference to me.

00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:25.743
She has an aptitude, and
I'll make good use of it.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.537
But the question is, how do I
make the most of her talent?

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:31.582
[TOMOE]
Uh, my king?

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.709
E‐Excuse me.

00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:34.835
What's wrong?

00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:38.464
Nothing! I‐‐ Um, actually...

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:41.467
...there is something
I need to tell you.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.636
Sounds like it's very important.

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:45.679
Please. Go ahead
and say your piece.

00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:49.016
[TOMOE]
Right! Um, as it happens...

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:51.143
Sorry. You'll need to
speak up a little,

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:53.270
or I won't be able to hear.

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.773
I, um... Well, you see...

00:22:00.903 --> 00:22:03.364
[SOUMA] No problem.
I'll come down there to you.

00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:13.749
See? Now you don't have
to raise your voice so much.

00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:15.292
There's no reason to be shy.

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:19.046
Y‐ Yes. The truth is...
